It has been used\nto learn dynamics, solve inverse problems and facilitate design, and is at its\ninception of impact. Current successes have concentrated on general physics\nmodels such as rigid bodies, deformable sheets, etc., assuming relatively\nsimple structures and forces. Their granularity is intrinsically coarse and\ntherefore incapable of modelling complex physical phenomena. Fine-grained\nmodels are still to be developed to incorporate sophisticated material\nstructures and force interactions with gradient-based learning. Following this\nmotivation, we propose a new differentiable fabrics model for composite\nmaterials such as cloths, where we dive into the granularity of yarns and model\nindividual yarn physics and yarn-to-yarn interactions. To this end, we propose\nseveral differentiable forces, whose counterparts in empirical physics are\nindifferentiable, to facilitate gradient-based learning. These forces, albeit\napplied to cloths, are ubiquitous in various physical systems.

The water molecule is only\npartially dissociated. Its oxygen atom binds to CO giving adsorbed COOH and\nPt-H. This concerted addition is rate-limiting.

However much of the work in general\npurpose DG is heuristically motivated, as the DG problem is hard to model\nformally; and recent evaluations have cast doubt on existing methods' practical\nefficacy -- in particular compared to a well tuned empirical risk minimisation\nbaseline. We present a novel learning-theoretic generalisation bound for DG\nthat bounds unseen domain generalisation performance in terms of the model's\nRademacher complexity. Based on this, we conjecture that existing methods'\nefficacy or lack thereof is largely determined by an empirical risk vs\npredictor complexity trade-off, and demonstrate that their performance\nvariability can be explained in these terms.

For this hyperparameter optimization, nested cross-validation must be\napplied to avoid a biased performance estimation. The resulting repeated\ntraining with high-dimensional data leads to very long computation times.\nMoreover, it is likely to observe a high variance in the individual performance\nevaluation metrics caused by outliers in tiny validation sets. Therefore, early\nstopping applying standard pruning algorithms to save time risks discarding\npromising hyperparameter sets.\n  Result: To speed up feature selection for high-dimensional data with tiny\nsample size, we adapt the use of a state-of-the-art asynchronous successive\nhalving pruner. In addition, we combine it with two complementary pruning\nstrategies based on domain or prior knowledge. One pruning strategy immediately\nstops computing trials with semantically meaningless results for the selected\nhyperparameter combinations.

In\nthe last years, a growing attention has been devoted to relaxing the assumption\nthat the sender perfectly knows receiver's payoffs. The first crucial step\ntowards such an achievement is to study settings where each receiver's payoffs\ndepend on their unknown type, which is randomly determined by a known\nfinite-supported probability distribution. This begets considerable\ncomputational challenges, as computing a sender-optimal signaling scheme is\ninapproximable up to within any constant factor. In this work, we circumvent\nthis issue by leveraging ideas from mechanism design. In particular, we\nintroduce a type reporting step in which the receiver is asked to report their\ntype to the sender, after the latter has committed to a menu defining a\nsignaling scheme for each possible receiver's type. We prove that, with a\nsingle receiver, the addition of this type reporting stage makes the sender's\ncomputational problem tractable. Then, we extend our framework to settings with\nmultiple receivers, focusing on the case of no inter-agent externalities and\nbinary actions. We show that it is possible to find a sender-optimal solution\nin polynomial-time by means of the ellipsoid method, given access to a suitable\npolynomial-time separation oracle. This can be implemented for supermodular and\nanonymous sender's utility functions. As for the case of submodular sender's\nutility functions, we first approximately cast the sender's problem into a\nlinearly-constrained mathematical program whose objective function is the\nmulti-linear extension of the sender's utility. Then, we show how to find in\npolynomial-time an approximate solution to the program by means of a continuous\ngreedy algorithm.

Moreover, we show that the satisfiability problem on\nfinite traces for several decidable fragments of first-order temporal logic is\nExpSpace-complete, as in the infinite trace case, while it decreases to\nNExpTime when finite traces bounded in the number of instants are considered.\nThis leads also to new complexity results for temporal description logics over\nfinite traces. Finally, we investigate applications to planning and\nverification, in particular by establishing connections with the notions of\ninsensitivity to infiniteness and safety from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 17:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Thus it finds those objects for almost all algebras used in practice\n(groups, quasigroups in their various signatures, semigroups possibly with many\nunary operations, fields, semi-rings, quandles, logic algebras, etc).\n  As a one-size-fits-all package, it only relies on universal algebra theorems,\nwithout taking advantage of specific theorems about, eg, groups or semigroups\nto reduce the search space. Canon and Holt produced very fast code to compute\nautomorphisms of groups that outperform CREAM on orders larger than 128.\nSimilarly, Mitchell et al. take advantage of deep theorems to compute\nautomorphisms and congruences of completely 0-simple semigroups in a very\nefficient manner. However these domains (groups of order above 128 and\ncompletely 0-simple semigroups) are among the very few examples of GAP code\nfaster than our general purpose package CREAM. For the overwhelming majority of\nother classes of algebras, either ours is the first code computing the above\nmentioned objects, or the existing algorithms are outperformed by CREAM, in\nsome cases by several orders of magnitude.\n  To get this performance, CREAM uses a mixture of universal algebra algorithms\ntogether with GAP coupled with artificial intelligence theorem proving tools\n(AITP) and very delicate C implementations. As an example of the latter, we\nre-implement Freese's very clever algorithm for computing congruences in\nuniversal algebras, in a way that outperforms all other known implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 18:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

The Social Reward\nFunction is designed to closely mimic those genetically endowed social\nperception capabilities of humans in an effort to provide a simple, stable and\nculture-agnostic reward function. Presently, datasets used in social robotics\nare either small or significantly out-of-domain with respect to social\nrobotics. The use of the Social Reward Function will allow larger in-domain\ndatasets to be collected close to the behaviour policy of social robots, which\nwill allow both further improvements to reward functions and to the behaviour\npolicies of social robots.

Semi-competing risks arise in a broad range of\nclinical contexts, with a novel example being the pregnancy condition\npreeclampsia, which can only occur before the `terminal' event of giving birth.\nModels that acknowledge semi-competing risks enable investigation of\nrelationships between covariates and the joint timing of the outcomes, but\nmethods for model selection and prediction of semi-competing risks in high\ndimensions are lacking. Instead, researchers commonly analyze only a single or\ncomposite outcome, losing valuable information and limiting clinical utility --\nin the obstetric setting, this means ignoring valuable insight into timing of\ndelivery after preeclampsia has onset. To address this gap we propose a novel\npenalized estimation framework for frailty-based illness-death multi-state\nmodeling of semi-competing risks. Our approach combines non-convex and\nstructured fusion penalization, inducing global sparsity as well as parsimony\nacross submodels. We perform estimation and model selection via a pathwise\nroutine for non-convex optimization, and prove the first statistical error\nbound results in this setting. We present a simulation study investigating\nestimation error and model selection performance, and a comprehensive\napplication of the method to joint risk modeling of preeclampsia and timing of\ndelivery using pregnancy data from an electronic health record.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 18:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 15:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

While\nPOD identifies modes based on orthogonality in space and it provides a clear\nranking of modes in terms of their contribution to the variance of the signal,\nDMD resolves modes that are orthogonal in time. The clear presence of the\nfundamental slow sausage and kink body modes, as well as higher order slow\nsausage and kink body modes have been identified using POD and DMD analysis of\nthe chromospheric H$\\alpha$ line at 6562.808~{\\AA} for both the circular and\nelliptical sunspots.

The considerable flexibility they offer, as well as their\ncapacity to reproduce a variety of empirically observed behaviours of complex\nsystems, give them broad appeal, and the increasing availability of cheap\ncomputing power has made their use feasible. Yet a widespread adoption in\nreal-world modelling and decision-making scenarios has been hindered by the\ndifficulty of performing parameter estimation for such models. In general,\nsimulation models lack a tractable likelihood function, which precludes a\nstraightforward application of standard statistical inference techniques.\nSeveral recent works have sought to address this problem through the\napplication of likelihood-free inference techniques, in which parameter\nestimates are determined by performing some form of comparison between the\nobserved data and simulation output. However, these approaches are (a) founded\non restrictive assumptions, and/or (b) typically require many hundreds of\nthousands of simulations. These qualities make them unsuitable for large-scale\nsimulations in economics and can cast doubt on the validity of these inference\nmethods in such scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of two\nclasses of black-box approximate Bayesian inference methods that have recently\ndrawn significant attention within the probabilistic machine learning\ncommunity: neural posterior estimation and neural density ratio estimation. We\npresent benchmarking experiments in which we demonstrate that neural network\nbased black-box methods provide state of the art parameter inference for\neconomic simulation models, and crucially are compatible with generic\nmultivariate time-series data. In addition, we suggest appropriate assessment\ncriteria for future benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures\nfor economic simulation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 18:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

However, it exhibits a fundamentally\nricher feedback structure that we refer to as performative feedback: after\nevery deployment, the learner receives samples from the shifted distribution\nrather than only bandit feedback about the reward. Our main contribution is an\nalgorithm that achieves regret bounds scaling only with the complexity of the\ndistribution shifts and not that of the reward function. The algorithm only\nrelies on smoothness of the shifts and does not assume convexity. Moreover, its\nfinal iterate is guaranteed to be near-optimal.

If a user happens to be exposed to strongly polarized\ncontent, she might subsequently receive recommendations which may steer her\ntowards more and more radicalized content, eventually being trapped in what we\ncall a \"radicalization pathway\". In this paper, we study the problem of\nmitigating radicalization pathways using a graph-based approach. Specifically,\nwe model the set of recommendations of a \"what-to-watch-next\" recommender as a\nd-regular directed graph where nodes correspond to content items, links to\nrecommendations, and paths to possible user sessions. We measure the\n\"segregation\" score of a node representing radicalized content as the expected\nlength of a random walk from that node to any node representing non-radicalized\ncontent. High segregation scores are associated to larger chances to get users\ntrapped in radicalization pathways. Hence, we define the problem of reducing\nthe prevalence of radicalization pathways by selecting a small number of edges\nto \"rewire\", so to minimize the maximum of segregation scores among all\nradicalized nodes, while maintaining the relevance of the recommendations. We\nprove that the problem of finding the optimal set of recommendations to rewire\nis NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate within any factor. Therefore, we turn our\nattention to heuristics, and propose an efficient yet effective greedy\nalgorithm based on the absorbing random walk theory. Our experiments on\nreal-world datasets in the context of video and news recommendations confirm\nthe effectiveness of our proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 18:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Towards this\ngoal, generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) using string and graph\nrepresentations have been successfully used to search for novel molecules.\nHowever, these approaches are limited since their representations ignore the\nthree-dimensional (3D) structure of molecules. In fact, geometry plays an\nimportant role in many applications in inverse molecular design, especially in\ndrug discovery. Thus, it is important to build models that can generate\nmolecular structures in 3D space based on property-oriented geometric\nconstraints. To address this, one approach is to generate molecules as 3D point\nclouds by sequentially placing atoms at locations in space -- this allows the\nprocess to be guided by physical quantities such as energy or other properties.\nHowever, this approach is inefficient as placing individual atoms makes the\nexploration unnecessarily deep, limiting the complexity of molecules that can\nbe generated.

It is the reservoir that fuels galaxy growth via star\nformation, the repository of material formed by these stars, and a sensitive\ntracer of internal and external processes that affect entire galaxies.\nConsequently, significant efforts have gone into systematic surveys of the cold\nISM of the galaxies in the local Universe. This review discusses the resulting\nnetwork of scaling relations connecting the atomic and molecular gas masses of\ngalaxies with their other global properties (stellar masses, morphologies,\nmetallicities, star formation activity...), and their implications for our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution. Key take-home messages are as follows: (1)\nFrom a gas perspective, there are three main factors that determine the star\nformation rate of a galaxy: the total mass of its cold ISM, how much of that\ngas is molecular, and the rate at which any molecular gas is converted into\nstars. All three of these factors vary systematically across the local galaxy\npopulation. (2) The shape and scatter of both the star formation main sequence\nand the mass-metallicity relation are deeply linked to the availability of\natomic and molecular gas. (3) Future progress will come from expanding our\nexploration of scaling relations into new parameter space (in particular the\nregime of dwarf galaxies), better connecting the cold ISM of large samples of\ngalaxies with the environment that feeds them (the circumgalactic medium in\nparticular), and understanding the impact of these large scales on the\nefficiency of the star formation process on molecular cloud scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In\nthe optical wavelength regime a number of different neutron-capture elements\nhave been measured, however from the infrared H-band only the s-process\ndominated element cerium has been accurately measured for a large sample of\ndisk stars. The more r-process dominated element ytterbium has only been\nmeasured in a small subset of stars so far. In this study we aim to measure the\nytterbium (Yb) abundance of local disk giants using the Yb II line at\n$\\lambda_\\text{air}$=16498\\AA. We also compare the resulting abundance trend\nwith Ce and Eu abundances for the same stars to analyse the s- and r-process\ncontributions. We analyse 30 K-giants with high-resolution H-band spectra using\nspectral synthesis. The very same stars have already been analysed using\nhigh-resolution optical spectra using the same method, but the abundance of Yb\nwas not possible to determine from those spectra due to blending issues for\nstars with [Fe/H]>-1. In this present analysis, we utilise the stellar\nparameters determined from the optical analysis. We determined the Yb\nabundances with an estimated uncertainty for [Yb/Fe] of 0.1 dex. From\ncomparison, the trend of [Yb/Fe] follows closely the [Eu/Fe] trend and has\nclear s-process enrichment in identified s-rich stars. From the comparison,\nboth the validity of the Yb abundances are ensured, and the theoretical\nprediction of a roughly 40/60 s-/r-process contribution to Yb's origin is\nsupported. These results show that with a careful and detailed analysis of\ninfrared spectra, reliable Yb abundances can be derived for a wider sample of\ncooler giants in the range -1.1<[Fe/H]<0.3. This is promising for further\nstudies of the production of Yb and for the r-process channel, key for\nGalactochemical evolution, in the infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Our goal is to infer the contribution of\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from star formation (SF), and X-ray radiation\nfrom the active galactic nuclei (AGN), respectively producing photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) and X-ray dominated regions (XDRs), to the molecular gas\nheating.

By comparing our results to the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, we find no\nevidence for AGN influence on the cold and low-density gas on kpc-scales. On\nnuclear (r = 250 pc) scales, we find weak correlations between the CO line\nratios and either the FUV or X-ray fluxes: this may indicate that neither SF\nnor AGN radiation dominates the gas excitation, at least at r = 250 pc.

This paper summarizes\nthe results of a project attempting to reconcile these findings with four\ndifferent data sets and six different data series--three survey and three\nadministrative data series, including two which match survey respondent data to\ntheir administrative data. Using common specifications, measures of volatility,\nand other treatments of the data, four of the six data series show a lack of\nany significant long-term trend in male earnings volatility over the last\n20-to-30+ years when differences across the data sets are properly accounted\nfor. A fifth data series (the PSID) shows a positive net trend but small in\nmagnitude. A sixth, administrative, data set, available only since 1998, shows\nno net trend 1998-2011 and only a small decline thereafter. Many of the\nremaining differences across data series can be explained by differences in\ntheir cross-sectional distribution of earnings, particularly differences in the\nsize of the lower tail. We conclude that the data sets we have analyzed, which\ninclude many of the most important available, show little evidence of any\nsignificant trend in male earnings volatility since the mid-1980s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 19:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

The\nother study reports a weak decreasing trend of the energy moments, resulting in\na generally accepted negative value for $K_{\\tau}$.

Despite the variation in the structural character of $E0$\nstrength distribution from different studies, we find for all datasets that the\nmoment ratios, calculated from the ISGMR strength in the excitation-energy\nrange that defines the main resonance region, display at best only a weak\nsystematic sensitivity to a mass increase.

Several forms of auxiliary information have been\nemployed in single-channel SE, such as a speech snippet enrolled from the\ntarget speaker or visual information corresponding to the spoken utterance.\nMany SE studies have reported performance improvement compared to speaker\nseparation (SS) methods with oracle selection, arguing that this is due to the\nuse of auxiliary information. However, such works have not considered\nstate-of-the-art SS methods that have shown impressive separation performance.\nIn this paper, we revise and examine the role of the auxiliary information in\nSE. Specifically, we compare the performance of two SE systems (audio-based and\nvideo-based) with SS using a common framework that utilizes the\nstate-of-the-art dual-path recurrent neural network as the main learning\nmachine. In addition, we study how much the considered SE systems rely on the\nauxiliary information by analyzing the systems' output for random auxiliary\nsignals. Experimental evaluation on various datasets suggests that the main\npurpose of the auxiliary information in the considered SE systems is only to\nspecify the target speaker in the mixture and that it does not provide\nconsistent extraction performance gain when compared to the uninformed SS\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 20:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

We employ causal inference methodology to estimate average causal\neffects of a split flow model on time to be roomed, time to disposition after\nbeing roomed, admission decisions, and ED revisits at a large tertiary teaching\nhospital that uses a split flow model during certain hours each day. We propose\na regression discontinuity (RD) design to identify average causal effects,\nwhich we formalize with causal diagrams. Using electronic health records data\n(n = 21,570), we estimate that split flow increases average time to be roomed\nby about 4.6 minutes (95% CI: [2.9,6.2] minutes) but decreases average time to\ndisposition by 14.4 minutes (95% CI: [4.1,24.7] minutes), leading to an overall\nreduction in length of stay. Split flow is also found to decrease admission\nrates by 5.9% (95% CI: [2.3%, 9.4%]) but not at the expense of a significant\nchange in revisit rates. Lastly, we find that the split flow model is\nespecially effective at reducing length of stay during low congestion levels,\nwhich mediation analysis partly attributes to early task initiation by the\nphysician assigned to triage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 20:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Diffeomorphic image registration is important\nfor medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility,\nsmoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the\ngrid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the\nneighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image\nregistration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly\naddress this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness\nregularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a\ndifferentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes\nexponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new\nregistration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson\nreconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive\nJacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a\npost-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be\nplaced at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable\nframework.

However, while\naccuracy has been steadily increasing on State-of-the-Art datasets, these\ndatasets often do not address the challenges seen in real-world applications.\nThese challenges are dealing with people distant from the camera, people in\ncrowds, and heavily occluded people. As a result, many real-world applications\nhave trained on data that does not reflect the data present in deployment,\nleading to significant underperformance. This article presents ADG-Pose, a\nmethod for automatically generating datasets for real-world human pose\nestimation. These datasets can be customized to determine person distances,\ncrowdedness, and occlusion distributions. Models trained with our method are\nable to perform in the presence of these challenges where those trained on\nother datasets fail. Using ADG-Pose, end-to-end accuracy for real-world\nskeleton-based action recognition sees a 20% increase on scenes with moderate\ndistance and occlusion levels, and a 4X increase on distant scenes where other\nmodels failed to perform better than random.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 20:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 20:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

For distributions\nwith strongly varying curvature, Riemannian metrics help in efficient\nexploration of the target distribution. Unfortunately, they have significant\ncomputational overhead due to e.g. repeated inversion of the metric tensor, and\ncurrent geometric MCMC methods using the Fisher information matrix to induce\nthe manifold are in practice slow. We propose a new alternative Riemannian\nmetric for MCMC, by embedding the target distribution into a higher-dimensional\nEuclidean space as a Monge patch and using the induced metric determined by\ndirect geometric reasoning. Our metric only requires first-order gradient\ninformation and has fast inverse and determinants, and allows reducing the\ncomputational complexity of individual iterations from cubic to quadratic in\nthe problem dimensionality.

Because labeling large\namounts of sensor data is an expensive task, unsupervised and semi-supervised\nlearning techniques have emerged that can learn good features from the data\nwithout requiring any labels. In this paper, we extend this line of research\nand present a novel technique called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning\n(ColloSSL) which leverages unlabeled data collected from multiple devices worn\nby a user to learn high-quality features of the data. A key insight that\nunderpins the design of ColloSSL is that unlabeled sensor datasets\nsimultaneously captured by multiple devices can be viewed as natural\ntransformations of each other, and leveraged to generate a supervisory signal\nfor representation learning. We present three technical innovations to extend\nconventional self-supervised learning algorithms to a multi-device setting: a\nDevice Selection approach which selects positive and negative devices to enable\ncontrastive learning, a Contrastive Sampling algorithm which samples positive\nand negative examples in a multi-device setting, and a loss function called\nMulti-view Contrastive Loss which extends standard contrastive loss to a\nmulti-device setting.

At the multicellular\nlevel, this \"lateral inhibition\" principle leads to checkerboard patterns of\nSender and Receiver cells. While it is well known that stochasticity modulates\ncell fate specification, little is known about how stochastic fluctuations at\nthe cellular level propagate during multicell pattern formation. Here, we model\nstochastic fluctuations in the Notch-Delta pathway in the presence of two\ndifferent noise types - shot and white - for a multicell system. The results\nshow that intermediate fluctuations reduce disorder and guide the multicell\nlattice toward more checkerboard like patterns. By further analyzing cell fate\ntransition events, we demonstrate that intermediate noise amplitudes provide\nenough perturbation to facilitate \"proofreading\" of disordered patterns and\ncause cells to switch to their correct ordered state. Conversely, high noise\ncan override environmental signals coming from neighboring cells and lead to\nswitching between ordered and disordered patterns. Therefore, in analogy with\nspin glass systems, intermediate noise levels allow the multicell Notch system\nto escape frustrated patterns and relax towards the lower energy checkerboard\npattern while at large noise levels the system is unable to find this ordered\nbase of attraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 21:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

To address this issue, a technology that\nhas received a lot of attention is In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD). The interest in\nIBFD systems stems from its capability to simultaneously transmit and receive\ndata in the same frequency. Cancelling the self interference (SI) from the\ntransmitter to the collocated receiver plays a pivotal role in the performance\nof the system. There are two types of SI cancellation (SIC) approaches, passive\nand active. In this research, the focus is on active cancellation and, in\nparticular, SIC in the digital domain. Among the direct and backscattered SI,\nthe former has been studied for a long time; therefore, the backscatter is\nconsidered in this research and two SIC approaches are analyzed. The first\nachieves SIC through beamforming. This requires knowing the angle of the\nreceived SI to put the beam null-space in this direction. The second method\nremoves SI by employing an Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Using an ANN,\nthere is no need to know the direction of the SI. The neural network is trained\nwith pilots which results in the network being able to separate the desired\nsignal from the SI at the receiver. Bayesian Neural Networks show the\nimportance of the weights and assign a parameter that facilitates ignoring the\nless significant ones. Through comparative simulations we demonstrate that the\nANN-based SIC achieves equivalent bit error rate performance as two beamforming\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 21:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

As the skyrmion density increases,\nthe skyrmion Hall angle is nonmonotonic, dropping to low or zero values in\ncommensurate states and rising to an enhanced value in incommensurate states.\nUnder commensuration, the driven skyrmion is channeled by a symmetry direction\nof the pinning array and exhibits an increased velocity. The velocity\nfluctuations have a narrow band signature at fillings where the skyrmion Hall\nangle is zero, while for incommensurate fillings, the skyrmion motion is\ndisordered and the velocity noise is broad band. Under commensurate conditions,\nmulti-step depinning transitions appear and the skyrmion Hall angle is zero at\nlow drives but becomes finite at higher drives, while incommensurate fillings\nhave a single depinning transition. As the Magnus force increases,\ncommensuration velocity peaks cross over to dips, and new directional locking\nangles appear. At large Magnus forces, particularly at commensurate fillings, a\nvelocity boost can occur in which the skyrmion moves faster than the applied\ndrive due to the alignment of the Magnus-induced velocity with the driving\ndirection. Increase the Magnus force can produce regimes of enhanced pinning\nwhen the skyrmion is forced to move along a non-symmetry direction of the\nperiodic pinning array. This is in contrast to systems with random pinning,\nwhere increasing the Magnus force generally reduces the pinning effect. We\ndemonstrate these dynamics for both square and triangular substrates, and map\nout the different regimes as a function of filling fraction, pinning force, and\nthe strength of the Magnus force in a series of dynamic phase diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 21:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

However in both methods there is a\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed of computation, both of which are\nimportant in applications. We introduce a new method, the MC-Tree method, that\ncombines the MC method with the binomial tree method. It employs a mixing\ndistribution on the tree parameters, which are restricted to give prescribed\nmean and variance. For the family of mixing densities proposed here, the\ncorresponding compound densities of the tree outcomes at final time are\nobtained. Ideally the compound density would be (after a logarithmic\ntransformation of the asset prices) Gaussian. Using the fact that in general,\nwhen mean and variance are prescribed, the maximum entropy distribution is\nGaussian, we look for mixing densities for which the corresponding compound\ndensity has high entropy level. The compound densities that we obtain are not\nexactly Gaussian, but have entropy values close to the maximum possible\nGaussian entropy. Furthermore we introduce techniques to correct for the\ndeviation from the ideal Gaussian pricing measure. One of these (distribution\ncorrection technique) ensures that expectations calculated with the method are\ntaken with respect to the desired Gaussian measure. The other one\n(bias-correction technique) ensures that the probability distributions used are\nrisk-neutral in each of the trees. Apart from option pricing, we apply our\ntechniques to develop an algorithm for calculation of the Credit Valuation\nAdjustment (CVA) to the price of an American option. Numerical examples of the\nworkings of the MC-Tree approach are provided, which show good performance in\nterms of accuracy and computational speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 22:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Our\nrepresentation unifies and extends recent approaches to team coordination.\nSimilar to the approach of Carminati et al (2021), our TB-DAG can be used to\ncapture adversarial team games, and enables standard, out-of-the-box\ngame-theoretic techniques including no-regret learning (e.g., CFR and its\nstate-of-the-art modern variants such as DCFR and PCFR+) and first-order\nmethods. However, our representation can be exponentially smaller, and can be\nviewed as a lossless abstraction of theirs into a directed acyclic graph.

Moreover, the semantic classes are\ndefined differently for different applications (e.g., rover traversal vs.\ngeological) and as a result the network has to be trained from scratch each\ntime, which is an inefficient use of resources. This research proposes a\nsemi-supervised learning framework for Mars terrain segmentation where a deep\nsegmentation network trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images is\ntransferred to the task of terrain segmentation trained on few labeled images.\nThe network incorporates a backbone module which is trained using a contrastive\nloss function and an output atrous convolution module which is trained using a\npixel-wise cross-entropy loss function.

The automatically\ngenerated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show\nthat in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\\%$\ndetection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data\ncan be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and\nexhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data\nanalyses in football.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 23:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 20:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 13:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

However, recent evidence supports a decades-old\nconcept that quantum entanglement, harnessed by current quantum communication\nsystems, does not necessarily rely on a physical relay medium. In modern\nquantum communication networks, this trusted relay infrastructure is (1)\nsusceptible to security attacks, (2) limited by the channel capacity, (3)\nsubject to decoherence loss, and (4) expensive to set up. The instantaneous and\nfaster-than-light activities of quantum entanglement occurring in quantum\ncommunication have suggested guidance by some non-locality nature. On the\ncontrary, neither ground nor space-relays have shown or been demonstrated to\nembody it. It is proposed in this paper that the non-locality nature of quantum\ntheory governs quantum entanglement; elementary particles, components of a\nuniversal quantum body, can achieve remote entanglement regardless of a\nphysical medium or spatial proximity. Evidence and theory supporting remote\nentanglement in superconducting quantum systems (entanglement fidelities for\ncommunication in particular) are presented.

The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a single regularization\nparameter and the number of data points in each ancestor.

We compare\nthe radial distribution of GCs predicted in simple Monte Carlo models with that\nof a sample of $38$ spectroscopically confirmed GCs plus 17 GC candidates,\nassociated mainly to low-luminosity dSph galaxies. If dark matter haloes follow\nan NFW profile, the observed number of off-center GCs at projected distances\nless than one half the galaxy effective radius is significantly higher than\nmodels predict. This timing problem can be viewed as a fine-tuning of the\nstarting GC distances. As a result of the short sinking timescale for GCs in\nthe central regions, the radial distribution of GCs is expected to evolve\nsignificantly during the next 1-2 Gyr. However, dark matter haloes with cores\nof size comparable to the galaxy effective radii can lead to a slow orbital\nin-spiral of GCs in the central regions of these galaxies, providing a simple\nsolution to the timing problem.

Based on the existing\nmathematical models, we develop an age-dependent feedback control model to\nsimulate the interaction. The model consists of three subsystems: cytosolic\ncalcium dynamics, ROS generation from the respiratory chain in mitochondria,\nand mitochondrial energy metabolism. In the model, we hypothesized that ROS\ninduces calcium release from the yeast endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus,\nand vacuoles, and that ROS damages calmodulin and calcineurin by oxidizing\nthem. The dependence of calcium uptake by Vcx1p on ATP is incorporated into the\nmodel. The model can approximately reproduce the log phase calcium dynamics.\nThe simulated interaction between the cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial ROS\nshows that an increase in calcium results in a decrease in ROS initially (in\nlog phase), but the increase-decrease relation is changed to an\nincrease-increase relation when the cell is getting old. This could accord with\nthe experimental observation that calcium diminishes ROS from complexes I and\nIII of the respiratory chain under normal conditions, but enhances ROS when the\ncomplex formations are inhibited. The model predicts that the subsystem of the\ncalcium regulators Pmc1p, Pmr1p, and Vex1p is stable, controllable, and\nobservable. These structural properties of the dynamical system could\nmathematically confirm that cells have evolved delicate feedback control\nmechanisms to maintain their calcium homeostasis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 03:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

The inconsistency between the\nconfidence for NMS and the real localization confidence seriously affects\ndetection performance. Prior works propose to predict Intersection-over-Union\n(IoU) between bounding boxes and corresponding ground-truths to improve NMS,\nwhile accurately predicting IoU is still a challenging problem. We argue that\nthe complex definition of IoU and feature misalignment make it difficult to\npredict IoU accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled IoU\nRegression (DIR) model to handle these problems. The proposed DIR decouples the\ntraditional localization confidence metric IoU into two new metrics, Purity and\nIntegrity. Purity reflects the proportion of the object area in the detected\nbounding box, and Integrity refers to the completeness of the detected object\narea. Separately predicting Purity and Integrity can divide the complex mapping\nbetween the bounding box and its IoU into two clearer mappings and model them\nindependently. In addition, a simple but effective feature realignment approach\nis also introduced to make the IoU regressor work in a hindsight manner, which\ncan make the target mapping more stable. The proposed DIR can be conveniently\nintegrated with existing two-stage detectors and significantly improve their\nperformance. Through a simple implementation of DIR with HTC, we obtain 51.3%\nAP on MS COCO benchmark, which outperforms previous methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 04:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Prior works have shown the\npossibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that\nfollow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the\nbehavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major\nchallenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and\nindividual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and\naggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them\nin real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are\nexpected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy\nand therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned\nchallenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and\nreward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn\nthe decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social\nutility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying\naltruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe\naction space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of\nAVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs\ncan learn cooperative policies that are adaptable to different situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 05:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

The domain has several\napplication areas ranging from car assessment companies such as car rentals and\nbody shops to accidental damage assessment for car insurance companies. In\nvehicle assessment, the damage can take any form including scratches, minor and\nmajor dents to missing parts. More often, the assessment area has a significant\nlevel of noise such as dirt, grease, oil or rush that makes an accurate\nidentification challenging. Moreover, the identification of a particular part\nis the first step in the repair industry to have an accurate labour and part\nassessment where the presence of different car models, shapes and sizes makes\nthe task even more challenging for a machine-learning model to perform well. To\naddress these challenges, this research explores and applies various instance\nsegmentation methodologies to evaluate the best performing models.\n  The scope of this work focusses on two genres of real-time instance\nsegmentation models due to their industrial significance, namely SipMask and\nYolact.

In this paper, we give the first formal study\non resource task sampling by leveraging the techniques from active learning. We\npropose an algorithm that iteratively estimates the relevance of each source\ntask to the target task and samples from each source task based on the\nestimated relevance. Theoretically, we show that for the linear representation\nclass, to achieve the same error rate, our algorithm can save up to a\n\\textit{number of source tasks} factor in the source task sample complexity,\ncompared with the naive uniform sampling from all source tasks.

While entropic regularization has been successfully applied to\napproximate Wasserstein barycenters, this loses the sparsity of the optimal\nsolution, making it difficult to solve the MOT problem directly in practice\nbecause of the curse of dimensionality.

One way to define the mutual information is by comparing the\njoint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ with the product of the marginals through the\nKL-divergence. If the two distributions are close to each other there will be\nalmost no leakage of $X$ from $Y$ since the two variables are close to being\nindependent. In the discrete setting the mutual information has the nice\ninterpretation of how many bits $Y$ reveals about $X$ and if $I(X;Y)=H(X)$ (the\nShannon entropy of $X$) then $X$ is completely revealed. However, in the\ncontinuous case we do not have the same reasoning. For instance the mutual\ninformation can be infinite in the continuous case. This fact enables us to try\ndifferent metrics or divergences to define the mutual information. In this\npaper, we are evaluating different metrics or divergences such as\nKullback-Liebler (KL) divergence, Wasserstein distance, Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence and total variation distance to form alternatives to the mutual\ninformation in the continuous case.

However, when trained with these loss functions,\nmodels usually fail to recover sharp edges present in the high-resolution (HR)\nimages for the reason that the model tends to give a statistical average of\npotential HR solutions. During our research, we observe that gradient maps of\nimages generated by the models trained with the L1 or L2 loss have\nsignificantly lower variance than the gradient maps of the original\nhigh-resolution images. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above issue\nby introducing a structure-enhancing loss function, coined Gradient Variance\n(GV) loss, and generate textures with perceptual-pleasant details.\nSpecifically, during the training of the model, we extract patches from the\ngradient maps of the target and generated output, calculate the variance of\neach patch and form variance maps for these two images. Further, we minimize\nthe distance between the computed variance maps to enforce the model to produce\nhigh variance gradient maps that will lead to the generation of high-resolution\nimages with sharper edges. Experimental results show that the GV loss can\nsignificantly improve both Structure Similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR) performance of existing image super-resolution (SR) deep learning\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 12:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

A common method for\nalleviating this issue is to combine per-task gradients into a joint update\ndirection using a particular heuristic. In this paper, we propose viewing the\ngradients combination step as a bargaining game, where tasks negotiate to reach\nan agreement on a joint direction of parameter update.

While the method of\ndetecting sleep stages via the monitoring of brain activity, muscle activity,\nand eye movement, through electroencephalogram in a lab setting, provide the\ngold standard for detection, this paper aims to investigate a new method that\nwill allow a person to gain similar insight and results with no obtrusion to\ntheir normal sleeping habits.

A PGNP is composed of two\ndifferent layers: the hard core of a nanoparticle and the soft corona of\ngrafted polymers on the surface. It is predicted that PGNPs with these two\ndistinct layers will have similar behaviors as star polymers and hard spheres.\nThe interaction between PGNPs strongly depend upon their grafting density and\nthe length of the grafted polymer chains, N. Thus, PGNP may exhibit\npolymorphism. Moreover, it is expected that crystals made from PGNPs will be\nstructurally tough due to the entanglement of grafted polymers. The crystal\npolymorph of PGNP is explored using molecular dynamics simulations. We\nsucceeded in finding FCC/HCP and BCC crystals depending on the length of the\ngrafted polymer chain. When N is small, PGNPs behave like hard spheres. The\ncrystals formed are arranged in FCC/HCP structure, much like the phase\ntransition observed in an Alder transition. When N is large enough, the\nincrease in the free energy of grafted polymers can no longer be neglected.\nThus, the crystals formed in these systems are arranged in BCC structure, which\nhas a lower density than FCC/HCP. When N is not too small or large, FCC/HCP\nstructures are observed when the concentration of PGNPs is low, but a phase\ntransition occurs when the concentration of PGNPs becomes higher with the\ncompression of the system. Again, the increase in free energy of grafted\npolymers can no longer be neglected and the crystals arrange themselves in a\nBCC structure. Also, it can be revealed that the lattice spacing of PGNP\ncrystals can be controlled easily and widely by the chain length.

Monchaux & Dejoan (Phys. Rev.\nFluids, 2, 104302, 2017) showed using direct numerical simulations (DNS) that\nwhile for low particle loading the effect of two-way coupling (2WC) on the\nglobal flow statistics is weak, 2WC enables the particles to drag the fluid in\ntheir vicinity down with them, significantly enhancing their settling, and they\nargued that 2WC suppresses the preferential sweeping mechanism. We explore this\nfurther by considering the impact of 2WC on the contribution made by eddies of\ndifferent sizes on the particle settling. In agreement with Monchaux & Dejoan,\nwe show that even for low loading, 2WC strongly enhances particle settling, and\nwe show how 2WC modifies the contribution from different flow scales. However,\ncontrary to their study, we show that preferential sweeping remains important\nin 2WC flows. In particular, for both 1WC and 2WC flows, the settling\nenhancement due to turbulence is dominated by contributions from particles in\nstraining regions of the flow, but for the 2WC case, the particles in these\nregions also drag the fluid down with them, leading to an enhancement of their\nsettling compared to the 1WC case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Melody extraction is a notoriously challenging task due to the\npresence of background instruments. Also, often melodic source exhibits similar\ncharacteristics to that of the other instruments. The interfering background\naccompaniment with the vocals makes extracting the melody from the mixture\nsignal much more challenging. Until recently, classical signal processing-based\nmelody extraction methods were quite popular among melody extraction\nresearchers. The ability of the deep learning models to model large-scale data\nand the ability of the models to learn automatic features by exploiting spatial\nand temporal dependencies inspired many researchers to adopt deep learning\nmodels for melody extraction. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review\nthe up-to-date data-driven deep learning approaches for melody extraction from\npolyphonic music. The available deep models have been categorized based on the\ntype of neural network used and the output representation they use for\npredicting melody. Further, the architectures of the 25 melody extraction\nmodels are briefly presented. The loss functions used to optimize the model\nparameters of the melody extraction models are broadly categorized into four\ncategories and briefly describe the loss functions used by various melody\nextraction models. Also, the various input representations adopted by the\nmelody extraction models and the parameter settings are deeply described. A\nsection describing the explainability of the block-box melody extraction deep\nneural networks is included. The performance of 25 melody extraction methods is\ncompared. The possible future directions to explore/improve the melody\nextraction methods are also presented in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 15:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

However, the scientific interest in causal inference suggests that we\nsomehow aim at stable estimates of the cause that will generalize to new\nindividuals in the long run.

In this\nway, we can avoid grid-searches over all task and hyperparameter combinations,\ndramatically reducing the time needed to find effective task pairs. Our results\nshow that, through this approach, it is possible to reduce training time by up\nto 83.5% at a cost of only 0.034 reduction in positive-class F1 on the TREC-IS\n2020-A dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 15:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel improved subspace method from the perspective of\ninput design, which guarantees the consistent and stable identification results\nwith the minimum variance. Specifically, we first obtain a closed-form\nestimation of the system matrix, then analyze the statistic performance by\nderiving the maximum identification deviation.

However, automatic detection is inefficient due to\nlow precision: e.g. \"we are a young company\" or \"working with mostly male\npatients\" are phrases that contain explicit terms, while the context shows that\nthese do not reflect discriminatory content.\n  In this paper, we show how machine learning based computational language\nmodels can raise precision in the detection of explicit discrimination by\nidentifying when the potentially discriminating terms are used in a\ndiscriminatory context. We focus on gender discrimination, which indeed suffers\nfrom low precision when filtering explicit terms. First, we created a data set\nfor gender discrimination in job vacancies. Second, we investigated a variety\nof computational language models for discriminatory context detection. Third,\nwe evaluated the capability of these models to detect unforeseen discriminating\nterms in context. The results show that machine learning based methods can\ndetect explicit gender discrimination with high precision and help in finding\nnew forms of discrimination. Accordingly, the proposed methods can\nsubstantially increase the effectiveness of detecting job vacancies which are\nhighly suspected to be discriminatory. In turn, this may lower the\ndiscrimination experienced at the start of the recruitment process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 09:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Correspondingly, the adjacency\nmatrix, containing the information on covalent bonds, or equivalent data\nstructures (e.g., lists) have been the main core in the feature-updating\nprocesses, such as graph convolution.
