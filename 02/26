In general, the limit distributions are characterized\nas suprema of Gaussian processes. We explicitly characterize when the limit\ndistribution is centered normal or degenerates to a Dirac measure. Moreover, in\ncontrast to recent contributions on distributional limit laws for empirical OT\non Euclidean spaces which require centering around its expectation, the\ndistributional limits obtained here are centered around the population\nquantity, which is well-suited for statistical applications.\n  At the heart of our theory is Kantorovich duality representing OT as a\nsupremum over a function class $\\mathcal{F}_{c}$ for an underlying sufficiently\nregular cost function $c$. In this regard, OT is considered as a functional\ndefined on $\\ell^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{F}_{c})$ the Banach space of bounded\nfunctionals from $\\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ and equipped with uniform\nnorm. We prove the OT functional to be Hadamard directional differentiable and\nconclude distributional convergence via a functional delta method that\nnecessitates weak convergence of an underlying empirical process in\n$\\ell^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{F}_{c})$. The latter can be dealt with empirical\nprocess theory and requires $\\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to be a Donsker class. We give\nsufficient conditions depending on the dimension of the ground space, the\nunderlying cost function and the probability measures under consideration to\nguarantee the Donsker property. Overall, our approach reveals a noteworthy\ntrade-off inherent in central limit theorems for empirical OT: Kantorovich\nduality requires $\\mathcal{F}_{c}$ to be sufficiently rich, while the empirical\nprocesses only converges weakly if $\\mathcal{F}_{c}$ is not too complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 16:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

The period dependence of the occurrence rate\nseems to follow a broken power-law or log-normal peaking at 700-800 days,\nroughly corresponding to 1.6AU for a 1Msun star and 2.0AU for a 2Msun star.\nThis peak could be a remnant from halted migration around intermediate-mass\nstars, caused by stellar evolution, or an artifact from contamination by false\npositives. The global occurrence rate of giant planetary systems is 10.7% for\nthe entire sample, while the subsets of RGB and HB stars exhibit 14.2% and\n6.6%, respectively. However, we demonstrate that the different stellar mass\ndistributions suffice to explain the apparent change of occurrence with\nevolutionary stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 16:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

For in-line imaging\nmodalities, which are appealing because they are compact, require no moving\nparts, and are robust, negating the effects of such scattering becomes\nparticularly challenging. Here we explore the effect of stationary scattering\nmedia on light scattering in in-line geometries, including digital holographic\nmicroscopy. We consider various object-scatterer scenarios where the object is\ndistorted or obscured by additional stationary scatterers, and use an advanced\ndeep learning (DL) generative methodology, generative adversarial networks\n(GANs), to mitigate the effects of the additional scatterers. Using light\nscattering simulations and experiments on objects of interest with and without\nadditional scatterers, we find that conditional GANs can be quickly trained\nwith minuscule datasets and can also efficiently learn the one-to-one\nstatistical mapping between the cross-domain input-output image pairs.

Specifically, supervised deep learning requires a large\namount of annotated images for training.

If\nworking with video frames can increase the number of these instances, it has a\nmajor disadvantage: the resulting images will be highly correlated with one\nanother. As a consequence, models trained under such constraints are expected\nto be very sensitive to input distribution changes, which may be caused in\npractice by changes in the acquisition system (cameras, lights), in the parts\nor in the defects aspect. In this work, we demonstrate the use of randomly\ngenerated synthetic training images can help tackle domain instability issues,\nmaking the trained models more robust to contextual changes.

By utilizing dynamic\nsoaring, the bird can travel in the desired flight direction almost for free by\nharvesting energy from the wind. Dynamic soaring biological inspiration has\ntriggered a momentous interest among many communities of science and\nengineering. Studying, modeling, and simulating dynamic soaring have been\nconducted in literature by mostly configuring dynamic soaring as an optimal\ncontrol problem. Said configuration requires accurate dynamic system modeling\nof the albatross/mimicking-object, accurate wind profile models, and a defined\nmathematical formula of an objective function that aims at conserving energy\nand minimizing its dissipation. However, the experimental observations of\nalbatrosses indicate their ability to conduct dynamic soaring in real time.\nIndeed, a functioning modeling and control framework for dynamic soaring that\nallows for a meaningful bio-mimicry of the albatross needs to be autonomous,\nreal-time, stable, and capable of tolerating the absence of mathematical\nexpressions of the wind profiles and the objective function, hypothetically\nsimilar to what the bird does. The qualifications of such modeling and control\nframework are the very same characteristics of the so-called extremum seeking\nsystems. In this paper, we propose an extremum seeking modeling and control\nframework for the dynamic soaring problem. We provide and discuss the problem\nsetup, design, and stability of the introduced framework. Our results,\nsupported by simulations and comparison with optimal control methods of the\nliterature, provide a proof of concept that the dynamic soaring phenomenon can\nbe a natural expression of extremum seeking. Hence, dynamic soaring has the\npotential to be performed autonomously and in real-time with stability\nguarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 16:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 00:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 03:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 16:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 13:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 16:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

A power-counting analysis shows that the leading singularities of\ncorrelation functions can be analyzed within an effective renormalizable model\nin which the kinetic energy of in-plane phonons and subleading geometrical\nnonlinearities in the expansion of the strain tensor are neglected. For\nmembranes at zero temperature, governed by zero-point motion, the RG equations\nof the effective model provide a systematic derivation of logarithmic\ncorrections to the bending rigidity and to the elastic Young modulus derived in\nearlier investigations. In the limit of a weakly applied external tension, the\nstress-strain relation at $T = 0$ is anomalous: the linear Hooke's law is\nreplaced with a singular law exhibiting logarithmic corrections. For small, but\nfinite temperatures, we use techniques of finite-size scaling to derive general\nrelations between the zero-temperature RG flow and scaling laws of\nthermodynamic quantities such as the thermal expansion coefficient $\\alpha$,\nthe entropy S, and the specific heat C.

In the analysis of the dynamic regret, prior works often assume\nLipschitz continuity or uniform smoothness of the cost functions. However,\nthere are many important cost functions in practice that do not satisfy these\nconditions. In such cases, prior analyses are not applicable and fail to\nguarantee the optimization performance. In this letter, we show that it is\npossible to bound the dynamic regret, even when neither Lipschitz continuity\nnor uniform smoothness is present. We adopt the notion of relative smoothness\nwith respect to some user-defined regularization function, which is a much\nmilder requirement on the cost functions. We first show that under relative\nsmoothness, the dynamic regret has an upper bound based on the path length and\nfunctional variation. We then show that with an additional condition of\nrelatively strong convexity, the dynamic regret can be bounded by the path\nlength and gradient variation. These regret bounds provide performance\nguarantees to a wide variety of online optimization problems that arise in\ndifferent application domains. Finally, we present numerical experiments that\ndemonstrate the advantage of adopting a regularization function under which the\ncost functions are relatively smooth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 17:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

A high-level planner approximates the original formulation as a\ndiscrete game with simplified state, control, and dynamics to easily encode the\ncomplex safety and fairness rules and calculates a series of target waypoints.\nThe low-level controller takes the resulting waypoints as a reference\ntrajectory and computes high-resolution control inputs by solving an\nalternative formulation approximation with simplified objectives and\nconstraints. We consider two approaches for the low-level planner, constructing\ntwo hierarchical controllers. One approach uses multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), and the other solves a linear-quadratic Nash game (LQNG) to\nproduce control inputs. The controllers are compared against three baselines:\nan end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a fixed racing line,\nand an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line. Quantitative results show\nthat the proposed hierarchical methods outperform their respective baseline\nmethods in terms of head-to-head race wins and abiding by the rules.

A number of other potential candidates exist, but improved mass\nmeasurements are necessary to determine if the decays are energetically allowed\nand, in fact, ultra-low. We performed precise $\\beta$-decay Q value\nmeasurements of $^{112,113}$Ag and $^{115}$Cd and combined them with nuclear\nenergy level data for the daughter isotopes to determine if the potential UL Q\nvalue $\\beta$-decay branches of $^{112,113}$Ag and $^{115}$Cd are energetically\nallowed and <1 keV.

The properties are inversely determined using only a\nfew experimental tests. Developing composite manufacturing digital twins for\nSFRP composite processes, including injection molding and extrusion deposition\nadditive manufacturing (EDAM) requires extensive experimental material\ncharacterization. In particular, characterizing the composite mechanical\nproperties is time consuming and therefore, micromechanics models are used to\nfully identify the elasticity tensor. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\ninfer the fiber orientation and the effective polymer modulus and therefore,\nidentify the elasticity tensor of the composite with minimal experimental\ntests. To that end, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model coupled with a\nmicromechanics model to infer the fiber orientation and the polymer elastic\nmodulus simultaneously which we then use to estimate the composite elasticity\ntensor.

While observational data\nis confounded, randomized data is unconfounded, but its sample size is usually\ntoo small to learn heterogeneous treatment effects. In this paper, we propose\nto estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining large amounts of\nobservational data and small amounts of randomized data via representation\nlearning. In particular, we introduce a two-step framework: first, we use\nobservational data to learn a shared structure (in form of a representation);\nand then, we use randomized data to learn the data-specific structures. We\nanalyze the finite sample properties of our framework and compare them to\nseveral natural baselines. As such, we derive conditions for when combining\nobservational and randomized data is beneficial, and for when it is not. Based\non this, we introduce a sample-efficient algorithm, called CorNet. We use\nextensive simulation studies to verify the theoretical properties of CorNet and\nmultiple real-world datasets to demonstrate our method's superiority compared\nto existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 18:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

We find an LP-CP separation in the images of\nthe low-$T_{\\rm e}$ disk cases at 230 GHz; namely, the LP flux mainly\noriginates from downstream of the jet and the CP flux comes from the\ncounter-side jet, while the total intensity is maximum at the jet base. This\ncan be understood as follows: although the LP flux is generated through\nsynchrotron emission widely around the black hole, most of the LP flux from the\njet base does not reach the observer, since it undergoes Faraday rotation\n($\\propto T_{\\rm e}^{-2}$) when passing through the outer cold disk and is thus\ndepolarized. Hence, only the LP flux from the downstream (not passing the cold\ndense plasmas) can survive. Meanwhile, the CP flux is generated from the LP\nflux by Faraday conversion ($\\propto T_{\\rm e}$) in the inner hot region.\nStronger CP flux is thus observed from the counter-side jet. Moreover, the\nLP-CP separation is more enhanced at a lower frequency such as 86 GHz but is\nrather weak at 43 GHz, since the media in the latter case is optically thick\nfor synchrotron self-absorption so that all the fluxes should come from the\nphotosphere.

The intent is to compensate for imperfect natural language\nvia visual observations. Early symbolic methods, based on manually defined\nsymbols, built modular framework consist of semantic parsing and task planning\nfor producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern\nconnectionist methods employ deep neural networks to automatically learn visual\nand linguistic features and map to a sequence of low-level actions, in an\nendto-end fashion. These two approaches are blended to create a hybrid, modular\nframework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via\ndeep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners.\nConnectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition\nLanguage. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal\nrepresentation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing\naction sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further\nincorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions.

To facilitate the real-world\napplications of text-to-image synthesis, we focus on studying the following\nthree issues: 1) How to ensure that generated samples are believable, realistic\nor natural? 2) How to exploit the latent space of the generator to edit a\nsynthesized image? 3) How to improve the explainability of a text-to-image\ngeneration framework? In this work, we constructed two novel data sets (i.e.,\nthe Good & Bad bird and face data sets) consisting of successful as well as\nunsuccessful generated samples, according to strict criteria. To effectively\nand efficiently acquire high-quality images by increasing the probability of\ngenerating Good latent codes, we use a dedicated Good/Bad classifier for\ngenerated images. It is based on a pre-trained front end and fine-tuned on the\nbasis of the proposed Good & Bad data set. After that, we present a novel\nalgorithm which identifies semantically-understandable directions in the latent\nspace of a conditional text-to-image GAN architecture by performing independent\ncomponent analysis on the pre-trained weight values of the generator.\nFurthermore, we develop a background-flattening loss (BFL), to improve the\nbackground appearance in the edited image.

An open challenge is DMU in non-stationary environments, where the\ndynamics of the environment can change over time. Reinforcement Learning (RL),\na popular approach for DMU problems, learns a policy by interacting with a\nmodel of the environment offline. Unfortunately, if the environment changes the\npolicy can become stale and take sub-optimal actions, and relearning the policy\nfor the updated environment takes time and computational effort. An alternative\nis online planning approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which\nperform their computation at decision time. Given the current environment, MCTS\nplans using high-fidelity models to determine promising action trajectories.\nThese models can be updated as soon as environmental changes are detected to\nimmediately incorporate them into decision making. However, MCTS's convergence\ncan be slow for domains with large state-action spaces. In this paper, we\npresent a novel hybrid decision-making approach that combines the strengths of\nRL and planning while mitigating their weaknesses. Our approach, called Policy\nAugmented MCTS (PA-MCTS), integrates a policy's actin-value estimates into\nMCTS, using the estimates to seed the action trajectories favored by the\nsearch. We hypothesize that PA-MCTS will converge more quickly than standard\nMCTS while making better decisions than the policy can make on its own when\nfaced with nonstationary environments. We test our hypothesis by comparing\nPA-MCTS with pure MCTS and an RL agent applied to the classical CartPole\nenvironment. We find that PC-MCTS can achieve higher cumulative rewards than\nthe policy in isolation under several environmental shifts while converging in\nsignificantly fewer iterations than pure MCTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 22:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In this study we motivate and explore the role of the\nvolume-averaged root-mean-squared (rms) magnetic coupling term between the\nturbulent, $\\delta\\mathbf{B}$ and large-scale, $\\mathbf{B}_0$ fields, $\\left<\n(\\delta\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}_0)^{2} \\right>^{1/2}_{\\mathcal{V}}$. By\nconsidering the second moments of the energy balance equations we show that the\nrms coupling term is in energy equipartition with the volume-averaged turbulent\nkinetic energy for turbulence with a sub-Alfv\\'enic large-scale field.

The specific objective of this study is to investigate\nsimilarities and differences between two methods that model tumor spread beyond\nthe visible gross tumor volume (GTV): 1. The shortest path model, which is the\nstandard method of adding a geometric GTV-CTV margin, and 2. The\nreaction-diffusion model.\n  Approach: These two models to capture the invisible tumor \"fire front\" are\ndefined and compared in mathematical terms. The models are applied to example\ncases that represent tumor spread in non-uniform and anisotropic media with\nanatomical barriers.\n  Main Results: The two seemingly disparate models bring forth traveling waves\nthat can be associated with the front of tumor growth outward from the GTV. The\nshape of the fronts is similar for both models. Differences are seen in cases\nwhere the diffusive flow is reduced due to anatomical barriers, and in complex\nspatially non-uniform cases. The diffusion model generally leads to smoother\nfronts. The smoothness can be controlled with a parameter defined by the ratio\nof the diffusion coefficient and the proliferation rate.\n  Significance: Defining the CTV has been described as the weakest link of the\nradiotherapy chain. There are many similarities in the mathematical description\nand the behavior of the common geometric GTV-CTV expansion method, and the\ndefinition of the CTV tumor front via the reaction-diffusion model.

As the computing resources of an MEC server are\nlimited, vehicles in the urban area who have abundant idle resources should be\nfully utilized. However, offloading computing tasks to vehicles faces many\nchallenging issues. In this paper, we introduce a vehicular fog-edge computing\nparadigm and formulate it as a multi-stage Stackelberg game to deal with these\nissues. Specifically, vehicles are not obligated to share resources, let alone\ndisclose their private information (e.g., stay time and the amount of\nresources). Therefore, in the first stage, we design a contract-based incentive\nmechanism to motivate vehicles to contribute their idle resources. Next, due to\nthe complicated interactions among vehicles, road-side unit (RSU), MEC server\nand mobile device users, it is challenging to coordinate the resources of all\nparties and design a transaction mechanism to make all entities benefit. In the\nsecond and third stages, based on Stackelberg game, we develop pricing\nstrategies that maximize the utilities of all parties. The analytical forms of\noptimal strategies for each stage are given. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism, reveal the trends of energy\nconsumption and offloading decisions of users with various parameters, and\npresent the performance comparison between our framework and existing MEC\noffloading paradigm in vehicular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 01:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

One of\nthe most popular models is graph attention networks. They were introduced to\nallow a node to aggregate information from features of neighbor nodes in a\nnon-uniform way, in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not\ndistinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we theoretically study the\nbehaviour of graph attention networks. We prove multiple results on the\nperformance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem of node\nclassification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here, the node features\nare obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block\nmodel. We show that in an \"easy\" regime, where the distance between the means\nof the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention is able to distinguish\ninter-class from intra-class edges. Thus it maintains the weights of important\nedges and significantly reduces the weights of unimportant edges. Consequently,\nwe show that this implies perfect node classification. In the \"hard\" regime, we\nshow that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from\ninter-class edges. In addition, we show that graph attention convolution cannot\n(almost) perfectly classify the nodes even if intra-class edges could be\nseparated from inter-class edges. Beyond perfect node classification, we\nprovide a positive result on graph attention's robustness against structural\nnoise in the graph.

It is well-known that\nphotometric stereo (PS) is excellent at recovering high-frequency surface\ndetails, whereas multi-view stereo (MVS) can help remove the low-frequency\ndistortion due to PS and retain the global geometry of the shape. This paper\nproposes an approach that can effectively utilize such complementary strengths\nof PS and MVS. Our key idea is to combine them suitably while considering the\nper-pixel uncertainty of their estimates. To this end, we estimate per-pixel\nsurface normals and depth using an uncertainty-aware deep-PS network and\ndeep-MVS network, respectively. Uncertainty modeling helps select reliable\nsurface normal and depth estimates at each pixel which then act as a true\nrepresentative of the dense surface geometry. At each pixel, our approach\neither selects or discards deep-PS and deep-MVS network prediction depending on\nthe prediction uncertainty measure. For dense, detailed, and precise inference\nof the object's surface profile, we propose to learn the implicit neural shape\nrepresentation via a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Our approach encourages the\nMLP to converge to a natural zero-level set surface using the confident\nprediction from deep-PS and deep-MVS networks, providing superior dense surface\nreconstruction. Extensive experiments on the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark dataset show\nthat our method provides high-quality shape recovery with a much lower memory\nfootprint while outperforming almost all of the existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 05:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 10:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Distinct from decision-making problems, lacking\nthree requirements (a challenging task, a fair environment, and a scientific\nevaluation procedure) makes it strenuous to answer the question. In this\narticle, we first propose the global instance tracking (GIT) task, which is\nsupposed to search an arbitrary user-specified instance in a video without any\nassumptions about camera or motion consistency, to model the human visual\ntracking ability.

However, since there is no manually annotated label for user\ninterests, existing approaches always follow the paradigm of entangling these\ntwo aspects, which may lead to inferior recommendation accuracy and\ninterpretability. In this paper, to address it, we propose a Contrastive\nlearning framework to disentangle Long and Short-term interests for\nRecommendation (CLSR) with self-supervision. Specifically, we first propose two\nseparate encoders to independently capture user interests of different time\nscales. We then extract long-term and short-term interests proxies from the\ninteraction sequences, which serve as pseudo labels for user interests. Then\npairwise contrastive tasks are designed to supervise the similarity between\ninterest representations and their corresponding interest proxies. Finally,\nsince the importance of long-term and short-term interests is dynamically\nchanging, we propose to adaptively aggregate them through an attention-based\nnetwork for prediction. We conduct experiments on two large-scale real-world\ndatasets for e-commerce and short-video recommendation. Empirical results show\nthat our CLSR consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models with\nsignificant improvements: GAUC is improved by over 0.01, and NDCG is improved\nby over 4%. Further counterfactual evaluations demonstrate that stronger\ndisentanglement of long and short-term interests is successfully achieved by\nCLSR.

The key obstacle to optimising elevator dispatching is\nthe unpredictable traffic flow of passengers. To address this difficulty, two\nmain features must be optimised: waiting time and journey time.

We present the results of our observations of cosmic GRB 141011A\nand GRB 141104A, compare the parameters obtained in the GBM/Fermi and KONUSWind\nexperiments, and estimate the redshifts and Eiso for the sources of these GRBs.\nThe detectability of GRBs and good agreement between the independent estimates\nof their parameters obtained in various experiments are an important factor of\nthe successful operation of similar detectors onboard the Lomonosov spacecraft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 10:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The reaction between a thermal\nneutron and a 10B atom releases 2 secondary particles, namely a 7Li ion and an\nalpha particle, which due to momentum conservation are emitted in opposite\ndirections, along the same line (back to back). Current boron coated neutron\ndetectors are equipped with 10B films with thicknesses of several micrometers,\ndeposited on very thick substrate plates. However, since the ranges of the 7Li\nion and the alpha particle are of few micrometeres in most materials, one of\nthese particles is always lost in the 10B layer or substrate. As such, these\ndetectors lose the ability to reconstruct the reaction line of action and to\nprecisely determine the neutron position, as only one of the two secondary\nparticles track can be measured. With the technique now presented, the sum of\nthe 10B layer and the substrate thicknesses is small enough to allow for both\nsecondary particles to escape and ionize the gas in opposite sides of the 10B\nconverter foil. Independent readout structures, one on each side of the 10B\nconverter foil, detect each secondary particle and determine its track centroid\nand the deposited energy. Since the two secondary particles are emitted back to\nback, the neutron position can be obtained by combining the information\nrecorded by the two readout structures. Through GEANT4 simulations, we verified\nthat the spatial resolution can be significantly improved: our results show\nthat, by using a B4C layer with a thickness of 1 micron on a 0.9 micron Mylar\nsubstrate, the spatial resolution can by improved by a factor of 8, compared to\nconventional detectors with thick 10B detection layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Most of the existing methods assume that a reliable\nmulti-modal training set with accurately matched text-image pairs is existing.\nHowever, this assumption may not always hold since the multi-modal training\nsets may include noisy pairs (i.e., textual descriptions/captions associated to\ntraining images can be noisy), distorting the learning process of the retrieval\nmethods. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal\nhashing method robust to the noisy image-text correspondences (CHNR).

This situation also applies to image quality assessment\n(IQA). Although recent no-reference (NR-IQA) methods have made great progress\nto predict image quality free from the reference image, they still have the\npotential to achieve better performance since HQ image information is not fully\nexploited. In contrast, full-reference (FR-IQA) methods tend to provide more\nreliable quality evaluation, but its practicability is affected by the\nrequirement for pixel-level aligned reference images. To address this, we\nfirstly propose the content-variant reference method via knowledge distillation\n(CVRKD-IQA). Specifically, we use non-aligned reference (NAR) images to\nintroduce various prior distributions of high-quality images. The comparisons\nof distribution differences between HQ and LQ images can help our model better\nassess the image quality. Further, the knowledge distillation transfers more\nHQ-LQ distribution difference information from the FR-teacher to the\nNAR-student and stabilizing CVRKD-IQA performance. Moreover, to fully mine the\nlocal-global combined information, while achieving faster inference speed, our\nmodel directly processes multiple image patches from the input with the\nMLP-mixer. Cross-dataset experiments verify that our model can outperform all\nNAR/NR-IQA SOTAs, even reach comparable performance with FR-IQA methods on some\noccasions.

Most previous works restore such\nmissing details in the image space. To cope with the high diversity of natural\nimages, they either rely on the unstable GANs that are difficult to train and\nprone to artifacts, or resort to explicit references from high-resolution (HR)\nimages that are usually unavailable. In this work, we propose Feature Matching\nSR (FeMaSR), which restores realistic HR images in a much more compact feature\nspace. Unlike image-space methods, our FeMaSR restores HR images by matching\ndistorted LR image {\\it features} to their distortion-free HR counterparts in\nour pretrained HR priors, and decoding the matched features to obtain realistic\nHR images. Specifically, our HR priors contain a discrete feature codebook and\nits associated decoder, which are pretrained on HR images with a Vector\nQuantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN). Notably, we incorporate a\nnovel semantic regularization in VQGAN to improve the quality of reconstructed\nimages. For the feature matching, we first extract LR features with an LR\nencoder consisting of several Swin Transformer blocks and then follow a simple\nnearest neighbour strategy to match them with the pretrained codebook. In\nparticular, we equip the LR encoder with residual shortcut connections to the\ndecoder, which is critical to the optimization of feature matching loss and\nalso helps to complement the possible feature matching errors. Experimental\nresults show that our approach produces more realistic HR images than previous\nmethods.

However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination\nconditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using\nsynthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the\ndrawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain\ngap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average\nperformance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source\ndomain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step\nframework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the\ndomain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized\nimages are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to\nthe same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain\ngap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a\nstyle mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed\nto construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain\ngeneralized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without\nprior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based\non extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA $\\to$\nCityscapes, GTAV $\\to$ Cityscapes while setting new SoTA on GTAV $\\to$ Dark\nZurich and GTAV $\\to$ Night Driving benchmarks without retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 13:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Even between type-safe languages, disparate\nfeatures frustrate interoperability, as invariants from one language can easily\nbe violated in the other. In their seminal 2007 paper, Matthews and Findler\nproposed a multi-language construction that augments the interoperating\nlanguages with a pair of boundaries that allow code from one language to be\nembedded in the other. While the technique has been widely applied, their\nsyntactic source-level interoperability doesn't reflect practical\nimplementations, where behavior of interaction is defined after compilation to\na common target, and any safety must be ensured by target invariants or\ninserted target-level \"glue code.\"\n  In this paper, we present a framework for the design and verification of\nsound language interoperability that follows an\ninteroperation-after-compilation strategy. Language designers specify what data\ncan be converted between types of the languages via a relation $\\tau_A \\sim\n\\tau_B$ and specify target glue code implementing conversions.

DBS is a surgical treatment\ninvolving the implantation of a medical probe inside the brain. For such\napplication, the EIT reconstruction method has to offer both high quality and\nrobustness against noise.

The reconstruction\nmethod is a two-steps method, the first solves the inverse problem with a\nlinear algorithm and the second brings the nonlinear aspects back into the\nimage.

With very\nlimited amounts of additional speech, we show that these models can be further\nimproved to perform at levels close to similar systems built on the full speech\ndatasets. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated on both intent\nand entity tasks using three different SLU datasets. With text-only training,\nthe proposed system achieves up to 90% of the performance possible with full\nspeech training.

These representatives belong to political parties,\nand the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the\nelected district representatives. In most systems, each elector can express\npreference for one candidate, though they may have a complete or partial\nranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead to situations\nwhere many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not\ndesirable in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a\nparticular party, and against others. Inspired by current literature on\nfairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures of fairness to\nquantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.\nWe also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules\nand rank aggregation, to enable voters to express their detailed preferences\nwithout making the electoral process cumbersome or opaque.
