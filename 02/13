The photometric\ngranulation/oscillation parameters scale with stellar parameters and they can\nalso make predictions for corresponding parameters in radial velocity\nmeasurements. Based on scaling relations, we simulate realistic radial velocity\ntime series and examine how the root-mean-square scatter of radial velocity\nmeasurements varies with stellar parameters and different observation\nstrategies such as the length of integration time and gaps in the time series.\nUsing stars with extensive spectroscopic observations from the spectrographs\n(SONG and HARPS), we measure the granulation amplitude and timescale from the\npower spectrum of the radial velocity time series. We compare these\nmeasurements with literature values based on Kepler photometry. We find that\nthe granulation amplitude in radial velocity can be well predicted from the\nphotometry and scaling relations. Both granulation timescales in radial\nvelocity agree with those predicted from photometry for giants and sub-giants.\nHowever, for main-sequence stars, only one granulation timescale in radial\nvelocity is in agreement with the photometric-based values, while the other\ntimescale generally lies at lower frequencies compared to the result of\nphotometry.

A wide-spread solution reinforces the GNN aggregation process with\nneighbor selectors according to original node features. This method may carry\nlimitations when identifying fraudsters not only with the relation camouflage,\nbut with the feature camouflage making them hard to distinguish from their\nlegitimate neighbors.

First, the equations are\nlinearized near the critical coupling $K=J/k_BT=2/\\pi$. An exact solution of\nthe linearized equations confirms that a finite-size Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)\ntransition occurs in the presence of weak fourfold anisotropy, and that an\nIsing transition occurs for strong anisotropy. The behaviour of a given system\nis determined by the product of an anisotropy parameter and the logarithm of\nthe system size. The linearized RG equations are not quantitatively reliable\nacross the full temperature range of the finite-size transition, but they\ndefine the parameter space where a second approach, where the fourfold\nanisotropy is treated as a perturbation, is valid. This perturbative treatment\nprovides a quantitative determination of the renormalized exchange coupling,\nvortex density, and anisotropy throughout the transition. In particular, the\ncoupling has a universal point of inflection where vortex-antivortex pairs\nunbind (as opposed to a \"universal jump\"), and goes to zero asymptotically in\nthe paramagnetic state, as is expected for a finite system. These results are\nused to calculate the magnetic susceptibility as the system moves from one\ndominated by spin waves to one dominated by a free vortex gas.

Recently, prior works for user behavior\nprediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information.\nHowever, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge\nbetween users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we\nexplore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user\nbehavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to\nembrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill\nthis setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users\nis scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over\ntime. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal\nEvent (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user\nrepresentations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in\nthe whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities\ncentrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise\npropagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate\nabundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates\nretrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture\nevolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction. Empirically,\nextensive experiments on both the public benchmark and four real-world\nindustrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETE method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 19:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Furthermore, some of the common\nSDP scenarios like predicting the number of defects in a module (Defect-count)\nin Cross-version and Cross-project SDP contexts remain unexplored. Such lack of\nclear directive on the effectiveness of SNA metrics when compared to the widely\nused code metrics prevents us from potentially building better performing SDP\nmodels. Therefore, through a case study of 9 open source software projects\nacross 30 versions, we study the relative effectiveness of SNA metrics when\ncompared to code metrics across 3 commonly used SDP contexts (Within-project,\nCross-version and Cross-project) and scenarios (Defect-count,\nDefect-classification (classifying if a module is defective) and Effort-aware\n(ranking the defective modules w.r.t to the involved effort)). We find the SNA\nmetrics by themselves or along with code metrics improve the performance of SDP\nmodels over just using code metrics on 5 out of the 9 studied SDP scenarios\n(three SDP scenarios across three SDP contexts). However, we note that in some\ncases the improvements afforded by considering SNA metrics over or alongside\ncode metrics might only be marginal, whereas in other cases the improvements\ncould be potentially large. Based on these findings we suggest that the future\nwork should: consider SNA metrics alongside code metrics in their SDP models;\nas well as consider Ego metrics and Global metrics, the two different types of\nthe SNA metrics separately when training SDP models as they behave differently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 21:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

A key challenge for this task lies in the large amount\nof types and the scarcity of annotated data per type. Existing systems\nformulate the task as a multi-way classification problem and train directly or\ndistantly supervised classifiers. This causes two issues: (i) the classifiers\ndo not capture the type semantics since types are often converted into indices;\n(ii) systems developed in this way are limited to predicting within a\npre-defined type set, and often fall short of generalizing to types that are\nrarely seen or unseen in training. This work presents LITE, a new approach that\nformulates entity typing as a natural language inference (NLI) problem, making\nuse of (i) the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type information\nmeaningfully represented as textual hypotheses and alleviate the data scarcity\nissue, as well as (ii) a learning-to-rank objective to avoid the pre-defining\nof a type set. Experiments show that, with limited training data, LITE obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance on the UFET task. In addition, LITE demonstrates\nits strong generalizability, by not only yielding best results on other\nfine-grained entity typing benchmarks, more importantly, a pre-trained LITE\nsystem works well on new data containing unseen types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 23:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In this paper, we present a new AI-based non-intrusive\nreduced-order model within a domain decomposition framework (AI-DDNIROM) which\nis capable of making predictions for domains significantly larger than the\ndomain used in training. This is achieved by using domain decomposition;\ndimensionality reduction; training a neural network to make predictions for a\nsingle subdomain; and by using an iteration-by-subdomain technique to converge\nthe solution over the whole domain.

Routing approaches for deformable\nobjects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g.,\nLearning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the\nenvironment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely\nseparate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing\nand manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of\nplanning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional\nobjects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes\na compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online\nrouting. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition\nof the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the\ndeformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the\nrouting problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence\nmatching method that calculates the next routing move.

However, most existing OSDA approaches are limited\ndue to three main reasons, including: (1) the lack of essential theoretical\nanalysis of generalization bound, (2) the reliance on the coexistence of source\nand target data during adaptation, and (3) failing to accurately estimate the\nuncertainty of model predictions. We propose a Progressive Graph Learning (PGL)\nframework that decomposes the target hypothesis space into the shared and\nunknown subspaces, and then progressively pseudo-labels the most confident\nknown samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. Moreover, we\ntackle a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA)\nsetting that makes no assumption about the coexistence of source and target\ndomains, and introduce a balanced pseudo-labeling (BP-L) strategy in a\ntwo-stage framework, namely SF-PGL. Different from PGL that applies a\nclass-agnostic constant threshold for all target samples for pseudo-labeling,\nthe SF-PGL model uniformly selects the most confident target instances from\neach category at a fixed ratio. The confidence thresholds in each class are\nregarded as the 'uncertainty' of learning the semantic information, which are\nthen used to weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. We conducted\nunsupervised and semi-supervised OSDA and SF-OSDA experiments on the benchmark\nimage classification and action recognition datasets. Additionally, we find\nthat balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving\ncalibration, which makes the trained model less prone to over-confident or\nunder-confident predictions on the target data.

We have seen several studies attempting to learn\nhierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models\nhave not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is\nnot stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term\nsymbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use\ncontrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining\nits difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an\noff-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a\nhierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g.,\nan 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones\n(e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range).

This review is\ndedicated to the framework of quintessential inflation, with a focus on the\nbuilding blocks of formalism. Consistent unification of inflation and late time\nacceleration using a single scalar field asks for a shallow field potential\ninitially followed by steep behaviour thereafter and shallow again around the\npresent epoch. The requirement of non-interference of scalar field with thermal\nhistory dictates steep nature of potential in the post-inflationary era, with a\nfurther restriction that late time physics be independent of initial\nconditions. We describe, in detail the scaling and asymptotic scaling solutions\nand the mechanism of exit from the scaling regime to late time acceleration.\nReview includes a fresh look at scaling solutions which are central to the\ntheme of unification of inflation and late time acceleration.

In order to reduce the\ninfluence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph\ncollaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods\ntypically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the\nneighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the\npotential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above\nissue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named\nNeighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly\nincorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we\nintroduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and\nsemantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction\ngraph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users\n(or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In\nimplementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors\ncorrespond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the\npotential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with\nsimilar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate\nthese semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed\nNCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph\ncollaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17%\nperformance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on\nthe Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively.

One of the most important thin\ncurrent sheet characteristics is the preponderance of electron currents driven\nby strong polarized electric fields, which are commonly observed in the Earth's\nmagnetotail well before the reconnection. We use particle-in-cell simulations\nto investigate magnetic reconnection in the 2D magnetotail current sheet with a\nfinite magnetic field component normal to the current sheet and with the\ncurrent sheet polarization. Under the same external driving conditions,\nreconnection in a polarized current sheet is shown to occur at a lower rate\nthan in a nonpolarized current sheet. The reconnection rate in a polarized\ncurrent sheet decreases linearly as the electron current's contribution to the\ncross-tail current increases. In simulations with lower background temperature\nthe reconnection electric field is higher. We demonstrate that after\nreconnection in such a polarized current sheet, the outflow energy flux is\nmostly in the form of ion enthalpy flux, followed by electron enthalpy flux,\nPoynting flux, ion kinetic energy flux and electron kinetic energy flux. These\nfindings are consistent with spacecraft observations.

However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other\ngeneric scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving\nmultiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads,\nwhich may exactly serve user's search intent; secondly, it needs to retrieve\nhigh-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we\npresent a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for\nBing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation\nand contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the\ncapability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling\nknowledge from the ``relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the\ncapability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to\ndiscriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes\nare jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads\nof high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides\nthe learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline\nbuilt upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be\nperformed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in\nhigh-quality. We make comprehensive offline and online experiments to evaluate\nthe proposed techniques, whose findings may provide useful insights for the\nfuture development of EBR systems. Uni-Retriever has been mainstreamed as the\nmajor retrieval path in Bing's production thanks to the notable improvements on\nthe representation and EBR serving quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 05:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

A major\ndifficulty of the KAM proof is the presence of a zero normal mode frequency,\nwhich is due to the conservation of the angular momentum. The key novelty to\novercome this degeneracy is to perform a perturbative symplectic reduction of\nthe angular momentum, introducing it as a symplectic variable in the spirit of\nthe Darboux-Carath\\'eodory theorem of symplectic rectification, valid in finite\ndimension.

Consequently, there have been substantial\nresearch efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no\nresearch has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With\nincreased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media\nplatforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as text data.\nNevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and\noffensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities,\ni.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the\nmost essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker's\nemotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our\ncurrent research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal\ndeep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion\nand the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate\nthat incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over\ntext-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content.

This problem has crucial applications in\nvarious contexts such as viral marketing or controlling the propagation of\nvirus or rumours in real-world networks. Existing approaches for vital node\nidentification mainly focus on capturing the importance of a node through a\nmathematical expression which directly relates structural properties of the\nnode to its vitality. Although these heuristic approaches have achieved good\nperformance in practice, they have weak adaptability, and their performance is\nlimited to specific settings and certain dynamics. Inspired by the power of\nmachine learning models for efficiently capturing different types of patterns\nand relations, we propose a machine learning-based, data driven approach for\nvital node identification. The main idea is to train the model with a small\nportion of the graph, say 0.5% of the nodes, and do the prediction on the rest\nof the nodes. The ground-truth vitality for the train data is computed by\nsimulating the SIR diffusion method starting from the train nodes. We use\ncollective feature engineering where each node in the network is represented by\nincorporating elements of its connectivity, degree and extended coreness.\nSeveral machine learning models are trained on the node representations, but\nthe best results are achieved by a Support Vector Regression machine with RBF\nkernel.

Previous methods mainly utilize the\nsimilarity decomposition and the associativity of matrix multiplication to\ndevise linear-time attention mechanisms. They avoid degeneration of attention\nto a trivial distribution by reintroducing inductive biases such as the\nlocality, thereby at the expense of model generality and expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we linearize Transformers free from specific inductive biases based\non the flow network theory. We cast attention as the information flow\naggregated from the sources (values) to the sinks (results) through the learned\nflow capacities (attentions). Within this framework, we apply the property of\nflow conservation into attention and propose the Flow-Attention mechanism of\nlinear complexity. By respectively conserving the incoming flow of sinks for\nsource competition and the outgoing flow of sources for sink allocation,\nFlow-Attention inherently generates informative attentions without using\nspecific inductive biases.

Due to the complex tree-like structure of the airway, preserving its\ntopology completeness while maintaining the segmentation accuracy is a\nchallenging task.\n  Methods: In this paper, a long-term slice propagation (LTSP) method is\nproposed for accurate airway segmentation from pathological CT scans.

The broad attention is implemented by broad\nconnection and parameter-free attention. Broad connection of each transformer\nlayer promotes the transmission and integration of information for BViT.\nWithout introducing additional trainable parameters, parameter-free attention\njointly focuses on the already available attention information in different\nlayers for extracting useful information and building their relationship.\nExperiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that BViT delivers\nstate-of-the-art accuracy of 74.8\\%/81.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with\n5M/22M parameters.

However, writing tests for Scratch programs can be\nchallenging: The game-like and randomised nature of typical Scratch programs\nmakes it difficult to identify specific timed input sequences used to control\nthe programs. Furthermore, precise test assertions to check the resulting\nprogram states are incompatible with the fundamental principle of creative\nfreedom in programming in Scratch, where correct program behaviour may be\nimplemented with deviations in the graphical appearance or timing of the\nprogram.

Among these maps, the particle-based map offers a\nsolid theoretical basis and the ability to model complex-shaped obstacles.\nCurrent particle-based maps describe the occupancy status in discrete grid form\nand suffer from the grid size problem, namely: large grid size is unfavorable\nfor path planning while small grid size lowers efficiency and causes gaps and\ninconsistencies. To tackle this problem, this paper generalizes the\nparticle-based map into continuous space and builds an efficient 3D local map.\nA dual-structure subspace division paradigm, composed of a voxel subspace\ndivision and a novel pyramid-like subspace division, is proposed to propagate\nparticles and update the map efficiently with the consideration of occlusions.\nThe occupancy status of an arbitrary point can then be estimated with the\ncardinality expectation. To reduce the noise in modeling static and dynamic\nobstacles simultaneously, an initial velocity estimation approach and a mixture\nmodel are utilized. Experimental results show that our map can effectively and\nefficiently model both dynamic obstacles and static obstacles.

The key to the GNNs\nis adopting the neural message-passing paradigm with two stages: aggregation\nand update. The current design of GNNs considers the topology information in\nthe aggregation stage. However, in the updating stage, all nodes share the same\nupdating function. The identical updating function treats each node embedding\nas i.i.d. random variables and thus ignores the implicit relationships between\nneighborhoods, which limits the capacity of the GNNs. The updating function is\nusually implemented with a linear transformation followed by a non-linear\nactivation function. To make the updating function topology-aware, we inject\nthe topological information into the non-linear activation function and propose\nGraph-adaptive Rectified Linear Unit (GReLU), which is a new parametric\nactivation function incorporating the neighborhood information in a novel and\nefficient way.

Hence, a\nsimple image-based VV estimation method is proposed.\n  As the validation of the proposed model, this paper focuses on describing the\nfact that the motion sickness increases as a passenger reads a book while using\nan AMPV, assuming that visual vertical (VV) plays an important role. In the\nstatic experiment, it is demonstrated that the estimated VV by the proposed\nmethod accurately described the gravitational acceleration direction with a low\nmean absolute deviation. In addition, the results of the driving experiment\nusing an APMV demonstrated that the proposed 6 DoF SVC-VV model could describe\nthat the increased motion sickness experienced when the VV and gravitational\nacceleration directions were different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 04:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 01:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 11:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Our lighting model builds 128 evenly\ndistributed SGs over the indoor panorama, where each SG encoding the lighting\nand the depth around that node. The proposed GCN then learns the mapping from\nthe input image to DSGLight. Compared with existing lighting models, our\nDSGLight encodes both direct lighting and indirect environmental lighting more\nfaithfully and compactly.

This is due to a smaller number of physical processes\naffecting the signal, and a larger ratio of the amplitude of the planetary\nsignal to the stellar signal. A few high-precision astrometric missions have\ntherefore been proposed over the past two decades. We aim to re-estimate the\ndetection limits in astrometry for the nearby stars which are the main targets\nproposed for the THEIA astrometric mission, the most elaborate mission to\nsearch for planets, and to characterise its performance. This analysis is\nperformed for the 55 F-G-K stars in the THEIA sample. We used realistic\nsimulations of stellar activity and selected those that correspond best to each\nstar in terms of spectral type and average activity level. Then, we performed\nblind tests to estimate the performance. We find worse detection limits\ncompared to those previously obtained for that sample based on a careful\nanalysis of the false positive rate, with values in the Earth-mass regime for\nmost stars of the sample. The difference is attributed to the fact that we\nanalysed full time series, adapted to each star in the sample, rather than\nusing the expected solar jitter only. Although these detection limits have a\nrelatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the fitted parameters have small\nuncertainties. We confirm the low impact of stellar activity on exoplanet\ndetectability for solar-type stars, although it plays a significant role for\nthe closest stars such as alpha Cen A and B. However, for the few stars in the\nsample with a habitable zone corresponding to long periods, namely subgiants,\nthe THEIA observational strategy is not well adapted and should prevent the\ndetection of planets in the habitable zone, unless a longer mission can be\nproposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 12:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Here, we propose a novel deep asymmetric attributed network\nembedding model based on convolutional graph neural network, called AAGCN. The\nmain idea is to maximally preserve the asymmetric proximity and asymmetric\nsimilarity of directed attributed networks. AAGCN introduces two neighbourhood\nfeature aggregation schemes to separately aggregate the features of a node with\nthe features of its in- and out- neighbours. Then, it learns two embedding\nvectors for each node, one source embedding vector and one target embedding\nvector. The final representations are the results of concatenating source and\ntarget embedding vectors.

We show that\nat total network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\\rho=20(50)$, individual Type-II\nimages should be identifiable with log Bayes factor $\\ln \\mathcal{B} > 2$ for\ninclinations $ \\iota > 5 \\pi/12 (\\pi/3) $. Furthermore, based on the trends we\nobserve in these results we predict that, at high SNRs ($\\gtrsim 100$),\nindividual Type-II images would be identifiable even when the inclination angle\nis much lower ($\\sim \\pi/6$). We then show that neglecting physical effects\narising from these identifiable Type-II images can significantly bias estimates\nof parameters (such as sky location, distance, inclination, etc.), and\nsometimes lead to fully inaccurate measurement of these parameters. Thus, in\nthe future, using Type-II lensed template for such signals would be necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 14:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

The ROM is constructed in the\nsame way as the full-order model (FOM) applying proper orthogonal decomposition\n(POD) with the Galerkin projection. The reduced-order system has the same\nstructure as the FOM, and preserves the discrete reduced global energy.\nApplying the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), the reduced-order\nsolutions are computed efficiently in the online stage. A priori error bound is\nderived for the DEIM approximation to the nonlinear Hamiltonian. The accuracy\nand computational efficiency of the ROMs are demonstrated for the Korteweg de\nVries (KdV) equation, Zakharov-Kuznetzov (ZK) equation, and nonlinear\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger (NLS) equation in multi-symplectic form. Preservation of the\nreduced energies shows that the reduced-order solutions ensure the long-term\nstability of the solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 14:38:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 08:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

To address limitations of\nthe evaluated research, experiments were conducted on three markets in\ndifferent economies with different overall trends. By incorporating specific\ninvestor preferences into our RL models' reward functions, a more comprehensive\ncomparison could be made to traditional methods in risk-return space.\nTransaction costs were also modelled more realistically by including nonlinear\nchanges introduced by market volatility and trading volume. The results of this\nstudy suggest that there can be an advantage to using RL methods compared to\ntraditional convex mean-variance optimisation methods under certain market\nconditions. Our RL models could significantly outperform traditional\nsingle-period optimisation (SPO) and multi-period optimisation (MPO) models in\nupward trending markets, but only up to specific risk limits. In sideways\ntrending markets, the performance of SPO and MPO models can be closely matched\nby our RL models for the majority of the excess risk range tested. The specific\nmarket conditions under which these models could outperform each other\nhighlight the importance of a more comprehensive comparison of Pareto optimal\nfrontiers in risk-return space. These frontiers give investors a more granular\nview of which models might provide better performance for their specific risk\ntolerance or return targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 10:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Given their constrained resources, it\nbecomes a great challenge to achieve high execution performance for FEL. Most\nof the state-of-the-arts concentrate on enhancing FEL from the perspective of\nsystem operation procedures, taking few precautions during the composition step\nof the FEL system. Though a few recent studies recognize the importance of FEL\nformation and propose server-centric device selection schemes, the impact of\ndata sizes is largely overlooked. In this paper, we take advantage of game\ntheory to depict the decision dilemma among edge devices regarding whether to\nparticipate in FEL or not given their heterogeneous sizes of local datasets.\nFor realizing both the individual and global optimization, the server is\nemployed to solve the participation dilemma, which requires accurate\ninformation collection for devices' local datasets. Hence, we utilize mechanism\ndesign to enable truthful information solicitation. With the help of correlated\nequilibrium, we derive a decision making strategy for devices from the global\nperspective, which can achieve the long-term stability and efficacy of FEL. For\nscalability consideration, we optimize the computational complexity of the\nbasic solution to the polynomial level. Lastly, extensive experiments based on\nboth real and synthetic data are conducted to evaluate our proposed mechanisms,\nwith experimental results demonstrating the performance advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 22:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}
