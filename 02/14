We extend this seminal work to the\ncase where the number of active users is random and unknown a priori. We define\na random-access code accounting for both misdetection (MD) and false alarm\n(FA), and derive a random-coding achievability bound for the Gaussian multiple\naccess channel. Our bound captures the fundamental trade-off between MD and FA.\nIt suggests that the lack of knowledge of the number of active users entails a\nsmall penalty in energy efficiency when the target MD and FA probabilities are\nhigh. However, as the target MD and FA probabilities decrease, the energy\nefficiency penalty becomes significant. For example, in a typical IoT scenario,\nthe required energy per bit to achieve both MD and FA probabilities below 0.1,\npredicted by our bound, is only 0.5-0.7 dB higher than that predicted by the\nbound in Polyanskiy (2017) for a known number of active users. This gap\nincreases to 3-4 dB when the target MD and/or FA probability is 0.001. Taking\nboth MD and FA into account, we use our bound to benchmark the energy\nefficiency of slotted ALOHA with multi-packet reception, of a decoder that\ntreats interference as noise, and of some recently proposed coding schemes.\nNumerical results suggest that, when the target MD and FA probabilities are\nhigh, it is effective to estimate the number of active users, then treat this\nestimate as the true value, and use a coding scheme that performs well for the\ncase of known number of active users. However, this approach becomes energy\ninefficient when the requirements on MD and FA probabilities are stringent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 17:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by\napplying it to a personalized multi-class classification task based on the\nReddit dataset, and achieve 9% and 30% relative improvement on prediction\naccuracy over a baseline system for two experiment settings through appropriate\ncomment history encoding and task modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 17:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

However, in\nreal-world scenarios, audios are usually contaminated by off-screen sound and\nbackground noise. They will interfere with the procedure of identifying desired\nsources and building visual-sound connections, making previous studies\nnon-applicable. In this work, we propose the Interference Eraser (IEr)\nframework, which tackles the problem of audio-visual sound source localization\nin the wild. The key idea is to eliminate the interference by redefining and\ncarving discriminative audio representations. Specifically, we observe that the\nprevious practice of learning only a single audio representation is\ninsufficient due to the additive nature of audio signals. We thus extend the\naudio representation with our Audio-Instance-Identifier module, which clearly\ndistinguishes sounding instances when audio signals of different volumes are\nunevenly mixed. Then we erase the influence of the audible but off-screen\nsounds and the silent but visible objects by a Cross-modal Referrer module with\ncross-modality distillation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior results on sound\nlocalization tasks, especially under real-world scenarios.

Consequently, there is a\nlarge body of literature on characterizing the likelihood for an election to be\ninfluenced when the votes follow certain distributions, especially the\nlikelihood of being manipulable by a single voter under the i.i.d. uniform\ndistribution, known as the Impartial Culture (IC).\n  In this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we propose a\nmore general semi-random model, where a distribution adversary chooses a\nworst-case distribution and then a contamination adversary modifies up to\n$\\psi$ portion of the data, (2) we consider many coalitional influence\nproblems, including coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various\nvote controls and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition\nsize $B$. Our main theorem provides asymptotically tight bounds on the\nsemi-random likelihood of the existence of a size-$B$ coalition that can\nsuccessfully influence the election under a wide range of voting rules.\nApplications of the main theorem and its proof techniques resolve long-standing\nopen questions about the likelihood of coalitional manipulability under IC, by\nshowing that the likelihood is $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{\\frac{B}{\\sqrt n},\n1\\right\\}\\right)$ for many commonly-studied voting rules.\n  The main technical contribution is a characterization of the semi-random\nlikelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable (PMV) to be unstable, which we\nbelieve to be a general and useful technique with independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 21:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 18:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 18:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Gravity estimates\ncan be used to infer the internal structure and composition of small bodies\nand, as such, have strong implications in the fields of planetary science,\nplanetary defense, and in-situ resource utilization. Current gravimetry\ntechniques at small bodies mostly rely on tracking the spacecraft orbital\nmotion, where the gravity observability is low. To date, only lower-degree and\norder spherical harmonics of small-body gravity fields could be resolved. In\nthis paper, we evaluate gravimetry performance for a novel mission architecture\nwhere artificial probes repeatedly hop across the surface of the small body and\nperform low-altitude, suborbital arcs. Such probes are tracked using optical\nmeasurements from the mothership's onboard camera and orbit determination is\nperformed to estimate the probe trajectories, the small body's rotational\nkinematics, and the gravity field. The suborbital motion of the probes provides\ndense observations at low altitude, where the gravity signal is stronger. We\nassess the impact of observation parameters and mission duration on gravity\nobservability.

However, for cooperative systems to integrate into human-centered\ntraffic, the automated systems must behave human-like so that humans can\nanticipate the system's decisions. While Reinforcement Learning has made\nremarkable progress in solving the decision-making part, it is non-trivial to\nparameterize a reward model that yields predictable actions.

High computational complexity scaling poses\nsignificant challenges, especially in fast-responding network-edge AI\napplications. Fortunately, the convolution theorem can be executed on-the-fly\nin the optical domain via a joint transform correlator (JTC) offering to\nfundamentally reduce the computational complexity. Nonetheless, the iterative\ntwo-step process of a classical JTC renders them unpractical. Here we introduce\na novel implementation of an optical convolution-processor capable of near-zero\nlatency by utilizing all-optical nonlinearity inside a JTC, thus minimizing\nelectronic signal or conversion delay. Fundamentally we show how this nonlinear\nauto-correlator enables reducing the high $O(n^4)$ scaling complexity of\nprocessing two-dimensional data to only $O(n^2)$. Moreover, this optical JTC\nprocesses millions of channels in time-parallel, ideal for large-matrix machine\nlearning tasks. Exemplary utilizing the nonlinear process of four-wave mixing,\nwe show light processing performing a full convolution that is temporally\nlimited only by geometric features of the lens and the nonlinear material's\nresponse time. We further discuss that the all-optical nonlinearity exhibits\ngain in excess of $>10^{3}$ when enhanced by slow-light effects such as\nepsilon-near-zero. Such novel implementation for a machine learning accelerator\nfeaturing low-latency and non-iterative massive data parallelism enabled by\nfundamental reduced complexity scaling bears significant promise for\nnetwork-edge, and cloud AI systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 00:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 00:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The mmWave channel\nconsists of a few spatial clusters each associated with an angle of departure\n(AoD). The narrow beams must be aligned with the channel AoDs to increase the\nbeamforming gain. This is achieved through a procedure called beam alignment\n(BA). Most of the BA schemes in the literature consider channels with a single\ndominant path while in practice the channel has a few resolvable paths with\ndifferent AoDs, hence, such BA schemes may not work correctly in the presence\nof multi-path or at the least do not exploit such multipath to achieve\ndiversity or increase robustness.\n  In this paper, we propose an efficient BA scheme in presence of multi-path.\nThe proposed BA scheme transmits probing packets using a set of scanning beams\nand receives feedback for all the scanning beams at the end of the probing\nphase from each user.

In contrast, mesosiderites rarely contain the olivine\nthat is mainly included in a mantle. Although a giant impact onto a\ndifferentiated asteroid is considered to be a probable mechanism to mix crust\nand metal materials to form mesosiderites, it is not obvious how such a giant\nimpact can form mesosiderite-like materials without including mantle materials.\nWe conducted numerical simulations of giant impacts onto differentiated\nasteroids, using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, to investigate the\ndetailed distribution of mixed materials on the resultant bodies. For the\ninternal structure of a target body, we used a thin-crust model derived from\nthe magma ocean crystallization model of the asteroid Vesta and a thick-crust\nand a large-core model suggested from the proximity observation of Vesta by the\nDawn probe. In the simulations with the former model, excavation of the metal\ncore requires nearly catastrophic impacts and mantle is exposed over large\nsurface areas. Thus, stony-iron materials produced on its surface are likely to\ninclude mantle materials and it is difficult to produce mesosiderite-like\nmaterials. Conversely, in the simulations with the latter model, mantle\nmaterials are exposed only at impact sites, even when the impacts excavate the\nmetal core, and the formation of a surface with little mantle material and the\nformation of mesosiderite-like materials are possible. Therefore, our\nsimulations suggest that an internal structure with a thick crust and a large\ncore is more likely as a mesosiderite parent body rather than the thin-crust\ninternal structure inferred from the conventional magma ocean model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 05:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Their success in maintaining computation efficiency\nis mainly attributed to avoiding the use of self-attention that is often\ncomputationally heavy, yet this is at the expense of not being able to mix\ntokens both globally and locally. In this paper, to exploit both global and\nlocal dependencies without self-attention, we present Mix-Shift-MLP (MS-MLP)\nwhich makes the size of the local receptive field used for mixing increase with\nrespect to the amount of spatial shifting. In addition to conventional mixing\nand shifting techniques, MS-MLP mixes both neighboring and distant tokens from\nfine- to coarse-grained levels and then gathers them via a shifting operation.\nThis directly contributes to the interactions between global and local tokens.\nBeing simple to implement, MS-MLP achieves competitive performance in multiple\nvision benchmarks. For example, an MS-MLP with 85 million parameters achieves\n83.8% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Moreover, by combining\nMS-MLP with state-of-the-art Vision Transformers such as the Swin Transformer,\nwe show MS-MLP achieves further improvements on three different model scales,\ne.g., by 0.5% on ImageNet-1K classification with Swin-B.

Specifically, we analyze\nimplementable $k$-qubit unitary operations over a certain class of networks,\ncalled cluster networks. We show that any two-qubit unitary operation is\nimplementable over the butterfly network and the grail network, which are\nfundamental primitive networks for network coding.

Furthermore, we prove that $\\mu_{\\mathscr{G}}^+$ is supported on\nthe whole of $\\mathcal{J}_{\\mathcal{S}}^+$ and is also the unique positive\nclosed $(1,1)$-current supported on $\\mathcal{J}_{\\mathcal{S}}^+$, satisfying a\nsemi-invariance relation that depends on the generating set ${\\mathscr{G}}$.\n  Secondly, we study the dynamics of a non-autonomous sequence of H\\'{e}non\nmaps, say $\\{h_k\\}$, contained in the semigroup $\\mathcal{S}$. Similarly, as\nabove, here too, we construct the non-autonomous dynamical positive and\nnegative Green's function and the corresponding dynamical Green's currents.\nFurther, we use the properties of Green's function to conclude that the\nnon-autonomous attracting basin of any such sequence $\\{h_k\\}$, sharing a\ncommon attracting fixed point, is biholomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^2.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 07:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 13:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 05:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

We leverage the natural heterogeneity of\nVisual Genome and its annotations to construct MetaShift. The key construction\nidea is to cluster images using its metadata, which provides context for each\nimage (e.g. \"cats with cars\" or \"cats in bathroom\") that represent distinct\ndata distributions. MetaShift has two important benefits: first, it contains\norders of magnitude more natural data shifts than previously available. Second,\nit provides explicit explanations of what is unique about each of its data sets\nand a distance score that measures the amount of distribution shift between any\ntwo of its data sets. We demonstrate the utility of MetaShift in benchmarking\nseveral recent proposals for training models to be robust to data shifts.

Unlike conventional\nfeed-forward DNNs, RNNs remember past information to improve the accuracy of\nfuture predictions and, therefore, they are very effective for sequence\nprocessing problems. For each application run, recurrent layers are executed\nmany times for processing a potentially large sequence of inputs (words,\nimages, audio frames, etc.). In this paper, we observe that the output of a\nneuron exhibits small changes in consecutive invocations.~We exploit this\nproperty to build a neuron-level fuzzy memoization scheme, which dynamically\ncaches each neuron's output and reuses it whenever it is predicted that the\ncurrent output will be similar to a previously computed result, avoiding in\nthis way the output computations.\n  The main challenge in this scheme is determining whether the new neuron's\noutput for the current input in the sequence will be similar to a recently\ncomputed result. To this end, we extend the recurrent layer with a much simpler\nBitwise Neural Network (BNN), and show that the BNN and RNN outputs are highly\ncorrelated: if two BNN outputs are very similar, the corresponding outputs in\nthe original RNN layer are likely to exhibit negligible changes. The BNN\nprovides a low-cost and effective mechanism for deciding when fuzzy memoization\ncan be applied with a small impact on accuracy.

Therefore, we develop here an individual-based model for\nthe growth of phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations. In this model, the\nphenotypic state of each cell is described by a structuring variable that\ncaptures intercellular variability in cell proliferation and migration rates.\nThe model tracks the spatial evolutionary dynamics of single cells, which\nundergo pressure-dependent proliferation, heritable phenotypic changes and\ndirectional movement in response to pressure differentials. We formally show\nthat the continuum limit of this model comprises a non-local partial\ndifferential equation for the cell population density, which generalises\nearlier models of growing cell populations. Results of the individual-based\nmodel illustrate how proliferation-migration tradeoffs shaping the evolution of\nsingle cells can lead to the formation of travelling waves at the population\nlevel where highly-mobile cells locally dominate at the invasive front, while\nmore-proliferative cells are found at the rear.

Our results show that additional augmentation improves model\ntransferability when training on few samples/limited tissue types. Models\ntrained with sufficient samples/tissue types do not benefit from our additional\naugmentation policy. Further, the resulting TIL quantification correlates to\npatient prognosis and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art method\nfor immune cell detection in non-small lung cancer (current standard CD8 cells\nin DAB stained TMAs HR 0.34 95% CI 0.17-0.68 vs TILs in HE WSIs: HoVer-Net\nPanNuke Aug Model HR 0.30 95% CI 0.15-0.60, HoVer-Net MoNuSAC Aug model HR 0.27\n95% CI 0.14-0.53). Moreover, we implemented a cloud based system to train,\ndeploy and visually inspect machine learning based annotation for H&E slides.\nOur pragmatic approach bridges the gap between machine learning research,\ntranslational clinical research and clinical implementation. However,\nvalidation in prospective studies is needed to assert that the method works in\na clinical setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 10:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Current approaches are\neither manual or semi-automatic and are therefore very time-consuming and prone\nto errors. To automate these tasks, we propose a multi-atlas framework for\nautomatic segmentation and spatial alignment of the embryo using deep learning\nwith minimal supervision. Our framework learns to register the embryo to an\natlas, which consists of the US images acquired at a range of gestational age\n(GA), segmented and spatially aligned to a predefined standard orientation.\nFrom this, we can derive the segmentation of the embryo and put the embryo in\nstandard orientation. US images acquired at 8+0 till 12+6 weeks GA were used\nand eight subjects were selected as atlas. We evaluated different fusion\nstrategies to incorporate multiple atlases: 1) training the framework using\natlas images from a single subject, 2) training the framework with data of all\navailable atlases and 3) ensembling of the frameworks trained per subject. To\nevaluate the performance, we calculated the Dice score over the test set. We\nfound that training the framework using all available atlases outperformed\nensembling and gave similar results compared to the best of all frameworks\ntrained on a single subject.

Therefore, a method for extracting multimodal\nurban traffic scenarios from naturalistic road traffic data in an unsupervised\nmanner, minimizing the amount of (potentially biased) prior expert knowledge,\nis proposed. Rather than an (elaborate) rule-based assignment by extracting\nconcrete scenarios into predefined functional scenarios, the presented method\ndeploys an unsupervised machine learning pipeline. The approach allows\nexploring the unknown nature of the data and their interpretation as test\nscenarios that experts could not have anticipated. The method is evaluated for\nnaturalistic road traffic data at urban intersections from the inD and the\nSilicon Valley Intersections datasets. For this purpose, it is analyzed with\nwhich clustering approach (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN) the\nscenario extraction method performs best (referring to an elaborate rule-based\nimplementation). Subsequently, using hierarchical clustering the results show\nboth a jump in overall accuracy of around 20% when moving from 4 to 5 clusters\nand a saturation effect starting at 41 clusters with an overall accuracy of\n84%. These observations can be a valuable contribution in the context of the\ntrade-off between the number of functional scenarios (i.e., clustering\naccuracy) and testing effort.

Optimizing video\ncompression has the potential to increase access and quality of content to\nusers, and reduce energy use and costs overall.

We treat this as a sequential decision making problem to\nmaximize the video quality with an episodic constraint imposed by the target\nbitrate. Notably, we introduce a novel self-competition based reward mechanism\nto solve constrained RL with variable constraint satisfaction difficulty, which\nis challenging for existing constrained RL methods. We demonstrate that the\nMuZero-based rate control achieves an average 6.28% reduction in size of the\ncompressed videos for the same delivered video quality level (measured as PSNR\nBD-rate) compared to libvpx's two-pass VBR rate control policy, while having\nbetter constraint satisfaction behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

We\ninvestigate the situation where the excitation energies of the molecules are\nrandomly distributed with a mean value of $\\epsilon_a$ and variance $\\sigma$.\nFor this case, we find a solution that approaches the exact result for large\nvalues of the number density $\\mathscr{N}$ of the molecules. We find the\nconditions for the existence of the polaritonic states, as well as expressions\nfor their energies. The polaritonic states are quite stable against disorder.\nAnalytical results are verified by comparison with simulations. When\n$\\epsilon_a$ is equal to that of the cavity state $\\epsilon_c$ (on resonance)\nthe gap between the two polaritonic states is found to increase with disorder,\nthe increase being equal to $2 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{N}}|\\tilde{V}|}$\nwhere $\\tilde{V}$ is the coupling of a molecular excitation to the cavity\nstate. An analytic expression is found for the disorder induced width of the\npolaritonic peak. We results for various densities of states, and the\nabsorption spectrum. The dark states that exist in the case $\\sigma=0$ turn\n\"grey\" in presence of disorder with their contribution to the absorption\nincreasing with $\\sigma$. We analyze the effect of including lifetimes of the\ncavity and molecular states and find that in the strong coupling regime, the\nwidth of the polaritonic peaks is dominated by the lifetime effect and that\ndisorder plays almost no role, if the Rabi splitting is sufficiently large. We\nalso consider the case where there is (a) orientational disorder as well as (b)\nspatial variation of the cavity field and find that they effectively amount to\na renormlisation of the coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

However, in case the transfer of\ngenes or other genetic information between the species or their ancestors has\noccurred in the past, a tree may not provide a complete picture of their\nhistory. In such cases,tree-based phylogenetic networks can provide a useful,\nmore refined representation of the species evolution. Such a network is\nessentially a phylogenetic tree with some arcs added between the tree edges so\nas to represent reticulate events such as gene transfer. Even so, this model\ndoes not permit the representation of evolutionary scenarios where reticulate\nevents have taken place between different subfamilies or lineages of species.\nTo represent such scenarios, in this paper we introduce the notion of a\nforest-based phylogenetic network, that is, a collection of leaf-disjoint\nphylogenetic trees on a set of species with arcs added between the edges of\ndistinct trees within the collection. Forest-based networks include the\nrecently introduced class of overlaid species forests which are used to model\nintrogression. As we shall see, even though the definition of forest-based\nnetworks is closely related to that of tree-based networks, they lead to new\nmathematical theory which complements that of tree-based networks. As well as\nstudying the relationship of forest-based networks with other classes of\nphylogenetic networks, such as tree-child networks and universal tree-based\nnetworks, we present some characterizations of some special classes of\nforest-based networks. We expect that our results will be useful for developing\nnew models and algorithms to understand reticulate evolution, such as gene\ntransfer between collections of bacteria that live in different environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Instead of using a fixed virtual\nmachine (VM) infrastructure, which can incur considerable costs to operate and\nrun, serverless platforms support short computations, triggered on demand, with\ncost proportional to fine-grain function execution time. However, serverless\nplatforms offer a restricted execution environment. For example, functions have\nlimited execution times, limited resources, and no support for networking\nbetween functions. In this paper, we explore what it takes to treat serverless\nplatforms as short-lived, general purpose data-centers which can execute\nunmodified existing applications. As a first step in this quest, we have\ndeveloped Boxer, a system providing an execution environment on top of existing\nfunctions-as-a-service platforms that allows users to seamlessly migrate\nconventional VM-based cloud services to serverless platforms. Boxer allows\ngeneric applications to benefit from the fine-grain elasticity of serverless\nplatforms without having to modify applications to adopt a restrictive\nevent-triggered programming model or orchestrate auxiliary systems for data\ncommunication. We implement Boxer on top of AWS Lambda and extend it to\ntransparently provide standard network interfaces. We describe its\nimplementation and demonstrate how it can be used to run off-the-shelf cloud\napplications with a degree of fine-grained elasticity not available on\ntraditional VM-based platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Points are not allowed to\ntouch each other, they have to be separated by 0-cells, and every 0-cell can\nfind at least one point in its Moore-neighborhood. Probabilistic rules are\ndesigned that can solve this task with asynchronous updating and cyclic\nboundary condition. The task is considered as a tiling problem, where point\ntiles are used to cover the space with overlaps. A point tile consists of a\ncenter pixel (the kernel with value 1) and 8 surrounding pixels forming the\nhull with value 0. The term pixel is used to distinguish the cells of a tile\nfrom the cells of a cellular automaton. For each of the 9 tile pixels a\nso-called template is defined by a shift of the point tile. In the rule\napplication, the 9 templates are tested at the actual cell position. If all\ntemplate pixels (except the central reference pixel) of a template match with\nthe corresponding neighbors of the actual cell under consideration, the cell's\nstate is adjusted to the reference pixel's value. Otherwise the cell is set to\nthe random value 0 or 1 with a certain probability. The hull pixels are allowed\nto overlap. In order to evolve a maximum of points, the overlap between tiles\nhas to be maximized. To do that, the number of template hits is counted.\nDepending on the hit-number, additional noise is injected with certain\nprobabilities. Thereby optimal patterns with the maximum number of points can\nbe evolved. The behavior and performance of the designed rules is evaluated for\ndifferent parameter settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 12:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

However, the applicability of the Hall effect is\nbased on the assumption that the crust does not fail and sustains its rigidity.\nThis assumption can be violated for substantially strong magnetic fields. If\nthis is the case, the evolution of the magnetic field is described by a\ndifferent set of equations, which include the effects of a non-rigid crust. In\nthis talk, after a brief review of the main characteristic of the Hall\nevolution, I will discuss the impact a plastic flow of the crust has on the\nmagnetic field, studying axisymmetric models. Moreover, the way the crust fails\nimpacts the overall evolution, with major differences appearing if the failure\nis local, intermediate or global. Quite remarkably, crustal failure and\nplasticity do not annul the Hall effect, and under certain circumstances they\nmay even lead to a more dramatic evolution. I will discuss the impact of these\neffects in the context of neutron star timing behaviour, with special focus on\ntiming noise, outbursts and glitches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 12:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

We performed two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary discs for a large parameter set of\ndisc viscosities and thicknesses and two different binary mass ratios for\nbinaries on circular orbits. For those we measured carefully the net angular\nmomentum and mass transfer between disc and binary system, and evaluate the\nnormalised specific angular momentum accretion, $j_\\mathrm{s}$ . This is\ncompared to the theoretical, critical specific angular momentum change\n$j_\\mathrm{s,crit}$ that separates contracting from expanding cases which\ndepends on the the binary's mass ratio and the relative accretion onto the two\nstars. Using finite and infinite disc models we show that the inferred binary\nevolution is very similar for both setups and confirm that $j_\\mathrm{s}$ can\nbe measured accurately with cylindrical simulations that do not include the\ncentral binary. However, to obtain the relative accretion onto the stars for\nnon-equal mass binaries, simulations that cover the whole domain including the\nbinary are required.

Surface plasmon polaritons (or\nplasmons) provide subwavelength localization of light, but are affected by\nsignificant losses. On the contrary, dielectrics lack a sufficiently robust\nresponse in the visible to trap photons similar to metallic structures.\nOvercoming these limitations appears elusive, as it implies devising a path to\ncircumvent causality in the quantum-mechanical form of matter. Here we\ndemonstrate that addressing this problem is possible if we employ a novel\napproach based on suitably deformed reflective metaphotonic structures. The\ncomplex geometrical shape engineered in these reflectors emulates nondispersive\nindex responses, which can be inverse-designed following arbitrary form\nfactors. We discuss the realization of essential components such as resonators\nwith an ultra-high refractive index of $n=100$ in diverse profiles.

Taking account of the\nfact that the existing knowledge-driven detection process for FDIAs has been in\na passive detection state for a long time and ignores the advantages of\ndata-driven active capture of features, an active and passive hybrid detection\nmethod for power CPS FDIAs with improved adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. First, we\nanalyze the shortcomings of the traditional AKF algorithm in terms of filtering\ndivergence and calculation speed. The state estimation algorithm based on\nnon-negative positive-definite adaptive Kalman filter (NDAKF) is improved, and\na passive detection method of FDIAs is constructed, with similarity Euclidean\ndistance detection and residual detection at its core. Then, combined with the\nadvantages of gate recurrent unit (GRU) and CNN in terms of temporal memory and\nfeature-expression ability, an active detection method of FDIAs based on a\nGRU-CNN hybrid neural network is proposed. Finally, the results of joint\nknowledge-driven and data-driven parallel detection are used to define a mixed\nfixed-calculation formula, and an active and passive hybrid detection method of\nFDIAs is established, considering the characteristic constraints of the\nparallel mode.

In addition, a set of experiments with a flapping\nwing MAV and rotorcraft is presented, demonstrating the capabilities of the\nsystem and the properties of these different types of drones in response to\nvarious types of wind. We performed two sets of experiments where a MAV is\nflying into the wake of the fan system, gathering data about states, battery\nvoltage and current. Firstly, we focus on steady wind conditions with wind\nspeeds ranging from 0.5 m/s to 3.4 m/s. During the second set of experiments,\nwe introduce wind gusts, by periodically modulating the wind speed from 1.3 m/s\nto 3.4 m/s with wind gust oscillations of 0.5 Hz, 0.25 Hz and 0.125 Hz. The\n\"Flapper\" flapping wing MAV requires much larger pitch angles to counter wind\nthan the \"CrazyFlie\" quadrotor. This is due to the Flapper's larger wing\nsurface. In forward flight, its wings do provide extra lift, considerably\nreducing the power consumption. In contrast, the CrazyFlie's power consumption\nstays more constant for different wind speeds. The experiments with the varying\nwind show a quicker gust response by the CrazyFlie compared with the Flapper\ndrone, but both their responses could be further improved. We expect that the\nproposed wind gust system will provide a useful tool to the community to\nachieve such improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Half-metallic magnets\n(HMMs) have been suggested as ideal electrode materials for MTJs to achieve an\nextremely large tunnel-magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Despite their high TMR\nratios, MTJs based on HMMs do not exhibit current rectification, i.e., a diode\neffect, which was achieved in a magnetic tunnel junction concept based on HMMs\nand type-II spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). The proposed concept has\nrecently been experimentally demonstrated using Heusler compounds. In the\npresent work, we investigate from first-principles MTJs based on type-II SGS\nand HMM quaternary Heusler compounds FeVTaAl, FeVTiSi, MnVTiAl, and CoVTiSb.\nOur $ab$ $initio$ quantum transport calculations based on a nonequilibrium\nGreen's function method have demonstrated that the MTJs under consideration\nexhibit current rectification with relatively high on:off ratios. We show that,\nin contrast to conventional semiconductor diodes, the rectification bias\nvoltage window (or breakdown voltage) of the MTJs is limited by the spin gap of\nthe HMM and SGS Heusler compounds. A unique feature of the present MTJs is that\nthe diode effect can be configured dynamically, i.e., depending on the relative\norientation of the magnetization of the electrodes, the MTJ allows the\nelectrical current to pass either in one or the other direction, which leads to\nan inverse TMR effect. The combination of nonvolatility, reconfigurable diode\nfunctionality, tunable rectification voltage window, and high Curie temperature\nof the electrode materials makes the proposed MTJs very promising for\nroom-temperature spintronic applications and opens ways to magnetic memory and\nlogic concepts as well as logic-in-memory computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 14:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Consequently, these VE measures are recommended as appropriate\nmeasures of VE for leaky and all-or-none vaccines, respectively. However, in\ndiseases with multiple pathogen variants and multiple vaccines, investigators\nmay also be interested in variant-specific VE of a vaccine, the relative VE of\na vaccine against two variants, or the relative VE of different vaccines\nagainst a given variant. In this multi-variant and multi-vaccine scenario, the\ntemporal properties of the aforementioned VE measures have not been studied\nentirely yet.

As a solution, we define variant-specific and relative VE measures\nwhile accounting for multiple competing pathogen variants.

The method is based on KB-BERT, a publicly available,\nneural network language model pre-trained on a Swedish corpus by National\nLibrary of Sweden. This model has then been fine-tuned for this specific task\nusing a corpus of government texts. With a lower-case and unpunctuated Swedish\ntext as input, the model is supposed to return a grammatically correct\npunctuated copy of the text as output. A successful solution to this problem\nbrings benefits for an array of NLP domains, such as speech-to-text and\nautomated text. Only the punctuation marks period, comma and question marks\nwere considered for the project, due to a lack of data for more rare marks such\nas semicolon. Additionally, some marks are somewhat interchangeable with the\nmore common, such as exclamation points and periods. Thus, the data set had all\nexclamation points replaced with periods. The fine-tuned Swedish BERT model,\ndubbed prestoBERT, achieved an overall F1-score of 78.9. The proposed model\nscored similarly to international counterparts, with Hungarian and Chinese\nmodels obtaining F1-scores of 82.2 and 75.6 respectively. As further\ncomparison, a human evaluation case study was carried out. The human test group\nachieved an overall F1-score of 81.7, but scored substantially worse than\nprestoBERT on both period and comma. Inspecting output sentences from the model\nand humans show satisfactory results, despite the difference in F1-score. The\ndisconnect seems to stem from an unnecessary focus on replicating the exact\nsame punctuation used in the test set, rather than providing any of the number\nof correct interpretations. If the loss function could be rewritten to reward\nall grammatically correct outputs, rather than only the one original example,\nthe performance could improve significantly for both prestoBERT and the human\ngroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

The\ntwo stages are coupled through disjunctive constraints, which model generators'\nactive and reactive power output changes responding to system-wide active power\nimbalance and voltage deviations after contingencies. Real-world SC-ACOPF\nproblems may involve power grids with more than 30k buses and 22k contingencies\nand need to be solved within 10-45 minutes to get a base case solution with\nhigh feasibility and reasonably good generation cost. We develop a\ncomprehensive algorithmic framework to solve SC-ACOPF that meets the challenge\nof speed, solution quality, and computation robustness. In particular, we\ndevelop a smoothing technique to approximate disjunctive constraints into a\nsmooth structure which can be handled by interior-point solvers; we design a\ndistributed optimization algorithm to efficiently generate first-stage\nsolutions; we propose a screening procedure to prioritize contingencies; and\nfinally, we develop a reliable and parallel architecture that integrates all\nalgorithmic components. Extensive tests on industry-scale systems demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 02:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 15:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

We find that an ideal-shape and\nfast-spreading uniform distribution can be prepared with our new model. First\nwe will show how an always-symmetrical instantaneous distribution appears in an\nindefinite causal order quantum walk, which then paves the way for deriving\nconditions that enables one to interpret an evolved state as a superposition of\nits definite causal order counterparts which is however in general prohibited.\nThis property of temporal superposition of states can be generalized from\ntwo-process scenarios to cases where arbitrary many $\\mathcal{N}$ processes are\ninvolved. Finally, we demonstrate how a genuine uniform distribution emerges\nfrom an indefinite causal order quantum walk. Remarkably, besides the ideal\nshape of the distribution, our protocol has another powerful advantage, that is\nthe speed of spatial spreading reaches exactly the theoretical limit in\ncontrast to conventional cases where one may encounter the well-known issue of\na $1/\\sqrt{2}$ degeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

Its abundance in Earth's crust and mantle (the Bulk Silicate Earth, BSE)\nis surprisingly high given that carbon is strongly siderophile (metal-loving)\nat low pressures and temperatures, and hence should have segregated almost\ncompletely into Earth's core during accretion. Estimates of the concentration\nof carbon in the BSE lie in the range 100-260 ppm and are much higher than\nexpected based on simple models of core-mantle differentiation. Here we show\nthrough experiments at the putative conditions of Earth's core formation (49-71\nGPa and 3600-4000 K) that carbon is significantly less siderophile at these\nconditions than at the low pressures ($\\leq$13 GPa) and temperatures\n($\\leq$2500 K) of previous large volume press studies, but at least an order of\nmagnitude more siderophile than proposed recently based on an experimental\napproach that is similar to ours. Using our new data along with previously\npublished results, we derive a new parameterization of the pressure-temperature\ndependence of the metal-silicate partitioning of carbon. We apply this\nparameterization in a model that combines planet formation and core-mantle\ndifferentiation that is based on astrophysical N-body accretion simulations.\nBecause differentiated planetesimals were almost completely depleted in carbon\ndue to sublimation at high temperatures, almost all carbon in the BSE was added\nby the accretion of fully-oxidized carbonaceous chondrite material from the\nouter solar system. Carbon is added to the mantle continuously throughout\naccretion and its concentration reaches values within the BSE range (e.g.\n140$\\pm$40 ppm) at the end of accretion. The corresponding final core and bulk\nEarth carbon concentrations are 1270$\\pm$300 ppm and 495$\\pm$125 ppm\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

These models rely on training with a\ntremendous amount of labeled data to achieve high accuracy. However, for\nmedical applications such as dermatological disease diagnosis, the private data\ncollected by mobile dermatology assistants exist on distributed mobile devices\nof patients, and each device only has a limited amount of data. Directly\nlearning from limited data greatly deteriorates the performance of learned\nmodels. Federated learning (FL) can train models by using data distributed on\ndevices while keeping the data local for privacy. Existing works on FL assume\nall the data have ground-truth labels. However, medical data often comes\nwithout any accompanying labels since labeling requires expertise and results\nin prohibitively high labor costs. The recently developed self-supervised\nlearning approach, contrastive learning (CL), can leverage the unlabeled data\nto pre-train a model, after which the model is fine-tuned on limited labeled\ndata for dermatological disease diagnosis. However, simply combining CL with FL\nas federated contrastive learning (FCL) will result in ineffective learning\nsince CL requires diverse data for learning but each device only has limited\ndata. In this work, we propose an on-device FCL framework for dermatological\ndisease diagnosis with limited labels. Features are shared in the FCL\npre-training process to provide diverse and accurate contrastive information.\nAfter that, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with local labeled data\nindependently on each device or collaboratively with supervised federated\nlearning on all devices. Experiments on dermatological disease datasets show\nthat the proposed framework effectively improves the recall and precision of\ndermatological disease diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 01:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a\npromising approach without the original datasets under privacy-sensitive and\nconfidential scenarios. However, current DFQ solutions degrade accuracy, need\nsynthetic data to calibrate networks, and are time-consuming and costly. This\npaper proposes an on-the-fly DFQ framework with sub-second quantization time,\ncalled SQuant, which can quantize networks on inference-only devices with low\ncomputation and memory requirements. With the theoretical analysis of the\nsecond-order information of DNN task loss, we decompose and approximate the\nHessian-based optimization objective into three diagonal sub-items, which have\ndifferent areas corresponding to three dimensions of weight tensor:\nelement-wise, kernel-wise, and output channel-wise. Then, we progressively\ncompose sub-items and propose a novel data-free optimization objective in the\ndiscrete domain, minimizing Constrained Absolute Sum of Error (or CASE in\nshort), which surprisingly does not need any dataset and is even not aware of\nnetwork architecture. We also design an efficient algorithm without\nback-propagation to further reduce the computation complexity of the objective\nsolver. Finally, without fine-tuning and synthetic datasets, SQuant accelerates\nthe data-free quantization process to a sub-second level with >30% accuracy\nimprovement over the existing data-free post-training quantization works, with\nthe evaluated models under 4-bit quantization.

However, there is an inadvertent fault in\nAnselin's mathematical processes so that the local Moran and Geary indicators\ndo not satisfy his second basic requirement, i.e., the sum of the local\nindicators is proportional to a global indicator. Based on Anselin's original\nintention, this paper is devoted to reconstructing the calculation formulae of\nthe local Moran indexes and Geary coefficients through mathematical derivation\nand empirical evidence. Two sets of LISAs were clarified by mathematical\nreasoning. One set of LISAs is based on no normalized weights and centralized\nvariable (MI1 and GC1), and the other set is but the second the set cannot.\nThen, the third set of LISA was proposed, treated as canonical forms (MI3 and\nGC3). The local Moran indexes are based on global normalized weights and\nstandardized variable based on population standard deviation, while the local\nGeary coefficients are based on global normalized weights and standardized\nvariable based on sample standard deviation. This set of LISAs satisfies the\nsecond requirement of based on row normalized weights and standardized variable\n(MI2 and GC2). The results show that the first set of LISAs satisfy Anselin's\nsecond requirement,Anselin's. The observational data of city population and\ntraffic mileage in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China were employed to\nverify the theoretical results. This study helps to clarify the\nmisunderstandings about LISAs in the field of geospatial analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 07:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Our results elucidate that emissions on a\nparticular route can vary significantly due to aircraft and engine choice, and\nthat emission rates differ significantly from airline to airline.

This study aims to\ndetermine whether indoor smoking bans at workplaces can effectively reduce the\nsmoking rate. The Smokeban dataset used for this study is an observational\ndataset that contains some socio-demographic factors, whether people smoke, and\nwhether smoking bans exist. Since the observational data used in the study did\nnot randomize people into with-smoking-bans group and without-smoking-bans\ngroup, confounders may cause bias in the estimation of whether the smoking bans\ncan reduce smoking rates. The propensity score matching(PSM) method can reduce\nthese biases via using a logistic regression model to predict the similarities\nof people in those 2 groups and using the nearest neighbour matching technique\nto match people who are the most similar. After reducing the bias, another\nregression model was created to interpret the relationship between the\nprobability of smoking and the indoor smoking bans. We conclude by arguing that\nwith the existence of indoor smoking bans, the probability of people who smoke\ncan be decreased greatly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

On the other\nside, developments in transfer learning would benefit significantly from a\nreal-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we pick\nelectroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for what makes biosignal machine\nlearning hard. We design two transfer learning challenges around diagnostics\nand Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI), that have to be solved in the face of low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the\ndata recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks\nrecorded in the dataset.

This uncertainty arises from\ncharacteristics such as arithmetic logical irreversibility, Landauer's\nprinciple, and memory erasure, which ultimately lead to a loss of information\nand an increase in entropy. To measure this uncertainty and loss of\ninformation, the concept of arithmetic logical entropy can be used. The Turing\nmachine and its equivalent, general recursive functions can be understood\nthrough the {\\lambda} calculus and the Turing/Church thesis. However, there are\ncertain recursive functions that cannot be fully understood or predicted by\nother algorithms due to the loss of information during logical-arithmetic\noperations. In other words, the behaviour of these functions cannot be\ncompletely determined at every stage of the computation due to a lack of\ninformation in their definition. While there are some cases where the behaviour\nof recursive functions is highly predictable, the lack of information in most\ncases makes it impossible for algorithms to determine if a program will halt or\nnot. This inability to predict the outcome of the computation is the essence of\nthe halting problem of the Turing machine. Even in cases where more information\nis available about the program, it is still difficult to determine with\ncertainty if the program will halt or not. This also highlights the importance\nof the Turing oracle machine, which introduces information from outside the\ncomputation to compensate for the lack of information and ultimately decide the\nresult of the computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 07:36:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 09:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 20:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 12:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}
