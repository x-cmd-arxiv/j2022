Plasmas\n27, 113701 (2020)]. It is found that a nonlinear driver in the form of a\ncnoidal square wave or a travelling wave driver produces a spectral response\nthat is closer to experimental observations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 085001\n(2004)] than that predicted by the simple sinusoidal driver. Using a bispectral\nanalysis, we also firmly establish that the nature of the nonlinear\noscillations, due to the interaction between the periodic source and the\ninherent collective mode of the system, is predominantly governed by a\nthree-wave mixing process. Furthermore, by studying the variation in the mixing\npattern, from a broad to a sparse frequency spectrum, as a function of the\ndriver frequency and its functional form, we propose a means of tailoring the\nnature of such patterns. Our results could find useful applications in the\nexperimental interpretation and manipulation of nonlinear wave mixing patterns\nin weakly nonlinear and dispersive plasma systems or similar phenomena in\nneutral fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Before the filament formation, three successive dipoles\nquickly emerged with separation motions in the center of AR 12760. Due to the\nmagnetic interaction between magnetic dipoles and pre-existing positive\npolarities, coronal brightenings consequently appeared in the overlying\natmosphere. Subsequently, because of the continuous cancellation of magnetic\nflux that happened around the adjacent ends of F1 and another nearby filament\n(F2), the magnetic reconections occurred intermittently occurred between F1 and\nF2. Finally, F1 lessened in the shear, and F2 became shorter. All the results\nshow that the formation of F1 was closely associated with intermittent\ninteractions between the sequence of emerging dipoles and pre-existing magnetic\npolarities, and the immediate deformation of F1 was intimately related to\nintermittent interactions between F1 and F2. We also suggest that the\nintermittent magnetic interactions driven by the continuous magnetic activities\n(magnetic-flux emergence, cancellation, and convergence) play an important role\nin the formation and deformation of filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 16:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 01:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

However, most\nunsupervised single image deraining methods mainly focus on rain streak removal\nby disregarding the fog, which leads to low-quality deraining performance. In\naddition, the samples are rather homogeneous generated by these methods and\nlack diversity, resulting in poor results in the face of complex rain scenes.\nTo address the above issues, we propose a novel Asymetric Cycle Generative and\nAdversarial framework (ACGF) for single image deraining that trains on both\nsynthetic and real rainy images while simultaneously capturing both rain\nstreaks and fog features. ACGF consists of a Rain-fog2Clean (R2C)\ntransformation block and a Clean2Rain-fog (C2R) transformation block. The\nformer consists of parallel rain removal path and rain-fog feature extraction\npath by the rain and derain-fog network and the attention rain-fog feature\nextraction network (ARFE) , while the latter only contains a synthetic rain\ntransformation path. In rain-fog feature extraction path, to better\ncharacterize the rain-fog fusion feature, we employ an ARFE to exploit the\nself-similarity of global and local rain-fog information by learning the\nspatial feature correlations. Moreover, to improve the translational capacity\nof C2R and the diversity of models, we design a rain-fog feature decoupling and\nreorganization network (RFDR) by embedding a rainy image degradation model and\na mixed discriminator to preserve richer texture details in synthetic rain\nconversion path.

Such speculations are\nrooted in a belief that setting dependence of hidden variables in a\nprobabilistic model, called a violation of measurement independence, would mean\na violation of experimenters freedom of choice. This belief is unfounded\nbecause it is based on a questionable use of Bayes Theorem and on incorrect\ncausal interpretation of conditional probabilities. In Bell-local realistic\nmodel, hidden variables describe only photonic beams created by a source, thus\nthey cannot depend on randomly chosen experimental settings. However, if hidden\nvariables describing measuring instruments are correctly incorporated into a\ncontextual probabilistic model a violation of inequalities and an apparent\nviolation of no-signaling reported in Bell tests can be explained without\nevoking quantum nonlocality. Therefore, for us, a violation of Bell-CHSH\ninequalities proves only that hidden variables have to depend on settings\nconfirming contextual character of quantum observables and an active role\nplayed by measuring instruments. Bell thought that he had to choose between\nnonlocality and the violation of experimenters freedom of choice. From two bad\nchoices he chose nonlocality.

In this paper, we argue that the analogous transformation at\nthe finite-$N$ level can be accomplished by applying an appropriate heat flow\nto the characteristic polynomial of the first model.\n  Let the \"second moment\" of a random polynomial $p$ denote the expectation\nvalue of the square of the absolute value of $p.$ We find certain pairs of\nrandom matrix models and we apply a certain heat-type operator to the\ncharacteristic polynomial $p_{1}$ of the first model, giving a new polynomial\n$q.$ We prove that the second moment of $q$ is equal to the second moment of\nthe characteristic polynomial $p_{2}$ of the second model. This result leads to\nseveral conjectures of the following sort: when $N$ is large, the zeros of $q$\nhave the same bulk distribution as the zeros of $p_{2},$ namely the eigenvalues\nof the second random matrix model. At a more refined level, we conjecture that,\nas the characteristic polynomial of the first model evolves under the\nappropriate heat flow, its zeros will evolve close to the characteristic curves\nof a certain PDE.

For\nstandard, non-robust, OPE/L, this is solved by doubly robust (DR) methods, but\nthey do not naturally extend to the more complex DROPE/L, which involves a\nworst-case expectation.

Unbalance mitigation will be a\nsignificant concern as voltage unbalance leads to increased losses, reduced\nmotor and inverter efficiency, and becomes a limiting factor for DN operation.\nThe true definition of the unbalance metric needs phasor measurements of\nnetwork voltage and current. However, such phasor measurements are generally\nnot available in real life and as such approximate definitions are widely used\ndue to their simplicity. This work aims to compare the true voltage unbalance\ndefinition and approximate unbalance metrics derived from phase voltage\nmagnitude, as phase voltage magnitudes are commonly measured by digital\nmetering infrastructure. For the comparison, multi-period power flow\nsimulations are performed for 161 Spanish distribution feeders with R/X ratios\nvarying from 2.87 to 14.68. We observe that phase magnitude-based unbalance\nmetrics reasonably approximate the true unbalance for higher R/X ratios with a\nvarying load power factor in a DN. Furthermore, the approximate unbalance\nmetrics slightly improve for a low DN power factor due to the increase in DN\nunbalance.

Hex meshes vary in\ncomplexity from structured to unstructured depending on application or domain\nof interest. Fully structured meshes require that all interior mesh edges are\nadjacent to exactly four hexes. Edges not satisfying this criteria are\nconsidered singular and indicate an unstructured hex mesh. Singular edges join\ntogether into singular curves that either form closed cycles, end on the mesh\nboundary, or end at a singular node, a complex junction of more than two\nsingular curves. While all hex meshes with singularities are unstructured,\nthose with more complex singular nodes tend to have more distorted elements and\nsmaller scaled Jacobian values. In this work, we study the topology of singular\nnodes. We show that all eight of the most common singular nodes are\ndecomposable into just singular curves. We further show that all singular\nnodes, regardless of edge valence, are locally decomposable. Finally we\ndemonstrate these decompositions on hex meshes, thereby decreasing their\ndistortion and converting all singular nodes into singular curves. With this\ndecomposition, the enigmatic complexity of 3D singular nodes becomes\neffectively 2D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 22:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Specifically, we make use of the weak-value scenario and\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. We prove that it is impossible for a\nclassical mediator to act on two local quantum objects to simulate\namplified-weak-value phenomenon in two-setting Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nsteering. Our approach can amplify the signal of gravitationally induced\nentanglement that were previously impossible to observe by any desired factor\nthat depends on the magnitude of the weak value. Our results not only open up\nthe possibility of exploring nonclassical nature of gravity in the near future,\nbut they also pave the way for weak entanglement criterion of a more general\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 06:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 03:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

This type of game is\nappropriate to model many current network security conflicts such as Internet\nphishing, mobile malware or network intrusions. In such attacks, the attacker\nand the defender need to decide how to allocate resources on each target so as\nto maximize his utility within his resource limit. We model such a\nmulti-dimensional network security game as a constrained non-zero sum game. Two\nsecurity breaching models, the product-form and the proportion-form, are\nconsidered. For each breaching model, we prove the existence of a unique Nash\nequilibrium (NE) based on Rosen's theorem and propose efficient algorithms to\nfind the NE when the games are strictly concave. Furthermore, we show the\nexistence of multiple NEs in the product-form breaching model when the strict\nconcavity does not hold.

Currently, spatial propagation\nnetworks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth\ncompletion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the\nfixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to\nestimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is\nover-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient\nmodel that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an\nattention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial\nPropagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation\nmodel (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different\ndistances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these\nparts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion\nsuppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to\nprevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the\ncomputational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the\namount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar\naccuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the\nperformance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms\nother state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation\nby the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2\ndataset as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 09:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

We confirm that the decoding resolution\ncan play a significant role in reducing the overall power consumption of a\nmobile device and conduct two user studies to investigate how the context in\nwhich a video is played, its content, and the user's personality, modulate a\nuser's quality expectations. We discover that a user's physical activity, the\nspatial/temporal properties of the video, and the user's personality traits\ninteract and jointly influence the minimal acceptable playback resolution,\npaving the way for context-adaptable approximate mobile computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 10:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Just like the Abelian\nLandau-Ginzburg theory it has the U(1) electromagnetic interaction, but the new\ningredient is the non-Abelian SU(2) gauge interaction between the spin doublet\nCooper pair. A remarkable feature of the theory is the mixing between the\nphoton and the diagonal part of the SU(2) gauge boson. After the mixing it has\nmassless gauge boson (the massless non-Abelian spinon) and massive gauge boson\n(the massive photon), in addition to the massive off-diagonal gauge bosons (the\nmassive non-Abelian spinons) which induces the spin-flip interaction between\nthe spin up and down components of the Cooper pair. So, unlike the ordinary\nLandau-Ginzburg theory it has a long range interaction mediated by the massless\nnon-Abelian spinon, which could be responsible for the long range magnetic\norder and spin waves observed in ferromagnetic superconductors. The theory is\ncharacterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by\nthe mass of the Higgs field it has two different penetration lengths, the one\nfixed by the mass of the photon (which generates the well known Meissner\neffect) and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal spinons (which\ndetermines the scale of the spin flip interaction).

It tries to\nautomatically separate instances into coherent subsets. As one of the most\nwell-known clustering algorithms, k-means assigns sample points at the boundary\nto a unique cluster, while it does not utilize the information of sample\ndistribution or density. Comparably, it would potentially be more beneficial to\nconsider the probability of each sample in a possible cluster. To this end,\nthis paper generalizes k-means to model the distribution of clusters. Our novel\nclustering algorithm thus models the distributions of distances to centroids\nover a threshold by Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) in Extreme Value\nTheory (EVT). Notably, we propose the concept of centroid margin distance, use\nGPD to establish a probability model for each cluster, and perform a clustering\nalgorithm based on the covering probability function derived from GPD. Such a\nGPD k-means thus enables the clustering algorithm from the probabilistic\nperspective. Correspondingly, we also introduce a naive baseline, dubbed as\nGeneralized Extreme Value (GEV) k-means. GEV fits the distribution of the block\nmaxima. In contrast, the GPD fits the distribution of distance to the centroid\nexceeding a sufficiently large threshold, leading to a more stable performance\nof GPD k-means. Notably, GEV k-means can also estimate cluster structure and\nthus perform reasonably well over classical k-means. Thus, extensive\nexperiments on synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate that GPD\nk-means outperforms competitors.

Quantifying the impact of\nan image on the specific target tasks, also named as task amenability, is\nneeded. A task-specific IQA has recently been proposed to learn an\nimage-amenability-predicting controller simultaneously with a target task\npredictor. This allows for the trained IQA controller to measure the impact an\nimage has on the target task performance, when this task is performed using the\npredictor, e.g. segmentation and classification neural networks in modern\nclinical applications. In this work, we propose an extension to this\ntask-specific IQA approach, by adding a task-agnostic IQA based on\nauto-encoding as the target task. Analysing the intersection between\nlow-quality images, deemed by both the task-specific and task-agnostic IQA, may\nhelp to differentiate the underpinning factors that caused the poor target task\nperformance. For example, common imaging artefacts may not adversely affect the\ntarget task, which would lead to a low task-agnostic quality and a high\ntask-specific quality, whilst individual cases considered clinically\nchallenging, which can not be improved by better imaging equipment or\nprotocols, is likely to result in a high task-agnostic quality but a low\ntask-specific quality. We first describe a flexible reward shaping strategy\nwhich allows for the adjustment of weighting between task-agnostic and\ntask-specific quality scoring. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed algorithm\nusing a clinically challenging target task of prostate tumour segmentation on\nmultiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) images, from 850 patients.

Understanding whether and how\nthis occurs is vital for predicting the final masses reached by these stars and\nthe form of the Pop III stellar initial mass function. To help us better\nunderstand the impact of UV radiation from massive Pop III stars on the gas\nsurrounding them, we carry out high resolution simulations of the formation and\nearly evolution of these stars, using the AREPO moving-mesh code coupled with\nthe innovative radiative transfer module SPRAI. Contrary to most previous\nresults, we find that the ionising radiation from these stars is trapped in the\ndense accretion disk surrounding them.

We show that the\nreason that we obtain qualitatively different results from previous studies of\nPop III stellar feedback lies in how the radiation is injected into the\nsimulation. HII region trapping only occurs if the photons are injected on\nscales smaller than the local scale height of the accretion disk, a criterion\nnot fulfilled in previous 3D simulations of this process.

A key\ncomplication with upscaled models in this setting is that the procedure must\ndifferentiate between interface spreading, driven by the spatially variable\nvelocity field, and mixing, in which components contact one another and react.\nOur model captures the enhanced mixing caused by spreading through use of a\ntime-dependent effective dispersion term. The early-time behavior of this\ndispersion is driven by flow kinematics, while at late times it reaches a\nTaylor-dispersion-like limit. The early-time behavior is modeled here using a\nvery fast (purely advective) particle tracking procedure, while late-time\neffects are estimated from scaling arguments. The only free parameter in the\nmodel is the asymptotic effective dispersion. This quantity is determined for a\nfew cases by calibrating 1D results to reference 2D results.

This paper proposes\nRFTacho, a rotation speed measurement \\emph{system} that leverages novel\nhardware and signal processing algorithms to produce highly accurate readings\nconveniently. RFTacho uses RF Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) waves to measure\nrotation speed of multiple machines simultaneously with no requirements from\nthe machine's properties. OAM antennas allow it to operate in high-scattering\nenvironments, commonly found in industries, as they are resilient to\nde-polarization compared to linearly polarized antennas. RFTacho achieves this\nby using two novel signal processing algorithms to extract the rotation speed\nof several rotating objects simultaneously amidst noise arising from\nhigh-scattering environments, non-line-of-sight scenarios and dynamic\nenvironmental conditions with a resolution of $1 rpm$. We test RFTacho on\nseveral real-world machines like fans, motors, air conditioners. Results show\nthat RFTacho has avg. error of $<0.5\\%$ compared to ground truth.

In this paper, we investigate this intriguing problem from a\nnew perspective, i.e., injecting appropriate forms of sparsity during\nadversarial training. We introduce two alternatives for sparse adversarial\ntraining: (i) static sparsity, by leveraging recent results from the lottery\nticket hypothesis to identify critical sparse subnetworks arising from the\nearly training; (ii) dynamic sparsity, by allowing the sparse subnetwork to\nadaptively adjust its connectivity pattern (while sticking to the same sparsity\nratio) throughout training. We find both static and dynamic sparse methods to\nyield win-win: substantially shrinking the robust generalization gap and\nalleviating the robust overfitting, meanwhile significantly saving training and\ninference FLOPs. Extensive experiments validate our proposals with multiple\nnetwork architectures on diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and\nTiny-ImageNet.

One of the approaches for analysis\nand interpretation of resting-state fMRI data require spatially and\nfunctionally homogenous parcellation of the whole brain based on underlying\ntemporal fluctuations. Clustering is often used to generate functional\nparcellation. However, major clustering algorithms, when used for fMRI data,\nhave their limitations. Among commonly used parcellation schemes, a tradeoff\nexists between intra-cluster functional similarity and alignment with\nanatomical regions. Approach: In this work, we present a clustering algorithm\nfor resting state and task fMRI data which is developed to obtain brain\nparcellations that show high structural and functional homogeneity. The\nclustering is performed by multistage binary k-means clustering algorithm\ndesigned specifically for the 4D fMRI data. The results from this multistage\nk-means algorithm show that by modifying and combining different algorithms, we\ncan take advantage of the strengths of different techniques while overcoming\ntheir limitations. Results: The clustering output for resting state fMRI data\nusing the multistage k-means approach is shown to be better than simple k-means\nor functional atlas in terms of spatial and functional homogeneity. The\nclusters also correspond to commonly identifiable brain networks. For task\nfMRI, the clustering output can identify primary and secondary activation\nregions and provide information about the varying hemodynamic response across\ndifferent brain regions. Conclusion: The multistage k-means approach can\nprovide functional parcellations of the brain using resting state fMRI data.\nThe method is model-free and is data driven which can be applied to both\nresting state and task fMRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 20:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Our experiments and evaluations on a set of\nstocks from the NASDAQ index demonstrate that GCNET significantly improves the\nperformance of SOTA in terms of accuracy and MCC measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 16:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 07:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Although task-driven\napproaches are appealing, designing models specific to each application can be\ndifficult in the face of limited data, especially when dealing with highly\nvariable multimodal input spaces arising from different tasks in different\nenvironments.We introduce the first general-purpose pretraining pipeline,\nCOntrastive Multimodal Pretraining for AutonomouS Systems (COMPASS), to\novercome the limitations of task-specific models and existing pretraining\napproaches. COMPASS constructs a multimodal graph by considering the essential\ninformation for autonomous systems and the properties of different modalities.\nThrough this graph, multimodal signals are connected and mapped into two\nfactorized spatio-temporal latent spaces: a \"motion pattern space\" and a\n\"current state space.\" By learning from multimodal correspondences in each\nlatent space, COMPASS creates state representations that models necessary\ninformation such as temporal dynamics, geometry, and semantics. We pretrain\nCOMPASS on a large-scale multimodal simulation dataset TartanAir\n\\cite{tartanair2020iros} and evaluate it on drone navigation, vehicle racing,\nand visual odometry tasks. The experiments indicate that COMPASS can tackle all\nthree scenarios and can also generalize to unseen environments and real-world\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 02:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}
