Non-adiabatic molecular\ndynamics (NAMD) simulations based on time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) are widely used to study excited-state carrier dynamics. However, the\ncalculated carrier lifetimes are often different from experimental results by\norders of magnitude. In this work, by revisiting the definition of carrier\nlifetime and considering different recombination mechanisms, we report a\nsystematic procedure for calculating the effective carrier lifetime in\nrealistic semiconductor crystals that can be compared directly to experimental\nmeasurements. The procedure shows that considering all recombination mechanisms\nand using reasonable densities of carriers and defects are crucial in\ncalculating the effective lifetime. When NAMD simulations consider only\nShockey-Read-Hall (SRH) defect-assisted and band-to-band non-radiative\nrecombination while neglect band-to-band radiative recombination, and the\ndensities of non-equilibrium carriers and defects in supercell simulations are\nmuch higher than those in realistic semiconductors under solar illumination,\nthe calculated lifetimes are ineffective and thus differ from experiments.\nUsing our procedure, the calculated effective lifetime of the halide perovskite\nCH3NH3PbI3 agrees with experiments. It is mainly determined by band-to-band\nradiative and defect-assisted non-radiative recombination, while band-to-band\nnon-radiative recombination is negligible. These results indicate that it is\npossible to calculate carrier lifetimes accurately based on NAMD simulations,\nbut the directly calculated values should be converted to effective lifetimes\nfor comparison to experiments. The revised procedure can be widely applied in\nfuture carrier lifetime simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 16:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

With the\nupcoming Large-scale Imaging Surveys, billions of galaxy images challenge\nastronomers to accomplish the classification task by applying traditional\nmethods or human inspection. Consequently, machine learning, in particular\nsupervised deep learning, has been widely employed to classify galaxy\nmorphologies recently due to its exceptional automation, efficiency, and\naccuracy. However, supervised deep learning requires extensive training sets,\nwhich causes considerable workloads; also, the results are strongly dependent\non the characteristics of training sets, which leads to biased outcomes\npotentially. In this study, we attempt Few-shot Learning to bypass the two\nissues. Our research adopts the dataset from Galaxy Zoo Challenge Project on\nKaggle, and we divide it into five categories according to the corresponding\ntruth table. By classifying the above dataset utilizing few-shot learning based\non Siamese Networks and supervised deep learning based on AlexNet, VGG_16, and\nResNet_50 trained with different volumes of training sets separately, we find\nthat few-shot learning achieves the highest accuracy in most cases, and the\nmost significant improvement is $21\\%$ compared to AlexNet when the training\nsets contain 1000 images. In addition, to guarantee the accuracy is no less\nthan 90\\%, few-shot learning needs $\\sim$6300 images for training, while\nResNet_50 requires 13000 images. Considering the advantages stated above,\nforeseeably, few-shot learning is suitable for the taxonomy of galaxy\nmorphology and even for identifying rare astrophysical objects, despite limited\ntraining sets consisting of observational data only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 16:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 03:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

A more general\nformulation, known as k-means with $z$ outliers, introduced to deal with noisy\ndatasets, features a further parameter $z$ and allows up to $z$ points of $P$\n(outliers) to be disregarded when computing the aforementioned sum. We present\na distributed coreset-based 3-round approximation algorithm for k-means with\n$z$ outliers for general metric spaces, using MapReduce as a computational\nmodel.

In this paper, we propose a\nweakly-supervised learning method for nuclei segmentation that only requires\npoint annotations for training. The proposed method achieves label propagation\nin a coarse-to-fine manner as follows. First, coarse pixel-level labels are\nderived from the point annotations based on the Voronoi diagram and the k-means\nclustering method to avoid overfitting. Second, a co-training strategy with an\nexponential moving average method is designed to refine the incomplete\nsupervision of the coarse labels.

Most existing works are under the supervision of expensive and\ntime-consuming full annotations, which require the surgeons to repeat watching\nvideos to find the precise start and end time for a surgical phase. In this\npaper, we introduce timestamp supervision for surgical phase recognition to\ntrain the models with timestamp annotations, where the surgeons are asked to\nidentify only a single timestamp within the temporal boundary of a phase. This\nannotation can significantly reduce the manual annotation cost compared to the\nfull annotations. To make full use of such timestamp supervisions, we propose a\nnovel method called uncertainty-aware temporal diffusion (UATD) to generate\ntrustworthy pseudo labels for training. Our proposed UATD is motivated by the\nproperty of surgical videos, i.e., the phases are long events consisting of\nconsecutive frames. To be specific, UATD diffuses the single labelled timestamp\nto its corresponding high confident ( i.e., low uncertainty) neighbour frames\nin an iterative way. Our study uncovers unique insights of surgical phase\nrecognition with timestamp supervisions: 1) timestamp annotation can reduce 74%\nannotation time compared with the full annotation, and surgeons tend to\nannotate those timestamps near the middle of phases; 2) extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can achieve competitive results compared with full\nsupervision methods, while reducing manual annotation cost; 3) less is more in\nsurgical phase recognition, i.e., less but discriminative pseudo labels\noutperform full but containing ambiguous frames; 4) the proposed UATD can be\nused as a plug and play method to clean ambiguous labels near boundaries\nbetween phases, and improve the performance of the current surgical phase\nrecognition methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 17:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 03:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Such\nsystems are especially challenging for model order reduction since the\ntransport cannot be captured by linear reduction methods. Moreover, topological\nchanges, such as splitting or merging of fronts pose difficulties for many\nnonlinear reduction methods and the small non-vanishing support of the\nunderlying partial differential equations dynamics makes most nonlinear\nhyper-reduction methods infeasible. We propose a new decomposition method\ntogether with a hyper-reduction scheme that addresses these shortcomings. The\ndecomposition uses a level-set function to parameterize the transport and a\nnonlinear activation function that captures the structure of the front. This\napproach is similar to autoencoder artificial neural networks, but additionally\nprovides insights into the system, which can be used for efficient reduced\norder models. We make use of this property and are thus able to solve the\nadvection equation with the same complexity as the POD-Galerkin approach while\nobtaining errors of less than one percent for representative examples.\nFurthermore, we outline a special hyper-reduction method for more complicated\nadvection-reaction-diffusion systems.

The results show that the goodput achieved with QUIC over\ngeostationary satellite links is very poor in general, and especially poor when\nthere is packet loss. Some implementations fail completely and the performance\nof the other implementations varies greatly. The performance depends on both\nclient and server implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 21:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

We argue that the entire mass spectrum should be utilized to\nprovide cosmological constraints. For example, we find that the mass spectrum\nof LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA events introduces at least five independent mass\n``features'': the upper and lower edges of the pair instability supernova\n(PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of the neutron star--black hole gap, and\nthe minimum neutron star mass.

We implement a design achieving a trap depth of 1 eV for a calcium-40\nion held at 200 micrometers from either electrode plane. We characterize traps,\nachieving measurement agreement with simulations to within +/-5% for mode\nfrequencies spanning 0.6--3.8 MHz, and evaluate stray electric field across\nmultiple trapping sites. We measure motional heating rates over an extensive\nrange of trap frequencies, and temperatures, observing 40 phonons/s at 1 MHz\nand 185 K. This fabrication method provides a highly scalable approach for\nproducing a new generation of 3D ion traps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 13:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

We show that quasi-developed\nmacro-scale flow is characterized by velocity modes which decay exponentially\nin the main flow direction. We prove that the closure force can be represented\nby an exact permeability tensor consisting of two parts. The first part, which\nis due to the developed macro-scale flow, is uniform everywhere, except in the\nside-wall region, where it is affected by the macro-scale velocity profile and\nits slip length. The second part expresses the resistance against the velocity\nmode, so it decays exponentially as the flow develops. It satisfies a specific\nclosure problem on a transversal row of the array. From these properties, we\nassess the validity of the classical closure problem for the volume-averaged\nflow equations. We show that all its underlying assumptions are partly violated\nby an exponentially vanishing error during flow development. Furthermore, we\nshow that it modifies the eigenvalues, modes, and onset point of\nquasi-developed flow, when it is applied to reconstruct the macro-scale flow.\nThe former theoretical aspects are illustrated for high-aspect-ratio channels\nwith high-porosity arrays of equidistant in-line square cylinders, by means of\ndirect numerical simulation and explicit filtering of the flow. In particular,\nwe present extensive solutions of the classical closure problem for Reynolds\nnumbers up to 600, porosities between 0.2 and 0.95, and flow directions between\n0 and 45 degrees, though the channel height has been kept equal to the cylinder\nspacing.

We identify transient, double-peaked Bowen (N III), He I, He II\nand Halpha emission lines. We model medium resolution optical spectroscopy of\nthe He II (after careful deblending of the N III contribution) and Halpha lines\nduring the rise, peak and early decline of the light curve using relativistic,\nelliptical accretion disk models. We find that the spectral evolution before\npeak can be explained by optical depth effects consistent with an outflowing,\noptically thick Eddington envelope. Around peak the envelope reaches its\nmaximum extent (approximately 10^15 or 3000-6000 gravitational radii for an\ninferred black hole mass of 5-10 10^5) and becomes optically thin. The Halpha\nand He II emission lines at and after peak can be reproduced with a highly\ninclined (i=85+-5 degrees), highly elliptical (e=0.97+-0.01) and relatively\ncompact (Rin = several 100 Rg and Rout = several 1000 Rg ) accretion disk.\nOverall, the line profiles suggest a highly elliptical geometry for the new\naccretion flow, consistent with theoretical expectations of newly formed TDE\ndisks. We quantitatively confirm, for the first time, the high inclination\nnature of a Bowen (and X-ray dim) TDE, consistent with the unification picture\nof TDEs where the inclination largely determines the observational appearance.\nRapid line profile variations rule out the binary SMBH hypothesis as the origin\nof the eccentricity; these results thus provide a direct link between a TDE in\nan AGN and the eccentric accretion disk. We illustrate for the first time how\noptical spectroscopy can be used to constrain the black hole spin, through (the\nlack of) disk precession signatures (changes in inferred inclination) - and\nrule out high black hole spin values (a < 0.8).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 16:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

For massless particles,\nlike gluons, however, such a construction leads to three-point and four-point\ncorrelators that vanish everywhere except for a measure zero hypersurface of\ncelestial coordinates. This is due to the four-dimensional momentum\nconservation law that constrains the insertion points of the operators\nassociated with massless particles. These correlators are reminiscent of\nCoulomb gas correlators that, in the absence of background charges, vanish due\nto charge conservation. We supply the background momentum by coupling\nYang-Mills theory to a background dilaton field, with the (complex) dilaton\nsource localized on the celestial sphere.

While\ntraditionally associated with short distance nonrenormalizability, it is\nevident that the long distance problem of unitarity, arising at high energies\nwith black hole formation, is more profound. This reveals a conflict between\nfoundational principles of quantum field theory: those of quantum mechanics,\nrelativity, and locality. Difficulties modifying quantum mechanics suggest a\n\"quantum-first\" approach, with other principles as mathematical properties of a\nquantum space of states. A challenge is how to describe locality, in terms of\nHilbert space structure. Perturbative gravity gives clues, with structure\napparently different than in field theory. The mathematical structure of\nsubsystems plausibly supplants conventional locality and plays a foundational\nrole in the theory. This view differs from one of spacetime \"emerging\" from\nanother quantum system. If a black hole behaves as a subsystem, a \"black hole\ntheorem\" says that unitarity requires interactions with its environment\ndepending on its state, or more drastic phenomena. Minimal interactions can be\nparameterized, in an effective approach; they could arise from wormholes or\nother fundamental dynamics. These or other near-horizon modifications\npotentially alter electromagnetic or gravitational signatures of this strong\ngravity region, now being probed in a new era of observation; it is important\nto seek observational clues for or constraints on such scenarios. One may also\ninvestigate quantum gravity via its S-matrix. New perturbative structure has\nbeen discovered there, but the harder question again goes beyond to the\nnonperturbative regime.

The dose predictions were input to\nfour optimization models to form 76 unique KBP pipelines that generated 7600\nplans.

We also performed a\ntheoretical investigation to justify our dose mimicking models. The range in\nrank order correlation of the dose score between predictions and their KBP\npipelines was 0.50 to 0.62, which indicates that the quality of the predictions\nis generally positively correlated with the quality of the plans.

Optimal arrangements of the arrays are\nobtained by coupling Navier-Stokes simulations with a multi-objective\noptimization algorithm, which seeks configurations that minimize wake enstrophy\nand maximize drag acting on the porous structure.

Large\nvariations in drag and enstrophy are observed by varying the relative positions\nof the cylinders, which indicates that the geometrical arrangement of porous\narrays plays a prominent role in determining wake and drag characteristics. A\nsensitivity analysis suggests that enstrophy is more sensitive than drag to\nspecific cylinder placement, and depends on distinctive flow patterns that\ndevelop in the interior due to interactions among individual cylinders.

The mechanisms driving the instability are characterized using\nlinear stability analysis for weakly inertial particles and further validated\nagainst Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations. We show that the particle-laden vortex\nis always unstable if the mass loading $M>0$. Surprisingly, even non-inertial\nparticles destabilize the vortex by a mechanism analogous to the centrifugal\nRayleigh-Taylor instability in radially stratified vortex with density jump. We\nidentify a critical mass loading above which an eigenmode $m$ becomes unstable.\nThis critical mass loading drops to zero as m increases.

The ISM is a multiphase medium\nand observations suggest that the properties of magnetic fields differ with the\nphase. Here, we aim to study how the properties of the turbulent dynamo depend\non the phase. We simulate the non-isothermal turbulent dynamo in a two-phase\nmedium (most previous work assumes an isothermal gas).

These rings are not\ntopologized.\n  We prove that the category of BC R-rings is dual to the category of compact\ntopological spaces. Next we prove that for every topological space X the ring\nof bounded continuous functions on it is a BC R-ring. These theorems combined\nyield an algebraic construction of the Stone-Cech Compactification of an\narbitrary topological space.\n  There is a similar notion of BC C-ring. Every BC C-ring A has a canonical\ninvolution. The canonical hermitian subring of A is a BC R-ring, and this is an\nequivalence of categories from BC C-rings to BC R-rings.\n  Let K be either R or C. We prove that a BC K-ring A has a canonical norm on\nit, making it into a Banach K-ring. We then prove that the forgetful functor is\nan equivalence from Banach^* K-rings (better known as commutative unital C^*\nK-algebras) to BC K-rings. The quasi-inverse of the forgetful functor endows a\nBC K-ring with its canonical norm, and the canonical involution when K = C.\n  Stone topological spaces, also known as profinite topological spaces, are\ntraditionally related to boolean rings - this is Stone Duality. We give a BC\nring characterization of Stone spaces. From that we obtain a very easy proof of\nthe fact that the Stone-Cech Compactification of a discrete space is a Stone\nspace.\n  Most of the results in this paper are not new.

Our motivation is to study the upper\nlimits of this research program: How far will understanding Neural Collapse\ntake us in understanding deep learning? First, we investigate its role in\ngeneralization. We refine the Neural Collapse conjecture into two separate\nconjectures: collapse on the train set (an optimization property) and collapse\non the test distribution (a generalization property). We find that while Neural\nCollapse often occurs on the train set, it does not occur on the test set. We\nthus conclude that Neural Collapse is primarily an optimization phenomenon,\nwith as-yet-unclear connections to generalization. Second, we investigate the\nrole of Neural Collapse in feature learning. We show simple, realistic\nexperiments where training longer leads to worse last-layer features, as\nmeasured by transfer-performance on a downstream task. This suggests that\nneural collapse is not always desirable for representation learning, as\npreviously claimed. Finally, we give preliminary evidence of a \"cascading\ncollapse\" phenomenon, wherein some form of Neural Collapse occurs not only for\nthe last layer, but in earlier layers as well.

However, there are still some challenges when applying\ntransformers to real-world scenarios due to the fact that deep transformers are\nhard to train from scratch and the quadratic memory consumption w.r.t. the\nnumber of nodes. In this paper, we propose Graph Masked Autoencoders (GMAEs), a\nself-supervised transformer-based model for learning graph representations. To\naddress the above two challenges, we adopt the masking mechanism and the\nasymmetric encoder-decoder design. Specifically, GMAE takes partially masked\ngraphs as input, and reconstructs the features of the masked nodes. The encoder\nand decoder are asymmetric, where the encoder is a deep transformer and the\ndecoder is a shallow transformer. The masking mechanism and the asymmetric\ndesign make GMAE a memory-efficient model compared with conventional\ntransformers. We show that, when serving as a conventional self-supervised\ngraph representation model, GMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nthe graph classification task and the node classification task under common\ndownstream evaluation protocols. We also show that, compared with training in\nan end-to-end manner from scratch, we can achieve comparable performance after\npre-training and fine-tuning using GMAE while simplifying the training process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 01:04:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 07:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

In this\ncontext, we show that long-term post-bottleneck outcomes can depend crucially\non the rate at which a diminished population grows whilst recovering. That is,\ntwo otherwise identical populations, each having undergone the same bottleneck,\ncan fixate on dramatically different demographics due to different rates of\npost-bottleneck growth. This behaviour is moreover shown to change\nnon-trivially with different levels of mutation. The underlying mechanism can\nbe traced to intrinsic fluctuations whose standard deviation decreases in time\nwith the inverse square root of the growing population size. Crucially, such\ndecreasing fluctuations couple to the underlying dynamics and result in\ndistinct regimes of (non-equilibrium) demographic behaviour, delimited by\nabrupt transitions at critical population sizes.

First of\nall, this flow represents the first instance of a \"non-inflectional\" absolute\ninstability, within constant-viscosity formulation, which is triggered when one\nof the plates moves opposite to the bulk motion. More strikingly, with further\nincrease in the negative plate motion, the absolute instability ($\\textrm{AI}$)\ntransitions to an \"upstream\" convective instability ($\\textrm{CI}^-$), wherein\nan unstable wave packet moves opposite to the direction of the bulk flow. Thus,\nthe CPF exhibits a unique $\\textrm{CI}^+ \\to \\textrm{AI} \\to \\textrm{CI}^-$\ntransition, for a given Reynolds number ($Re$), where $\\textrm{CI}^+$ denotes\nthe commonly-observed case of a \"downstream\" convective instability. This type\nof transition has not been reported for other known examples of absolutely\nunstable flows. We compute the leading and trailing edge velocities for an\namplifying wave packet and find that, for the plane Poiseuille flow, both these\nvelocities approach zero as $Re \\to \\infty$. As a result, at high $Re$, even\nthe slightest of negative plate motions is sufficient to trigger $\\textrm{AI}$\nand subsequently $\\textrm{CI}^-$, as observed for the CPF. The wave-packet\ndispersion first increases with $Re$, followed by a decrease, which points to a\npeculiar \"dual\" role of viscosity in sustaining $\\textrm{AI}$ in the CPF,\nnamely, viscosity promotes sustenance of $\\textrm{AI}$ at moderate Reynolds\nnumbers but suppresses it at low and high Reynolds numbers. These results can\nbe well understood within the Ginzburg-Landau framework, and therefore can be\nexpected to have a wider applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 06:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

For example, medical researchers are\ninterested in treatment effects on hospitalizations in heart failure patients\nand sports injuries in athletes. Competing events, such as death, complicate\ncausal inference in studies of recurrent events because once a competing event\noccurs, an individual cannot have more recurrent events. Several statistical\nestimands have been studied in recurrent event settings, with and without\ncompeting events. However, the causal interpretations of these estimands, and\nthe conditions that are required to identify these estimands from observed\ndata, have yet to be formalized. Here we use a counterfactual framework for\ncausal inference to formulate several causal estimands in recurrent event\nsettings, with and without competing events. When competing events exist, we\nclarify when commonly used classical statistical estimands can be interpreted\nas causal quantities from the causal mediation literature, such as (controlled)\ndirect effects and total effects. Furthermore, we show that recent results on\ninterventionist mediation estimands allow us to define new causal estimands\nwith recurrent and competing events that may be of particular clinical\nrelevance in many subject matter settings. We use causal directed acyclic\ngraphs and single world intervention graphs to illustrate how to reason about\nidentification conditions for the various causal estimands using subject matter\nknowledge. Furthermore, using results on counting processes, we show how our\ncausal estimands and their identification conditions, which are articulated in\ndiscrete time, converge to classical continuous-time counterparts in the limit\nof fine discretizations of time. Finally, we propose several estimators and\nestablish their consistency for the various identifying functionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

However, it can be extremely\ntime-consuming and laborious to collect sufficient high-quality labeled data in\nmost practical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an\neffective solution to reduce the cost of labeling by simultaneously leveraging\nboth labeled and unlabeled data. In this work, we present Cross Labeling\nSupervision (CLS), a framework that generalizes the typical pseudo-labeling\nprocess. Based on FixMatch, where a pseudo label is generated from a\nweakly-augmented sample to teach the prediction on a strong augmentation of the\nsame input sample, CLS allows the creation of both pseudo and complementary\nlabels to support both positive and negative learning. To mitigate the\nconfirmation bias of self-labeling and boost the tolerance to false labels, two\ndifferent initialized networks with the same structure are trained\nsimultaneously. Each network utilizes high-confidence labels from the other\nnetwork as additional supervision signals. During the label generation phase,\nadaptive sample weights are assigned to artificial labels according to their\nprediction confidence. The sample weight plays two roles: quantify the\ngenerated labels' quality and reduce the disruption of inaccurate labels on\nnetwork training.

Extensive experiments\nquantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SAITS outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on the time-series imputation task efficiently and\nreveal SAITS' potential to improve the learning performance of pattern\nrecognition models on incomplete time-series data from the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 10:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 07:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

We studied the\ndynamic and thermal properties of two large plumes using observations from New\nVacuum Solar Telescope, the Solar Dynamic Observatory, and the Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead. We find that two large plumes observed\nwith high-resolution data are quite different from previously studied\nsmall-scale plumes. They are born at the top of a prominence bubble with a\nlarge projected area of 10-20 Mm^2 . Before the occurrence of each large plume,\nthe bubble expands and takes on a quasi-semicircular appearance. Meanwhile, the\nemission intensity of extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) bands increases in the bubble.\nA small-scale filament is found to erupt in the bubble during the second large\nplume. At the point at which the height of the bubble is comparable with half\nthe width of the bubble, the bubble becomes unstable and generates the plumes.\nDuring the formation of plumes, two side edges of the top of the bubble, which\nare dominated by opposite Doppler signals, approach each other. The large plume\nthen emerges and keeps rising up with a constant speed of about 13-15 km/s.\nThese two large plumes have temperatures of 1.3 x 10^6 Kelvin and densities of\n2.0 x 10^9 cm^-3, two orders hotter and one order less dense than the typical\nprominence. We also find that the bubble is a hot, low-density volume instead\nof a void region beneath the cold and dense prominence. Therefore, we conclude\nthat these two large plumes are the result of the breakup of the prominence\nbubble triggered by an enhancement of thermal pressure; they separate from the\nbubble, most likely by magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, our understanding of SBM with\nunbalanced communities (arguably, more relevant in practice) is still very\nlimited. In this paper, we provide a simple SVD-based algorithm for recovering\nthe communities in the SBM with communities of varying sizes. We improve upon a\nresult of Ailon, Chen and Xu [ICML 2013] by removing the assumption that there\nis a large interval such that the sizes of clusters do not fall in.

While\nsome recent studies propose to capture the dependencies across different types\nof behaviors, two important challenges have been less explored: i) Dealing with\nthe sparse supervision signal under target behaviors (e.g., purchase). ii)\nCapturing the personalized multi-behavior patterns with customized dependency\nmodeling. To tackle the above challenges, we devise a new model CML,\nContrastive Meta Learning (CML), to maintain dedicated cross-type behavior\ndependency for different users.

NER from speech is usually made through a two-step pipeline that\nconsists of (1) processing the audio using an Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR) system and (2) applying an NER tagger to the ASR outputs. Recent works\nhave shown the capability of the End-to-End (E2E) approach for NER from English\nand French speech, which is essentially entity-aware ASR. However, due to the\nmany homophones and polyphones that exist in Chinese, NER from Chinese speech\nis effectively a more challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndataset AISEHLL-NER for NER from Chinese speech. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to explore the performance of several state-of-the-art methods. The\nresults demonstrate that the performance could be improved by combining\nentity-aware ASR and pretrained NER tagger, which can be easily applied to the\nmodern SLU pipeline.

In this paper, we present a\nframework for moral reasoning about the justification of fairness metrics and\nexplore the moral implications of the use of fair-ml algorithms that optimize\nfor them. In particular, we argue that whether a distribution of outcomes is\nfair, depends not only on the cause of inequalities but also on what moral\nclaims decision subjects have to receive a particular benefit or avoid a\nburden. We use our framework to analyze the suitability of two fairness metrics\nunder different circumstances.

The objective is to provide\nelectricity, water, and natural gas supplies to critical customers in the\ndesired ratio according to their needs after an extreme event. The operational\nconstraints of electricity, water, and natural gas networks are considered. The\ncharacteristics of electricity-driven coupling components, including water\npumps and gas compressors, are also modeled.

Its frequency-domain formulation is computationally efficient when\nprocessing only a few discrete frequencies. However, classical FWI, which is\nformulated on the reduced-parameter space, requires starting the inversion with\na sufficiently-accurate initial model and low frequency to prevent being stuck\nin local minima due to cycle skipping. FWI with extended search space has been\nproposed to mitigate this issue. It contains two main steps: first,\ndata-assimilated (DA) wavefields are computed by allowing for wave-equation\nerrors to match the data at receivers closely. Then, subsurface parameters are\nestimated from these wavefields by minimizing the wave-equation errors. The DA\nwavefields are the least-squares solution of an overdetermined system gathering\nthe wave and observation equations. The numerical bandwidth of the resulting\nnormal-equation system is two times that of the wave-equation system, which can\nbe a limiting factor for 3D large-scale applications. Therefore, computing\nhighly accurate DA wavefields at a reasonable computational cost is an issue in\nextended FWI. This issue is addressed here by rewriting the normal system such\nthat its solution can be computed by solving the time-harmonic wave equation\nseveral times in sequence. Moreover, the computational burden of\nmulti-right-hand side (RHS) simulations is mitigated with a sketching method.\nFinally, we solve the time-harmonic wave equation with the convergent Born\nseries method, which conciliates accuracy and computational efficiency.\nApplication of the new extended FWI algorithm on the salt benchmark shows that\nit reconstructs at a reasonable cost subsurface models that are similar to\nthose obtained with the classical extended FWI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

In accordance\nwith previous literature, the parameters of the LPBF process have been\nsystematically varied, including layer resolution from 1 to 6, laser power from\n100 {\\mu}W to 220 {\\mu}W, bed temperature from 300 K to 1200 K, and laser scan\nspeed from 0.5 {\\AA}/ps to 0.0625 {\\AA}/ps. Consistent with prior macroscopic\nexperimental findings, the atomistic results suggest that additive\nmanufacturing using thinner layers imparts higher ultimate tensile strength\n(UTS) than fabricating with thicker layers. The latter, however, requires a\nshorter process time but induces keyhole defect formation if the laser-induced\ntemperature is not sufficiently high enough. Increasing the temperature proves\nuseful in mitigating this problem. Enhancement of UTS for the multi-rowed\npowders has been observed by raising the substrate temperature to 600 K or\nlaser power to 160 {\\mu}W during production. Beyond these critical limits,\nhowever, the UTS of the product diminishes due to the emergence of multiple\nvacancies. The results of our present study will help researchers to find a\ngood balance between the production speed and strength of additive manufactured\nproducts at the nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

However, for many applications an accurate measurement of a\ncluster's mass is essential. A systematic underestimate of hydrostatic masses\nfrom X-ray observations (the so-called hydrostatic bias) may be responsible for\ntension between the results of different cosmological measurements. We compare\nX-ray hydrostatic masses with masses estimated using the caustic method (based\non galaxy velocities) in order to explore the systematic uncertainties of both\nmethods and place new constraints on the level of hydrostatic bias. Hydrostatic\nand caustic mass profiles were determined independently for a sample of 44\nclusters based on Chandra observations of clusters from the Hectospec Cluster\nSurvey. This is the largest systematic comparison of its kind. Masses were\ncompared at a standardised radius ($R_{500}$) using a model that includes\npossible bias and scatter in both mass estimates. The systematics affecting\nboth mass determination methods were explored in detail. The hydrostatic masses\nwere found to be systematically higher than caustic masses on average, and we\nfound evidence that the caustic method increasingly underestimates the mass\nwhen fewer galaxies are used to measure the caustics. We limit our analysis to\nthe 14 clusters with the best-sampled caustics where this bias is minimised\n($\\ge210$ galaxies), and find that the average ratio of hydrostatic to caustic\nmass at $R_{500}$ is $M_X/M_C=1.12^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$.

While a shape coefficient embeds a combination\nof anatomical measures, a formalized approach to find the relationship between\nthem remains elusive in the literature. This limits the use of SSMs to\nsubjective evaluations in clinical practices. We propose a novel SSM controlled\nby anatomical parameters derived from morphometric analysis. The proposed\nanatomically parameterized SSM (ANAT-SSM) is based on learning a linear mapping\nbetween shape coefficients and selected anatomical parameters. This mapping is\nlearned from a synthetic population generated by the standard SSM. Determining\nthe pseudo-inverse of the mapping allows us to build the ANAT-SSM.

Transient phases are expected\nto be heterogeneous, either through photo-generated domain growth or by\ngenerating topological defects, and this impacts the dynamics of the system.\nHowever, this nanoscale heterogeneity has not been directly observed. Here we\nuse time- and spectrally resolved coherent X-ray imaging to track the\nprototypical light induced insulator-to-metal phase transition in vanadium\ndioxide on the nanoscale with femtosecond time resolution. We show that the\nearly-time dynamics are independent of the initial spatial heterogeneity and\nobserve a 200 fs switch to the metallic phase. A heterogeneous response emerges\nonly after hundreds of picoseconds. Through spectroscopic imaging, we reveal\nthat the transient metallic phase is a highly orthorhombically strained rutile\nmetallic phase, an interpretation that is in contrast to those based on\nspatially averaged probes.

Most studies on this granular system focus in the bulk of\nthe medium. In this region contacts are permanent or long-lived, so continuous\napproximations are able to yield results for velocity distributions or mass\nflow. Close to the exit, however, the density of the medium decreases and\ncontacts are instantaneous. Thus, the collisional nature of the dynamics\nbecomes significant, warranting a dedicated investigation as carried out in\nthis work. More interesting, the vicinity of the outlet is the region where the\narches that block the flow for small apertures are formed. It is found that the\ntransition from the clogging regime (at small apertures) to the continuous flow\nregime is smooth in collisional variables. Furthermore, the dynamics of\nparticles as reflected by the distributions of the velocities is as well\nunaffected. This result implies that there is no critical outlet size that\nseparates both regimes, as had been proposed in the literature.

About\ntwo-thirds (91) of the detected gETGs are unresolved, with sizes <4 kpc,\nconfirming the prevalence of compact radio sources in local sources. Forty-six\ngETGs show extended emission on scales ranging from 4 to 340 kpc, at least 80%\nof which have a FRI class morphology.

The science of quantum error correction, a discipline that seeks to\ncombine and protect quantum information from the effects of decoherence using\nstructures known as codes, has arisen to meet this challenge. Stabilizer codes,\na particular subclass of quantum codes, have enabled fast progress in the field\nof quantum error correction by allowing parallels to be drawn with the widely\nstudied field of classical error correction. This has resulted in the\nconstruction of the quantum counterparts of well-known capacity-approaching\nclassical codes like sparse codes and quantum turbo codes. However, quantum\ncodes obtained in this manner do not entirely evoke the stupendous error\ncorrecting abilities of their classical counterparts. This occurs because\nclassical strategies ignore important differences between the quantum and\nclassical paradigms, an issue that needs to be addressed if quantum error\ncorrection is to succeed in its battle with decoherence.

Key to our approach, is the\nuse of pristine crystalline hyperbolic dispersion media (HyM) which can support\nlarge momentum excitations with relatively low losses. Making a HyM cavity is\ncomplicated by the additional modes that appear in a HyM. Ordinarily, these\nserve as additional channels for leakage, reducing cavity performance. But, in\nour experiments, we find a BIC-like cavity confinement enhancement effect,\nwhich is intimately related to the ray-like nature of HyM excitations. In fact,\nthe quality factors of our cavities exceed the maximum that is possible in the\nabsence of higher order modes. The alliance of HyM with BICs in our work yields\na radically novel way to confine light and is expected to have far reaching\nconsequences wherever strong optical confinement is utilized, from ultra-strong\nlight-matter interactions, to mid-IR nonlinear optics and a range of sensing\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 11:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

A simple stochastic binary bundling rule\ninspired by the stochastic summation of neuronal activities allows the\nresulting memory state to represent both, item information as well as\nsequential information as long as it is non-associative. The memory state\nresulting from bundling together an arbitrary number of items is\nnon-homogeneous and has a degree of sparseness, which is controlled by the\nactivation threshold in summation. The bundling operation proposed allows to\nbuild a filter in the temporal as well as in the items' domain, which can be\nused to navigate the continuous inflow of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 12:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

We consider functions on binary inputs\nthat depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of\ncoordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how\nneural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent\nlow-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.\nAccordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large\nambient dimension $d$.\n  Our main results characterize a hierarchical property, the \"merged-staircase\nproperty\", that is both necessary and nearly sufficient for learning in this\nsetting.\n  We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of\nfunctions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of\nlearning efficiently. The key tools are a new \"dimension-free\" dynamics\napproximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of\nlow-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity\ntesting, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for\nnon-almost orthogonal functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Working group 13 (WG13) is responsible for the\nspectral analysis of the hottest stars (O, B and A type, with a formal cut-off\nof Teff > 7000 K) that were observed as part of GES. We present the procedures\nand techniques that have been applied to the reduced spectra, in order to\ndetermine the stellar parameters and abundances of these stars. The procedure\nused is similar to that of other working groups in GES. A number of groups\n(called `Nodes') each independently analyse the spectra, using their\nstate-of-the-art techniques and codes. Specific for the analysis in WG13 is the\nlarge temperature range that is covered (Teff = 7000 - 50,000 K), requiring the\nuse of different analysis codes. Most Nodes can therefore only handle part of\nthe data. Quality checks are applied to the results of these Nodes by comparing\nthem to benchmark stars, and by comparing them one to another. For each star\nthe Node values are then homogenised into a single result: the recommended\nparameters and abundances. Eight Nodes each analysed (part of) the data. In\ntotal 17,693 spectra of 6462 stars were analysed, most of them in 37 open star\nclusters.

Among these, compiler-based instrumentation is particularly\npromising, not requiring manual code modifications and being able to achieve\nprecise memory safety. Unfortunately, existing compiler-based solutions\ncompromise in many areas, including performance but also usability and memory\nsafety guarantees. New developments in hardware can help improve performance\nand security of compiler-based memory safety. ARM Pointer Authentication, added\nin the ARMv8.3 architecture, is intended to enable hardware-assisted Control\nFlow Integrity (CFI). But since its operations are generic, it also enables\nother, more comprehensive hardware-supported runtime integrity approaches. As\nsuch, we propose CryptSan, a memory safety approach based on ARM Pointer\nAuthentication. CryptSan uses pointer signatures to retrofit memory safety to\nC/C++ programs, protecting heap, stack, and globals against temporal and\nspatial vulnerabilities. We present a full LLVM-based prototype implementation,\nrunning on an M1 MacBook Pro, i.e., on actual ARMv8.3 hardware. Our prototype\nevaluation shows that the system outperforms similar approaches under\nreal-world conditions. This, together with its interoperability with\nuninstrumented libraries and cryptographic protection against attacks on\nmetadata, makes CryptSan a viable solution for retrofitting memory safety to\nC/C++ programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 14:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 12:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

In this work, we\nconstruct a deep-learning neural network to efficiently distinguish BBH signals\nfrom blip glitches. We introduce sine-Gaussian projection (SGP) maps, which are\nprojections of GW frequency-domain data snippets on a basis of sine-Gaussians\ndefined by the quality factor and central frequency. We feed the SGP maps to\nour deep-learning neural network, which classifies the BBH signals and blips.\nWhereas the BBH signals are simulated, the blips used are taken from real data\nthroughout our analysis. We show that our network significantly improves the\nidentification of the BBH signals in comparison to the results obtained using\ntraditional-$\\chi^2$ and sine-Gaussian $\\chi^2$. For example, our network\nimproves the sensitivity by 75% at a false-positive rate of $10^{-2}$ for BBHs\nwith total mass in the range $[80,140]~M_{\\odot}$ and SNR in the range $[3,8]$.\nAlso, it correctly identifies 95% of the real GW events in GWTC-3. The\ncomputation time for classification is a few minutes for thousands of SGP maps\non a single core.

In this work we study\ndepartures from the restrictive degeneracy condition -- starting from a\nfiducial model containing an exact Minkowski space solution, we break the\ndegeneracy condition in numerous simple ways to test if the resulting models\nmaintain certain key features -- specifically the dynamical cancellation of a\nlarge vacuum energy by the scalar field and the existence of a low energy\nvacuum state. We highlight the role the tadpole plays in eliminating the fixed\npoints of the dynamical system, generically rendering both the scalar field and\nmetric time dependent. Our results indicate that when violating the degeneracy\ncondition but preserving shift symmetry, the metric maintains an asymptotic\nMinkowski state, irrespective of the presence of the cosmological constant. In\ncontrast, when shift symmetry is also broken the asymptotic behaviour can\nradically alter. Regardless, the non-degenerate models in this work share an\nattractive quality; harboring low energy, late-time asymptotic states that are\nindependent of the vacuum energy.

For the field of size $q$, the natural $t$-flat tester\nwas shown to be optimal first by Bhattacharyya et al. for $q=2$, and later by\nHaramaty et al. for all prime powers $q$. The dependency on the field size,\nhowever, is a tower-type function.\n  We improve the results above, showing that the dependency on the field size\nis polynomial.

Neither online\ninertia nor the speed of the committed units is considered in the scheduling\nprocess. With the increasing injection of uncertain renewable energy sources,\nthis practice is starting to fall short especially in island power systems,\nwhere the primary frequency response is already scarce, and any contingency\nleads to potentially poor frequency response. This paper introduces a data\ndriven linear constraint to improve the post-fault frequency quality in island\npower systems. A coherent initial data-set is obtained by simulating the system\nfrequency response of single outages. Then logistic regression is employed as a\npredictive analytic procedure to differentiate the acceptable and unacceptable\nincidents. To compare the conventional methods with the proposed approach and\nalso to handle the uncertain nature of renewable energy generation, an adaptive\nrobust unit commitment formulation is utilized. Results for the island power\nsystem of La Palma show that depending on the chosen cut-point on the logistic\nregression estimation the proposed method can improve the frequency response\nquality of the system while reducing the operation costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 15:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 13:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Process discovery is one of the\nmost critical parts of process mining, which aims at discovering process models\nautomatically from event logs. The performance of existing process discovery\nalgorithms can be affected when there are missing activity labels in event\nlogs. Several methods have been proposed to repair missing activity labels, but\ntheir accuracy can drop when a large number of activity labels are missing.

Although many models exist to\npredict traffic flow, human mobility patterns have not been well explored in\nthis regard. To reduce this research gap and learn human mobility knowledge\nfrom this fixed travel behaviors, we propose a multi-pattern passenger flow\nprediction framework, MPGCN, based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).\nFirstly, we construct a novel sharing-stop network to model relationships\nbetween passengers based on bus record data.

These large databases are well suited to train machine-learning\nmodels, for instance for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical\nsettings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative -- rather than\ngenerative -- modeling, and thus open the door to new missing-values\nstrategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing\nvalues have focused on inferential statistics. RESULTS: Here we conduct a\nsystematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a\nfocus on large health databases: four electronic health record datasets, a\npopulation brain imaging one, a health survey and two intensive care ones.\nUsing gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with\nsimple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate\nprediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we\nfind that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is\nimportant, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate\nmissing values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies\nbut requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model\nmissing values-with missing incorporated attribute-leads to robust, fast, and\nwell-performing predictive modeling.

We show that for any graph $G$, there always exists a\n$G$-HEF-$k$ allocation of goods, where $k$ is the size of a minimum vertex\ncover of $G$, and that this is essentially tight. We show that $G$-EFX\nallocations of goods exist for three different classes of graphs -- two of them\ngeneralizing the star $K_{1, n-1}$ and the third generalizing the three-edge\npath $P_4$. Many of these results extend to allocations of chores as well.\nOverall, we show several natural settings in which the graph structure helps\nobtain strong fairness guarantees. Finally, we evaluate an algorithm using\nproblem instances from Spliddit to show that $G$-EFX allocations appear to\nexist for paths $P_n$, pointing the way towards showing EFX for even broader\nfamilies of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 19:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

To tackle this, we propose NEUROSEQRET which learns to retrieve and\nrank a relevant set of continuous-time event sequences for a given query\nsequence, from a large corpus of sequences. More specifically, NEUROSEQRET\nfirst applies a trainable unwarping function on the query sequence, which makes\nit comparable with corpus sequences, especially when a relevant query-corpus\npair has individually different attributes. Next, it feeds the unwarped query\nsequence and the corpus sequence into MTPP guided neural relevance models.
