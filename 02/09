Existing sanitizers enforce checks and catch such bugs during\ndevelopment and testing. However, they either provide partial memory safety or\nhave overwhelmingly high performance overheads. Our novel sanitizer PACSan\nenforces spatial and temporal memory safety with no false positives at low\nperformance overheads. PACSan removes the majority of the overheads involved in\npointer tracking by sealing metadata in pointers through ARM PA (Pointer\nAuthentication), and performing the memory safety checks when pointers are\ndereferenced. We have developed a prototype of PACSan and systematically\nevaluated its security and performance on the Magma, Juliet, Nginx, and SPEC\nCPU2017 test suites, respectively. In our evaluation, PACSan shows no false\npositives together with negligible false negatives, while introducing stronger\nsecurity guarantees and lower performance overheads than state-of-the-art\nsanitizers, including HWASan, ASan, SoftBound+CETS, Memcheck, LowFat, and\nPTAuth. Specifically, PACSan has 0.84x runtime overhead and 1.92x memory\noverhead on average. Compared to the widely deployed ASan, PACSan has no false\npositives and much fewer false negatives and reduces 7.172% runtime overheads\nand 89.063%memory overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 16:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The mainly existing literature learns representations of social\ninteractions by deep learning networks, while the explicit interaction patterns\nare not utilized. Different interaction patterns, such as following or\ncollision avoiding, will generate different trends of next movement, thus, the\nawareness of social interaction patterns is important for trajectory\nforecasting. Moreover, the social interaction patterns are privacy concerned or\nlack of labels. To jointly address the above issues, we present a social-dual\nconditional variational auto-encoder (Social-DualCVAE) for multi-modal\ntrajectory forecasting, which is based on a generative model conditioned not\nonly on the past trajectories but also the unsupervised classification of\ninteraction patterns. After generating the category distribution of the\nunlabeled social interaction patterns, DualCVAE, conditioned on the past\ntrajectories and social interaction pattern, is proposed for multi-modal\ntrajectory prediction by latent variables estimating.

We argue that the feature statistics (mean and\nstandard deviation), which carry the domain characteristics of the training\ndata, can be properly manipulated to improve the generalization ability of deep\nlearning models. Common methods often consider the feature statistics as\ndeterministic values measured from the learned features and do not explicitly\nconsider the uncertain statistics discrepancy caused by potential domain shifts\nduring testing. In this paper, we improve the network generalization ability by\nmodeling the uncertainty of domain shifts with synthesized feature statistics\nduring training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature statistic, after\nconsidering the potential uncertainties, follows a multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution. Hence, each feature statistic is no longer a deterministic value,\nbut a probabilistic point with diverse distribution possibilities. With the\nuncertain feature statistics, the models can be trained to alleviate the domain\nperturbations and achieve better robustness against potential domain shifts.\nOur method can be readily integrated into networks without additional\nparameters.

This\nmakes them applicable to practically important use-cases where training data is\nscarce. Rather than being learned, this knowledge can be embedded by enforcing\ninvariance to those transformations. Invariance can be imposed using\ngroup-equivariant convolutions followed by a pooling operation.\n  For rotation-invariance, previous work investigated replacing the spatial\npooling operation with invariant integration which explicitly constructs\ninvariant representations. Invariant integration uses monomials which are\nselected using an iterative approach requiring expensive pre-training. We\npropose a novel monomial selection algorithm based on pruning methods to allow\nan application to more complex problems.

This paper introduces a self-supervised\nlearning framework suitable for hyperspectral images that are inherently\nchallenging to annotate. The proposed framework architecture leverages\ncross-domain CNN, allowing for learning representations from different\nhyperspectral images with varying spectral characteristics and no pixel-level\nannotation. In the framework, cross-domain representations are learned via\ncontrastive learning where neighboring spectral vectors in the same image are\nclustered together in a common representation space encompassing multiple\nhyperspectral images. In contrast, spectral vectors in different hyperspectral\nimages are separated into distinct clusters in the space. To verify that the\nlearned representation through contrastive learning is effectively transferred\ninto a downstream task, we perform a classification task on hyperspectral\nimages. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed\nself-supervised representation over models trained from scratch or other\ntransfer learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 16:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In order to arrive at\nstability of the biologically-relevant endemic equilibrium characterized by\ncoexistence of antibody and CTL responses, the parameters promoting CTL\nresponses need to be boosted over parameters promoting antibody production.\nThis result may seem counter-intuitive (in that a weaker antibody response is\nbetter) but can be understood in terms of a balance between CTL and antibody\nresponses that is needed to permit existence of CTLs. In conclusion, an\nintervention such as a vaccine that is intended to control a persistent viral\ninfection with both immune responses should moderate the antibody response to\nallow for stimulation of the CTL response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 16:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Our method searches over\nclassifiers of the data representation to find plausible labelings. We call\nthis paradigm data consistent weak supervision. A key facet of our framework is\nthat we are able to estimate labels for data examples low or no coverage from\nthe weak supervision. In addition, we make no assumptions about the joint\ndistribution of the weak signals and true labels of the data. Instead, we use\nweak signals and the data features to solve a constrained optimization that\nenforces data consistency among the labels we generate.

Nevertheless, these emerging markets - similar to traditional\nemerging marketplaces - can be seen as a great opportunity for illegal\nactivities (e.g., money laundering, sale of illegal goods etc.). In this study\nwe focus on a specific marketplace, namely NBA TopShot, that facilitates the\npurchase and (peer-to-peer) trading of sports collectibles. Our objective is to\nbuild a framework that is able to label peer-to-peer transactions on the\nplatform as anomalous or not. To achieve our objective we begin by building a\nmodel for the profit to be made by selling a specific collectible on the\nplatform. We then use RFCDE - a random forest model for the conditional density\nof the dependent variable - to model the errors from the profit models. This\nstep allows us to estimate the probability of a transaction being anomalous. We\nfinally label as anomalous any transaction whose aforementioned probability is\nless than 1%. Given the absence of ground truth for evaluating the model in\nterms of its classification of transactions, we analyze the trade networks\nformed from these anomalous transactions and compare it with the full trade\nnetwork of the platform. Our results indicate that these two networks are\nstatistically different when it comes to network metrics such as, edge density,\nclosure, node centrality and node degree distribution. This network analysis\nprovides additional evidence that these transactions do not follow the same\npatterns that the rest of the trades on the platform follow.

In a conventional insulator, the charge carrier\nconcentration vanishes, when an energy gap separates filled and unfilled\nelectronic states. In the established picture of a Mott insulator, by contrast,\nelectronic interactions cause coherent charge carriers to slow down and\neventually stop in electronic grid-lock without materially affecting the\ncarrier concentration itself. This description has so far escaped experimental\nverification by quantum oscillation measurements, which directly probe the\nvelocity distribution of the coherent charge carriers. By extending this\ntechnique to high pressure we were able to examine the evolution of carrier\nconcentration and velocity in the strongly correlated metallic state of the\nclean, crystalline material NiS$_2$, while tuning the system towards the Mott\ninsulating phase. Our results confirm that pronounced electronic slowing down\nindeed governs the approach to the insulating state. However, the critical\npoint itself, at which the carrier velocity would reach zero and the effective\ncarrier mass diverge, is concealed by the insulating sector of the phase\ndiagram. In the resulting, more nuanced view of Mott localisation, the\ninaccessibility of the low temperature Mott critical point resembles that of\nthe threshold of magnetic order in clean metallic systems, where criticality is\nalmost universally interrupted by first order transitions, tricritical\nbehaviour or novel emergent phases such as unconventional superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 17:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In this paper, we consider the knapsack\nsemilinearity of HNN-extensions, where the stable letter $t$ acts trivially by\nconjugation on the associated subgroup $A$ of the base group $G$. We show that\nunder some additional technical conditions, knapsack semilinearity transfers\nfrom base group $G$ to the HNN-extension $H$. These additional technical\nconditions are satisfied in many cases, e.g., when $A$ is a centralizer in $G$\nor $A$ is a quasiconvex subgroup of the hyperbolic group $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 18:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 17:39:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 10:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

In this\npaper, we propose POET, a computational Genetic Programming tool based on\nevolutionary computation methods to enhance screening and mutagenesis in\nDirected Evolution and help protein engineers to find proteins that have better\nfunctionality. As a proof-of-concept we use peptides that generate MRI contrast\ndetected by the Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer contrast mechanism. The\nevolutionary methods used in POET are described, and the performance of POET in\ndifferent epochs of our experiments with Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer\ncontrast are studied.

The networks focus on the\ncore of the data distribution, leaving the tails - or the edges of the\ndistribution - behind. We argue that this bias is responsible not only for\nfairness concerns, but that it plays a key role in the collapse of\nlatent-traversal editing methods when deviating away from the distribution's\ncore. Building on this observation, we outline a method for mitigating\ngenerative bias through a self-conditioning process, where distances in the\nlatent-space of a pre-trained generator are used to provide initial labels for\nthe data. By fine-tuning the generator on a re-sampled distribution drawn from\nthese self-labeled data, we force the generator to better contend with rare\nsemantic attributes and enable more realistic generation of these properties.\nWe compare our models to a wide range of latent editing methods, and show that\nby alleviating the bias they achieve finer semantic control and better identity\npreservation through a wider range of transformations.

Subsequently, we use a\ndeep neural network (DNN) to represent the magnetic field as a function of\nspace and parameters that describe geometric features and operating points. We\ntrain the DNN by minimizing the physics-informed functional using stochastic\ngradient descent.

We design a novel correlation-driven joint-bone fusion graph\nconvolutional network (CD-JBF-GCN) as an encoder and use a pose prediction head\nas a decoder to achieve semi-supervised learning.

This fact provides a\nrigorous meaning to the asymptotic simplification that some optimal control\nproblems appear to enjoy over long time intervals, allowing the consideration\nof the corresponding stationary problem for computing and applications. We\nreview a slice of the theory developed over the past decade --the\ncontrollability of the underlying system is an important ingredient, and can\neven be used to devise simple turnpike-like strategies which are nearly\noptimal--, and present several novel applications, including, among many\nothers, the characterization of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman asymptotics, and\nstability estimates in deep learning via residual neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 19:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Both methods either lead to high prediction errors near\nthe edge or cannot be trained in an end-to-end manner. Another problem is that\nexisting methods may fail to detect objects of various sizes due to the lack of\nefficient and effective feature fusion mechanisms. In this work, we propose to\ndecompose the saliency detection task into two cascaded sub-tasks, \\emph{i.e.},\ndetail modeling and body filling. Specifically, the detail modeling focuses on\ncapturing the object edges by supervision of explicitly decomposed detail label\nthat consists of the pixels that are nested on the edge and near the edge. Then\nthe body filling learns the body part which will be filled into the detail map\nto generate more accurate saliency map.

In this work, we attempt to identify\nthe dynamic regime from limited measurement data in a stratified wake with\n(nominally) unknown $Re$ and $Fr$. A large database of candidate basis\nfunctions is compiled by pooling the DMD modes obtained in prior DNS. A sparse\nmodel is built using the Forward Regression with Orthogonal Least Squares\n(FROLS) algorithm, which sequentially identifies DMD modes that best represent\nthe data and calibrates their amplitude and phase. After calibration, the\nvelocity field can be reconstructed using a weighted combination of the\ndominant DMD modes. The dynamic regime for the measurements is estimated via a\nprojection-weighted average of $Re$ and $Fr$ corresponding to the identified\nmodes. Regime identification is carried out from a limited number of 2D\nvelocity snapshots from numerical and experimental datasets, as well as 3 point\nmeasurements in the wake of the body. A metric to assess confidence is\nintroduced based on the observed predictive capability.

These connected devices have created a security blind\nspot, where cybercriminals can easily launch an attack to compromise the\ndevices using malware proliferation techniques. Therefore, malware detection is\nconsidered a lifeline for the survival of IoT devices against cyberattacks.\nThis study proposes a novel IoT Malware Detection Architecture (iMDA) using\nsqueezing and boosting dilated convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed\narchitecture exploits the concepts of edge and smoothing, multi-path dilated\nconvolutional operations, channel squeezing, and boosting in CNN. Edge and\nsmoothing operations are employed with split-transform-merge (STM) blocks to\nextract local structure and minor contrast variation in the malware images. STM\nblocks performed multi-path dilated convolutional operations, which helped\nrecognize the global structure of malware patterns. Additionally, channel\nsqueezing and merging helped to get the prominent reduced and diverse feature\nmaps, respectively. Channel squeezing and boosting are applied with the help of\nSTM block at the initial, middle and final levels to capture the texture\nvariation along with the depth for the sake of malware pattern hunting.

Recently,\neffective second-order methods, such as KFAC, K-BFGS, Shampoo, and TNT, have\nbeen developed for training DNNs, by preconditioning the stochastic gradient by\nlayer-wise block-diagonal matrices. Here we propose a \"mini-block Fisher (MBF)\"\npreconditioned gradient method, that lies in between these two classes of\nmethods. Specifically, our method uses a block-diagonal approximation to the\nempirical Fisher matrix, where for each layer in the DNN, whether it is\nconvolutional or feed-forward and fully connected, the associated diagonal\nblock is itself block-diagonal and is composed of a large number of mini-blocks\nof modest size. Our novel approach utilizes the parallelism of GPUs to\nefficiently perform computations on the large number of matrices in each layer.\nConsequently, MBF's per-iteration computational cost is only slightly higher\nthan it is for first-order methods. The performance of our proposed method is\ncompared to that of several baseline methods, on both autoencoder and CNN\nproblems, to validate its effectiveness both in terms of time efficiency and\ngeneralization power.

To overcome such\nlimitations, we propose an untrimmed action anticipation task, which, similarly\nto temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test\ntime, while still requiring predictions to be made before the actions actually\ntake place. We design an evaluation procedure for methods designed to address\nthis novel task, and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100\ndataset. Experiments show that the performance of current models designed for\ntrimmed action anticipation is very limited and more research on this task is\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 20:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

The localized state is of strong carbon \\textit{p}\ncharacter and reminiscent of the localization of the unpaired electron in the\nethyl radical molecule. The radiative lifetime for the defect-bound exciton is\ncalculated to be on the order of $\\mu$s, much longer than other quantum defects\nsuch as the NV center in diamond and in agreement with experiments. The longer\nlifetime is associated with the small transition dipole moment as a result of\nthe very different nature of the localized and delocalized states forming the\ndefect-bound exciton. Finally, we use first principles calculations to assess\nthe stability of the T-center. We find the T-center to be stable against\ndecomposition into simpler defects when keeping the stoichiometry fixed.\nHowever, we identify that the T-center is easily prone to (de)hydrogenation and\nso requires very precise annealing conditions (temperature and atmosphere) to\nbe efficiently formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 21:17:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 20:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

Near periodicity of normal voice\nsignals makes short-time harmonic modeling an appealing choice to extract vocal\nfeature parameters. For dysphonic voice, however, a fixed harmonic structure\ncould be too constrained as it strictly enforces periodicity in the model.\nSlight variation in amplitude or frequency in the signal may cause the model to\nmisrepresent the observed signal. To address these issues, this paper presents\na time-varying harmonic model, which allows its fundamental frequency and\nharmonic amplitudes to be polynomial functions of time. The model decouples the\nslow deviations of frequency and amplitude from fast irregular vocal fold\nvibratory behaviors such as subharmonics and diplophonia. The time-varying\nmodel is shown to track the frequency and amplitude modulations present in\nvoice with severe tremor. This reduces the sensitivity of the model-based\nharmonics-to-noise ratio measures to slow frequency and amplitude variations\nwhile maintaining its sensitivity to increase in turbulent noise or the\npresence of irregular vibration. Other uses of the model include the vocal\ntract filter estimation and the rates of frequency and intensity changes. These\nuse cases are experimentally demonstrated along with the modeling accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 21:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

This method consists in a set\nof 14 PDEs for the density, momentum, pressure tensor components, heat flux\nvector and fourth-order moment associated to the particle velocity distribution\nfunction. The model is applied to the study of collisionless ion dynamics in a\nHall thruster-like configuration, and its accuracy is assessed against\ndifferent models, including the Vlasov kinetic equation. Three test cases are\nconsidered: a purely axial acceleration problem, the problem of ion-wave\ntrapping and finally the evolution of ions in the axial-azimuthal plane.\n  Most of this work considers ions only, and the coupling with electrons is\nremoved by prescribing reasonable values of the electric field.

Compared with state-of-the-art secure aggregation\nprotocols, SwiftAgg significantly reduces the communication overheads without\nany compromise on security. Specifically, in presence of at most $D$ dropout\nusers, SwiftAgg achieves a users-to-server communication load of $(T+1)L$ and a\nusers-to-users communication load of up to $(N-1)(T+D+1)L$, with a worst-case\ninformation-theoretic security guarantee, against any subset of up to $T$\nsemi-honest users who may also collude with the curious server. The key idea of\nSwiftAgg is to partition the users into groups of size $D+T+1$, then in the\nfirst phase, secret sharing and aggregation of the individual models are\nperformed within each group, and then in the second phase, model aggregation is\nperformed on $D+T+1$ sequences of users across the groups. If a user in a\nsequence drops out in the second phase, the rest of the sequence remain silent.\nThis design allows only a subset of users to communicate with each other, and\nonly the users in a single group to directly communicate with the server,\neliminating the requirements of 1) all-to-all communication network across\nusers; and 2) all users communicating with the server, for other secure\naggregation protocols. This helps to substantially slash the communication\ncosts of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 22:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 11:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address\nprivacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging\ndata. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to\nmap from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of\nthe imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across\ndifferent acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be\nfixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across\nsites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional\ncollaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based\non Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a\ntwo-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and\nsubject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is\nlearned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR\nimages based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a\nmapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the\nprior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable\nreconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing\ndata-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional\ndatasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP\nagainst site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as\nwell as traditional reconstruction methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 22:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 18:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

As a result, when loading data, if we anticipate future selective\n(point or range) queries, we typically maintain an index that is gradually\npopulated as new data is ingested. In that respect, indexing can be perceived\nas the process of adding structure to an incoming, otherwise unsorted, data\ncollection. The process of adding structure comes at a cost, as instead of\nsimply appending incoming data, every new entry is inserted into the index. If\nthe data ingestion order matches the indexed attribute order, the ingestion\ncost is entirely redundant and can be avoided (e.g., via bulk loading in a\nB+-tree). However, state-of-the-art index designs do not benefit when data is\ningested in an order that is close to being sorted but not fully sorted. In\nthis paper, we study how indexes can benefit from partial data sortedness or\nnear-sortedness, and we propose an ensemble of techniques that combine bulk\nloading, index appends, variable node fill/split factor, and buffering, to\noptimize the ingestion cost of a tree index in presence of partial data\nsortedness. We further augment the proposed design with necessary metadata\nstructures to ensure competitive read performance. We apply the proposed design\nparadigm on a state-of-the-art B+-tree, and we propose the Ordered Sort-Merge\ntree (OSM-tree). OSM-tree outperforms the state of the art by up to 8.8x in\ningestion performance in the presence of sortedness, while falling back to a\nB+-tree's ingestion performance when data is scrambled. OSM-tree offers\ncompetitive query performance, leading to performance benefits between 28% and\n5x for mixed read/write workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 22:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Furthermore, in observational\nstudies, treatment assignment is likely to be confounded. Many statistical\nmethods have emerged for causal inference under unconfoundedness conditions\ngiven pre-treatment covariates, including propensity score-based methods,\nprognostic score-based methods, and doubly robust methods. Unfortunately for\napplied researchers, there is no `one-size-fits-all' causal method that can\nperform optimally universally. In practice, causal methods are primarily\nevaluated quantitatively on handcrafted simulated data. Such data-generative\nprocedures can be of limited value because they are typically stylized models\nof reality. They are simplified for tractability and lack the complexities of\nreal-world data. For applied researchers, it is critical to understand how well\na method performs for the data at hand. Our work introduces a deep generative\nmodel-based framework, Credence, to validate causal inference methods. The\nframework's novelty stems from its ability to generate synthetic data anchored\nat the empirical distribution for the observed sample, and therefore virtually\nindistinguishable from the latter. The approach allows the user to specify\nground truth for the form and magnitude of causal effects and confounding bias\nas functions of covariates. Thus simulated data sets are used to evaluate the\npotential performance of various causal estimation methods when applied to data\nsimilar to the observed sample.

Rate equations\ndefining the dynamics of state variables are obtained from simplifications of a\nrecent manuscript in which electronic processes (i.e., electron\ncapture/emission) were combined with atomic processes (i.e., Frenkel pair\ngeneration/recombination, diffusion) stemming from the thermochemical model of\ndielectric breakdown.

In many real applications of fault\ndetection and diagnosis, data tend to be imbalanced, meaning that the number of\nsamples for some fault classes is much less than the normal data samples. At\nthe same time, in an industrial condition, accelerometers encounter high levels\nof disruptive signals and the collected samples turn out to be heavily noisy.\nAs a consequence, many traditional Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD)\nframeworks get poor classification performances when dealing with real-world\ncircumstances. Three main solutions have been proposed in the literature to\ncope with this problem: (1) the implementation of generative algorithms to\nincrease the amount of under-represented input samples, (2) the employment of a\nclassifier being powerful to learn from imbalanced and noisy data, (3) the\ndevelopment of an efficient data pre-processing including feature extraction\nand data augmentation. This paper proposes a hybrid framework which uses the\nthree aforementioned components to achieve an effective signal-based FDD system\nfor imbalanced conditions. Specifically, it first extracts the fault features,\nusing Fourier and wavelet transforms to make full use of the signals. Then, it\nemploys Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) to generate\nsynthetic samples to populate the rare fault class and enhance the training\nset. Moreover, to achieve a higher performance a novel combination of\nConvolutional Long Short-term Memory (CLSTM) and Weighted Extreme Learning\nMachine (WELM) is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the developed\nframework, different datasets settings on different imbalance severities and\nnoise degrees were used. The comparative results demonstrate that in different\nscenarios GAN-CLSTM-ELM outperforms the other state-of-the-art FDD frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 01:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

To further improve\nthat computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order\ninformation in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study\nthe normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter\nestimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient\ndescent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the\nHessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the\npopulation loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when\n$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the\nNormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter\nafter a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed\ndimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational\ncomplexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This\ncomputational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient\ndescent algorithm, which is of the order $\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\tau})$ for some $\\tau\n> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius.

The resultant gravitational waves are predicted with a peak\namplitude of ${\\cal O}(10^{-12})$ at a frequency of $10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$ Hz,\nwhich can be tested with future space-based instruments such as DECIGO and BBO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 01:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Autonomous intersection\nmanagement requires time and speed adjustment of vehicles arriving at an\nintersection for collision-free passing through the intersection. Due to its\ncomputational complexity, this problem has been studied only when vehicle\narrival times towards the vicinity of the intersection are known beforehand,\nwhich limits the applicability of these solutions for real-time deployment. To\nsolve the real-time autonomous traffic intersection management problem, we\npropose a reinforcement learning (RL) based multiagent architecture and a novel\nRL algorithm coined multi-discount Q-learning. In multi-discount Q-learning, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective way to solve a Markov Decision Process by\npreserving both short-term and long-term goals, which is crucial for\ncollision-free speed control.

Although the\nmonitoring of the station behaviors can be realized by anomaly detection on\nmultivariate time series, due to complex correlations and various temporal\npatterns of multivariate series in large-scale stations, building a general\nunsupervised anomaly detection model with a higher F1-score remains a\nchallenging task. In this paper, we propose a General representation of\nmultivariate time series for Anomaly Detection(GenAD). First, we pre-train a\ngeneral model on large-scale wireless base stations with self-supervision,\nwhich can be easily transferred to a specific station anomaly detection with a\nsmall amount of training data. Second, we employ Multi-Correlation Attention\nand Time-Series Attention to represent the correlations and temporal patterns\nof the stations. With the above innovations, GenAD increases F1-score by total\n9% on real-world datasets in China Mobile, while the performance does not\nsignificantly degrade on public datasets with only 10% of the training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 03:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

In the previous studies,\nDECIGO's parameters were optimized to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nof the PGW to quantum noise including the effect of diffraction loss. To\nsimulate the SNR more realistically, we optimize DECIGO's parameters\nconsidering the GWs from double white dwarfs (DWDs) and the thermal noise of\ntest masses. We consider two cases of the cutoff frequency of GWs from DWDs. In\naddition, we consider two kinds of thermal noise: thermal noise in a residual\ngas and internal thermal noise.

As a result, we obtained the optimums for the\nparameters that maximize the SNR that depends on the mirror radius.

Numerical simulations based on an\nadaptive augmented Lagrangian scheme are used to study the two-dimensional flow\nfield of yield-stress fluids within and around vane tools with N=3 to 24 arms\nfor a wide range of Bingham numbers, B (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress over\nthe characteristic viscous stress). This allows for accurate calculations of\nthe velocity and stress fields around vanes with various geometries, as well as\ndirect comparison to experimental observations of the output torque measured by\na rheometer, revealing sources of variation and error. We describe the impact\nof the vane structure on the fluid velocity field, from few-arm cruciform vanes\n(N < 6) that significantly perturb the flow away from ideal azimuthal\nkinematics, to many-arm fractal vanes (N > 12) in which the internal structural\nfeatures are successfully ``cloaked\" by a yield surface. This results in the\nshearing of an almost-circular ring of viscoplastic fluid that is\nindistinguishable from the annular ring of fluid deformed around a slip-free\nrotating cylindrical bob and leads to more accurate rheometric measurements of\nthe material flow curve. Moreover, in direct comparison with data from previous\nliterature, we show that slip conditions on the vane surface do not impact the\nvelocity field or measured overall torque T, whereas slip conditions on the\nsmooth outer wall have significant impact on data, even when using a vane\ngeometry.

As the\nresolution in object detection is much larger than in image recognition, the\ncomputational cost of the backbone often dominates the total inference cost.\nThis heavy-backbone design paradigm is mostly due to the historical legacy when\ntransferring image recognition models to object detection rather than an\nend-to-end optimized design for object detection. In this work, we show that\nsuch paradigm indeed leads to sub-optimal object detection models. To this end,\nwe propose a novel heavy-neck paradigm, GiraffeDet, a giraffe-like network for\nefficient object detection.

Recent theoretical and observational developments have led to\nrenewed interest in double degenerate models, in particular the \"helium-ignited\nviolent merger\" or \"dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation\"\n(D$^6$). In this paper we take the output of an existing D$^6$ SN model and\ncarry it into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase up to 4000 years after the\nexplosion, past the time when all the ejecta have been shocked. Assuming a\nuniform ambient medium, we reveal specific signatures of the explosion\nmechanism and spatial variations intrinsic to the ejecta. The first detonation\nproduces an ejecta tail visible at early times, while the second detonation\nleaves a central density peak in the ejecta that is visible at late times. The\nSNR shell is off-centre at all times, because of an initial velocity shift due\nto binary motion. The companion WD produces a large conical shadow in the\nejecta, visible in projection as a dark patch surrounded by a bright ring. This\nis a clear and long-lasting feature that is localized, and its impact on the\nobserved morphology is dependent on the viewing angle of the SNR. These results\noffer a new way to diagnose the explosion mechanism and progenitor system using\nobservations of a Type Ia SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 04:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Improperly sized boxes with box dimensions much larger than the\nproduct dimensions create wastage and unduly increase the shipping costs. Since\nit is infeasible to make unique, tailor-made boxes for each of the $N$\nproducts, the fundamental question that confronts e-commerce companies is: How\nmany $K << N$ cuboidal boxes need to manufactured and what should be their\ndimensions? In this paper, we propose a solution for the single-count shipment\ncontaining one product per box in two steps: (i) reduce it to a clustering\nproblem in the $3$ dimensional space of length, width and height where each\ncluster corresponds to the group of products that will be shipped in a\nparticular size variant, and (ii) present an efficient forward-backward\ndecision tree based clustering method with low computational complexity on $N$\nand $K$ to obtain these $K$ clusters and corresponding box dimensions. Our\nalgorithm has multiple constituent parts, each specifically designed to achieve\na high-quality clustering solution. As our method generates clusters in an\nincremental fashion without discarding the present solution, adding or deleting\na size variant is as simple as stopping the backward pass early or executing it\nfor one more iteration.

To\nclarify the mechanism of the high-TC ferromagnetism, we have investigated the\nelectronic structure and magnetic properties of an (In,Fe)Sb thin film by\nperforming x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Fe L2,3 edges. The magnetic-field\ndependence of the XMCD spectra reveals that there are ferromagnetic-like Fe and\nparamagnetic-like Fe components in the (In,Fe)Sb thin film. The XAS and XMCD\nspectra of the ferromagnetic-like and paramagnetic-like Fe components resemble\nthose of other Fe-doped FMSs and extrinsic oxides, respectively. The finite\nvalue of the ratio between the orbital and spin magnetic moments estimated by\napplying the XMCD sum rules indicates that the valence state of the Fe ions\nsubstituting for the In sites in (In,Fe)Sb is not purely ionic Fe3+, but\nintermediate between Fe3+ and Fe2+.

The results of tribological analysis\ncarried out using a standard ball-on-disc tribometer at different loads (2N, 5N\nand 7N) exhibited advantageous effects of zirconia coating on Ti6Al4V.\nProminently, the sample coated at 200 C substrate temperature maintained very\nlow coefficient of friction up to hundreds of sliding cycles and showed a\nnotable reduction in the wear rate by 49% at 5N load. The in vitro bacterial\nretention test showed a clear inhibition in growth of Staphylococcus aureus and\nKlebsiella pneumonia bacteria on the surface of the coated samples indicating\nthe possibility of prevention of biofilm formation. More than 50% reduction in\ndensity of Staphylococcus aureus was observed on coated sample in comparison to\npristine Ti6Al4V and this can be attributed to reduction in surface energy of\nthe sample after coating.

Generally, noisy supervision could stem from variation among\nlabelers, label corruption by adversaries, etc. To combat such label noises,\none popular line of approach is to apply customized weights to the training\ninstances, so that the corrupted examples contribute less to the model\nlearning. However, such learning mechanisms potentially erase important\ninformation about the data distribution and therefore yield suboptimal results.\nTo leverage useful information from the corrupted instances, an alternative is\nthe bootstrapping loss, which reconstructs new training targets on-the-fly by\nincorporating the network's own predictions (i.e., pseudo-labels).\n  In this paper, we propose a more generic learnable loss objective which\nenables a joint reweighting of instances and labels at once. Specifically, our\nmethod dynamically adjusts the per-sample importance weight between the real\nobserved labels and pseudo-labels, where the weights are efficiently determined\nin a meta process.

ELI\nGammatron beamline provides X-ray pulses of energies from 1-100 keV in betatron\nscheme, and up to a MeV in Compton scheme. A state-of-the-art Ti:Sa\ndiode-pumped HAPLS laser (10-30 J, 30 fs @10 Hz) is used as a driving laser for\nthese X-ray sources. These sources are characterized with a low divergence (<\n10 mrad), small source size (few {\\mu}m), short pulse duration (a few fs) and\nphoton flux up to1010 photons per pulse. In addition, a separate Betatron X-ray\nsource is being developed in the ELI Plasma Physics Platform (P3)that will\nserve as an active diagnostics of various plasma physics experiments. P3 is\ndedicated to laboratory astrophysics, HED physics, multi-beam experiments, warm\ndense matter and fundamental research. Besides the presentation of the two\nX-ray sources, we will also introduce a novel optical probing method with\nincreased interferometric sensitivity for characterization of low-density gas\njets. The sensitivity is achieved together with using a novel optical\nconfiguration employing multiple passes of the probe beam through the object\nand relay-imaging of the object between the individual passes, and a short\nprobing beam (405 nm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 07:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 06:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

There is a consensus that anesthetic drugs are\ncapable of interfering with neural activities at different levels and time\nscales, being able to induce alterations both locally as well as on the\nspatiotemporal patterns throughout the whole cortex. However, it is still\nunclear how such changes in the complexity of cortical activity are supposed to\noccur, and experimental evidence is still needed. To this purpose, we have\nanalyzed an ECoG records database of a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic\ninduction experiment in a non-human primate subject. The MDR-ECoG provided\nrecords of cortical activity with both high temporal and spatial resolution\nallied with extensive coverage of the cortical surface. The Permutation Entropy\nand the Fractal Dimension were employed to evaluate the complexity of the\nneural time series. The complexity of cortical activity was relatively constant\nduring awakened conditions. The transition to unconsciousness occurred in a\nfast manner, requiring about 30 to 40 seconds for the first changes to take\nplace. During general anesthesia, the complexity assumed a considerable\nvariation at local levels and fluctuated without a defined period. On a global\nscale, the cortex dynamically alternated among high and low complex states.\nThis study brings novel evidence of the effects of anesthetics on neural\nactivity and cortical dynamics, complementing the actual scenario for the\nelucidation of anesthesia mechanisms in terms of circuits, pathways, and global\nbrain functioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 08:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Existing\nmethods based on binary objects, ranging from early matrix factorization to\nrecently emerged deep learning, obtain objects' embeddings by mapping from\npre-existing features.

In the alignment limit of $\\cos\\gamma \\to 0$ for\n$h$--$H$ mixing, flavor changing neutral Higgs couplings such as $h \\to\n\\tau\\mu$ are naturally suppressed, but the couplings of the heavier $H$ is\noptimized by $\\sin \\gamma \\to 1$. We define various signal regions for $H,A \\to\n\\tau\\mu$ and $\\tau \\tau$, and evaluate physics backgrounds from dominant\nprocesses with realistic acceptance cuts and tagging efficiencies. Two\ndifferent studies are presented: we first perform a parton level study without\nany hadronization and with minimal detector smearing; we then include\nhadronization using PYTHIA 8.2 and fast detector simulation using DELPHES to\ngive event level simulation. Results for $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV appear promising,\nwhich we extend further to $\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV for the High Luminosity LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 08:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

As the coherence time is one of the most\nfundamental properties of spin qubits, the short T2 time of VB- could\nsignificantly limit its potential as a promising spin qubit candidate. In this\nstudy, we theoretically proposed two materials engineering methods, which can\nsubstantially extend the T2 time of the VB- spin by four times more than its\nintrinsic T2.

We found magnetic helicity and energy thresholds of $9 \\times\n10^{41}$ Mx$^2$ and $2 \\times 10^{32}$ erg, respectively, which, if crossed,\nARs are likely to erupt. The segregation, in terms of accumulated magnetic\nhelicity and energy budgets, of the eruptive ARs from the noneruptive ones is\nviolated in one case when an AR erupts early in its emergence phase and in six\ncases with noneruptive ARs exhibiting large magnetic helicity and energy\nbudgets. Decay index calculations may indicate that these ARs did not erupt\nbecause the overlying magnetic field provided stronger or more extended\nconfinement than in eruptive ARs. Conclusions. Our results indicate that\nemerging ARs tend to produce CMEs when they accumulate significant budgets of\nboth magnetic helicity and energy. Any study of their eruptive potential should\nplace magnetic helicity on equal footing with magnetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 09:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In previous works, it was assumed that the number of samples in\nthe intermediate domains was sufficiently large; hence, self-training was\npossible without the need for labeled data. If the number of accessible\nintermediate domains is restricted, the distances between domains become large,\nand self-training will fail.

Accordingly, we\ndesign the common phase-shift of IRS elements to achieve transmit diversity at\nthe AP side without the need of any CSI of the users. In addition, we propose a\npractical method for the users to estimate the CSI at the receiver side for\ninformation decoding.

In recent years, many deep learning algorithms\nhave been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast. A typical practice is\nto integrate convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture\nspatial-temporal dependency in historical travel demand. For typical CNN, the\nconvolution operation is conducted through a kernel that moves across a\n\"matrix-format\" city to extract features over spatially adjacent urban areas.\nThis practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful\ninformation that improves prediction accuracy. However, bicycle usage in\nneighboring areas might not always be similar, given spatial variations in\nbuilt environment characteristics and travel behavior that affect cycling\nactivities. Yet, areas that are far apart can be relatively more similar in\ntemporal usage patterns. To utilize the hidden linkage among these distant\nurban areas, the study proposes an irregular convolutional Long-Short Term\nMemory model (IrConv+LSTM) to improve short-term bike sharing demand forecast.\nThe model modifies traditional CNN with irregular convolutional architecture to\nextract dependency among \"semantic neighbors\".

L-MAPF is typically\ntackled by partitioning it into multiple consecutive, and hence similar,\n\"one-shot\" MAPF queries, as in the Rolling-Horizon Collision Resolution (RHCR)\nalgorithm. Therefore, a solution to one query informs the next query, which\nleads to similarity with respect to the agents' start and goal positions, and\nhow collisions need to be resolved from one query to the next. Thus, experience\nfrom solving one MAPF query can potentially be used to speedup solving the next\none. Despite this intuition, current L-MAPF planners solve consecutive MAPF\nqueries from scratch. In this paper, we introduce a new RHCR-inspired approach\ncalled exRHCR, which exploits experience in its constituent MAPF queries. In\nparticular, exRHCR employs an extension of Priority-Based Search (PBS), a\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solver. The extension, which we call exPBS, allows to\nwarm-start the search with the priorities between agents used by PBS in the\nprevious MAPF instances.

By imposing the boundary conditions\nin a strong manner, the power balance characterizing the Stokes-Dirac structure\nis then retrieved at the discrete level via symplectic Runge-Kutta integrators\nbased on Gauss-Legendre collocation points. Numerical experiments validate the\nconvergence of the method and the conservation properties in terms of energy\nbalance both for the wave and Maxwell equations in a three dimensional domain.\nFor the latter example, the magnetic and electric fields preserve their\ndivergence free nature at the discrete level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 10:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 14:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We use a sample of 40 well-observed ICMEs from Helios 1/2\n(0.3-1au) and 5 from Parker Solar Probe (0.32-0.75au). For each event we\nidentify four main density structures, namely shock, sheath, leading edge (LE),\nand magnetic ejecta (ME) itself. Methods: We derive separately for each\nstructure averaged plasma and magnetic field parameter values as well as\nduration and place the results into comparison with the upstream solar wind\n(SW) to investigate the interrelation between the different density structures.\nResults: The sheath structure presumably consists of compressed plasma due to\nthe turbulent SW material following the shock. The sheath lies ahead of a\nregion of compressed ambient SW, the LE, which is typically found directly in\nfront of the magnetic driver and seems to match the bright leading edge\ncommonly observed in remote sensing observations of CMEs. The sheath becomes\ndenser than the ambient SW at about 0.06au, which we interpret as the average\nstarting distance for actual sheath formation. Between 0.09-0.28au the sheath\nstructure density starts to dominate over the density within the ME. The ME\ndensity seems to fall below the ambient SW density over 0.45-1.07au. Besides\nthe well-known expansion of the ME, the sheath size shows a weak positive\ncorrelation with distance, while the LE seems not to expand with distance from\nthe Sun. We further find a moderate anti-correlation between sheath density and\nlocal SW plasma speed upstream of the ICME shock. An empirical relation is\nderived connecting the ambient SW speed with sheath and LE density that can be\nused for modeling of ICME evolution. Constraints to those results are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 10:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 12:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In the last few decades,\nthese approaches have limited their operation to feature extraction and linear\nclassification tasks for between-group inference. In this context, statistical\ninference is assessed by randomly permuting image labels or by the use of\nrandom effect models that consider between-subject variability. These\nmultivariate MLE-based statistical pipelines, whilst potentially more effective\nfor detecting activations than hypotheses-driven methods, have lost their\nmathematical elegance, ease of interpretation, and spatial localization of the\nubiquitous General linear Model (GLM). Recently, the estimation of the\nconventional GLM has been demonstrated to be connected to an univariate\nclassification task when the design matrix is expressed as a binary indicator\nmatrix. In this paper we explore the complete connection between the univariate\nGLM and MLE \\emph{regressions}. To this purpose we derive a refined statistical\ntest with the GLM based on the parameters obtained by a linear Support Vector\nRegression (SVR) in the \\emph{inverse} problem (SVR-iGLM). Subsequently, random\nfield theory (RFT) is employed for assessing statistical significance following\na conventional GLM benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate how parameter\nestimations derived from each model (mainly GLM and SVR) result in different\nexperimental design estimates that are significantly related to the predefined\nfunctional task. Moreover, using real data from a multisite initiative the\nproposed MLE-based inference demonstrates statistical power and the control of\nfalse positives, outperforming the regular GLM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 11:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 09:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

If these trapped modes indeed show up in the solutions to the\nassociated initial value problem (IVP), then FSMs have a much better chance to\nbe observed than expected with classical theory, and can be invoked to account\nfor a considerably broader range of periodicities than practiced. However, with\naxial fundamentals in active region loops as an example, we show that this\nlong-wavelength expectation is not seen in our finite-difference solutions to\nthe IVP, the reason for which is then explored by superposing the necessary\neigenmodes to re-solve the IVP. At least for the parameters we examine, the\neigenfunctions of trapped modes are characterized by a spatial extent well\nexceeding the observationally reasonable range of the spatial extent of initial\nperturbations, meaning a negligible fraction of energy that a trapped mode can\nreceive. We conclude that the absence of cutoff wavenumbers for FSMs in the\nexamined equilibrium does not guarantee a distinct temporal behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 12:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In this work we propose a particle physics model that\ncan help alleviate the Hubble tension via an out-of-equilibrium hidden sector\ncoupled to the visible sector. The particles that populate the dark sector\nconsist of a dark fermion, which acts as dark matter, a dark photon, a massive\nscalar and a massless pseudo-scalar. Assuming no initial population of\nparticles in the dark sector, feeble couplings between the visible and the\nhidden sectors via kinetic mixing populate the dark sector even though the\nnumber densities of hidden sector particles never reach their equilibrium\ndistribution and the two sectors remain at different temperatures. A\ncosmologically consistent analysis is presented where a correlated evolution of\nthe visible and the hidden sectors with coupled Boltzmann equations involving\ntwo temperatures, one for the visible sector and the other for the hidden\nsector, is carried out. The relic density of the dark matter constituted of\ndark fermions is computed in this two-temperature formalism. As a consequence,\nBBN predictions are upheld with a minimal contribution to $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$.\nHowever, the out-of-equilibrium decay of the massive scalar to the massless\npseudo-scalar close to the recombination time causes an increase in $\\Delta\nN_{\\rm eff}$ that can help weaken the Hubble tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 13:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 10:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

This is especially prevalent in\nNoisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices in which the qubit states\nquickly decay through processes of relaxation and decoherence. Ideal quantum\nstates evolve according to unitary dynamics, which modern devices are not\nalways capable of maintaining. Due to the persistent presence of noise from\nvarious sources, the best NISQ devices ideally evolve according to Markovian\ndynamics. NISQ devices, such as those offered by IBM through its cloud-based\nopen-access IBM Quantum Experience (IBM QE), are regularly re-calibrated to\nreset the affect of external noise. The calibration information is shared to\nprovide the users with data about the qubit dynamics, which can be considered\nin the design of experiments on the quantum devices.

Spatial\nvariations of concentration of a resource, change the fitness of competing\nstrategies locally. The notion of fitness varying with respect to both genotype\nand environment is important in modeling cancer initiation, microbial evolution\nand evolution of drug resistance. Environmental interactions can be asymmetric,\nthat is, they affect the fitness of one type more than the other. The question\nis how local environmental variations in network population structures change\nthe selection dynamics in a finite population setting. We consider\none-dimensional lattice population structures with spatial fitness\ndistributions with a periodic pattern. Heterogeneity is determined by standard\ndeviation of fitnesses and period. The model covers biologically relevant\nlimits of two-habitat subdivided populations and randomly-distributed resources\nin high- and low-periods. We numerically calculate fixation probability and\nfixation times for a constant population birth-death process as fitness\nheterogeneity and period vary. We identify levels of heterogeneity for which a\npreviously deleterious mutant, in a uniform environment, becomes beneficial. In\nother regimes of the problem we observe unexpected behavior where the fixation\nprobability of both types are larger than their neutral value at the same time.\nThis coincides with an exponential increase in time to fixation as a function\nof population size, which points to significant slow-down in selection process\nand the potential for coexistence between types in realistic time scales. We\nalso discuss `fitness shift' model where the fitness function of one type is\nidentical to the other up to a constant spatial shift. This leads to\nsignificant increase (or decrease) in the fixation probability of the mutant\ndepending the value of the shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 15:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 18:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

A key property of IGA is that\nit is simple to achieve high order smoothness within a single patch. To\nrepresent more complex geometries one often uses a multi-patch construction. In\nthis case, the global continuity for the basis functions is in general only\n$C^0$. Therefore, to obtain $C^1$-smooth isogeometric functions, a special\nconstruction for the basis is needed. Such spaces are of interest when solving\nnumerically fourth-order problems, such as the biharmonic equation or\nKirchhoff-Love plate/shell formulations, using an isogeometric Galerkin method.\n  Isogeometric spaces that are globally $C^1$ over multi-patch domains can be\nconstructed as in (Collin, Sangalli, Takacs; CAGD, 2016) and (Kapl, Sangalli,\nTakacs; CAGD, 2019). The constructions require so-called analysis-suitable\n$G^1$ parametrizations. To allow $C^1$ spaces over more general multi-patch\nparametrizations, we need to increase the polynomial degree and relax the $C^1$\nconditions. We adopt the approximate $C^1$ construction for two-patch domains,\nas developed in (Weinm\\\"uller, Takacs; CMAME, 2021), and extend it to more\ngeneral multi-patch domains.\n  We employ the construction for a biharmonic model problem and compare the\nresults with Nitsche's method.

In this paper we consider the insecurity problem for protocols with\nlogical statements that include equality on terms and existential\nquantification.

Today, the development of artificial\nintelligence-based methods is a valuable achievement for diagnosing disease.\nHence, in this paper, artificial intelligence methods such as neural network\n(NN), deep neural network (DNN), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering combined with\ndeep neural network (FCM-DNN) are developed for diagnosing CAD on a cardiac\nmagnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) dataset. The original dataset is used in two\ndifferent approaches. First, the labeled dataset is applied to the NN and DNN\nto create the NN and DNN models. Second, the labels are removed, and the\nunlabeled dataset is clustered via the FCM method, and then, the clustered\ndataset is fed to the DNN to create the FCM-DNN model. By utilizing the second\nclustering and modeling, the training process is improved, and consequently,\nthe accuracy is increased. As a result, the proposed FCM-DNN model achieves the\nbest performance with a 99.91% accuracy specifying 10 clusters, i.e., 5\nclusters for healthy subjects and 5 clusters for sick subjects, through the\n10-fold cross-validation technique compared to the NN and DNN models reaching\nthe accuracies of 92.18% and 99.63%, respectively. To the best of our\nknowledge, no study has been conducted for CAD diagnosis on the CMRI dataset\nusing artificial intelligence methods. The results confirm that the proposed\nFCM-DNN model can be helpful for scientific and research centers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 06:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 06:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The emergence of the nonreciprocal\nresponse below the N\\'eel temperature confirms a correlation between\nnonreciprocity and intrinsic magnetism in the surface state of MBT. The angular\ndependence of the nonreciprocal transport indicates that nonreciprocal response\noriginates from the asymmetry scattering of electrons at the surface of MBT\nmediated by magnon.

Their\nremoval was attributed to electrosorption (7.4-35%), and electrooxidation\n(9.3-32 %). Defluorination efficiencies of C4-C8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and\nacids were 8-24% due to a fraction of PFAS being electrosorbed only at the\nanode surface. Yet, the recovery of fluoride was 74-87% relative to the\nelectrooxidized fraction, suggesting that once the degradation of the PFAS is\ninitiated, the C-F bond cleavage is very efficient. The nearly stoichiometric\nsulfate recoveries obtained for perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (91-98%) relative to\nthe electrooxidized fraction demonstrated an efficient cleavage of the\nsulfonate head-group.

In the present formulation, the deformed\nconfiguration of a TMD-membrane is represented through the deformation map of\nits middle surface and two stretches normal to the middle surface.\nCrystal-elasticity based kinematic rules are employed to express the deformed\nbond lengths and bond angles of TMDs in terms of the continuum strains. The\ncontinuum hyper-elastic strain energy of the TMD membrane is formulated from\nits inter-atomic potential. The relative shifts between two simple lattices of\nTMDs are also considered in the constitutive relation. A smooth finite element\nframework using B-splines is developed to numerically implement the present\ncontinuum membrane model.

A modified version of a standard ECG circuit was utilized to provide\nproper loading, noise rejection, filtering, and phase of the TENG signals along\nwith multiplexing of the many electrodes. All system components were selected\nwith a final embedded system in mind. Testing of the device was conducted\nutilizing an Arduino Uno and an EVAL-AD5940BIOZ evaluation board for\nelectrodermal activity for stress and/or pain after exercise. An accelerometer\nwas included for device activation and hand tremor detection. Upon testing, the\nself-powered TENG sensors produce positive impulses upon contact and negative\nimpulses upon release of contact from the surface of the ball. Furthermore,\nfinger removal detection was demonstrated by capturing the associated negative\nimpulse by maintaining the bipolar signal in our conditioning circuit.
