Such efforts\non reusing training samples pose serious privacy risks due to increased\nmemorization, which, however, has not been investigated yet.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of privacy risks in neural\nnetwork pruning.

Extensive experiments are conducted to rigorously evaluate the\nprivacy impacts of different pruning approaches, sparsity levels, and adversary\nknowledge. The proposed attack shows the higher attack performance on the\npruned models when compared with eight existing membership inference attacks.\nIn addition, we propose a new defense mechanism to protect the pruning process\nby mitigating the prediction divergence based on KL-divergence distance, whose\neffectiveness has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively mitigate the\nprivacy risks while maintaining the sparsity and accuracy of the pruned models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 16:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 20:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

However, we believe it is\nnecessary to continue investigating EBSE training and its impact on software\nengineering practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 17:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Despite the decent performance,\nexisting text-video retrieval models in vision and language communities are\nimpractical for large-scale Web search because they adopt brute-force search\nbased on high-dimensional embeddings. To improve efficiency, Web search engines\nwidely apply vector compression libraries (e.g., FAISS) to post-process the\nlearned embeddings. Unfortunately, separate compression from feature encoding\ndegrades the robustness of representations and incurs performance decay. To\npursue a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose the\nfirst quantized representation learning method for cross-view video retrieval,\nnamely Hybrid Contrastive Quantization (HCQ). Specifically, HCQ learns both\ncoarse-grained and fine-grained quantizations with transformers, which provide\ncomplementary understandings for texts and videos and preserve comprehensive\nsemantic information. By performing Asymmetric-Quantized Contrastive Learning\n(AQ-CL) across views, HCQ aligns texts and videos at coarse-grained and\nmultiple fine-grained levels. This hybrid-grained learning strategy serves as\nstrong supervision on the cross-view video quantization model, where\ncontrastive learning at different levels can be mutually promoted. Extensive\nexperiments on three Web video benchmark datasets demonstrate that HCQ achieves\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art non-compressed retrieval methods\nwhile showing high efficiency in storage and computation.

Also CH$_3$OH was searched for in two comets. The HCN\nsample includes the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. For the short-period comet\n46P/Wirtanen we could monitor the variation of HCN emission over a time span of\nabout one month. We performed radiative transfer modelling for the observed\nmolecular emission by also including time-dependent effects due to the\noutgassing of molecules.\n  HCN was detected in 6 comets. Two of these are short-period comets and 4 of\nthem are long-period. Six methanol transitions were detected in 46P/Wirtanen,\nenabling us to determine the gas kinetic temperature. From the observations, we\ndetermined the molecular production rates using time-dependent radiative\ntransfer modelling.

Second, each\nCIR is engineered through RIS, and reflected signals combine at the receiver to\ndetermine the output of the convolution.

However, integrating these two lines of research remains a crucial\nchallenge since they often conflict with one another with respect to the threat\nmodel.\n  In this work, we develop a principle framework that offers both privacy\nguarantees for users and detection against poisoning attacks from them. With a\nnew threat model that includes both an honest-but-curious server and malicious\nusers, we first propose a secure aggregation protocol using homomorphic\nencryption for the server to combine local model updates in a private manner.\nThen, a zero-knowledge proof protocol is leveraged to shift the task of\ndetecting attacks in the local models from the server to the users. The key\nobservation here is that the server no longer needs access to the local models\nfor attack detection. Therefore, our framework enables the central server to\nidentify poisoned model updates without violating the privacy guarantees of\nsecure aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 18:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

These small-angle patterns represent the magnitude of\nthe Fourier transform of the two-dimensional projection of the sample's\nelectron density, which can be reconstructed efficiently but lacks any depth\ninformation. In cases where the diffracted signal can be measured up to\nscattering angles exceeding 10 degrees, i.e. in the wide-angle regime,\nthree-dimensional morphological information of the target is contained in a\nsingle-shot diffraction pattern.

Since their transverse momenta are initially larger than the\ntypical saturation scale describing the bulk of the equilibrating QGP, their\ntypical stopping distances are larger than the usual hydrodynamization time, so\nthey do not in general hydrodynamize at the same pace than the bulk of the\ncollision. Therefore, in general mini-jets cannot be described solely by a\nunique pre-equilibrium stage that bridges the initial, over-occupied glasma\nstate, with the hydrodynamical evolution. In this work we make use of a new\nconcurrent mini-jet+hydrodynamic framework in which the properties of the\nhydrodynamically evolving QGP are modified due to the injection of energy and\nmomentum from the mini-jets. We study the system for different choices of the\nminimum transverse momentum associated to mini-jet production. In order to\nachieve a realistic description of charged particle multiplicity, the amount of\nentropy associated to the low-$x$ initial state needs to be reduced. Moreover,\nthe fact that the injected momentum from the randomly oriented mini-jets is not\ncorrelated with the spatial gradients of the system reduces overall flow, and\nthe value of the QGP transport coefficients needs to be reduced accordingly.\nThey are an important new source of fluctuations, resulting in a spikier,\nnotably modified hydrodynamical evolution.

In case when $\\mu$ is infinite, we also consider\nproperties of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal E}_{fin} \\subseteq \\widetilde{\\mathcal E}$\nconsisting of classes of measurable sets having finite measure.\n  The compactness and separability of the N.B.A. are characterised using the\nnewly defined terms of approximability and uniform approximability of the\ncorresponding measure space.\n  Finally, conditions on $(E,\\mathcal E,\\mu)$ are derived for separability and\ncompactness of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal E}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal E}_{fin}.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 18:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Studying $A(n, d)$, including efforts to\ndetermine it as well to derive bounds on $A(n, d)$ for large $n$'s, is one of\nthe most fundamental subjects in coding theory. In this paper, we explore new\nlower and upper bounds on $A(n, d)$ in the large-minimum distance regime, in\nparticular, when $d = n/2 - \\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. We first provide a new\nconstruction of cyclic codes, by carefully selecting specific roots in the\nbinary extension field for the check polynomial, with length $n= 2^m -1$,\ndistance $d \\geq n/2 - 2^{c-1}\\sqrt{n}$, and size $n^{c+1/2}$, for any $m\\geq\n4$ and any integer $c$ with $0 \\leq c \\leq m/2 - 1$. These code parameters are\nslightly worse than those of the Delsarte--Goethals (DG) codes that provide the\npreviously known best lower bound in the large-minimum distance regime.\nHowever, using a similar and extended code construction technique we show a\nsequence of cyclic codes that improve upon DG codes and provide the best lower\nbound in a narrower range of the minimum distance $d$, in particular, when $d =\nn/2 - \\Omega(n^{2/3})$. Furthermore, by leveraging a Fourier-analytic view of\nDelsarte's linear program, upper bounds on $A(n, n/2 - \\rho\\sqrt{n})$ with\n$\\rho\\in (0.5, 9.5)$ are obtained that scale polynomially in $n$. To the best\nof authors' knowledge, the upper bound due to Barg and Nogin\n\\cite{barg2006spectral} is the only previously known upper bound that scale\npolynomially in $n$ in this regime.

The rise of \"doubly robust\" non-parametric tools coupled with the\ngrowth of deep learning for capturing rich representations of multimodal data,\noffers a unique opportunity to develop and test such models for causal\ninference on comprehensive electronic health records (EHR). In this paper, we\ninvestigate causal modelling of an RCT-established null causal association: the\neffect of antihypertensive use on incident cancer risk. We develop a dataset\nfor our observational study and a Transformer-based model, Targeted BEHRT\ncoupled with doubly robust estimation, we estimate average risk ratio (RR). We\ncompare our model to benchmark statistical and deep learning models for causal\ninference in multiple experiments on semi-synthetic derivations of our dataset\nwith various types and intensities of confounding. In order to further test the\nreliability of our approach, we test our model on situations of limited data.\nWe find that our model provides more accurate estimates of RR (least sum\nabsolute error from ground truth) compared to benchmarks for risk ratio\nestimation on high-dimensional EHR across experiments.

One\nof the greatest challenges is the production of complex structures of\nmicroscopic size. Owing to two-photon polymerization, a novel fabrication\ntechnique from the view of acoustic metamaterials, it is now possible to\nprecisely manufacture sub-wavelength structures in this frequency range.\nHowever, shrinking in size poses another challenge; the increasing\nthermoviscous effects lead to considerable losses, which must be taken into\naccount in the design.

By contrast, the sparse annotations become appealing to the\nsalient object detection community. However, few efforts are devoted to\nlearning salient object detection from sparse annotations, especially in the\nremote sensing field. In addition, the sparse annotation usually contains\nscanty information, which makes it challenging to train a well-performing\nmodel, resulting in its performance largely lagging behind the fully-supervised\nmodels. Although some SOD methods adopt some prior cues to improve the\ndetection performance, they usually lack targeted discrimination of object\nboundaries and thus provide saliency maps with poor boundary localization.

Washing caused lesser\nquality degradation in sets incorporating spunbond non-woven polypropylene or\nmedical wraps (Q = 12 to 24 pre-wash, Q = 8 to 10 post-wash). Post-wash quality\nfactors are similar for all multi-layer sets in this study, and higher than\nKona quilting cotton (Q = 6). Washed multi-layer sets filtered 12-42 percent of\n0.5 micron, 27-76 percent of 1 micron, 58-96 percent of 2.8 micron, and 72-100\npercent of 4.2 micron particles. The measured filtration and pressure drop of\nboth the homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-layer fabric combinations agreed\nwith the estimations from the layering model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 20:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

These quantities\nin turn affect the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We present the\nfirst joint analysis of small-scale temperature and polarization CMB anisotropy\nfrom Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT), together\nwith Planck data and the recent primordial abundance measurements of helium and\ndeuterium to place comprehensive bounds on the mass of light thermal-relic dark\nmatter. We consider a range of models, including dark matter that couples to\nphotons and Standard-Model neutrinos. We find that the combination of ACT, SPT,\nand Planck generally leads to the most stringent mass constraint for dark\nmatter that couples to neutrinos, improving the lower limit by 40%-80%, with\nrespect to previous Planck analyses. On the other hand, the addition of ACT and\nSPT leads to a slightly weaker bound on electromagnetically coupled particles,\ndue to a shift in the preferred values of $Y_\\mathrm{p}$ and $N_\\mathrm{eff}$\ndriven by the ground based experiments. Combining all CMB measurements with\nprimordial abundance measurements, we rule out masses below $\\sim$4 MeV at 95%\nconfidence, for all models. We show that allowing for new relativistic species\ncan weaken the mass bounds for dark matter that couples to photons by up to an\norder of magnitude or more.

The decision maker has access to a black-box oracle, such as a\nmachine learning model, that provides untrusted and potentially inaccurate\npredictions of the optimal decision in each round. The goal of the decision\nmaker is to exploit the predictions if they are accurate, while guaranteeing\nperformance that is not much worse than the hindsight optimal sequence of\ndecisions, even when predictions are inaccurate.

This method is quite general and applicable to any\nsituation in which declarative-type constraints of a modal and/or temporal\nnature play a part.\n  A declarative process is a process in which activities may freely happen\nwhile respecting a set of constraints. For such a process, anything may happen\nso long as it is not explicitly forbidden. Declarative processes have been used\nand studied as models of business and healthcare workflows by several authors.\nIn considering a declarative process as a model of some system it is natural to\nconsider how the process behaves with respect to stakeholders. We derive a\nmeasure for stakeholder utility that can be applied in a very general setting.\nThis derivation is achieved by listing a collection a properties which we argue\nsuch a stakeholder utility function ought to satisfy, and then using these to\nshow a very specific form must hold for such a utility. The utility measure\ndepends on the set of unique traces of the declarative process, and calculating\nthis set requires a combinatorial analysis of the declarative graph that\nrepresents the process.\n  This builds on previous work of the author wherein the combinatorial\ndiversity metrics for declarative processes were derived for use in policy\nprocess analysis. The collection of stakeholder utilities can themselves then\nbe used to form a metric with which we can compare different declarative\nprocesses to one another. These are illustrated using several examples of\ndeclarative processes that already exist in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2022 21:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratios in water\nare available for several comets. However, no long-term studies of the D/H\nratio in water of a comet during its passage around the Sun have been reported.\nLinear alkanes are important organic molecules, which have been found on\nseveral Solar System bodies, including comets. To date, only upper limits of\nisotopic ratios for D/H and 13C/12C in linear alkanes are available.\n  The aim of this work is a detailed analysis of the D/H ratio in water during\nthe whole Rosetta mission. In addition, a first determination of the D/H and\n13C/12C ratios in the first four linear alkanes in the coma of\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is provided.

By identifying an appropriate choice of resource R\nand target subsystem T, our problems reduce, respectively, to the well-known\nmarginal problems for quantum states and the problem of determining if a given\nquantum system is a resource. More generally, we say that a set of marginal\nstates is resource-free incompatible with a target subsystem T if all global\nstates compatible with this set must result in a resourceful state in T. We\nshow that this incompatibility induces a resource theory that can be quantified\nby a monotone, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for this monotone\nto be computable as a conic program with finite optimum. We further show, via\nthe corresponding witnesses, that resource-free incompatibility is equivalent\nto an operational advantage in some subchannel discrimination task. Through our\nframework, a clear connection can be established between any marginal problem\n(that involves some notion of incompatibility) for quantum states and a\nresource theory for quantum states.

In the case of multivariate time series, the key to good\nperformances is to properly capture the dependencies between the variates.\nOften, these variates are structured, i.e. they are localised in an abstract\nspace, usually representing an aspect of the physical world, and prediction\namounts to a form of diffusion of the information across that space over time.\nSeveral neural network models of diffusion have been proposed in the\nliterature. However, most of the existing proposals rely on some a priori\nknowledge on the structure of the space, usually in the form of a graph\nweighing the pairwise diffusion capacity of its points. We argue that this\npiece of information can often be dispensed with, since data already contains\nthe diffusion capacity information, and in a more reliable form than that\nobtained from the usually largely hand-crafted graphs.

However, the presence of metallic inserts,\nsuch as implants, crowns, and dental filling, causes severe streaking and\nshading artifacts in a CBCT image and loss of the morphological structures of\nthe teeth, which consequently prevents accurate segmentation of bones. A\ntwo-stage metal artifact reduction method is proposed for accurate 3D low-dose\nmaxillofacial CBCT modeling, where a key idea is to utilize explicit tooth\nshape prior information from intra-oral scan data whose acquisition does not\nrequire any extra radiation exposure. In the first stage, an image-to-image\ndeep learning network is employed to mitigate metal-related artifacts. To\nimprove the learning ability, the proposed network is designed to take\nadvantage of the intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and perform multi-task\nlearning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D\nmaxillofacial model is constructed by segmenting the bones from the dental CBCT\nimage corrected in the first stage. For accurate bone segmentation, weighted\nthresholding is applied, wherein the weighting region is determined depending\non the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Because acquiring a paired\ntraining dataset of metal-artifact-free and metal artifact-affected dental CBCT\nimages is challenging in clinical practice, an automatic method of generating a\nrealistic dataset according to the CBCT physics model is introduced.

While neutron stars are\nknown to have large velocities associated with impulsive kicks imparted to them\nat birth in supernovae, whether black holes receive similar kicks, and of what\nmagnitude, remains an open question. Recently, Callister et al. (2021) analysed\nthe binary black hole population under the hypothesis that they were all formed\nthrough isolated binary evolution and claimed that large black hole kicks\n(greater than 260 km/s at 99% confidence) were required for the spin\ndistribution of merging binary black holes to match observations. Here we\nhighlight that a key assumption made by Callister et al. (2021) -- that all\nsecondary black holes can be tidally spun up -- is not motivated by physical\nmodels, and may lead to a bias in their estimate of the magnitudes of black\nhole kicks. We make only minor changes to the Callister et al. (2021) model,\naccounting for a population of wider merging binaries where tidal\nsynchronisation is ineffective. We show that this naturally produces a bimodal\nspin distribution for secondary black holes, and that the spin-orbit\nmisalignments observed in the binary black hole population can be explained by\nmore typical black hole kicks of order 100 km/s, consistent with kicks inferred\nfrom Galactic X-ray binaries containing black holes. We conclude that the\nmajority of the binary black hole population is consistent with forming through\nisolated binary evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 00:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

However, nullifying the jamming\nsignals can be problematic when the correlations between transmitted jamming\nsignals are deliberately varied over time. Specifically, recent studies reveal\nthat by deliberately varying the correlations among jamming signals, attackers\ncan effectively vary the jamming channels and thus their nullspace, even when\nthe physical channels remain unchanged. That makes the beam-forming matrix\nderived from the nullspace of the jamming channels unable to suppress the\njamming signals. Most existing solutions only consider unchanged correlations\nor heuristically adapt to the time-varying correlation problem by continuously\nmonitoring the residual jamming signals before updating the beam-forming\nmatrix. In this paper, we systematically formulate the optimization problem of\nthe nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Even ignoring the\nunknown strategy of the jammers and the challenging nullspace estimation\nprocess, the resulting problem is an integer programming problem, hence\nintractable to obtain its optimal solution. To tackle it and address the\nunknown strategy of the jammer, we reformulate the problem using a partially\nobservable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) and then design a deep dueling\nQ-learning based framework to tune the duration of the nullspace estimation and\ndata transmission phases. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed\ntechniques effectively deal with jamming signals whose correlations vary over\ntime, and the range of correlations is unknown. Especially, our techniques do\nnot require continuous monitoring of the residual jamming signals (after the\nnullification process) before updating the beam-forming matrix. As such, the\nsystem is more spectral-efficient and has a lower outage probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 02:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

We find that at high rates, for $Pe>1$, the shear flow\ninduces an ordering transition that significantly decreases the measured\nviscosity. This ordering is analyzed in terms of the development of layering\nand planar order, and we determine that particles are packed into hexagonal\ncrystal layers (with numerous defects) that slide past each other.

Since validating\ndesigned sequences in the wet lab is typically costly, it is important to\nquantify the uncertainty in the model's predictions.

We introduce a method to quantify predictive uncertainty in\nsuch settings. We do so by constructing confidence sets for predictions that\naccount for the dependence between the training and test data.

We circumvent this limitation by conceiving quantum networks using\nsecure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure direct\ncommunication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum\ncommunication that directly transmits information over quantum channel. The\nfinal component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant\nalgorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a\nquantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it\nis read out and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the\ninformation is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure\neven in the face of a quantum computer. Hence, our solution offers secure\nend-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both\neavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum internet. It is\ncompatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of\nthe popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the\ntransition from the classical Internet to the Quantum Internet (Qinternet) by\nfollowing a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative network\nin quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first\nexperimental demonstration of a secure classical repeater based hybrid quantum\nnetwork constructed by a serial concatenation of an optical fiber and\nfree-space communication link. In conclusion, secure repeater networks may\nindeed be constructed using existing technology and continue to support a\nseamless evolutionary pathway to the future Qinternet of quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 03:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Motivated\nby the example of a physical system with an unexpected change in its dynamics,\nwe take the drift parameter to be unknown, so that it must be learned while\ncontrolling the system. The state of the system is observed through a linear\nobservation model with Gaussian noise. In contrast to most previous work, which\nfocuses on a controller's asymptotic performance over an infinite time horizon,\nwe minimize a quadratic cost function over a finite time horizon. The\nperformance of our control strategy is quantified by comparing its cost with\nthe cost incurred by an optimal controller that has full knowledge of the\nparameters. This approach gives rise to several notions of \"regret.\" We derive\na set of control strategies that provably minimize the worst-case regret; these\narise from Bayesian strategies that assume a specific fixed prior on the drift\nparameter.

Most of the existing work focuses primarily on the monoplex\nsetting where we have access to a network with only a single type of connection\nbetween entities. However, in the multiplex setting, where there are multiple\ntypes of connections, or \\emph{layers}, between entities, performance on tasks\nsuch as link prediction has been shown to be stronger when information from\nother connection types is taken into account. We propose an algorithm for\nscalable learning on multiplex networks with a large number of layers.

The proposed framework can be used for two\ndistinctive objectives. First, we can further improve the synthesis quality, by\ndecreasing the negative log-density of real records in the process of\nadversarial training. On the other hand, by increasing the negative log-density\nof real records, realistic fake records can be synthesized in a way that they\nare not too much close to real records and reduce the chance of potential\ninformation leakage. We conduct experiments with real-world datasets for\nclassification, regression, and privacy attacks.

In\nBoolean observation games, each player is associated with a finite set of\npropositional variables of which only it can observe the value, and it controls\nwhether and to whom it can reveal that value. It does not control the given,\nfixed, value of variables. Boolean observation games are a generalization of\nBoolean games, a well-studied subclass of strategic games but with complete\ninformation, and wherein each player controls the value of its variables.\n  In Boolean observation games player goals describe multi-agent knowledge of\nvariables. As in classical strategic games, players choose their strategies\nsimultaneously and therefore observation games capture aspects of both\nimperfect and incomplete information. They require reasoning about sets of\noutcomes given sets of indistinguishable valuations of variables. What a Nash\nequilibrium is, depends on an outcome relation between such sets. We present\nvarious outcome relations, including a qualitative variant of ex-post\nequilibrium. We identify conditions under which, given an outcome relation,\nNash equilibria are guaranteed to exist.

Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed algorithm can\nachieve a $[O(1/V), O(V)]$ tradeoff between EE and service delay.

The\nfirst part of this paper provides a non-empirical method to calculate specific\nheat of glass. The method consists of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based\non density-functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamics methods. The total-energy\napproach based on DFT enables us to calculate specific heat, irrespective of\nsolids or liquids. A serious problem for glass-transition states is involvement\nof complicated energy dissipation processes, which is resolved by adiabatic MD\nsimulations.

Each mechanism\nis driven by two classes of sphere-sphere interactions, between one sphere's\nmotion and 1) the oscillating background flow induced by the other's motion,\nand 2) a geometric asymmetry induced by the other's presence. We can thus unify\nand explain behaviours observed in other works.

Different droplet (diameter, concentration) and cloud (diameter)\nproperties are considered. Our results show that droplet size, concentration\nand cloud radius have significant effects on peak pressure trajectory of the\ndetonation wave. After interacting with cloud, the detonation wave exhibits\nthree propagation modes, including perturbed propagation, leeward\nre-detonation, and detonation extinction. Leeward re-detonation is analyzed\nfrom unsteady evolutions of gas and liquid droplet quantities. The refracted\ndetonation wave inside the cloud is decoupled and propagates more slowly than\nthe one outside the cloud. The detonation re-initiation is from a local hot\nspot, caused by shock focusing from upper and lower diffracted detonations.\nDisintegration of water droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the\ncloud and multiphase interfacial instability is observed due to the difference\nin effective density of the two fluids. Furthermore, detonation extinction is\nobserved when we consider various water cloud size. It is featured by quickly\nfading peak pressure trajectories when the detonation passes the cloud, and no\nlocal autoignition occurs in the shock focusing area. Evolutions of\nthermochemical structures from the shocked area in an extinction process are\nalso studied.

However, due to its high semantic constraints, many existing\nmethods learn to generate portrait drawings using paired training data, which\nis costly and time-consuming to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to automatically transform face photos to portrait drawings using\nunpaired training data with two new features; i.e., our method can (1) learn to\ngenerate high quality portrait drawings in multiple styles using a single\nnetwork and (2) generate portrait drawings in a \"new style\" unseen in the\ntraining data. To achieve these benefits, we (1) propose a novel quality metric\nfor portrait drawings which is learned from human perception, and (2) introduce\na quality loss to guide the network toward generating better looking portrait\ndrawings. We observe that existing unpaired translation methods such as\nCycleGAN tend to embed invisible reconstruction information indiscriminately in\nthe whole drawings due to significant information imbalance between the photo\nand portrait drawing domains, which leads to important facial features missing.\nTo address this problem, we propose a novel asymmetric cycle mapping that\nenforces the reconstruction information to be visible and only embedded in the\nselected facial regions. Along with localized discriminators for important\nfacial regions, our method well preserves all important facial features in the\ngenerated drawings. Generator dissection further explains that our model learns\nto incorporate face semantic information during drawing generation.

In this paper, we develop a unified framework for predicting cellular\nsignal maps from limited measurements. Our framework builds on a\nstate-of-the-art random-forest predictor, or any other base predictor. We\npropose and combine three mechanisms that deal with the fact that not all\nmeasurements are equally important for a particular prediction task. First, we\ndesign quality-of-service functions ($Q$), including signal strength (RSRP) but\nalso other metrics of interest to operators, i.e., coverage and call drop\nprobability. By implicitly altering the loss function employed in learning,\nquality functions can also improve prediction for RSRP itself where it matters\n(e.g., MSE reduction up to 27% in the low signal strength regime, where errors\nare critical). Second, we introduce weight functions ($W$) to specify the\nrelative importance of prediction at different locations and other parts of the\nfeature space. We propose re-weighting based on importance sampling to obtain\nunbiased estimators when the sampling and target distributions are different.\nThis yields improvements up to 20% for targets based on spatially uniform loss\nor losses based on user population density. Third, we apply the Data Shapley\nframework for the first time in this context: to assign values ($\\phi$) to\nindividual measurement points, which capture the importance of their\ncontribution to the prediction task. This improves prediction (e.g., from 64%\nto 94% in recall for coverage loss) by removing points with negative values,\nand can also enable data minimization.

A\nlocal defect lattice relaxation results in a negative-$U$ energy binding two\nholes on amphoteric defects in the donor configuration that act as preformed\nboson pair. Thermodynamic equilibrium between defects in the donor and acceptor\nconfigurations stabilizes Fermi energy at the amphoteric defect charge\ntransition state assuring resonant coupling between free holes and the\nlocalized hole pairs. Model calculations show that the critical temperature is\nprimarily determined by the density of the amphoteric defects in the donor\nconfiguration, explaining the ubiquity of dome-like dependence of the critical\ntemperature on the doping as well as its universal dependence on the superfluid\ndensity. Intentional doping with chemical acceptors or donors is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient condition for superconductivity that is fully\ndetermined by the amphoteric defects whose concentration can be controlled by\ncrystal nonstoichiometry. The only role of chemical doping is changing the\nbalance between concentrations of amphoteric defects in the donor and acceptor\nconfigurations resulting in an increase of the superfluid density and thus also\nthe critical temperature for acceptor and a decrease for donor doping. This\naccounts for the experimentally observed distinct asymmetry between the dome\nstructures for the chemical doping with acceptors and donors. The unusual\nsensitivity of the critical temperature to external perturbations is explained\nby the resonant nature of the coupling between free holes and preformed hole\npairs. The work has broader implications as it could be applicable to other\nsuperconductors with dome-like dependence of the critical temperature on\ndoping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 07:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Their degree (number of neighbors) does not depend\non the graph's size but only on the considered scale. It follows a Gamma\ndistribution and thus presents an exponential decay. Levy flights are\nparticular random walks with some power-law increments of infinite variance.\nWhen building the geometric graphs from them, we show from dimensional\narguments, that the number of connected components (clusters) follows an\ninverse power of the scale. The distribution of the size of their components,\nproperly normalized, is scale-invariant, which reflects the self-similar nature\nof the underlying process. This allows to test if a graph (including\nnon-spatial ones) could possibly result from an underlying Levy process. When\nthe scale increases, these graphs never tend towards a single cluster, the\ngiant component. In other words, while the autocorrelation of the process\nscales as a power of the distance, they never undergo a phase transition of\npercolation type. The Levy graphs may find applications in community detection\nand in the analysis of collective behaviors as in face-to-face interaction\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 08:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 14:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The spectral leakage and picket fence effect would cause the\ndistortions in amplitude, frequency, and phase of signals, which have always\nbeen of concern, and attempts have been made to solve them. This paper proposes\ntwo novel decomposition theorems that can totally eliminate the spectral\nleakage and picket fence effect, and could broaden the knowledge of signal\nprocessing. First, two generalized eigenvalue equations are constructed for\nmultifrequency discrete real signals and complex signals. The two decomposition\ntheorems are then proved. On these bases, exact decomposition methods for real\nand complex signals are proposed. For a noise-free multifrequency real signal\nwith m sinusoidal components, the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each\ncomponent can be exactly calculated by using just 4m-1 discrete values and its\nsecond-order derivatives. For a multifrequency complex signal, only 2m-1\ndiscrete values and its first-order derivatives are needed. The numerical\nexperiments show that the proposed methods have very high resolution, and the\nsampling rate does not necessarily obey the Nyquist sampling theorem. With\nnoisy signals, the proposed methods have extraordinary accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 08:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

While current hair capture methods focus on hair shape estimation\nmany applications could benefit from an automated method for capturing the\nappearance of a physical hair sample, from augmented/virtual reality to hair\ndying development. Building on recent advances in inverse graphics and material\ncapture using deep neural networks, we introduce a novel method for hair color\ndigitization. Our proposed pipeline allows capturing the color appearance of a\nphysical hair sample and renders synthetic images of hair with a similar\nappearance, simulating different hair styles and/or lighting environments.\nSince rendering realistic hair images requires path-tracing rendering, the\nconventional inverse graphics approach based on differentiable rendering is\nuntractable. Our method is based on the combination of a controlled imaging\ndevice, a path-tracing renderer, and an inverse graphics model based on\nself-supervised machine learning, which does not require to use differentiable\nrendering to be trained.

It searches for a\ngood approximation of the problem's Pareto optimal solutions, from which the\nstakeholders choose the most preferred solution according to their preferences.\nHowever, when clear preferences of the stakeholders (e.g., a set of weights\nwhich reflect relative importance between objectives) are available prior to\nthe search, weighted search is believed to be the first choice since it\nsimplifies the search via converting the original multi-objective problem into\na single-objective one and enable the search to focus on what only the\nstakeholders are interested in.\n  This paper questions such a \"weighted search first\" belief. We show that the\nweights can, in fact, be harmful to the search process even in the presence of\nclear preferences. Specifically, we conduct a large scale empirical study which\nconsists of 38 systems/projects from three representative SBSE problems,\ntogether with two types of search budget and nine sets of weights, leading to\n604 cases of comparisons. Our key finding is that weighted search reaches a\ncertain level of solution quality by consuming relatively less resources at the\nearly stage of the search; however, Pareto search is at the majority of the\ntime (up to 77% of the cases) significantly better than its weighted\ncounterpart, as long as we allow a sufficient, but not unrealistic search\nbudget.

Ignition is investigated in the constant density\napproximation with a one-step irreversible reaction with large activation\nenergy adopted for the chemistry description. The ratio of the characteristic\nstrain time, given by the inverse of the wall velocity gradient, to the\ncharacteristic deflagration residence time defines the relevant controlling\nDamk\\\"ohler number $D$. The time-dependent evolution following the activation\nof the heat source is obtained by numerical integration of the energy and fuel\nconservation equations. For sufficiently small values of $D$, the solution is\nseen to evolve towards a steady flow in which the chemical reaction remains\nconfined to a finite near-source reactive kernel. This becomes increasingly\nslender for increasing values of $D$, corresponding to smaller near-wall\nvelocities, until a critical value $D_{c1}$ is reached at which the confined\nkernel is replaced by a steady anchored deflagration, assisted by the source\nheating rate, which develops indefinitely downstream. As the boundary-layer\nvelocity gradient is further decreased, a second critical Damk\\\"ohler number\n$D_{c2}>D_{c1}$ is reached at which the energy deposition results in a\nflashback deflagration propagating upstream against the incoming flow along the\nbase of the boundary layer. The computations are extended to investigate the\ndependence of $D_{c1}$ and $D_{c2}$ on the fuel diffusivity as well as the\nadditional dependence of $D_{c1}$ on the source heating rate, thereby\ndelineating the boundaries that define the relevant regime diagram for these\ncombustion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 09:26:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

To reduce the annotation burden,\nthis paper proposes a consistency-regularized region-growing network (CRGNet)\nto achieve semantic segmentation of VHR images with point-level annotations.\nThe key idea of CRGNet is to iteratively select unlabeled pixels with high\nconfidence to expand the annotated area from the original sparse points.\nHowever, since there may exist some errors and noises in the expanded\nannotations, directly learning from them may mislead the training of the\nnetwork. To this end, we further propose the consistency regularization\nstrategy, where a base classifier and an expanded classifier are employed.\nSpecifically, the base classifier is supervised by the original sparse\nannotations, while the expanded classifier aims to learn from the expanded\nannotations generated by the base classifier with the region-growing mechanism.\nThe consistency regularization is thereby achieved by minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the predictions from both the base and the expanded\nclassifiers. We find such a simple regularization strategy is yet very useful\nto control the quality of the region-growing mechanism.

The\ninterface between a metal and its nitride is expected to be atomically sharp,\nas chemical gradation would require the creation of N vacancies in nitrides and\nN interstitials in metal. Contrary to this belief, using first-principles\ndensity functional theory (DFT), we establish that the chemically graded Ti/TiN\ninterface is thermodynamically preferred over the sharp interface. DFT\ncalculated N vacancy formation energy in TiN is 2.4 eV, and N interstitial in\nTi is -3.8 eV. Thus, diffusion of N from TiN to Ti by the formation of N\nvacancy in TiN and N interstitial in Ti would reduce the internal energy of the\nTi-TiN heterostructure. We show that diffusion of N is thermodynamically\nfavorable till ~23% of N has diffused from TiN to Ti, resulting in an\natomically chemically graded interface, which we refer to as a 3-D interface.\nExperiments' inability to identify a 3-D interface in Ti/TiN could be\nattributed to limitations in identifying chemical composition and structure\nwith atomic-level resolution at interfaces.

In this paper, we\ntake advantage of the inherent properties of neural networks to federate the\nprocess of training of these models. This is crucial in the medical domain\nsince data is scarce and collaboration of multiple health centers is essential\nto make a conclusive decision about the properties of a treatment or a disease.\nTo ensure the privacy of the datasets, it is common to utilize differential\nprivacy on top of federated learning. Differential privacy acts by introducing\nrandom noise to different stages of training, thus making it harder for an\nadversary to extract details about the data. However, in the realistic setting\nof small medical datasets and only a few data centers, this noise makes it\nharder for the models to converge. To address this problem, we propose\nDPFed-post which adds a post-processing stage to the private federated learning\nscheme.

A unique feature of these strong-pinning centers\nis that they survive upto high temperatures (near Tc) and produce a\nnon-Gaussian distribution of the penetration field strength.

However, existing GCN-based methods\nbuild face graphs mainly according to kNN relations in the feature space, which\nmay lead to a lot of noise edges connecting two faces of different classes. The\nface features will be polluted when messages pass along these noise edges, thus\ndegrading the performance of GCNs. In this paper, a novel algorithm named\nAda-NETS is proposed to cluster faces by constructing clean graphs for GCNs. In\nAda-NETS, each face is transformed to a new structure space, obtaining robust\nfeatures by considering face features of the neighbour images. Then, an\nadaptive neighbour discovery strategy is proposed to determine a proper number\nof edges connecting to each face image. It significantly reduces the noise\nedges while maintaining the good ones to build a graph with clean yet rich\nedges for GCNs to cluster faces.

Coarse-grained classification represents categories with a\nlarge degree of dissimilarity, such as the classification of cats and dogs,\nwhile fine-grained classification represents classifications with a large\ndegree of similarity, such as cat species, bird species, and the makes or\nmodels of vehicles. Unlike coarse-grained visual classification, fine-grained\nvisual classification often requires professional experts to label data, which\nmakes data more expensive. To meet this challenge, many approaches propose to\nautomatically find the most discriminative regions and use local features to\nprovide more precise features.

Because FBSs\nare battery-powered, regulating their energy usage is a vital aspect of their\nuse; and therefore the appropriate placement and trajectories of FBSs\nthroughout their operation are critical to overcoming this challenge. In this\npaper, we propose a method of solving a multi-FBS 3D trajectory problem that\nconsiders FBS energy consumption, operation time, flight distance limits, and\ninter-cell interference constraints. Our method is divided into two phases: FBS\nplacement and FBS trajectory. In taking this approach, we break the problem\ninto several snapshots. First, we find the minimum number of FBSs required and\ntheir proper 3D positions in each snapshot. Then, between every two snapshots,\nthe trajectory phase is executed. The optimal path between the origin and\ndestination of each FBS is determined during the trajectory phase by utilizing\na proposed binary linear problem (BLP) model that considers FBS energy\nconsumption and flight distance constraints. Then, the shortest path for each\nFBS is determined while taking obstacles and collision avoidance into\nconsideration. The number of FBSs needed may vary between snapshots, so we\npresent an FBS set management (FSM) technique to manage the set of FBSs and\ntheir power.

They generally require large training datasets,\nwhich is a limitation in most practical cases. Transfer learning allows\nimporting the first layers of a pre-trained architecture and connecting them to\nfully-connected layers to adapt them to a new problem. Consequently, the\nconfiguration of the these layers becomes crucial for the performance of the\nmodel. Unfortunately, the optimization of these models is usually a\ncomputationally demanding task. One strategy to optimize Deep Learning models\nis the pruning scheme. Pruning methods are focused on reducing the complexity\nof the network, assuming an expected performance penalty of the model once\npruned. However, the pruning could potentially be used to improve the\nperformance, using an optimization algorithm to identify and eventually remove\nunnecessary connections among neurons. This work proposes EvoPruneDeepTL, an\nevolutionary pruning model for Transfer Learning based Deep Neural Networks\nwhich replaces the last fully-connected layers with sparse layers optimized by\na genetic algorithm. Depending on its solution encoding strategy, our proposed\nmodel can either perform optimized pruning or feature selection over the\ndensely connected part of the neural network. We carry out different\nexperiments with several datasets to assess the benefits of our proposal.\nResults show the contribution of EvoPruneDeepTL and feature selection to the\noverall computational efficiency of the network as a result of the optimization\nprocess.

Recently, KGs are popularly used as the auxiliary information\nto enable more accurate, explainable, and diverse user preference\nrecommendations. Specifically, existing KG-based recommendation methods target\nmodeling high-order relations/dependencies from long connectivity user-item\ninteractions hidden in KG. However, most of them ignore the cold-start problems\n(i.e., user cold-start and item cold-start) of recommendation analytics, which\nrestricts their performance in scenarios when involving new users or new items.\nInspired by the success of meta-learning on scarce training samples, we propose\na novel meta-learning based framework called MetaKG, which encompasses a\ncollaborative-aware meta learner and a knowledge-aware meta learner, to capture\nmeta users' preference and entities' knowledge for cold-start recommendations.\nThe collaborative-aware meta learner aims to locally aggregate user preferences\nfor each user preference learning task. In contrast, the knowledge-aware meta\nlearner is to globally generalize knowledge representation across different\nuser preference learning tasks. Guided by two meta learners, MetaKG can\neffectively capture the high-order collaborative relations and semantic\nrepresentations, which could be easily adapted to cold-start scenarios.\nBesides, we devise a novel adaptive task scheduler which can adaptively select\nthe informative tasks for meta learning in order to prevent the model from\nbeing corrupted by noisy tasks. Extensive experiments on various cold-start\nscenarios using three real data sets demonstrate that our presented MetaKG\noutperforms all the existing state-of-the-art competitors in terms of\neffectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 13:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 02:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Most contemporary\noptical flow techniques largely focus on addressing the cross-image matching\nwith feature similarity, with few methods considering how to explicitly reason\nover the given scene for achieving a holistic motion understanding. In this\nwork, taking a fresh perspective, we introduce a novel graph-based approach,\ncalled adaptive graph reasoning for optical flow (AGFlow), to emphasize the\nvalue of scene/context information in optical flow. Our key idea is to decouple\nthe context reasoning from the matching procedure, and exploit scene\ninformation to effectively assist motion estimation by learning to reason over\nthe adaptive graph. The proposed AGFlow can effectively exploit the context\ninformation and incorporate it within the matching procedure, producing more\nrobust and accurate results.

We characterize the physical\nproperties of this model and perform, using a number of numerical techniques,\nan in-depth statistical analysis of structure and dynamics of the emerging\nconformations. We discovered a number of interesting features, including the\nexistence of a direct correspondence between the sequence of the active forces\nand the structure of folded conformations, and we discover the existence of an\nensemble of highly mobile compact structures capable of moving from\nconformation to conformation. Finally, akin to protein design problems, we\ndiscuss a method that is capable of designing specific target folds by sampling\nover sequences of active forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 14:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

This renders DNNs vulnerable to strategic\ninput manipulations by attackers, and also oversensitive to environmental\nnoise.\n  To mitigate this phenomenon, practitioners apply joint classification by an\n*ensemble* of DNNs. By aggregating the classification outputs of different\nindividual DNNs for the same input, ensemble-based classification reduces the\nrisk of misclassifications due to the specific realization of the stochastic\ntraining process of any single DNN. However, the effectiveness of a DNN\nensemble is highly dependent on its members *not simultaneously erring* on many\ndifferent inputs.\n  In this case study, we harness recent advances in DNN verification to devise\na methodology for identifying ensemble compositions that are less prone to\nsimultaneous errors, even when the input is adversarially perturbed --\nresulting in more robustly-accurate ensemble-based classification.\n  Our proposed framework uses a DNN verifier as a backend, and includes\nheuristics that help reduce the high complexity of directly verifying\nensembles.

We report here\na study conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). It demonstrates that\nthe absence of any beam time-structure leads to low pile-up events and a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than one hour acquisition time per sample\nor data point. This performance creates the perspective to open this technique\nto a wider audience for the routine investigation of non-destructive and\ndepth-sensitive elemental compositions, for example in rare and precious\nsamples. Using a hetero-structured sample of known elements and thicknesses, we\nsuccessfully detected the characteristic muonic X-rays, emitted during the\ncapture of a negative muon by an atom, and the gamma-rays resulting from the\nnuclear capture of the muon, characterizing the capabilities of MIXE at PSI.\nThis sample emphasizes the quality of a continuous beam, and the exceptional\nSNR at high rates. Such sensitivity will enable totally new statistically\nintense aspects in the field of MIXE, e.g. elemental 3D-tomography and chemical\nanalysis.

To\nillustrate an application of the Infection Delay Model, this paper integrates\nhousehold travel survey data with cell phone mobility data from the S\\~ao Paulo\nmetropolitan region to assess the effectiveness of lockdowns to slow the spread\nof COVID-19. Rather than operating under the assumption that the next pandemic\nwill begin in the same region as the last, the model estimates infection delays\nunder every possible outbreak scenario, allowing for generalizable insights\ninto the effectiveness of interventions to delay a region's first case. The\nmodel sheds light on how the effectiveness of lockdowns to slow the spread of\ndisease is influenced by the interaction of mobility networks and\nsocio-economic levels.

A key challenge behind this problem is to identify a\nsuitable representation capturing all relevant properties of the underlying\nfunctional mapping. A principled approach to distribution regression is\nprovided by kernel mean embeddings, which lifts kernel-induced similarity on\nthe input domain at the probability level. This strategy effectively tackles\nthe two-stage sampling nature of the problem, enabling one to derive estimators\nwith strong statistical guarantees, such as universal consistency and excess\nrisk bounds. However, kernel mean embeddings implicitly hinge on the maximum\nmean discrepancy (MMD), a metric on probabilities, which may fail to capture\nkey geometrical relations between distributions.

In this paper, we identify bottlenecks in parallel data\nlayout and domain decomposition that hinder an efficient evaluation of the\nmortar integrals.

Accelerometer measurements are\nmore cost effective and less intrusive than alternatives such as video\nmonitoring or pressure sensors.

Thus, the adaptive two capacitor model enables new\ninsights into the molecular details of the charge separation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 15:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

In this\npaper, we present an empirical study to observe the effect of test automation\nmaturity (assessed by standard best practices in the literature) on product\nquality, test automation effort, and release cycle in the CI context of open\nsource projects. We run our test automation maturity survey and got responses\nfrom 37 open source java projects. We also mined software repositories of the\nsame projects.

At the same time, the eyes, their movements, and the meaning of these\nmovements are being progressively researched. The combination of these\ndevelopments has led to exciting approaches. In this dissertation, I present\nsome of these approaches which I worked on during my Ph.D.\n  First, I provide insight into the development of models that use artificial\nintelligence to connect eye movements with visual expertise. This is\ndemonstrated for two domains or rather groups of people: athletes in\ndecision-making actions and surgeons in arthroscopic procedures. The resulting\nmodels can be considered as digital diagnostic models for automatic expertise\nrecognition. Furthermore, I show approaches that investigate the\ntransferability of eye movement patterns to different expertise domains and\nsubsequently, important aspects of techniques for generalization. Finally, I\naddress the temporal detection of confusion based on eye movement data. The\nresults suggest the use of the resulting model as a clock signal for possible\ndigital assistance options in the training of young professionals. An\ninteresting aspect of my research is that I was able to draw on very valuable\ndata from DFB youth elite athletes as well as on long-standing experts in\narthroscopy.

The method adopted,\nusing historical precipitation and temperature data and water levels collected\nin monitoring wells, first investigates the possible correlations between\nmeteorological and groundwater indices at each well. Then, if there is a\ncorrelation, a linear regression analysis is used to model the relationships\nbetween SGIs and SPIs, and SGIs and SPEIs. The same relationships are used to\ninfer future SGIs from SPI and SPEI projections obtained by means of an\nensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), under different climate scenarios\n(RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). This methodology has been applied to data collected in\nTuscany (Italy), where historical series of daily climate variables (since\n1934) and daily records for 16 wells, covering the period 2005-2020, are\navailable. The impacts on groundwater have been computed in the short\n(2006-2035), medium (2036-2065) and long term (2066-2095). The analysis\nindicates that, in the historical period and for most of the monitoring wells,\nthere is a good correlation between SGIs and SPIs or SPEIs. In a global warming\nscenario, the influence of temperature on evapotranspiration phenomena cannot\nbe overlooked so the SGI-SPEI relationships seem more suitable to forecast\ngroundwater droughts. According to these relationships, negative effects on\ngroundwater levels in almost all wells are estimated for the futureDue to the\ntype of data required and its simplicity, this methodology can be applied to\ndifferent areas of interest for a quick estimate of groundwater availability\nunder climate change scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 11:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}

Despite the fruitful progress of MP\nGNNs, their performance can suffer from over-smoothing, when node\nrepresentations become too similar and even indistinguishable from one another.\nFurthermore, it has been reported that intrinsic graph structures are smoothed\nout as the GNN layer increases. Inspired by the edge-preserving bilateral\nfilters used in image processing, we propose a new, adaptable, and powerful MP\nframework to prevent over-smoothing. Our bilateral-MP estimates a pairwise\nmodular gradient by utilizing the class information of nodes, and further\npreserves the global graph structure by using the gradient when the aggregating\nfunction is applied. Our proposed scheme can be generalized to all ordinary MP\nGNNs. Experiments on five medium-size benchmark datasets using four\nstate-of-the-art MP GNNs indicate that the bilateral-MP improves performance by\nalleviating over-smoothing.

However, many GCN-based KGC\nmodels fail to outperform state-of-the-art KGE models though introducing\nadditional computational complexity. This phenomenon motivates us to explore\nthe real effect of GCNs in KGC. Therefore, in this paper, we build upon\nrepresentative GCN-based KGC models and introduce variants to find which factor\nof GCNs is critical in KGC. Surprisingly, we observe from experiments that the\ngraph structure modeling in GCNs does not have a significant impact on the\nperformance of KGC models, which is in contrast to the common belief.

Whereas continuum mechanics is a very classical area of study, and\nsignificant effort has been devoted to the development of intricate\nconstitutive models for finite elasticity, we show that in the kinds of\nlarge-strain mechanics problems arising in soft robotics, many of the\nparameters in constitutive models are irrelevant. For the most part, the\nisochoric (locally volume-preserving) constraint dominates behavior, and this\ncan be built into closed-form kinematic deformation fields before even\nconsidering other aspects of constitutive modeling. We therefore focus on\ndeveloping and applying primitive deformations that each observe this\nconstraint. It is shown that by composing a wide enough variety of such\ndeformations that the most common behaviors observed in soft robots can be\nreplicated. Case studies include an inflatable rubber chamber, a slender rubber\nrod, and a rubber block subjected to different boundary conditions. We show\nthat this method is at least 50 times faster than the ABAQUS implementation of\nthe finite element method (FEM). Physical experiments and measurements show\nthat both our method and ABAQUS have approximately 10% error relative to\nexperimentally measured displacements, as well as to each other. Our method\nprovides a real-time alternative to FEM, and captures essential degrees of\nfreedom for use in feedback control systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 06:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

The development of Internet of Drones (IoD)\nmakes UAV operation more autonomous. Network virtualization technology is a\npromising technology to support IoD, so the allocation of virtual resources\nbecomes a crucial issue in IoD. How to rationally allocate potential material\nresources has become an urgent problem to be solved. The main work of this\npaper is presented as follows: (1) In order to improve the optimization\nperformance and reduce the computation time, we propose a multi-domain virtual\nnetwork embedding algorithm (MP-VNE) adopting the centralized hierarchical\nmulti-domain architecture. The proposed algorithm can avoid the local optimum\nthrough incorporating the genetic variation factor into the traditional\nparticle swarm optimization process. (2) In order to simplify the\nmulti-objective optimization problem, we transform the multi-objective problem\ninto a single-objective problem through weighted summation method. The results\nprove that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimal solution.\n(3) In order to reduce the mapping cost, we propose an algorithm for selecting\ncandidate nodes based on the estimated mapping cost. Each physical domain\ncalculates the estimated mapping cost of all nodes according to the formula of\nthe estimated mapping cost, and chooses the node with the lowest estimated\nmapping cost as the candidate node. The simulation results show that the\nproposed MP-VNE algorithm has better performance than MC-VNM, LID-VNE and other\nalgorithms in terms of delay, cost and comprehensive indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 07:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

However, they are not suitable for nested and overlapping spans with\nlarge ontologies and for predicting the position of the entities. To fill this\ngap, we introduce a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer (RNN-T). These\nmodels are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly\nspecifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models.\nRNN-T models learn the alignment using a loss function that sums over all\nalignments. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and target\nlabels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment\nRNN-T model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of\nRNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. As a more general case, we also\npropose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation of\nthe given input alignment and the model will learn an alignment within the\ngiven constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models\nwhich can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when\navailable. Through empirical experiments on a challenging real-world medical\nNER task with multiple nested ontologies, we demonstrate that our fixed\nalignment model outperforms the standard RNN-T model, improving F1-score from\n0.70 to 0.74.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 05:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}
