In ergodic theory the maximally chaotic dynamical systems\n(MCDS) can be defined as dynamical systems that have nonzero Kolmogorov\nentropy. The hyperbolic dynamical systems that fulfil the Anosov C-condition\nbelong to the MCDS insofar as they have exponential instability of their phase\ntrajectories and positive Kolmogorov entropy. It follows that the C-condition\ndefines a rich class of MCDS that span over an open set in the space of all\ndynamical systems. The large class of Anosov-Kolmogorov MCDS is realised on\nRiemannian manifolds of negative sectional curvatures and on high-dimensional\ntori. The interest in MCDS is rooted in the attempts to understand the\nrelaxation phenomena, the foundations of the statistical mechanics, the\nappearance of turbulence in fluid dynamics, the non-linear dynamics of\nYang-Mills field and gravitating N-body systems as well as black hole\nthermodynamics.

To address this, we present a\nnew approach for personalized FL that achieves exact stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) minimization. We start from the FedPer (Arivazhagan et al., 2019)\nneural network (NN) architecture for personalization, whereby the NN has two\ntypes of layers: the first ones are the common layers across clients, while the\nfew final ones are client-specific and are needed for personalization. We\npropose a novel SGD-type scheme where, at each optimization round, randomly\nselected clients perform gradient-descent updates over their client-specific\nweights towards optimizing the loss function on their own datasets, without\nupdating the common weights. At the final update, each client computes the\njoint gradient over both client-specific and common weights and returns the\ngradient of common parameters to the server. This allows to perform an exact\nand unbiased SGD step over the full set of parameters in a distributed manner,\ni.e. the updates of the personalized parameters are performed by the clients\nand those of the common ones by the server. Our method is superior to FedAvg\nand FedPer baselines in multi-class classification benchmarks such as Omniglot,\nCIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST and has much lower computational\ncomplexity per round.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 16:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

However, obtaining the expected\nperformance of such deep learning-based systems requires large amounts of\nclassified images to train the deep models. Obtaining such data is usually\nboring, time-consuming, and can easily be exposed to human mistakes which\nhinder the utilization of such deep learning approaches. This paper introduces\na novel framework for brain tumor detection and classification. The basic idea\nis to generate a large synthetic MRI images dataset that reflects the typical\npattern of the brain MRI images from a small class-unbalanced collected\ndataset. The resulted dataset is then used for training a deep model for\ndetection and classification. Specifically, we employ two types of deep models.\nThe first model is a generative model to capture the distribution of the\nimportant features in a set of small class-unbalanced brain MRI images. Then by\nusing this distribution, the generative model can synthesize any number of\nbrain MRI images for each class. Hence, the system can automatically convert a\nsmall unbalanced dataset to a larger balanced one. The second model is the\nclassifier that is trained using the large balanced dataset to detect brain\ntumors in MRI images. The proposed framework acquires an overall detection\naccuracy of 96.88% which highlights the promise of the proposed framework as an\naccurate low-overhead brain tumor detection system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 16:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

To further\ninvestigate entropic effects, we compare spectra sampled in continuous\nfrequency with results of amplitudes sampled on a fixed frequency grid. We\ndemonstrate equivalences between sampling and optimizing spectral functions\nwith the maximum-entropy approach with different forms of the entropy.

Such an ability is especially important\nat a time when machine learning is being used to automate decision processes\nwhich concern sensitive factors and legal outcomes. Indeed, it is even a\nrequirement according to EU law. Furthermore, researchers concerned with\nimposing overly restrictive functional form (e.g., as would be the case in a\nlinear regression) may be motivated to use machine learning algorithms in\nconjunction with explainability techniques, as part of exploratory research,\nwith the goal of identifying important variables which are associated with an\noutcome of interest. For example, epidemiologists might be interested in\nidentifying `risk factors' - i.e. factors which affect recovery from disease -\nby using random forests and assessing variable relevance using importance\nmeasures. However, and as we demonstrate, machine learning algorithms are not\nas flexible as they might seem, and are instead incredibly sensitive to the\nunderling causal structure in the data. The consequences of this are that\npredictors which are, in fact, critical to a causal system and highly\ncorrelated with the outcome, may nonetheless be deemed by explainability\ntechniques to be unrelated/unimportant/unpredictive of the outcome. Rather than\nthis being a limitation of explainability techniques per se, we show that it is\nrather a consequence of the mathematical implications of regression, and the\ninteraction of these implications with the associated conditional\nindependencies of the underlying causal structure.

Variations measured for a water vapour spectral feature reveal a\ntemperature profile that transitions from warming with altitude on the dayside\nhemisphere to cooling with altitude on the nightside hemisphere. The data are\nwell explained by models assuming chemical equilibrium, with water molecules\nthermally dissociating at low pressures on the dayside and recombining on the\nnightside. Nightside temperatures are low enough for perovskite (CaTiO3) to\ncondense, which could deplete titanium from the gas phase and explain recent\nnon-detections at the day-night terminator. Nightside temperatures are also\nconsistent with the condensation of refractory species such as magnesium, iron,\nand vanadium. Detections of these metals at the day-night terminator suggest,\nhowever, that if they do form nightside clouds, cold trapping does not\nefficiently remove them from the upper atmosphere.

Yet, when there are many devices\nthat tend to be active only intermittently, the fully orthogonal resource\nallocation is largely inefficient. The solution is to employ a common, shared\npool of resources and account for the fact that some collisions and\ninterference will inevitably occur. In this contribution we study the\nreliability aspects of such multi-user uplink communication scenario over a\nshared pool of channel resources, where intermittently active devices utilize\nmultiple transmissions (K-repetition coding) to achieve diversity. We focus on\ntwo access methods -- one where devices choose the K slots at random and one\nwhere the access patterns are deterministic and follow a specific code design,\nnamely the Steiner System. We analyze the problem under two signal models that\ninvolve different complexity for the receiver. Firstly, a model which treats\ncollisions as destructive, i.e. only those K' among K transmissions that do not\ncontain interference can be used and combined. Second, where receiver is\ncapable of utilizing all K replicas and applies maximum ratio combining (MRC)\ntreating interference as noise. Furthermore, in both cases we investigate the\nreceiver with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC)\ncapabilities. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop useful\napproximations and bounds for the outage probabilities in the aforementioned\nscenarios that match very closely the simulation results. We also show that\ndeterministic patterns have the potential to significantly outperform fully\nrandom selection, both in terms of raw performance and by simplifying the\nsystem design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 19:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Some species are solitary; others\nlive in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased\nlevels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations and\nbeneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful\ncontagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these\ncontagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an\nexplicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed\nby contagion remains elusive.\n  We consider a model for the evolution of sociality strategies in the presence\nof both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study the dynamics of this model\nat three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model to\ndescribe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a replicator equation\nto study the changing fractions of two different levels of sociality, and an\nadaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution of the population\nlevel of sociality.\n  For a wide range of assumptions about the benefits and costs of infection, we\nidentify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable sociality strategy (ESS)\nis distinct from the collective optimum -- the level of sociality that would be\nbest for all individuals. In particular, the ESS level of social interaction is\ngreater (respectively less) than the social optimum when the good contagion\nspreads more (respectively less) readily than the bad contagion.\n  Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the evolution of social\ninteraction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily lead populations to\nsocial structures that are good for any or all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 20:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 17:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

The standard version of $C$ considers a\nmodel and a derived conditional model, formed by conditioning on an ancillary\nstatistic for the model, together with the data, to be equivalent with respect\nto their statistical evidence content. This equivalence is considered to hold\nfor any ancillary statistic for the model but creates two problems. First,\nthere can be more than one maximal ancillary in a given context and this leads\nto $C$ not being an equivalence relation and, as such, calls into question\nwhether $C$ is a proper characterization of statistical evidence. Second, a\nstatistic $A$ can change from ancillary to informative (in its marginal\ndistribution) when another ancillary $B$ changes, from having one known\ndistribution $P_{B},$ to having another known distribution $Q_{B}.$ This means\nthat the stability of ancillarity differs across ancillary statistics and\nraises the issue of when a statistic can be said to be truly ancillary. It is\ntherefore natural, and practically important, to limit conditioning to the set\nof ancillaries whose distribution is irrelevant to the ancillary status of any\nother ancillary statistic. This results in a family of ancillaries for which\nthere is a unique maximal member. This also gives a new principle for\ninference, the stable conditionality principle, that satisfies the criteria\nrequired for any principle whose aim is to characterize statistical evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 21:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Corresponding weight maps were estimated\nby a sliding-window algorithm which analyzed signal deviations from a\npatch-wise reference. In order to ensure the computation of a robust reference,\nrepetitions were filtered by a classifier that was trained to detect images\ncorrupted by signal dropouts. The proposed method, termed Deep Learning-guided\nAdaptive Weighted Averaging (DLAWA), was evaluated in terms of dropout\nsuppression capability, bias reduction in the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient\n(ADC) and noise characteristics.\n  Results: In the case of uniform averaging, motion-related dropouts caused\nsignal attenuation and ADC overestimation in parts of the liver with the left\nlobe being affected particularly. Both effects could be substantially mitigated\nby DLAWA while preventing global penalties with respect to signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) due to local signal suppression. Performing evaluations on patient\ndata, the capability to recover lesions concealed by signal dropouts was\ndemonstrated as well. Further, DLAWA allowed for transparent control of the\ntrade-off between SNR and signal dropout suppression by means of a few\nhyperparameters.\n  Conclusion: This work presents an effective and flexible method for the local\ncompensation of signal dropouts resulting from motion and pulsation.

Since the search region encompasses the target, attention from the\nsearch region is used for robust model adaptation. In particular, our approach\nrelies on an auto-encoder trained through adversarial learning to detect\nchanges in a target object's appearance and predict a future target template,\nusing a set of target templates localized from tracker outputs at previous\nframes. To prevent template corruption during the update, the proposed tracker\nalso performs change detection using the generative model to suspend updates\nuntil the tracker stabilizes, and robust matching can resume through dynamic\ntemplate fusion.\n  Extensive experiments conducted on VOT-16, VOT-17, OTB-50, and OTB-100\ndatasets highlight the effectiveness of our method, along with the impact of\nits key components. Results indicate that our proposed approach can outperform\nstate-of-art trackers, and its overall robustness allows tracking for a longer\ntime before failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

In sufficiently large quantum systems, one can extract\nfrom the OTOC the quantum analog of the Lyapunov coefficient that describes the\ntime scale on which a classical chaotic system becomes scrambled. OTOCs have\nbeen applied only to a very limited number of toy models, such as the SYK model\nconnected with black hole information scrambling, but they could find much\nwider applicability for information scrambling in quantum systems that allow\ncomparison with experiments. The vibrations of polyatomic molecules are known\nto undergo a transition from regular dynamics at low energy to facile energy\nflow at sufficiently high energy. Molecules therefore represent ideal quantum\nsystems to study scrambling in many-body systems of moderate size (here 6 to 36\ndegrees of freedom).

In this\npaper, we aim to quantitatively analyze why DNNs can achieve comparable\nperformance in the physical layer comparing with traditional techniques, and\nalso drive their cost in terms of computational complexity. To achieve this\ngoal, we first analyze the encoding performance of a DNN-based transmitter and\ncompare it to a traditional one. And then, we theoretically analyze the\nperformance of DNN-based estimator and compare it with traditional estimators.\nThird, we investigate and validate how information is flown in a DNN-based\ncommunication system under the information theoretic concepts. Our analysis\ndevelops a concise way to open the \"black box\" of DNNs in physical layer\ncommunication, which can be applied to support the design of DNN-based\nintelligent communication techniques and help to provide explainable\nperformance assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 02:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 03:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The\ndependence structure of extreme prices shows asymmetric and time-dependent\npatterns. Applying the extremograms, we further show the effectiveness of the\nAustralian Energy Market Commission's 2016 rebidding rule with respect to\nreducing the share of isolated price spikes that are often considered as an\nindication of strategic bidding. Our results provide important information for\nhedging decisions of market participants and for policy makers who aim to\nreduce market volatility and extreme price outcomes through effective\nregulations which guide the trading behaviour of market participants as well as\nimproved network interconnections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 03:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

FCA is adopted to categorize line indices measured\nfrom LAMOST low-resolution spectra, and automatically remove the least\nmetallicity-sensitive indices. The FCA-processed indices are then transferred\nto the artificial neural network (ANN) to derive metallicities for 147 very\nmetal-poor (VMP) stars that have been analyzed by high-resolution spectroscopy.\nThe FCA-ANN method could derive robust metallicities for VMP stars, with a\nprecision of 0.2 dex compared with high-resolution analysis. The recommended\nFCA threshold value \\lambda for this test is between 0.9965 and 0.9975. After\nreducing the dimension of the line indices through FCA, the derived\nmetallicities are still robust, with no loss of accuracy, and the FCA-ANN\nmethod performs stably for different spectral quality from [Fe/H] from -1.8\ndown to -3.5. Compared with traditional classification methods, FCA considers\nambiguity in groupings and noncontinuity of data, and is thus more suitable for\nobservational data analysis. Though this early test uses FCA to analyze\nlow-resolution spectra, and feeds the input to the ANN method to derive\nmetallicities, FCA should be able to, in the large data era, also analyze\nslitless spectroscopy and multiband photometry, and prepare the input for\nmethods not limited to ANN, in the field of stellar physics for other studies,\ne.g., stellar classification, identification of peculiar objects. The\nliterature-collected high-resolution sample can help improve pipelines to\nderive stellar metallicities, and systematic offsets in metallicities for VMP\nstars for three published LAMOST catalogs have been discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 03:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Because it is difficult to develop first principle models of cars driven\nby humans, there is great potential for using data driven approaches in\ndeveloping traffic dynamical models. While there is extensive literature on\nthis subject, previous works mainly address the prediction accuracy of\ndata-driven models. Moreover, it is often difficult to apply these models to\ncommon planning frameworks since they fail to meet the assumptions therein. In\nthis work, we propose a new stochastic traffic model, Recurrent Traffic Graph\nNeural Network (RTGNN), by enforcing additional structures on the model so that\nthe proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with existing motion planning\nalgorithms. RTGNN is a Markovian model and is able to infer future traffic\nstates conditioned on the motion of the ego vehicle. Specifically, RTGNN uses a\ndefinition of the traffic state that includes the state of all players in a\nlocal region and is therefore able to make joint predictions for all agents of\ninterest. Meanwhile, we explicitly model the hidden states of agents,\n\"intentions,\" as part of the traffic state to reflect the inherent partial\nobservability of traffic dynamics. The above mentioned properties are critical\nfor integrating RTGNN with motion planning algorithms coupling prediction and\ndecision making.

An attacker has the\ncapability to manipulate the RIS controller and modify the phase shift induced\nby the RIS elements. The goal of the attacker is to minimize the data rate at\nthe receiver, subject to a constraint on the attack detection probability at\nthe receiver. We consider a number of attack detection models: (i) composite\nhypothesis testing based attack detection in a given fading block for known\nchannel gains, (ii) sequential quickest detection of CMA in a given fading\nblock for known channel gains, (iii) nonparametric hypothesis test to detect\nCMA for unknown channel gains over a fading block, and (iv)\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) moment based detection over possibly multiple\nfading blocks. In the first case, a simple energy detector turns out to be\nuniformly most powerful (UMP). In the second case, simplification of the\nstandard CUSUM test and its performance bounds are obtained. In the third case,\nnon-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is further simplified to a simple\nper-sample double threshold test. The attack against these three detectors are\ndesigned via novel optimization formulations and semidefinite relaxation based\nsolutions. In the fourth case, we consider threshold detection using moments of\nSNR; various SNR moments under no attack are obtained analytically for large\nRIS and then used to formulate the attack design problem as a linear program.\nFinally, numerical results illustrate the performance and trade-offs associated\nwith the attack schemes, and also demonstrate their efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 06:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 19:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Nevertheless,\n$\\alpha$ clustering in medium-heavy nuclei is quite a hot subject recently.\n  Purpose: The tensor interaction has been known to play an essential role in\nthe strong binding of the $^4$He nucleus, which induces the\ntwo-particle-two-hole (2p2h) excitation. Since this excitation is blocked when\nanother nucleus approaches, it is worthwhile to show whether the tensor effect\nworks to keep the distance between $^4$He and $^{40}$Ca and becomes the\nsalvation of the clustering in $^{44}$Ti.\n  Methods: The spin-orbit effect is included in the cluster model by using the\nantisymmetrized quasi cluster model (AQCM) developed by the authors. We have\nalso developed an improved version of the simplified method to include the\ntensor contribution ($i$SMT), which allows us to estimate the tensor effect\nwithin the cluster model.

This is the signature of strong transport of\nangular momentum (AM) in stellar interiors. One of the plausible candidates to\nefficiently carry AM is magnetic fields with various topologies that could be\npresent in stellar radiative zones. Among them, strong axisymmetric azimuthal\nmagnetic fields have received a lot of interest. Indeed, if they are subject to\nthe so-called Tayler instability, the accompanying triggered Maxwell stresses\ncan transport AM efficiently. In addition, the electromotive force induced by\nthe fluctuations of magnetic and velocity fields could potentially sustain a\ndynamo action that leads to the regeneration of the initial strong axisymmetric\nazimuthal magnetic field. The key question we aim to answer is: can we detect\nsignatures of these deep strong azimuthal magnetic fields? The only way to\nanswer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories of study are\nintermediate-mass and massive stars. Most of these are rapid rotators during\ntheir main-sequence. Therefore, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating\nin stably stratified, rotating, and potentially strongly magnetised radiative\nzones. We generalise the traditional approximation of rotation by\nsimultaneously taking general axisymmetric differential rotation and azimuthal\nmagnetic fields into account in a non-perturbative way. Using this new\nformalism, we derive the asymptotic properties of magneto-gravito-inertial\n(MGI) waves and their period spacings. We find that toroidal magnetic fields\ninduce a shift in the period spacings of MGI modes.

Motivated by reallocation of governmental institutions\nin Sweden, in 1995 J. Krarup posed the problem of finding $k$ edge-disjoint\nHamiltonian Circuits of minimum total weight, called the peripatetic salesman\nproblem (PSP). Since then researchers have investigated the complexity of\nfinding diverse solutions to spanning trees, paths, vertex covers, matchings,\nand more. Unlike the PSP that has a constraint on the total weight of the\nsolutions, recent work has involved finding diverse solutions that are all\noptimal.\n  However, sometimes the space of exact solutions may be too small to achieve\nsufficient diversity. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of obtaining\nsufficiently-diverse, yet approximately-optimal solutions to optimization\nproblems. Formally, given an integer $k$, an approximation factor $c$, and an\ninstance $I$ of an optimization problem, we aim to obtain a set of $k$\nsolutions to $I$ that a) are all $c$ approximately-optimal for $I$ and b)\nmaximize the diversity of the $k$ solutions. Finding such solutions, therefore,\nrequires a better understanding of the global landscape of the optimization\nfunction.\n  We show that, given any metric on the space of solutions, and the diversity\nmeasure as the sum of pairwise distances between solutions, this problem can be\nsolved by combining ideas from dispersion and multicriteria optimization. We\nfirst provide a general reduction to an associated budget-constrained\noptimization (BCO) problem, where one objective function is to be maximized\n(minimized) subject to a bound on the second objective function. We then prove\nthat bi-approximations to the BCO can be used to give bi-approximations to the\ndiverse approximately optimal solutions problem with a little overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 07:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

As Juno transitioned to its extended mission, we review the major\nfindings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant to understanding Jupiter's\nformation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's\ninterior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is\naccordingly non-adiabatic, with a complex internal structure. These new results\nimply that current models of Jupiter's formation and evolution require a\nrevision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths\nthat can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the\nconstraints they provide. We note that standard core accretion formation\nmodels, including the heavy-element enrichment during planetary growth is\nconsistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition gradients in\nits deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this\nregion, which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to\nabout 10% of Jupiter's total mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno\ndata imply that this region contains 30% of the mass or more. One way to\nexplain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long\n(about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and\nplanetesimals delaying the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's\nfuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact or convection post-formation.\nThese novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions. Clarity\non the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution\nobservations of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed\nand modeled architectures of extrasolar systems with giant planets, and future\nJuno data obtained during its extended mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 08:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

We\nshow theoretically that this tradeoff between ID and OOD accuracy arises even\nin a simple setting: fine-tuning overparameterized two-layer linear networks.\nWe prove that the OOD error of fine-tuning is high when we initialize with a\nfixed or random head -- this is because while fine-tuning learns the head, the\nlower layers of the neural network change simultaneously and distort the\npretrained features. Our analysis suggests that the easy two-step strategy of\nlinear probing then full fine-tuning (LP-FT), sometimes used as a fine-tuning\nheuristic, combines the benefits of both fine-tuning and linear probing.\nEmpirically, LP-FT outperforms both fine-tuning and linear probing on the above\ndatasets (1% better ID, 10% better OOD than full fine-tuning).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 09:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Amongst these, the 16Cyg binary system\nholds a special place, being the brightest solar twins observed by Kepler. For\nthis system, modellers have access to high-quality asteroseismic, spectroscopic\nand interferometric data, making it the perfect testbed for the limitations of\nstellar models. We aim to further constrain the internal structure and\nfundamental parameters of 16CygA&B using linear seismic inversion techniques of\nboth global indicators and localised corrections of the internal structure. We\nstart from the models defined by detailed modelling in our previous paper and\nextend our analysis by applying variational inversions to these models. We\ncarried out inversions of so-called seismic indicators and provided local\ncorrections of the internal structure of the two stars. Our results indicate\nthat linear seismic inversions alone are not able to discriminate between\nstandard and non-standard models for 16CygA&B. We confirm the results of our\nprevious studies that used linear inversion techniques, but consider that the\ndifferences could be linked to small fundamental parameters variations rather\nthan to a missing process in the models. We confirm the robustness and\nreliability of the results of the modelling performed in our previous paper. We\nconclude that non-linear inversions are likely required to further investigate\nthe properties of 16CygA&B from a seismic point of view, but that these\ninversions should be coupled to analyses of the depletion of light elements\nsuch as lithium and beryllium to constrain the macroscopic transport of\nchemicals and potential non-standard evolutionary paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 09:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Nevertheless, they treat an image as a 1D sequence of\nvisual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local\nvisual structures and dealing with scale variance, which is instead learned\nimplicitly from large-scale training data with longer training schedules. In\nthis paper, we propose a Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB\nfrom convolutions, i.e., ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid\nreduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich\nmulti-scale context using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates.\nIn this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and can learn robust\nfeature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each\ntransformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block parallel to the multi-head\nself-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward\nnetwork.

During the interactions, the uncertainty of environment and reward will\ninevitably induce stochasticity in the long-term returns and the randomness can\nbe exacerbated with the increasing number of agents. However, such randomness\nis ignored by most of the existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) methods, which only model the expectation of Q-value for both\nindividual agents and the team. Compared to using the expectations of the\nlong-term returns, it is preferable to directly model the stochasticity by\nestimating the returns through distributions. With this motivation, this work\nproposes a novel value-based MARL framework from a distributional perspective,\n\\emph{i.e.}, parameterizing value function via \\underline{M}ixture of\n\\underline{C}ategorical distributions for MARL. Specifically, we model both\nindividual Q-values and global Q-value with categorical distribution.

From October 1, 2020, to the time of submission,\nwe have processed 75,183 individual UVOT images and we currently detect an\naverage rate of ~100 transient candidates per day. Of these daily candidates,\non average ~30 are real transients, separated by human vetting from the\nremaining `bogus' transients which were not discarded automatically within the\npipeline. Most of the real transients we detect are known variable stars,\nthough we also detect many known active galactic nuclei and accreting white\ndwarfs. TUVOpipe can additionally run in archival mode, whereby all archival\nUVOT data of a given field is scoured for `historical' transients; in this mode\nwe also mostly find variable stars. However, some of the transients we find (in\nparticular in the real-time mode) represent previously unreported new\ntransients, or undiscovered outbursts of known transients, predominantly\noutbursts from cataclysmic variables. In this paper we describe the operation\nof (both modes of) TUVOpipe and some of the initial results we have so far\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 11:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 09:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

However, the observable nodes and connections in real cases\nare often incomplete or unavailable due to measurement errors, private\nprotection issues, or other problems. Therefore, inferring the complete network\nstructure is useful for understanding human interactions and complex dynamics.\nThe existing studies have not fully solved the problem of inferring network\nstructure with partial information about connections or nodes. In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem by utilizing time-series data generated by network\ndynamics. We regard the network inference problem based on dynamical time\nseries data as a problem of minimizing errors for predicting states of\nobservable nodes and proposed a novel data-driven deep learning model called\nGumbel-softmax Inference for Network (GIN) to solve the problem under\nincomplete information. The GIN framework includes three modules: a dynamics\nlearner, a network generator, and an initial state generator to infer the\nunobservable parts of the network. We implement experiments on artificial and\nempirical social networks with discrete and continuous dynamics. The\nexperiments show that our method can infer the unknown parts of the structure\nand the initial states of the observable nodes with up to 90\\% accuracy. The\naccuracy declines linearly with the increase of the fractions of unobservable\nnodes. Our framework may have wide applications where the network structure is\nhard to obtain and the time series data is rich.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 11:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

The tip-over stability of wheeled mobile manipulators must not\nbe overlooked at any stage of a mobile manipulator's life, starting from the\ndesign phase, continuing through the commissioning period and extending to the\noperational phase. Many tip-over stability criteria formulated throughout the\nyears do not explicitly consider the normal wheel loads, with most of them\nrelying on prescribed stability margins in terms of overturning moments. In\nthese formulations, it is commonly argued that overturning will occur about one\nof the axes connecting adjacent manipulator's contact points with the ground.\nThis claim may not always be valid and is certainly restrictive. Explicit\nexpressions for the manipulator supporting forces provide the best insight into\nrelevant affecting terms which contribute to the tip-over (in)stability. They\nalso remove the necessity for thinking about which axis the manipulator could\ntip over and simultaneously enable the formulation of more intuitive stability\nmargins and on-line tip-over prevention techniques. The present study presents\na general dynamics modelling approach in the Newton--Euler framework using 6D\nvectors and gives normal wheel load equations in a typical 4-wheeled mobile\nmanipulator negotiating a slope. The given expressions are expected to become\nstandard in wheeled mobile manipulators and to provide a basis for effective\ntip-over stability criteria and tip-over avoidance techniques. Based on the\npresented results, specific improvements of the state-of-the-art criteria are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 12:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 10:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

The main reason is that they learn\nthe network with only binary supervision, which may learn arbitrary cues\noverfitting on the training dataset. To make the learned feature explainable\nand more generalizable, some researchers introduce facial depth and reflection\nmap as the auxiliary supervision. However, many other generalizable cues are\nunexplored for face anti-spoofing, which limits their performance under\ncross-dataset testing. To this end, we propose a novel framework to learn\nmultiple explainable and generalizable cues (MEGC) for face anti-spoofing.\nSpecifically, inspired by the process of human decision, four mainly used cues\nby humans are introduced as auxiliary supervision including the boundary of\nspoof medium, moir\\'e pattern, reflection artifacts and facial depth in\naddition to the binary supervision.

Some have recently expanded off-chain contracts to Multi-Party\nComputation (MPC), which seek to transition the on-chain states by off-chain\nMPC. The most general problem among these solutions is MPT, since its off-chain\nMPC takes on- and off-chain inputs, delivers on- and off-chain outputs, and can\nbe publicly verified by the blockchain, thus capable of covering more\nscenarios. However, existing Multi-Party Transaction (MPT) solutions lack at\nleast one of data availability, financial fairness, delivery fairness, and\ndelivery atomicity. These properties are crucially valued by communities, e.g.,\nthe Ethereum community, or users. Even worse, these solutions require high-cost\ninteractions between the blockchain and off-chain systems.\n  This paper proposes a novel MPT-enabled off-chain contract execution\nframework, DECLOAK. DECLOAK is the first to achieve data availability of MPT,\nand our method can apply to other fields that seek to persist user data\non-chain. Moreover, DECLOAK solves all mentioned shortcomings with even lower\ngas costs and weaker assumptions. Specifically, DECLOAK tolerates all but one\nByzantine party and TEE executors. Evaluating on 10 MPTs, DECLOAK reduces the\ngas cost of the SOTA, Cloak, by 65.6%. Consequently, we are the first to not\nonly achieve such level secure MPT in practical assumption, but also\ndemonstrate that evaluating MPT in the comparable gas cost to normal Ethereum\ntransaction is possible. And the cost superiority of DECLOAK increases as the\nnumber of MPT parties grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 11:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

These key points are then\npassed through a trained CNN network to generate feature maps corresponding to\na convolution layer. However, owing to the scale corresponding to the SIFT key\npoints, the size of a generated feature map may differ. As an alleviation to\nthis issue, the histogram of gradients is applied on the feature map to produce\na fixed representation. Typically, in a CNN, the number of filters of each\nconvolution block increase depending on the depth of the network. Thus,\nextracting histogram features for each of the convolution feature map increase\nthe dimension as well as the computational load.

We show\nthat certain combinations of cross sections in $e^+e^- \\to ZH$ with different\n$Z$ polarizations help to enhance or isolate the effect of one of the two kinds\nof $ZZH$ couplings possible on general grounds of CP and Lorentz invariance.\nThese combinations can be useful to get information on the $ZZH$ coupling in\nthe specific contexts of an effective field theory, two-Higgs-doublet models,\nand composite Higgs models, in a relatively model-independent fashion. We find\nin particular that the longitudinal helicity fraction of the $Z$ is expected to\nbe insensitive to anomalous couplings, and would be close to its value in the\nstandard model in the scenarios we consider. We also discuss the sensitivity of\nthe proposed measurements to the anomalous couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the\ndevelopment of topological qubits. In this application, however, aluminum-based\ndevices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, we\nresolve this limitation by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g.\nplatinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a\nfactor of two. Using tunnel junctions, we show that the increased field\nresilience originates from spin-orbit scattering introduced by Pt. We exploit\nthis property in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in\nsemiconductor-superconductor hybrids, where we show that InSb nanowires\nstrongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7T. The\ntwo-electron charging effect, a fundamental requirement for topological quantum\ncomputation, is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms.\nAdditionally, we use non-local spectroscopy in a three-terminal geometry to\nprobe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub-gap\nstates. Finally, we demonstrate that semiconductor states which are\nproximitized by Al/Pt films maintain their ability to Zeeman-split in an\napplied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well-known\nfabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to\nAl-based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors,\nwhenever high-field resilience is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

In many cases, a dissection\nresults from pathological changes such as fragmentation or loss of elastic\nfibers. But it has been shown that even the healthy aortic wall has an inherent\nheterogeneous microstructure. Some parts of the aorta are particularly\nsusceptible to the development of inhomogeneities due to pathological changes,\nhowever, the distribution in the aortic wall and the spatial extent, such as\nsize, shape, and type, are difficult to predict. Motivated by this observation,\nwe describe the heterogeneous distribution of elastic fiber degradation in the\ndissected aortic wall using a stochastic constitutive model. For this purpose,\nrandom field realizations, which model the stochastic distribution of degraded\nelastic fibers, are generated over a non-equidistant grid. The random field\nthen serves as input for a uni-axial extension test of the pathological aortic\nwall, solved with the finite-element (FE) method. To include the microstructure\nof the dissected aortic wall, a constitutive model developed in a previous\nstudy is applied, which also includes an approach to model the degradation of\ninter-lamellar elastic fibers. Then to assess the uncertainty in the output\nstress distribution due to this stochastic constitutive model, a convolutional\nneural network, specifically a Bayesian encoder-decoder, was used as a\nsurrogate model that maps the random input fields to the output stress\ndistribution obtained from the FE analysis. The results show that the neural\nnetwork is able to predict the stress distribution of the FE analysis while\nsignificantly reducing the computational time. In addition, it provides the\nprobability for exceeding critical stresses within the aortic wall, which could\nallow for the prediction of delamination or fatal rupture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The PointSCNet consists of three main\nmodules: the space-filling curve-guided sampling module, the information fusion\nmodule, and the channel-spatial attention module. The space-filling\ncurve-guided sampling module uses Z-order curve coding to sample points that\ncontain geometrical correlation. The information fusion module uses a\ncorrelation tensor and a set of skip connections to fuse the structure and\ncorrelation information. The channel-spatial attention module enhances the\nrepresentation of key points and crucial feature channels to refine the\nnetwork.

Motivated by the problem of traffic regulation in communication\nnetworks, DPA consists of allocating edge-disjoint paths in a graph. While\nonline algorithms for DPA have been thoroughly studied in the past, we extend\nthe analysis of this optimization problem by considering the more powerful\nclass of priority algorithms. Like an online algorithm, a priority algorithm\nreceives its input only sequentially and must output irrevocable decisions for\nindividual input items before having seen the input in its entirety. However,\nin contrast to the online setting, a priority algorithm may choose an order on\nthe set of all possible input items and the actual input is then presented\naccording to this order. A priority algorithm is a natural model for the\nintuitively well-understood concept of a greedy algorithm. Apart from analyzing\nthe classical priority setting, we also consider priority algorithms with\nadvice. Originally conceived to study online algorithms from an\ninformation-theoretic point of view, the concept of advice has recently been\nextended to the priority framework. In this paper, we analyze the classical\nvariant of the DPA problem on the graph class of paths, the related problem of\nLength-Weighted DPA, and finally, DPA on the graph class of trees. We show\nasymptotically matching upper and lower bounds on the advice necessary for\noptimality in LWDPA and generalize the known optimality result for DPA on paths\nto trees with maximal degree at most 3. On trees with maximal degree greater\nthan 3, we prove matching upper and lower bounds on the approximation ratio in\nthe advice-free priority setting.

A posterior mass\ncorrection is performed by introducing a small perturbation to the level-set\nfield, which is solved via the Newton method. Unlike in previous researches,\nthe signed distance property of the level-set function is exactly preserved\nafter the present mass correction. Moreover, this method can be easily\ngeneralized from 2D to 3D.

For\nall cases, the accuracy and efficiency of the original method and the present\nmethod are quantitatively compared.

Though\npresentation attack detection (PAD) systems try to address this problem, the\nlack of generalization and robustness continues to be a major concern. Several\nworks have shown that using multi-channel PAD systems could alleviate this\nvulnerability and result in more robust systems. However, there is a wide\nselection of channels available for a PAD system such as RGB, Near Infrared,\nShortwave Infrared, Depth, and Thermal sensors. Having a lot of sensors\nincreases the cost of the system, and therefore an understanding of the\nperformance of different sensors against a wide variety of attacks is necessary\nwhile selecting the modalities. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study\nto understand the effectiveness of various imaging modalities for PAD. The\nstudies are performed on a multi-channel PAD dataset, collected with 14\ndifferent sensing modalities considering a wide range of 2D, 3D, and partial\nattacks. We used the multi-channel convolutional network-based architecture,\nwhich uses pixel-wise binary supervision. The model has been evaluated with\ndifferent combinations of channels, and different image qualities on a variety\nof challenging known and unknown attack protocols. The results reveal\ninteresting trends and can act as pointers for sensor selection for\nsafety-critical presentation attack detection systems.

Then the prover commits this sequence using a commitment scheme (e.g.,\nMerkle root (like) commitment) predefined in the PoSWs. Now the verifier asks\nthe prover to provide a set of proofs against t randomly chosen checkpoints,\ncalled challenges, in the computed sequence. The verifier finds out the\ncommitment from each of these proofs spending O(log N) rounds of queries to the\noracle. It can be reduced to a single round of queries only if the verifier\nowns O(log N) parallelism [6].

We have applied it to a compilation of\nhigh-quality data split into two samples: HII regions (DHR) in spiral and\nirregular galaxies, and dwarf galaxies dominated by a strong starburst\n(HIIGal). Sulphur abundances have been derived by direct methods under the\nassumption of an ionisation structure composed of two zones: an intermediate\none where S{++} is originated and a low ionisation one where S{+} is formed.\nIonisation correction factors (ICF) have been calculated from the Ar{2+}/Ar{3+}\nratio and are shown to correlate with the hardness of the radiation field. Only\nabout 10% of the objects show S{3+} contributions to the total abundance larger\nthan 30%. A good correlation exists between sulphur abundance and ionising\ntemperature with low metallicity objects being ionised by hotter stars. No\ncorrelation is found between ionisation parameter and total S/H abundance. Most\nof the HIIGal objects show S/O ratios below the solar value and a trend for\nincreasing S/O ratios with increasing sulphur abundances while DHR objects show\nS/O ratios larger than solar and a tendency for lower S/O ratios for higher\nmetallicities. Finally, we present a calibration of the sulphur abundance\nthrough the S{23} parameter that remains single valued up to sulphur abundances\nwell beyond the solar value. S{23} is independent of the ionisation parameter\nand only weakly dependent on ionising temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

A\ncommon problem in both pruning and distillation is to determine compressed\narchitecture, i.e., the exact number of filters per layer and layer\nconfiguration, in order to preserve most of the original model capacity. In\nspite of the great advances in existing works, the determination of an\nexcellent architecture still requires human interference or tremendous\nexperimentations. In this paper, we propose an architecture slimming method\nthat automates the layer configuration process. We start from the perspective\nthat the capacity of the over-parameterized model can be largely preserved by\nfinding the minimum number of filters preserving the maximum parameter variance\nper layer, resulting in a thin architecture. We formulate the determination of\ncompressed architecture as a one-step orthogonal linear transformation, and\nintegrate principle component analysis (PCA), where the variances of filters in\nthe first several projections are maximized. We demonstrate the rationality of\nour analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive\nexperiments. In particular, we show that under the same overall compression\nrate, the compressed architecture determined by our method shows significant\nperformance gain over baselines after pruning and distillation. Surprisingly,\nwe find that the resulting layer-wise compression rates correspond to the layer\nsensitivities found by existing works through tremendous experimentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 12:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The potential\nof IoT has made it the center of attention for many people, but, where some see\nan opportunity to contribute, others may see IoT networks as a target to be\nexploited. The high number of IoT devices makes them the perfect setup for\nstaging denial-of-service attacks (DoS) that can have devastating consequences.\nThis renders the need for cybersecurity measures such as intrusion detection\nsystems (IDSs) evident. The aim of this paper is to build an IDS using the big\ndata platform, Apache Spark. Apache Spark was used along with its ML library\n(MLlib) and the BoT-IoT dataset. The IDS was then tested and evaluated based on\nF-Measure (f1), as was the standard when evaluating imbalanced data. Two rounds\nof tests were performed, a partial dataset for minimizing bias, and the full\nBoT-IoT dataset for exploring big data and ML capabilities in a security\nsetting. For the partial dataset, the Random Forest algorithm had the highest\nperformance for binary classification at an average f1 measure of 99.7%, as\nwell as 99.6% for main category classification, and an 88.5% f1 measure for sub\ncategory classification. As for the complete dataset, the Decision Tree\nalgorithm scored the highest f1 measures for all conducted tests; 97.9% for\nbinary classification, 79% for main category classification, and 77% for sub\ncategory classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 08:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

For several decades, researchers have studied the stability of\ntraffic flow using deterministic traffic models, with less emphasis on the\npresence of stochastic factors. However, recent empirical and theoretical\nfindings have demonstrated that the stochastic factors tend to destabilize\ntraffic flow and stimulate the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations.\nIn this paper, we derive a string stability condition of a general stochastic\ncontinuous car-following model by the mean of the generalized Lyapunov\nequation. We have found, indeed, that the presence of stochasticity\ndestabilizes the traffic flow. The impact of stochasticity depends on both the\nsensitivity to the gap and the sensitivity to the velocity difference.\nNumerical simulations of three typical car-following models have been carried\nout to validate our theoretical analysis. Finally, we have calibrated and\nvalidated the stochastic car-following models against empirical data. It is\nfound that the stochastic car-following models reproduce the observed traffic\ninstability and capture the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations. Our\nresults further highlight theoretically and numerically that the stochastic\nfactors have a significant impact on traffic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 17:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 09:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

However, real-time response is still challenging regarding the enormous\namount of data generated by the IoT devices in 5G and 6G networks. Thus,\nmulti-access edge computing (MEC), which consists of distributing the edge\nservers in the proximity of end-users to have low latency besides the higher\nprocessing power, is increasingly becoming a vital factor for the success of\nmodern applications. This paper addresses the problem of minimizing both, the\nnetwork delay, which is the main objective of MEC, and the number of edge\nservers to provide a MEC design with minimum cost. This MEC design consists of\nedge servers placement and base stations allocation, which makes it a joint\ncombinatorial optimization problem (COP). Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas shown promising results for COPs. However, modeling real-world problems\nusing RL when the state and action spaces are large still needs investigation.\nWe propose a novel RL framework with an efficient representation and modeling\nof the state space, action space and the penalty function in the design of the\nunderlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) for solving our problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 03:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

This new area goes under the name of Learned Data\nStructures. The motivation for its study is a perceived change of paradigm in\nComputer Architectures that would favour the use of Graphics Processing Units\nand Tensor Processing Units over conventional Central Processing Units. In\nturn, that would favour the use of Neural Networks as building blocks of\nClassic Data Structures. Indeed, Learned Bloom Filters, which are one of the\nmain pillars of Learned Data Structures, make extensive use of Neural Networks\nto improve the performance of classic Filters. However, no use of Neural\nNetworks is reported in the realm of Learned Indexes, which is another main\npillar of that new area. In this contribution, we provide the first, and much\nneeded, comparative experimental analysis regarding the use of Neural Networks\nas building blocks of Learned Indexes. The results reported here highlight the\nneed for the design of very specialized Neural Networks tailored to Learned\nIndexes and it establishes a solid ground for those developments.
