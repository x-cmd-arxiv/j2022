The advent of substantially larger\napertures, with the concomitant increase in polarimetric sensitivity, will\ndrive an increased interest in observing chromospheric spectral lines.\nAccordingly, pertinent inversion codes will need to take account of line\nformation under general non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) conditions.\nSeveral currently available codes can already accomplish this, but they have a\ncommon practical limitation that impairs the speed at which they can invert\npolarised spectra, namely that they employ numerical evaluation of the\nso-called response functions to changes in the atmospheric parameters, which\nmakes them less suitable for the analysis of very large data volumes.

A two-branches curve\nin the stability diagram, qualitatively similar to the one expected for\nclassical (incompressible and viscous) rotating liquid droplets, is obtained\nwhen vortices are present in the droplets, while prolate (i.e. non\naxi-symmetric) shapes are only permitted in vortex-free droplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 16:55:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 12:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

It is becoming clear that providing robust guarantees on systems that use\nneural networks is very important, especially in safety-critical applications.\nA trained neural network's sensitivity to adversarial attacks is one of its\ngreatest shortcomings. To provide robust guarantees, one popular method that\nhas seen success is to bound the activation functions using equality and\ninequality constraints. However, there are numerous ways to form these bounds,\nproviding a trade-off between conservativeness and complexity. Depending on the\ncomplexity of these bounds, the computational time of the optimisation problem\nvaries, with longer solve times often leading to tighter bounds. We approach\nthe problem from a different perspective, using sparse polynomial optimisation\ntheory and the Positivstellensatz, which derives from the field of real\nalgebraic geometry.

Considering\nthe dendritic-tree like plausible biological properties, BNeuralT is a single\nneuron neural tree model with its internal sub-trees resembling dendritic\nnonlinearities. BNeuralT algorithm produces an ad hoc neural tree which is\ntrained using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer like gradient descent\n(GD), momentum GD, Nesterov accelerated GD, Adagrad, RMSprop, or Adam. BNeuralT\ntraining has two phases, each computed in a depth-first search manner: the\nforward pass computes neural tree's output in a post-order traversal, while the\nerror backpropagation during the backward pass is performed recursively in a\npre-order traversal. A BNeuralT model can be considered a minimal subset of a\nneural network (NN), meaning it is a \"thinned\" NN whose complexity is lower\nthan an ordinary NN.

Thus,\nthe proper estimation of their coordinates is extremely needed for better\nunderstanding of the properties of these materials. We have designed a Python 3\nbased code named PY-Nodes for efficiently finding the nodes present in a given\nmaterial using first-principle approach. The present version of the code is\ninterfaced with the WIEN2k package. For benchmarking the code, it has been\ntested on some famous materials which possess characteristic nodes. These\ninclude - TaAs, a well-known Weyl semimetal, Na$_3$Bi, which is categorized as\nDirac semimetal, CaAgAs, classified as a nodal-line semimetal and YAuPb, which\nis claimed to be non-trivial topological semimetal. In case of TaAs, 24 nodes\nare obtained from our calculations.

To help app developers generate\nanswers that are related to the users' issues, recent studies develop models to\ngenerate the answers automatically. Aims: The app response generation models\nuse deep neural networks and require training data. Pre-Trained neural language\nModels (PTM) used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) take advantage of the\ninformation they learned from a large corpora in an unsupervised manner, and\ncan reduce the amount of required training data. In this paper, we evaluate\nPTMs to generate replies to the mobile app user feedbacks. Method: We train a\nTransformer model from scratch and fine-tune two PTMs to evaluate the generated\nresponses, which are compared to RRGEN, a current app response model. We also\nevaluate the models with different portions of the training data. Results: The\nresults on a large dataset evaluated by automatic metrics show that PTMs obtain\nlower scores than the baselines. However, our human evaluation confirms that\nPTMs can generate more relevant and meaningful responses to the posted\nfeedbacks. Moreover, the performance of PTMs has less drop compared to other\nmodels when the amount of training data is reduced to 1/3.

The main focus lies on sparse problem instances, although also dense\nones can be solved. We enhance several algorithmic components such as reduction\ntechniques and cutting-plane separation algorithms, and combine them in an\nexact branch-and-cut solver. Furthermore, we provide a parallel implementation.\nThe new solver is shown to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art\nsoftware for sparse MaxCut and QUBO instances. Furthermore, we improve the best\nknown bounds for several instances from the 7th DIMACS Challenge and the QPLIB,\nand solve some of them (for the first time) to optimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 18:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Existing approaches that address this issue\nrequire significant design changes to the otherwise simple, efficient, and\nwell-adopted architectures used to compute direct convolutions.\n  To address this challenge, we propose EcoFlow, a new set of dataflows and\nmapping algorithms for dilated and transposed convolutions.

An open question in science is how complex systems self-organize to\nproduce emergent structures and properties, a branch of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. It has long been known that there is a quantity-quality\ntransition in natural systems. This is to say that the properties of a system\ndepend on its size. More recently, this has been termed the size-complexity\nrule, which means that to increase their size, systems must increase their\ncomplexity, and that to increase their complexity they must grow in size. This\nrule goes under different names in different disciplines and systems of\ndifferent nature, such as the area-speciation rule, economies of scale, scaling\nrelations (allometric) in biology and for cities, and many others. We apply the\nsize-complexity rule to stars to compare them with other complex systems in\norder to find universal patterns of self-organization independent of the\nsubstrate. Here, as a measure of complexity of a star, we are using the degree\nof grouping of nucleons into atoms, which reduces nucleon entropy, increases\nthe variety of elements, and changes the structure of the star. As seen in our\nprevious work, complexity, using action efficiency, is in power law\nproportionality of all other characteristics of a complex system, including its\nsize. Here we find that, as for the other systems studied, the complexity of\nstars is in a power law proportionality with their size - the bigger a system\nis, the higher its level of complexity is - despite differing explosion\nenergies and initial metallicities from simulations and data, which confirms\nthe size-complexity rule and our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 18:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Being one of the brightest cooling lines in the rest-frame\nfar-infrared regime of star-forming galaxies, it has been successfully\nexploited as a tracer of star-formation rate (SFR) in local sources. The\npicture is more complex at higher redshifts, where its usability in this\ncontext is still under investigation. Recent results from the ALMA Large\nProgram to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey suggest that there\nis no (or weak) evolution of the L$\\mathrm{_{[CII]}}$-SFR relation up to\n$z\\sim6$ but their reliability is hampered by the presence of a large\npopulation of [CII] non-detected galaxies.

Our\ngoal is to analyze in detail the ionised gas kinematics in a sample of ULIRGs\nto infer the incidence of gas rotational dynamics in late-stage interacting\ngalaxies and merger remnants. We analysed MUSE data of a sample of 20 nearby\n(z<0.165) ULIRGs, as part of the \"Physics of ULIRGs with MUSE and ALMA\" (PUMA)\nproject.

The rest of the sample displays a plethora of gas\nkinematics, dominated by winds and merger-induced flows, which make the\ndetection of rotation signatures difficult. On the other hand, the incidence of\nstellar disk-like motions is ~2 times larger than gaseous disks, as the former\nare probably less affected by winds and streams. The eight galaxies with a\ngaseous disk present relatively high intrinsic gas velocity dispersion (sigma =\n30-85 km/s), rotationally-supported motions (with gas rotation velocity over\nvelocity dispersion vrot/sigma > 1-8), and dynamical masses in the range\n(2-7)x1e10 Msun. By combining our results with those of local and high-z disk\ngalaxies from the literature, we found a significant correlation between sigma\nand the offset from the main sequence (MS), after correcting for their\nevolutionary trends. Our results confirm the presence of kpc-scale rotating\ndisks in interacting galaxies and merger remnants, with an incidence going from\n27% (gas) to ~50% (stars).

The results demonstrate up to $4.25\\%$ more accuracy (iso-ReLU\ncount at 50K) or $2.2\\times$ less latency (iso-accuracy at 70\\%) than the\ncurrent state of the art and advance the Pareto frontier across the\nlatency-accuracy space. To complement empirical results, we present a \"no free\nlunch\" theorem that sheds light on how and when network linearization is\npossible while maintaining prediction accuracy.

In this regard, the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) is a\nquantitative measure of the entanglement spreading process. Particular interest\nconcerns the propagation of quantum correlations in the lattice systems, {\\it\ne.g.}, spin chains. In a seminal paper D. A. Roberts, D. Stanford and L.\nSusskind, J.

Beyond this radius operators commute. In the present\nwork, we propose a model of two nanomechanical systems coupled with two\nNitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins. Oscillators are coupled to each other\ndirectly while NV spins are not. Therefore, the correlation between the NV\nspins may arise only through the quantum feedback exerted from the first NV\nspin to the first oscillator and transferred from the first oscillator to the\nsecond oscillator via the direct coupling. Thus nonzero OTOC between NV spins\nquantifies the strength of the quantum feedback. We show that NV spins cannot\nexert quantum feedback on classical nonlinear oscillators. We also discuss the\ninherently quantum case with a linear quantum harmonic oscillator indirectly\ncoupling the two spins and verify that in the classical limit of the\noscillator, the OTOC vanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 19:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

We consider two\nsettings. First, when a target sparse representation is known, in which case we\npresent a near-complete answer based on drawing independent random samples from\ncarefully-designed probability measures.

Of particular interest are cases where two potential energy surfaces\ncross at features known as conical intersections (CIs), resulting in\nnonadiabatic dynamics that may promote ultrafast and highly efficient reactions\nwhen rovibrational damping is present. A prominent chemical reaction that\ninvolves a CI is the cis-trans isomerization reaction in rhodopsin, which is\ncrucial to vision. CIs in real molecular systems are typically investigated via\noptical pump-probe spectroscopy, which has demanding spectral bandwidth and\ntemporal resolution requirements, and where precise control of the environment\nis challenging. A complementary approach for understanding chemical reactions\nis to use quantum simulators that can provide access to a wider range of\nobservables, though thus far combining strongly interacting linear\n(rovibrational) and nonlinear (electronic) degrees of freedom with engineered\ndissipation has yet to be demonstrated.

Thus,\nthe forces that influence a chemical reaction can be viewed as an effective\nmeasurement induced dephasing rate that depends on the position of the\nwave-packet relative to the CI.

Selecting a reviewer who lacks\nexpertise and understanding can slow development or result in more defects. To\ndate, most reviewer recommendation systems rely primarily on historical file\nchange and review information; those who changed or reviewed a file in the past\nare the best positioned to review in the future. We posit that while these\napproaches are able to identify and suggest qualified reviewers, they may be\nblind to reviewers who have the needed expertise and have simply never\ninteracted with the changed files before. Fortunately, at Microsoft, we have a\nwealth of work artifacts across many repositories that can yield valuable\ninformation about our developers. To address the aforementioned problem, we\npresent CORAL, a novel approach to reviewer recommendation that leverages a\nsocio-technical graph built from the rich set of entities (developers,\nrepositories, files, pull requests (PRs), work items, etc.) and their\nrelationships in modern source code management systems. We employ a graph\nconvolutional neural network on this graph and train it on two and a half years\nof history on 332 repositories within Microsoft. We show that CORAL is able to\nmodel the manual history of reviewer selection remarkably well. Further, based\non an extensive user study, we demonstrate that this approach identifies\nrelevant and qualified reviewers who traditional reviewer recommenders miss,\nand that these developers desire to be included in the review process. Finally,\nwe find that \"classical\" reviewer recommendation systems perform better on\nsmaller (in terms of developers) software projects while CORAL excels on larger\nprojects, suggesting that there is \"no one model to rule them all.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 20:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2022 05:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 16:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 22:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

However, different feature\nimportance methods are likely to compute different feature importance ranks\neven for the same dataset and classifier. Hence such interchangeable use of\nfeature importance methods can lead to conclusion instabilities unless there is\na strong agreement among different methods. Therefore, in this paper, we\nevaluate the agreement between the feature importance ranks associated with the\nstudied classifiers through a case study of 18 software projects and six\ncommonly used classifiers. We find that: 1) The computed feature importance\nranks by CA and CS methods do not always strongly agree with each other. 2) The\ncomputed feature importance ranks by the studied CA methods exhibit a strong\nagreement including the features reported at top-1 and top-3 ranks for a given\ndataset and classifier, while even the commonly used CS methods yield vastly\ndifferent feature importance ranks. Such findings raise concerns about the\nstability of conclusions across replicated studies. We further observe that the\ncommonly used defect datasets are rife with feature interactions and these\nfeature interactions impact the computed feature importance ranks of the CS\nmethods (not the CA methods). We demonstrate that removing these feature\ninteractions, even with simple methods like CFS improves agreement between the\ncomputed feature importance ranks of CA and CS methods. In light of our\nfindings, we provide guidelines for stakeholders and practitioners when\nperforming model interpretation and directions for future research, e.g.,\nfuture research is needed to investigate the impact of advanced feature\ninteraction removal methods on computed feature importance ranks of different\nCS methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 21:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, the control policies trained for an RL\nagent crucially depend on user-defined, state-based reward functions. Poorly\ndesigned rewards can lead to policies that do get maximal rewards but fail to\nsatisfy desired task objectives or are unsafe. There are several examples of\nthe use of formal languages such as temporal logics and automata to specify\nhigh-level task specifications for robots (in lieu of Markovian rewards).\nRecent efforts have focused on inferring state-based rewards from formal\nspecifications; here, the goal is to provide (probabilistic) guarantees that\nthe policy learned using RL (with the inferred rewards) satisfies the\nhigh-level formal specification. A key drawback of several of these techniques\nis that the rewards that they infer are sparse: the agent receives positive\nrewards only upon completion of the task and no rewards otherwise. This\nnaturally leads to poor convergence properties and high variance during RL. In\nthis work, we propose using formal specifications in the form of symbolic\nautomata: these serve as a generalization of both bounded-time temporal\nlogic-based specifications as well as automata. Furthermore, our use of\nsymbolic automata allows us to define non-sparse potential-based rewards which\nempirically shape the reward surface, leading to better convergence during RL.\nWe also show that our potential-based rewarding strategy still allows us to\nobtain the policy that maximizes the satisfaction of the given specification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 21:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 09:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

In this work, we predict\nspectral index maps of both M87* and Sgr A* by applying the general\nrelativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) code IPOLE to a suite of general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We analytically show that\nthe spectral index increases with increasing magnetic field strength, electron\ntemperature, and optical depth. Consequently, spectral index maps grow more\nnegative with increasing radius in almost all models, since all of these\nquantities tend to be maximised near the event horizon. Additionally, photon\nring geodesics exhibit more positive spectral indices, since they sample the\ninnermost regions of the accretion flow with the most extreme plasma\nconditions. Spectral index maps are sensitive to highly uncertain plasma\nheating prescriptions (the electron temperature and distribution function).\nHowever, if our understanding of these aspects of plasma physics can be\ntightened, even the spatially unresolved spectral index around 230 GHz can be\nused to discriminate between models.

The global and scale-by-scale\nenergy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations.

The\nincompressive part of the pressure-strain interaction dominates over its\ncompressive part in all simulations considered.

We find that the energy balance is exactly\nsatisfied across all scales, but the lack of a well-defined inertial range\ninfluences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the\ninertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation to\nestimating dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the\nscale separation in the system is not clearly defined.

Our goal is to design a\ndispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward for the\ndispatcher based on observing the arrival times and the state of the system at\neach arrival; critically, the dispatcher observes neither the service times nor\ndeparture times.\n  We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learning\nproblem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalent\ncontrol switches between an always admit policy (always explore) and a never\nadmit policy (immediately terminate learning), which is distinct from the\nadaptive control literature. Our learning scheme then uses maximum likelihood\nestimation followed by certainty equivalent control but with judicious use of\nthe always admit policy so that learning doesn't stall. We prove that for all\nservice rates, the proposed policy asymptotically learns to take the optimal\naction. Further, we also present finite-time regret guarantees for our scheme.\nThe extreme contrast in the certainty equivalent optimal control policies leads\nto difficulties in learning that show up in our regret bounds for different\nparameter regimes. We explore this aspect in our simulations and also follow-up\nsampling related questions for our continuous-time system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 22:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Reinforcement learning from\nonline user feedback on the system's performance presents a natural solution to\nthis problem, and enables the interface to adapt to individual users. However,\nthis approach tends to require a large amount of human-in-the-loop training\ndata, especially when feedback is sparse. We propose a hierarchical solution\nthat learns efficiently from sparse user feedback: we use offline pre-training\nto acquire a latent embedding space of useful, high-level robot behaviors,\nwhich, in turn, enables the system to focus on using online user feedback to\nlearn a mapping from user inputs to desired high-level behaviors. The key\ninsight is that access to a pre-trained policy enables the system to learn more\nfrom sparse rewards than a na\\\"ive RL algorithm: using the pre-trained policy,\nthe system can make use of successful task executions to relabel, in hindsight,\nwhat the user actually meant to do during unsuccessful executions. We evaluate\nour method primarily through a user study with 12 participants who perform\ntasks in three simulated robotic manipulation domains using a webcam and their\neye gaze: flipping light switches, opening a shelf door to reach objects\ninside, and rotating a valve.

We model and analyze group testing on $n$ correlated nodes\nwhose interactions are specified by a graph $G$. We model correlation through\nan edge-faulty random graph formed from $G$ in which each edge is dropped with\nprobability $1-r$, and all nodes in the same component have the same state. We\nconsider three classes of graphs: cycles and trees, $d$-regular graphs and\nstochastic block models or SBM, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the number\nof tests needed to identify the defective nodes. Our results are expressed in\nterms of the number of tests needed when the nodes are independent and they are\nin terms of $n$, $r$, and the target error. In particular, we quantify the\nfundamental improvements that exploiting correlation offers by the ratio\nbetween the total number of nodes $n$ and the equivalent number of independent\nnodes in a classic group testing algorithm. The lower bounds are derived by\nillustrating a strong dependence of the number of tests needed on the expected\nnumber of components. In this regard, we establish a new approximation for the\ndistribution of component sizes in \"$d$-regular trees\" which may be of\nindependent interest and leads to a lower bound on the expected number of\ncomponents in $d$-regular graphs. The upper bounds are found by forming dense\nsubgraphs in which nodes are more likely to be in the same state. When $G$ is a\ncycle or tree, we show an improvement by a factor of $log(1/r)$.

The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the dispersion loss makes it possible to select\ndesired values of the temporal separation (TS) in bound pairs of SMs in the\nsystem.

To confront this challenge, we study the FSL\nproblem from a geometric point of view in this paper. One observation is that\nthe widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in the\nfeature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance in\ncomputational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Starting\nfrom the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporates\ncluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for space\nsubdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiple\nstages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric and\nnonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation and\nsurrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level,\ntransformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble.\nOur CIVD-based workflow enables us to achieve new state-of-the-art results on\nmini-ImageNet, CUB, and tiered-ImagenNet datasets, with ${\\sim}2\\%{-}5\\%$\nimprovements upon the next best.

This paper presents a ten-month ethnography in a remote\norganization, where we observed that despite exhibiting excellent remote\ncollaboration, teams paradoxically struggled to collaborate across team\nboundaries. We extend the Distance Matters framework to account for inter-team\ncollaboration, arguing that challenges analogous to those in the original\nintra-team framework -- common ground, collaboration readiness, collaboration\ntechnology readiness, and coupling of work -- persist but are actualized\ndifferently at the inter-team scale.

In this paper, we\ndevise a Gradient Descent method with Sparsification and Error Correction\n(GD-SEC) to improve the communications efficiency in a general worker-server\narchitecture. Motivated by a variety of wireless communications learning\nscenarios, GD-SEC reduces the number of bits per communication from worker to\nserver with no degradation in the order of the convergence rate. This enables\nlarger-scale model learning without sacrificing convergence or accuracy. At\neach iteration of GD-SEC, instead of directly transmitting the entire gradient\nvector, each worker computes the difference between its current gradient and a\nlinear combination of its previously transmitted gradients, and then transmits\nthe sparsified gradient difference to the server. A key feature of GD-SEC is\nthat any given component of the gradient difference vector will not be\ntransmitted if its magnitude is not sufficiently large. An error correction\ntechnique is used at each worker to compensate for the error resulting from\nsparsification. We prove that GD-SEC is guaranteed to converge for strongly\nconvex, convex, and nonconvex optimization problems with the same order of\nconvergence rate as GD. Furthermore, if the objective function is strongly\nconvex, GD-SEC has a fast linear convergence rate. Numerical results not only\nvalidate the convergence rate of GD-SEC but also explore the communication bit\nsavings it provides.

In this work, we propose Iota, a\nlogic programming-based framework to perform system-level security analysis for\nIoT systems. Iota generates attack graphs for IoT systems, showing all of the\nsystem resources that can be compromised and enumerating potential attack\ntraces. In building Iota, we design novel techniques to scan IoT systems for\nindividual vulnerabilities and further create generic exploit models for IoT\nvulnerabilities. We also identify and model physical dependencies between\ndifferent devices as they are unique to IoT systems and are employed by\nadversaries to launch complicated attacks. In addition, we utilize NLP\ntechniques to extract IoT app semantics based on app descriptions. To evaluate\nvulnerabilities' system-wide impact, we propose two metrics based on the attack\ngraph, which provide guidance on fortifying IoT systems. Evaluation on 127 IoT\nCVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) shows that Iota's exploit modeling\nmodule achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting vulnerabilities' preconditions\nand effects.

Known solutions to\nthis problem include wild bootstrap implementations of the PLR test or the use\nof an information criterion, such as the BIC, to select the co-integration\nrank. Although asymptotically valid in the presence of heteroskedasticity,\nthese methods can display very low finite sample power under some patterns of\nnon-stationary volatility. In particular, they do not exploit potential\nefficiency gains that could be realised in the presence of non-stationary\nvolatility by using adaptive inference methods.

In this paper, the seamless and\nreliable demand for communication and computation in maritime wireless networks\nis investigated. Two types of marine user equipment (UEs), i.e., low-antenna\ngain and high-antenna gain UEs, are considered. A joint task computation and\ntime allocation problem for weighted sum-rate maximization is formulated as\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The goal is to design an algorithm\nthat enables the network to efficiently provide backhaul resources to an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and offload HUEs tasks to LEO satellite for blue\ndata (i.e., marine user's data). To solve this MILP, a solution based on the\nBender and primal decomposition is proposed. The Bender decomposes MILP into\nthe master problem for binary task decision and subproblem for continuous-time\nresource allocation. Moreover, primal decomposition deals with a coupling\nconstraint in the subproblem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm provides the maritime UEs coverage demand in polynomial time\ncomputational complexity and achieves a near-optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 11:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

In\naddition, the presence of methylammonium in many high performing 3D perovskite\ncompositions introduces additional instabilities, which limit reliable room\ntemperature optoelectronic device operation. Here, we address both these\nchallenges and demonstrate that field-effect transistors (FETs) based on\nmethylammonium-free, mixed-metal (Pb/Sn) perovskite compositions, that are\nwidely studied for solar cell and light-emitting diode applications, do not\nsuffer from ion migration effects as their pure Pb counterparts and reliably\nexhibit hysteresis free p-type transport with high mobility reaching 5.4\n$cm^2/Vs$, ON/OFF ratio approaching $10^6$, and normalized channel conductance\nof 3 S/m. The reduced ion migration is also manifested in an activated\ntemperature dependence of the field-effect mobility with low activation energy,\nwhich reflects a significant density of shallow electronic defects. We\nvisualize the suppressed in-plane ionic migration in Sn-containing perovskites\ncompared to their pure-Pb counterparts using photoluminescence microscopy under\nbias and demonstrate promising voltage and current-stress device operational\nstabilities.

The magnetic induction inside the 6 m diameter superconducting\nsolenoid was measured and is currently monitored by four nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) probes installed using special tubes outside the barrel hadron\ncalorimeter. Two more NRM probes were installed at the faces of the tracking\nsystem. The field inside the superconducting solenoid was precisely measured in\n2006 in a cylindrical volume of 3.448 m in diameter and 7 m in length using 10\nthree-dimensional (3D) B-sensors based on the Hall effect. These B-sensors were\ninstalled on each of the two propeller arms of an automated field-mapping\nmachine. In addition to these measurement systems, a system for monitoring the\nmagnetic field during the CMS detector operation has been developed. Inside the\nsolenoid in the horizontal plane, 4 3D B-sensors were installed at the faces of\nthe tracking detector. Twelve 3D B-sensors were installed on the surfaces of\nthe flux-return yoke nose disks. Seventy 3D B-sensors were installed in the air\ngaps of the CMS magnet yoke.

Task proposed in this paper\ninvolves the design of an intelligent visual aid for identification of such\nlocations in an image, which has either the potential to create an imminent\nthreat from an adversary or appear as the target zones needing further\ninvestigation. Covert places (CGL) for hiding behind an occluding object are\nconcealed 3D locations, not detectable from the viewpoint (camera). Hence this\ninvolves delineating specific image regions around the projections of outer\nboundary of the occluding objects, as places to be accessed around the\npotential hideouts. CGL detection finds applications in military\ncounter-insurgency operations, surveillance with path planning for an\nexploratory robot. Given an RGB image, the goal is to identify all CGLs in the\n2D scene. Identification of such regions would require knowledge about the 3D\nboundaries of obscuring items (pillars, furniture), their spatial location with\nrespect to the neighboring regions of the scene. We propose this as a novel\ntask, termed Covert Geo-Location (CGL) Detection.

In this paper, a communication efficient\nalgorithm, called ordering-based alternating direction method of multipliers\n(OADMM) is devised in a general fully decentralized network setting where a\nworker can only exchange messages with neighbors. Compared to the classical\nADMM, a key feature of OADMM is that transmissions are ordered among workers at\neach iteration such that a worker with the most informative data broadcasts its\nlocal variable to neighbors first, and neighbors who have not transmitted yet\ncan update their local variables based on that received transmission. In OADMM,\nwe prohibit workers from transmitting if their current local variables are not\nsufficiently different from their previously transmitted value. A variant of\nOADMM, called SOADMM, is proposed where transmissions are ordered but\ntransmissions are never stopped for each node at each iteration. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that given a targeted accuracy, OADMM can significantly\nreduce the number of communications compared to existing algorithms including\nADMM. We also show numerically that SOADMM can accelerate convergence,\nresulting in communication savings compared to the classical ADMM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 15:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

To assist component design for stamping\nprocesses, this paper presents a novel deep-learning-based platform for\noptimising 3D component geometries. The platform adopts a non-parametric\nmodelling approach that is capable of optimising arbitrary geometries from\nmultiple geometric parameterisation schema. This approach features the\ninteraction of two neural networks: 1) a geometry generator and 2) a\nmanufacturing performance evaluator. The generator predicts continuous 3D\nsigned distance fields (SDFs) for geometries of different classes, and each SDF\nis conditioned on a latent vector. The zero-level-set of each SDF implicitly\nrepresents a generated geometry. Novel training strategies for the generator\nare introduced and include a new loss function which is tailored for sheet\nstamping applications. These strategies enable the differentiable generation of\nhigh quality, large scale component geometries with tight local features for\nthe first time. The evaluator maps a 2D projection of these generated\ngeometries to their post-stamping physical (e.g., strain) distributions.\nManufacturing constraints are imposed based on these distributions and are used\nto formulate a novel objective function for optimisation. A new gradient-based\noptimisation technique is employed to iteratively update the latent vectors,\nand therefore geometries, to minimise this objective function and thus meet the\nmanufacturing constraints. Case studies based on optimising box geometries\nsubject to a sheet thinning constraint for a hot stamping process are presented\nand discussed. The results show that expressive geometric changes are\nachievable, and that these changes are driven by stamping performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 22:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The attacked model behaves normally on benign\nsamples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed when the backdoor\nis activated. We reveal that poisoned samples tend to cluster together in the\nfeature space of the attacked DNN model, which is mostly due to the end-to-end\nsupervised training paradigm. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel\nbackdoor defense via decoupling the original end-to-end training process into\nthree stages. Specifically, we first learn the backbone of a DNN model via\n\\emph{self-supervised learning} based on training samples without their labels.\nThe learned backbone will map samples with the same ground-truth label to\nsimilar locations in the feature space. Then, we freeze the parameters of the\nlearned backbone and train the remaining fully connected layers via standard\ntraining with all (labeled) training samples. Lastly, to further alleviate\nside-effects of poisoned samples in the second stage, we remove labels of some\n`low-credible' samples determined based on the learned model and conduct a\n\\emph{semi-supervised fine-tuning} of the whole model. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets and DNN models verify that the proposed defense is\neffective in reducing backdoor threats while preserving high accuracy in\npredicting benign samples.

The\nresults presented here, of testing the hypothesis of independence of\nluminosities and distances of magnetars by means of the Efron-Petrosian\nstatistic, do not uphold this assumption however: they imply that the\nobservational data in the McGill Magnetar Catalog are consistent with the\ndependence S\\propto D^{-3/2} of the flux densities S of these objects on their\ndistances D at substantially higher levels of significance than they are with\nthe dependence S\\propto D^{-2}. These results are not incompatible with the\nrequirements of the conservation of energy because the radiation process\ndescribed in Ardavan (2021, MNRAS, 507, 4530), by which the superluminally\nmoving current sheet in the magnetosphere of a neutron star is shown to\ngenerate the slowly decaying X-ray pulses, is intrinsically transient. Once\ntheir over-estimation is rectified, the ratios of X-ray to spin-down\nluminosities of known magnetars turn out to be invariably lower than one. A\nmagnetar differs from other rotationally powered pulsars only in that it is\nobserved along a privileged latitudinal direction relative to its spin axis:\nthe closer is the line of sight to a direction in which the radiation from the\ncurrent sheet is focused, the higher the frequency content and the lower the\ndecay rate with distance of the observed radiation.

In this paper, we present a new\nrecommendation problem, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR), where users'\ninstant interest can be explicitly induced with a trigger item and follow-up\nrelated target items are recommended accordingly. TIR has become ubiquitous and\npopular in e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we figure out that although\nexisting recommendation models are effective in traditional recommendation\nscenarios by mining users' interests based on their massive historical\nbehaviors, they are struggling in discovering users' instant interests in the\nTIR scenario due to the discrepancy between these scenarios, resulting in\ninferior performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel recommendation\nmethod named Deep Interest Highlight Network (DIHN) for Click-Through Rate\n(CTR) prediction in TIR scenarios. It has three main components including 1)\nUser Intent Network (UIN), which responds to generate a precise probability\nscore to predict user's intent on the trigger item; 2) Fusion Embedding Module\n(FEM), which adaptively fuses trigger item and target item embeddings based on\nthe prediction from UIN; and (3) Hybrid Interest Extracting Module (HIEM),\nwhich can effectively highlight users' instant interest from their behaviors\nbased on the result of FEM. Extensive offline and online evaluations on a\nreal-world e-commerce platform demonstrate the superiority of DIHN over\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 08:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 02:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of\nalgorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of\ncryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to\nNP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets\nunconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length\nof key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a\ntroublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in\npractice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key,\nand the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on \"one-way\"\nassumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the\nexistence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P\n!= NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher\nalgorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a\nplaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the\nplaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext\npair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also\neasy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing\nshort-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem\nand theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way\nfunctions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions,\nthat is, directly proving that P != NP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 13:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}
