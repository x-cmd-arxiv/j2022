We examine this limitation using two languages: PARITY, the\nlanguage of bit strings with an odd number of 1s, and FIRST, the language of\nbit strings starting with a 1. We demonstrate three ways of overcoming the\nlimitation suggested by Hahn's lemma. First, we settle an open question by\nconstructing a transformer that recognizes PARITY with perfect accuracy, and\nsimilarly for FIRST. Second, we use layer normalization to bring the\ncross-entropy of both models arbitrarily close to zero. Third, when\ntransformers need to focus on a single position, as for FIRST, we find that\nthey can fail to generalize to longer strings; we offer a simple remedy to this\nproblem that also improves length generalization in machine translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 16:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Diverse\nexploration approaches have been proposed to accelerate the learning process\nover single- and multi-agent problems with homogeneous agents. However, scarce\nstudies have elaborated on collaborative learning frameworks between\nheterogeneous agents deployed into the same environment, but interacting with\ndifferent instances of the latter without any prior knowledge.

Previous modeling studies have considered the dynamics of a single\nrod on fluid planar membranes. We extend these studies to the more\nphysiologically relevant case of a single filament moving in a spherical\nmembrane. Specifically, we use a slender-body formulation to compute the\ntranslational and rotational resistance of a single filament of length $L$\nmoving in a membrane of radius $R$ and 2D viscosity $\\eta_m$, and surrounded on\nits interior and exterior with Newtonian fluids of viscosities $\\eta^{-}$ and\n$\\eta^{+}$. We first discuss the case where the filament's curvature is at its\nminimum $\\kappa=1/R$. We show that the boundedness of spherical geometry gives\nrise to flow confinement effects that increase in strength with increasing the\nratio of filament's length to membrane radius $L/R$. These confinement flows\nonly result in a mild increase in filament's resistance along its axis,\n$\\xi_{\\parallel}$, and its rotational resistance, $\\xi_{\\Omega}$. As a result,\nour predictions of $\\xi_\\parallel$ and $\\xi_{\\Omega}$ can be quantitatively\nmapped to the results on a planar membrane. In contrast, we find that the drag\nin perpendicular direction, $\\xi_\\perp$, increases superlinearly with the\nfilament's length, when $L/R >1$ and ultimately $\\xi_\\perp \\to \\infty$ as $L/R\n\\to \\pi$. Next, we consider the effect of the filament's curvature, $\\kappa$,\non its parallel motion, while fixing the membrane's radius. We show that the\nflow around the filament becomes increasingly more asymmetric with increasing\nits curvature. These flow asymmetries induce a net torque on the filament,\ncoupling its parallel and rotational dynamics. This coupling becomes stronger\nwith increasing $L/R$ and $\\kappa$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 17:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 16:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 23:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Our bound informs the design of a novel privacy\namplification scheme: an effective training set is sub-sampled from a larger\nset prior to the beginning of training.

As a result, our scheme allows the use of looser DP\nguarantees to limit the success of any MI adversary; this ensures that the\nmodel's accuracy is less impacted by the privacy guarantee.

An example is\nfound in systems exhibiting a saddle-node bifurcation, which undergo a dramatic\ntime delay towards equilibrium. Specifically the duration of the transient,\n$\\tau$, close to this bifurcation in deterministic systems follows scaling laws\nof the form $\\tau \\sim |\\epsilon - \\epsilon_c|^{-1/2}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the\nbifurcation or control parameter, and $\\epsilon_c$ its critical value. For\nsystems undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation, the mechanism involves transients\ngetting trapped by a so-called ghost. In a recent article we explored how\nintrinsic noise affected the deterministic picture. Extensive numerical\nsimulations showed that, although scaling behaviour persisted in the presence\nof noise, the scaling law was more complicated than a simple power law. In\norder to gain deeper insight into this scaling behaviour, we resort to the WKB\nasymptotic approximation of the Master Equation. According to this\napproximation, the behaviour of the system is given as the weighted sum of\n\\emph{trajectories} within the phase space of the Hamiltonian associated to the\ncorresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. By analysing the flight time of the\nHamilton equations, we show that the statistically significant paths follow a\nscaling function that exactly matches the one observed in the stochastic\nsimulations. We therefore put forward that the properties of the flight times\nof the Hamiltonian system underpin the scaling law of the underlying stochastic\nsystem, and that the same properties should extend in a universal way to all\nstochastic systems whose associated Hamiltonian exhibits the same behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

An instance of the\ngroup testing problem includes a ground set of individuals which includes a\nsmall subset of infected individuals. The group testing procedure consists of a\nnumber of tests, such that each test indicates whether or not a given subset of\nindividuals includes one or more infected individuals. The goal of the group\ntesting procedure is to identify the subset of infected individuals with the\nminimum number of tests. Motivated by practical scenarios, such as testing for\nviral diseases, this paper focuses on the following group testing settings: (i)\nthe group testing procedure is noisy, i.e., the outcome of the group testing\nprocedure can be flipped with a certain probability; (ii) there is a certain\namount of side information on the distribution of the infected individuals\navailable to the group testing algorithm. The paper makes the following\ncontributions. First, we propose a probabilistic model, referred to as an\ninteraction model, that captures the side information about the probability\ndistribution of the infected individuals. Next, we present a decoding scheme,\nbased on the belief propagation, that leverages the interaction model to\nimprove the decoding accuracy. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm\nachieves higher success probability and lower false-negative and false-positive\nrates when compared to the traditional belief propagation especially in the\nhigh noise regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

ALPs are very elusive, extremely light and interact primarily\nwith photons. In the presence of an external magnetic field two effects show\nup: (i) photon-ALP oscillations and (ii) a change of the photon polarization\nstate. The astrophysical context represents the best opportunity to get\nindirect evidence for the ALP existence thanks to various effects that the\nphoton-ALP interaction produces in the sky. Great attention has been paid so\nfar to photon-ALP oscillations, since they modify the transparency of the\ncrossed media at very high energies and so the final spectra of faraway sources\nexhibit a flux excess and a characteristic oscillatory behavior. Two hints at\nthe ALP existence have hitherto been discovered. But less interest has been\nattracted by the modification of the photon polarization. In this paper we\naddress it in the X-ray and in the high energy (HE) bands. Specifically, we\nanalyze the photon degree of linear polarization and the polarization angle\ninduced by the photon-ALP interaction for photons generated in the central\nregion of two galaxy clusters: Perseus and Coma. We find a substantial\ndeparture from conventional physics in both considered bands. We conclude that\nthe ALP-induced polarization effects are more likely detectable with the\nproposed missions like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the\nHE range. Still, possible ALP-induced effects on photon polarization could also\nbe detected by IXPE (already operative) and by the proposed eXTP, XL-Calibur,\nNGXP and XPP in the X-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 17:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

However, the inherent locality of convolution makes CNNs fail to\nfully exploit global context, essential for better recognition of some\nstructures, e.g., brain lesions. Transformers have recently proven promising\nperformance on vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, mainly due to\ntheir capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the\nquadratic complexity of attention makes existing Transformer-based models use\nself-attention layers only after somehow reducing the image resolution, which\nlimits the ability to capture global contexts present at higher resolutions.\nTherefore, this work introduces a family of models, dubbed Factorizer, which\nleverages the power of low-rank matrix factorization for constructing an\nend-to-end segmentation model. Specifically, we propose a linearly scalable\napproach to context modeling, formulating Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\n(NMF) as a differentiable layer integrated into a U-shaped architecture. The\nshifted window technique is also utilized in combination with NMF to\neffectively aggregate local information. Factorizers compete favorably with\nCNNs and Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability,\nachieving state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset for brain tumor\nsegmentation and ISLES'22 dataset for stroke lesion segmentation. Highly\nmeaningful NMF components give an additional interpretability advantage to\nFactorizers over CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal a\ndistinctive feature of Factorizers that enables a significant speed-up in\ninference for a trained Factorizer without any extra steps and without\nsacrificing much accuracy.

Here, we\nconsider the heating of the IGM due to cosmic ray protons generated by the\nsupernovae from both early Pop III and Pop II stars. The low energy cosmic ray\nprotons from Pop III supernovae can escape from minihalos and heat the IGM via\ncollision and ionization of hydrogen. Furthermore, high energy protons\ngenerated in Pop II supernovae can escape the hosting halos and heat the IGM\nvia magnetosonic Alfv\\'en waves. We show that the heating due to these cosmic\nray particles can significantly impact the IGM temperature and hence the global\n21-cm signal at $z\\sim 14-18$. The depth, location, and duration of the 21-cm\nabsorption profile are highly dependent on the efficiencies of cosmic ray\nheating. In particular, the EDGES signal can be well fitted by the cosmic ray\nheating along with the Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling, and the dark matter-baryon\ninteraction that we consider to achieve a `colder IGM background'. Further, we\nargue that the properties of cosmic rays and the nature of first generation of\nstars could be constrained by accurately measuring the global 21-cm absorption\nsignal during the cosmic dawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 18:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

While various\nlow-level performance portable programming models are available, support at the\napplication level lacks behind.

Parthenon adopts the Kokkos\nprogramming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from\nmulti-dimensional variables, to packages defining and separating components, to\nlaunching of parallel compute kernels. Parthenon allocates all data in device\nmemory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and\nmesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided,\nasynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node\nsimulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong\nscaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD\nx86 CPUs, IBM Power9 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs.

The thermal\nconductivity due to Majorana fermions shows dip-bump structures as the magnetic\nfield increases, which is caused by either the transitions between different\nflux sectors of Kitaev spin liquids or the topological transitions that change\nthe Majorana Chern number within the same flux sector.

Recently, meta-learning was\nproposed to learn model initialization (MI) for ASR tasks of different\nlanguages. This method leads to good performance when the model is adapted to\nan unseen language. However, MI is vulnerable to overfitting on training tasks\n(learner overfitting). It is also unknown whether MI generalizes to other\nlow-resource tasks.

These are stellar feedback, inward transport due\nto disc instability and clumpy accretion via streams. The transport rate is\ncomputed with two different formalisms, with similar results.

Our paper shows that\nnecessary trade-offs exist for fairness in the context of scarcity; many\nreasonable definitions of equitable outcomes cannot hold simultaneously except\nunder stringent conditions. For example, defining fairness in terms of\nimprovement over a baseline inherently conflicts with defining fairness in\nterms of loss compared with the best possible outcome.

To address these problems, we introduce\nPartially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD), which extracts and decompiles\nsuspect binary functions to source where they can be patched or analyzed,\napplies transformations to enable recompilation of these functions (partial\nrecompilation), then employs binary rewriting techniques to create a patched\nbinary. Although decompilation and recompilation do not universally apply,\nPRD's fault localization identifies a function subset that is small enough to\nadmit decompilation and large enough to address many vulnerabilities. Our\napproach succeeds because decompilation is limited to a few functions and\nlifting facilitates analysis and repair.\n  To demonstrate the scalability of PRD, we evaluate it in the context of a\nfully automated end-to-end scenario that relies on source-level Automated\nProgram Repair (APR) methods to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

In terms of proton inertial length $\\lambda_{p}$, the CS\nthickness $\\lambda$ is in the range from about $0.1$ to $10\\lambda_{p}$ with\nthe typical value around 2$\\lambda_{p}$. The magnetic field magnitude does not\nsubstantially vary across the CSs and, accordingly, the current density is\ndominated by the magnetic field-aligned component. The CSs are typically\nasymmetric with statistically different magnetic field magnitudes at the CS\nboundaries. The current density is larger for smaller-scale CSs, $J_0\\approx\n0.15 \\cdot (\\lambda/100\\;{\\rm km})^{-0.76}$ $\\mu {\\rm A/m^2}$, but does not\nstatistically exceed the Alfv\\'en current density $J_A$ corresponding to the\nion-electron drift of local Alfv\\'{e}n speed.

Recently, there has been an\nincreasing interest in the adaptive processing of graphs, which led to the\ndevelopment of different neural network-based methodologies. In this thesis, we\ntake a different route and develop a Bayesian Deep Learning framework for graph\nlearning. The dissertation begins with a review of the principles over which\nmost of the methods in the field are built, followed by a study on graph\nclassification reproducibility issues. We then proceed to bridge the basic\nideas of deep learning for graphs with the Bayesian world, by building our deep\narchitectures in an incremental fashion. This framework allows us to consider\ngraphs with discrete and continuous edge features, producing unsupervised\nembeddings rich enough to reach the state of the art on several classification\ntasks. Our approach is also amenable to a Bayesian nonparametric extension that\nautomatizes the choice of almost all model's hyper-parameters. Two real-world\napplications demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for graphs. The first\nconcerns the prediction of information-theoretic quantities for molecular\nsimulations with supervised neural models. After that, we exploit our Bayesian\nmodels to solve a malware-classification task while being robust to\nintra-procedural code obfuscation techniques. We conclude the dissertation with\nan attempt to blend the best of the neural and Bayesian worlds together. The\nresulting hybrid model is able to predict multimodal distributions conditioned\non input graphs, with the consequent ability to model stochasticity and\nuncertainty better than most works.

Deep learning based computer vision techniques can\nhelp in scene understanding, and help rescue teams with precise damage\nassessment.

Unfortunately,\navailable datasets for natural disaster damage assessment lack detailed\nannotation of the affected areas, and therefore do not support the deep\nlearning models in total damage assessment. To this end, we introduce the\nRescueNet, a high resolution post disaster dataset, for semantic segmentation\nto assess damages after natural disasters. The RescueNet consists of post\ndisaster images collected after Hurricane Michael. The data is collected using\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from several areas impacted by the hurricane.\nThe uniqueness of the RescueNet comes from the fact that this dataset provides\nhigh resolution post-disaster images and comprehensive annotation of each\nimage. While most of the existing dataset offer annotation of only part of the\nscene, like building, road, or river, RescueNet provides pixel level annotation\nof all the classes including building, road, pool, tree, debris, and so on.

The correlators with two double-cycle and two\nsingle-cycle fields give the leading order contribution in the large-$N$ limit.\nWe derive explicit formulas for these functions, encompassing a large class of\nchoices for the single- and the double-cycle fields, including generic Ramond\nground states, NS chiral fields and the marginal deformation operator. We are\nthus able to extract important dynamical information from the short-distance\nOPEs: conformal dimensions, R-charges and structure constants of families of\nBPS and non-BPS fields present in the corresponding light-light and heavy-light\nchannels. We also discuss properties of generic multi-cycle $Q$-point functions\nin $M^N/S_N$ orbifolds, using a technology due to Pakman, Rastelli and Razamat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 23:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Training such recommendation models efficiently\nis challenging primarily because they consist of billions of embedding-based\nparameters which are often stored remotely leading to significant overheads\nfrom embedding access. By profiling existing DLRM training, we observe that\nonly 8.5% of the iteration time is spent in forward/backward pass while the\nremaining time is spent on embedding and model synchronization. Our key insight\nin this paper is that access to embeddings have a specific structure and\npattern which can be used to accelerate training. We observe that embedding\naccesses are heavily skewed, with almost 1% of embeddings represent more than\n92% of total accesses. Further, we observe that during training we can\nlookahead at future batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be\nneeded at what iteration in the future.

In this paper, we introduce an opinion dynamics\nmodel where agents are connected in a social network, and update their opinions\nbased on their neighbors' opinions and on the content shown to them by the\nplatform. We focus on a stochastic block model with two blocks, where the\ninitial opinions of the individuals in different blocks are different. We prove\nthat for large and dense enough networks the trajectory of opinion dynamics in\nsuch networks can be approximated well by a simple two-agent system. The latter\nadmits tractable analytical analysis, which we leverage to provide interesting\ninsights into the platform's impact on the social learning outcome in our\noriginal two-block model. Specifically, by using our approximation result, we\nshow that agents' opinions approximately converge to some limiting opinion,\nwhich is either: consensus, where all agents agree, or persistent disagreement,\nwhere agents' opinions differ. We find that when the platform is weak and there\nis a high number of connections between agents with different initial opinions,\na consensus equilibrium is likely. In this case, even if a persistent\ndisagreement equilibrium arises, the polarization in this equilibrium, i.e.,\nthe degree of disagreement, is low. When the platform is strong, a persistent\ndisagreement equilibrium is likely and the equilibrium polarization is high. A\nmoderate platform typically leads to a persistent disagreement equilibrium with\nmoderate polarization. Lastly, more balanced and less polarized initial\nopinions are more likely to lead to persistent disagreement than to consensus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 01:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

In this\npaper, for handling this difficulty, the packing knowledge is extracted from\nhistorical data collected from the packing pipeline of Huawei. First, by fully\nexploiting the relationship between historical packing records and input\norders(orders to be packed) , the problem is reformulated as a set cover\nproblem. Then, two novel strategies, the constraint handling and process\nacceleration strategies are applied to the classic column generation approach\nto solve this set cover problem.

The proposed constraints handling strategy exploits the\nhistorical packing records with the most negative value of the reduced cost.\nThose constraints have been implicitly satisfied in these historical packing\nrecords so that there is no need to conduct further evaluation on constraints,\nthus the computational load is saved.

By assuming that the atom interacts\nwith a quantum scalar field initially in a coherent state, we show how a\nstochastic component of the internal dynamics of the atom arises from the\nvacuum fluctuations of the field, resulting in the emittance of quantum\nradiation, whose reaction induces quantum dissipation in the internal dynamics.\nWe also show how the deterministic mean field drives the internal classical\nmean component to emit classical radiation and receive classical radiation\nreaction. Both components are statistically distinct and fully decoupled. It is\nclearly seen that the effects of the vacuum fluctuations of the field are\nmatched with those of quantum radiation reaction, not with classical radiation\nreaction, as the folklore goes. In contrast to the quantum component of the\natom's internal dynamics, which always equilibrates, the relaxation dynamics of\nthe classical component largely depends on the late-time behavior of the mean\nfield. For the values of the parameters defining the coherent state of the\nfield much greater than unity, if the mean field remains periodic, then the\ninternal dynamics of the atom will appear classical and periodic. If the mean\nfield diminishes with time, then the classical component of the atom's internal\ndynamics subsides but the quantum component will abide and dynamically\nequilibrate. This also explains why quantum radiation from a stationary atom is\nnot observed, and a probe located far away only sees classical radiation. Our\nanalysis therefore paints a continuum landscape starting from vacuum\nfluctuations in the quantum field to classical radiation and radiation\nreaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 04:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

The final transfer learned\nDGCN-LSTM model performs well to predict evacuation traffic flow (RMSE=399.69).\nThe implemented model can be applied to predict evacuation traffic over a\nlonger forecasting horizon (6 hour).

A simple and efficient strategy to validate deep learning checkpoints\nis the addition of validation loops to execute during training. However, the\nvalidation of dense retrievers (DR) checkpoints is not as trivial -- and the\naddition of validation loops is not efficient. This is because, in order to\naccurately evaluate the performance of a DR checkpoint, the whole document\ncorpus needs to be encoded into vectors using the current checkpoint before any\nactual retrieval operation for checkpoint validation can be performed. This\ncorpus encoding process can be very time-consuming if the document corpus\ncontains millions of documents (e.g., 8.8m for MS MARCO and 21m for Natural\nQuestions). Thus, a naive use of validation loops during training will\nsignificantly increase training time. To address this issue, in this demo\npaper, we propose Asyncval: a Python-based toolkit for efficiently validating\nDR checkpoints during training. Instead of pausing the training loop for\nvalidating DR checkpoints, Asyncval decouples the validation loop from the\ntraining loop, uses another GPU to automatically validate new DR checkpoints\nand thus permits to perform validation asynchronously from training. Asyncval\nalso implements a range of different corpus subset sampling strategies for\nvalidating DR checkpoints; these strategies allow to further speed up the\nvalidation process.

We also propose data augmentation using neural networks, which\nsimplifies the search space design and allows for updating of the data\naugmentation using the gradient method. We show that TeachAugment outperforms\nexisting methods in experiments of image classification, semantic segmentation,\nand unsupervised representation learning tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 06:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 00:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 23:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Banyan\nimproves performance by up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art\ngraph query engines, while providing performance isolation and load balancing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 07:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

We propose a new machine learning technique for\nRaman spectrum matching, based on contrastive representation learning, that\nrequires no preprocessing and works with as little as a single reference\nspectrum from each class. On three datasets we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves or is on par with the state of the art in prediction\naccuracy, and we show how to compute conformal prediction sets with specified\nfrequentist coverage.

To efficiently gather the contributions of the VPLs, lightcuts and its\nextensions cluster the VPLs, which implicitly approximates the lighting matrix\nwith some representative blocks similar to vector quantization. In this paper,\nwe propose a new approximation method based on the previous lightcut method and\na low-rank matrix factorization model. As many researchers pointed out, the\nlighting matrix is low rank, which implies that it can be completed from a\nsmall set of known entries.\n  We first generate a conservative global light cut with bounded error and\npartition the lighting matrix into slices by the coordinate and normal of the\nsurface points using the method of lightslice. Then we perform two passes of\nrandomly sampling on each matrix slice. In the first pass, uniformly\ndistributed random entries are sampled to coarsen the global light cut, further\nclustering the similar light for the spatially localized surface points of the\nslices. In the second pass, more entries are sampled according to the\npossibility distribution function estimated from the first sampling result.\nThen each matrix slice is factorized into a product of two smaller low-rank\nmatrices constrained by the sampled entries, which delivers a completion of the\nlighting matrix. The factorized form provides an additional speedup for adding\nup the matrix columns which is more GPU friendly. Compared with the previous\nlightcut based methods, we approximate the lighting matrix with some signal\nspecialized bases via factorization. The experimental results shows that we can\nachieve significant acceleration than the state of the art many-light methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 09:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 11:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a new traffic forecasting\nframework -- Spatio-Temporal Latent Graph Structure Learning networks\n(ST-LGSL). More specifically, the model employs a graph generator based on\nMultilayer perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbor, which learns the latent graph\ntopological information from the entire data considering both spatial and\ntemporal dynamics.

Currently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive\nperformance on these tasks. Yet, most of them mainly focus on finding powerful\ndeep architectures but ignore capturing the inherent curvilinear structure\nfeature (e.g., the curvilinear structure is darker than the context) for a more\nrobust representation. In consequence, the performance usually drops a lot on\ncross-datasets, which poses great challenges in practice. In this paper, we aim\nto improve the generalizability by introducing a novel local intensity order\ntransformation (LIOT). Specifically, we transfer a gray-scale image into a\ncontrast-invariant four-channel image based on the intensity order between each\npixel and its nearby pixels along with the four (horizontal and vertical)\ndirections. This results in a representation that preserves the inherent\ncharacteristic of the curvilinear structure while being robust to contrast\nchanges. Cross-dataset evaluation on three retinal blood vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrates that LIOT improves the generalizability of some\nstate-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the cross-dataset evaluation between\nretinal blood vessel segmentation and pavement crack segmentation shows that\nLIOT is able to preserve the inherent characteristic of curvilinear structure\nwith large appearance gaps.

(AAAI, 2021) introduced a model for deliberative coalition\nformation, where a community wishes to identify a strongly supported proposal\nfrom a space of alternatives, in order to change the status quo. In their\nmodel, agents and proposals are points in a metric space, agents' preferences\nare determined by distances, and agents deliberate by dynamically forming\ncoalitions around proposals that they prefer over the status quo. The\ndeliberation process operates via k-compromise transitions, where agents from k\n(current) coalitions come together to form a larger coalition in order to\nsupport a (perhaps new) proposal, possibly leaving behind some of the\ndissenting agents from their old coalitions. A deliberation succeeds if it\nterminates by identifying a proposal with the largest possible support. For\ndeliberation in d dimensions, Elkind et al. consider two variants of their\nmodel: in the Euclidean model, proposals and agent locations are points in R^d\nand the distance is measured according to ||...||_2; and in the hypercube\nmodel, proposals and agent locations are vertices of the d-dimensional\nhypercube and the metric is the Hamming distance. They show that in the\ncontinuous model 2-compromises are guaranteed to succeed, but in the discrete\nmodel for deliberation to succeed it may be necessary to use k-compromises with\nk >= d.

Secondly, traditional IRL\nmethods assume the reward functions are homogeneous across all the\ndemonstrations. Some existing IRL methods managed to extend to the\nheterogeneous demonstrations. However, they still assume one hidden variable\nthat affects the behavior and learn the underlying hidden variable together\nwith the reward from demonstrations.

Instead,\nthe existence proof is based on the entropy structure of the model, a novel\nregularization of the entropy variable, higher-order moment estimates, and\nfractional time regularity. The regularization technique is generic and is\napplied to the population system with self-diffusion in any space dimension and\nwithout self-diffusion in two space dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 10:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

In particular, it is often important to estimate how long\ncrystals stay in suspension in the host liquid before being deposited at its\nbottom (or top, for light particles). We perform a systematic 3D numerical\nstudy of particle-laden Rayleigh-Benard convection, and derive a robust model\nfor the particle residence time. For Rayleigh numbers higher than 10^7,\ninertial particles' trajectories exhibit a monotonic transition from fluid\ntracer-like to free-fall dynamics, the control parameter being the ratio\nbetween particle Stokes velocity and the fluid velocity. The average settling\nrate is proportional to the particle Stokes velocity in both the end-member\nregimes, but the distribution of the residence times differs markedly from one\nto the other. For lower Rayleigh numbers (<10^7), an interaction between\nlarge-scale circulation and particle motion emerges, increasing the settling\nrates on average. Nevertheless, the mean residence time does not exceed the\nterminal time, i.e. the settling time from a quiescent fluid, by a factor\nlarger than four. An exception are simulations with only a slightly\nsuper-critical Rayleigh number (~ 10^4), for which stationary convection\ndevelops and some particles become trapped indefinitely. 2D simulations of the\nsame problem overestimate the flow-particle interaction - and hence the\nresidence time - for both high and low Rayleigh numbers, which stresses the\nimportance of using 3D geometries for simulating particle-laden flows. We\noutline how our model can be used to explain depth changes of crystal size\ndistribution in sedimentary layers of magmatic intrusions that are thought to\nhave formed via settling of a crystal cargo, and discuss how the\nmicro-structural observations of solidified intrusions can be used to infer the\npast convective velocity of magma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 11:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Employing the block-Lanczos\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method, we show that there are two phases\nin the relevant parameter space, i.e., a nonmagnetic phase in the weak coupling\nregion and a free magnetic moment phase in the realistic parameter region. The\nsystematic analysis finds that, in the free magnetic moment phase, local\nmultiplets of the doubly degenerate irreducible representation of the\n$\\mathcal{C}_3$ point group with spin 1 become dominant in the ground state,\nand approximately half of this local spin 1 is screened by electrons in the\nsurrounding $\\pi$ orbitals, indicating the emergence of the residual spin-1/2\nfree magnetic moment. Furthermore, we find that the emergence of the free\nmagnetic moment is robust against carrier doping, which is in sharp contrast to\nthe case of graphene with an adatom, thus explaining the qualitative difference\nobserved experimentally in these two classes of systems.

This gives the system under investigation the ability to remain stable\nin a large number of complex states, which is a vital ability for myriad of\napplications, including reconfigurable structures and soft robots. The\ntheoretical model explains the dynamics of a single straw-like element in a\ndiscrete manner, considering inertial, damping, and gravitational effects,\nwhile taking into account the nonlinear elasticity of the elastic frusta, and\nassuming hydrostatic behavior of the entrapped fluid. After identifying the\ngeometric and elastic parameters of the theoretical model based on relatively\nsimple experiments, the model is validated compared to numerical simulations\nand experiments. The numerical simulations validate the theoretical elasticity\nof the elastic frusta, whereas the overall dynamic behavior of the system and\nthe influence of unmodeled fluidic effects are examined experimentally. It is\ndemonstrated both theoretically and empirically that straw-like elements cannot\nbe adequately modeled using simple uniaxial deformations.

We start by establishing convergence\nrates to functions from periodic Sobolev spaces and we show that the saturation\nrate is $O(h^{2}),$ where $h$ is the scale of the Gaussian kernel. Taken from a\ndiscrete point of view, this result can be interpreted as the accuracy that can\nbe achieved on the uniform grid with spacing $h.$ In the discrete setting, the\ncurse of dimensionality would place severe restrictions on the computation of\nthe approximation. For instance, a spacing of $2^{-n}$ would provide an\napproximation converging at a rate of $O(2^{-2n})$ but would require\n$(2^{n}+1)^{d}$ grid points. To overcome this we introduce a sparse grid\nversion of Gaussian convolution approximation, where substantially fewer grid\npoints are required, and\n  show that the sparse grid version delivers a saturation rate of\n$O(n^{d-1}2^{-2n}).$ This rate is in line with what one would expect in the\nsparse grid setting (where the full grid error only deteriorates by a factor of\norder $n^{d-1}$) however the analysis that leads to the result is novel in that\nit draws on results from the theory of special functions and key observations\nregarding the form of certain weighted geometric sums.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 12:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

For a MBL system in the presence of\nnon-reciprocal tunnelings and random disorder potential, we identify two\ndifferent complex-real spectral transitions, one is present for both open and\nperiodic boundaries while the other is present only for open boundaries of a\ncoupled non-Hermitian chains. The later is driven due to the inter-chain\ncoupling at weak disorder where the level statistics of the real eigenenergy\nphase follows Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. We further characterize\nwavefunctions through the (biorthogonal) inverse participation ratio and\nfractal dimension, which reveal the suppression of skin effect in the\nnon-Hermitian MBL phase.

During\nmeasurement, conventional entropy measures are susceptible to length and\namplitude changes in time series. A new entropy metric, neural network entropy\n(NNetEn), has been developed to overcome these limitations. NNetEn entropy is\ncomputed using a modified LogNNet neural network classification model. The\nalgorithm contains a reservoir matrix of N=19625 elements that must be filled\nwith the given data. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, this\nwork investigates different methods of filling the reservoir with time series\n(signal) elements. The reservoir filling method determines the accuracy of the\nentropy estimation by convolution of the study time series and LogNNet test\ndata. The present study proposes 6 methods for filling the reservoir for time\nseries. Two of them (Method 3 and Method 6) employ the novel approach of\nstretching the time series to create intermediate elements that complement it,\nbut do not change its dynamics. The most reliable methods for short time series\nare Method 3 and Method 5. The second part of the study examines the influence\nof noise and constant bias on entropy values. Our study examines three\ndifferent time series data types (chaotic, periodic, and binary) with different\ndynamic properties, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and offsets. The NNetEn\nentropy calculation errors are less than 10% when SNR is greater than 30 dB,\nand entropy decreases with an increase in the bias component. The third part of\nthe article analyzes real-time biosignal EEG data collected from emotion\nrecognition experiments.

Now, we extend this concept to model\narbitrarily shaped and moving cathodes. Two methodologies are investigated to\ndescribe the time varying position of the cathode. In the first approach, we\nchange the electric conductivity of elements within the cathode and, in a\nsecond approach, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodes of\ncorresponding elements. For both methods, elements on the cathode's surface are\ntreated with effective material parameters.

The prevailing view is\nthat giant planets accreted multiple Earth masses of heavy elements after the\nend of core formation. Such late solid enrichment is commonly explained by the\naccretion of planetesimals. Planetesimals are expected to form at the edges of\nplanetary gaps, and here we address the question of whether these planetesimals\ncan be accreted in large enough amounts to explain the inferred high heavy\nelement contents of giant planets. We perform a series of N-body simulations of\nthe dynamics of planetesimals and planets during the planetary growth phase,\ntaking into account gas drag as well as the enhanced collision cross-section\ncaused by the extended envelopes. We consider the growth of Jupiter and Saturn\nvia gas accretion after reaching the pebble isolation mass and we include their\nmigration in an evolving disk. We find that the accretion efficiency of\nplanetesimals formed at planetary gap edges is very low: less than 10% of the\nformed planetesimals are accreted even in the most favorable cases, which in\nour model corresponds to a few Earth-masses. When planetesimals are assumed to\nform beyond the feeding zone of the planets, extending to a few Hill radii from\na planet, accretion becomes negligible. Furthermore, we find that the accretion\nefficiency increases when the planetary migration distance is increased and\nthat the efficiency does not increase when the planetesimal radii are\ndecreased. Based on these results we conclude that it is difficult to explain\nthe large heavy element content of giant planets with planetesimal accretion\nduring the gas accretion phase.

In this\nwork, we study the performance of DASH across different turbidity regimes, in\nsimulation as well as experiments. We further provide a direct comparison\nbetween DASH and a novel, modified version of the Continuous Sequential\nAlgorithm (CSA) which we call Amplified CSA (a-CSA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 15:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 09:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Although weighted scoring rules have\nbecome a well-established tool to achieve this, such scores have been studied\nalmost exclusively in the univariate case, with interest typically placed on\nextreme events. However, a large impact may also result from events not\nconsidered to be extreme from a statistical perspective: the interaction of\nseveral moderate events could also generate a high impact. Compound weather\nevents provide a good example of this. To assess forecasts made for high-impact\nevents, this work extends existing results on weighted scoring rules by\nintroducing weighted multivariate scores. To do so, we utilise kernel scores.\nWe demonstrate that the threshold-weighted continuous ranked probability score\n(twCRPS), arguably the most well-known weighted scoring rule, is a kernel\nscore. This result leads to a convenient representation of the twCRPS when the\nforecast is an ensemble, and also permits a generalisation that can be employed\nwith alternative kernels, allowing us to introduce, for example, a\nthreshold-weighted energy score and threshold-weighted variogram score. To\nillustrate the additional information that these weighted multivariate scoring\nrules provide, results are presented for a case study in which the weighted\nscores are used to evaluate daily precipitation accumulation forecasts, with\nparticular interest on events that could lead to flooding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

The impact of these interactions on charged\npion transverse-mass and rapidity spectra, as well as on pion-pion momentum\ncorrelations is investigated in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.4 GeV.\nWe show that the low-mt part of the data ($m_t < 0.2$ GeV/c$^2$) can be well\ndescribed with a Coulomb-modified Boltzmann distribution that also takes\nchanges of the Coulomb field during the expansion of the fireball into account.\nThe observed centrality dependence of the fitted mean Coulomb potential\ndeviates strongly from a $A_{part}^{2/3}$ scaling, indicating that, next to the\nfireball, the non-interacting charged spectators have to be taken into account.\nFor the most central collisions, the Coulomb modifications of the HBT source\nradii are found to be consistent with the potential extracted from the\nsingle-pion transverse-mass distributions. This finding suggests that the\nregion of homogeneity obtained from two-pion correlations coincides with the\nregion in which the pions freeze-out.

A batch of 5 kg of alloy was synthesized at\nindustrial level and characterized through scanning electron microscopy and\npowder X-ray diffraction, to determine the structure and phase abundance.\nMoreover, the hydrogen sorption properties were investigated through\nthermodynamic and kinetic analyses, followed by a long-term cycling study and\nresistance to O$_2$ and H$_2$O poisoning.

Many organisations employ a Chief Information Security\nOfficer (CISO) to lead such a function. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured\ninterviews with 15 CISOs and six senior organisational leaders, between October\n2019 and July 2020, as part of a wider exploration into the purpose of CISOs\nand cyber-security functions. In this paper, we employ broader security\nscholarship related to ontological security and sociological notions of\nidentity work to provide an interpretative analysis of the CISO role in\norganisations. Research findings reveal that cyber security is an expert system\nthat positions the CISO as an interpreter of something that is mystical,\nunknown and fearful to the uninitiated. They show how the fearful nature of\ncyber security contributes to it being considered an ontological threat by the\norganisation, while responding to that threat contributes to the organisation's\noverall identity. We further show how cyber security is analogous to a belief\nsystem and how one of the roles of the CISO is akin to that of a modern-day\nsoothsayer for senior management; that this role is precarious and, at the same\ntime, superior, leading to alienation within the organisation. Our study also\nhighlights that the CISO identity of protector-from-threat, linked to the\nprecarious position, motivates self-serving actions that we term `cyber\nsophistry'. We conclude by outlining a series of implications for both\norganisations and CISOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 15:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

Mis-estimation of the noise behavior\ndirectly impacts the posterior width of the signal parameters. This becomes an\nissue for studies which depend on accurate localization volumes such as i)\nprobing cosmological parameters (such as Hubble constant, clustering bias)\nusing cross-correlation methods with galaxies, ii) doing electromagnetic\nfollow-up using localization information from parameter estimation done from\npre-merger data. We study the effects of dynamical noise on the parameter\nestimation of the GW events. We develop a new method to correct dynamical noise\nby estimating a locally-valid pseudo PSD which is normalized along the\ntime-frequency track of a potential signal. We do simulations by injecting the\nBNS signal in various scenarios where the detector goes through a period of\nnon-stationarity with reference noise curve of third generation detectors\n(Cosmic explorer, Einstein telescope). As an example, for a source where\nmis-modelling of the noise biases the signal-to-noise estimate by even $10\\%$,\none would expect the estimated localization volume to be either under or over\nreported by $\\sim 30\\%$; errors like this, especially in low-latency, could\npotentially cause follow-up campaigns to miss the true source location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 15:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

Moreover, collected\nspectroscopic data vary due to different experimental setups and environments.\nSuch variations, artifacts, and environmental differences pose a challenge in\naccurate spectral analysis. In this work, we developed a deep learning model to\novercome the effects of such variations and classify graphene Raman spectra\naccording to different charge densities and dielectric environments.

Microsatellite\ninstability (MSI) or mismatch repair (MMR) status plays a vital role in\nappropriate treatment selection, has prognostic implications and is used to\ninvestigate the possibility of patients having underlying genetic disorders\n(Lynch syndrome). NICE recommends that all CRC patients should be offered\nMMR/MSI testing. Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to assess MMR status\nwith subsequent molecular testing performed as required. This incurs\nsignificant extra costs and requires additional resources. The introduction of\nautomated methods that can predict MSI or MMR status from a target image could\nsubstantially reduce the cost associated with MMR testing. Unlike previous\nstudies on MSI prediction involving training a CNN using coarse labels (MSI vs\nMicrosatellite Stable (MSS)), we have utilised fine-grain MMR labels for\ntraining purposes. In this paper, we present our work on predicting MSI status\nin a two-stage process using a single target slide either stained with CK8/18\nor H&E.

Many theories assume the\npresence of an absolute space and time in which the physical objects are\nlocated and physical processes take place. However, it is more fundamental to\nunderstand time as relative to the motion of another object, e.g. the number of\nswings of a pendulum, and the position of an object primarily as relative to\nother objects. The goals of this paper is to explain, how using the principle\nof relationalism (to be introduced below), classical mechanics can be\nformulated on a most elementary space, which is freed from absolute entities:\nshape space. On shape space only the relative orientation and length of\nsubsystems are taken into account. In order to find out how the shape of a\nclassical system evolves in time, the method of \"symplectic reduction of\nHamiltonian systems\" is extended to include scale transformations, and in this\nway the reduction of a classical system with respect to the full similarity\ngroup is achieved. A necessary requirement for the validity of the principle of\nrelationalism is that changing the length scale of a system, all parameters of\nthe theory that depend on the length, get changed accordingly. In particular,\nthe principle of relationalism requires a proper transformation of the coupling\nconstants of the interaction potentials in Classical Physics. This leads\nconsequently to a transformation in Planck's measuring units, which enables us\nto derive a metric on shape space in a unique way. Later in this paper, we will\nexplain the derivation of the reduced Hamiltonian and symplectic form on shape\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 15:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 06:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}
