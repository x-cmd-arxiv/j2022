ASNI-I learns an accurate sparse off-the-shelf network only in one\nsingle round of training. ASNI-II learns a sparse network and an initialization\nthat is quantized, compressed, and from which the sparse network is trainable.\nThe learned initialization is quantized since only two numbers are learned for\ninitialization of nonzero parameters in each layer L. Thus, quantization levels\nfor the initialization of the entire network is 2L. Also, the learned\ninitialization is compressed because it is a set consisting of 2L numbers. The\nspecial sparse network that can be trained from such a quantized and compressed\ninitialization is called amenable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no\nother algorithm that can learn a quantized and compressed initialization from\nwhich the network is still trainable and is able to solve both pruning tasks.\nOur numerical experiments show that there is a quantized and compressed\ninitialization from which the learned sparse network can be trained and reach\nto an accuracy on a par with the dense version.

In the present day scenario, it is difficult to decide the\nexact annual demand rate and hence a major difficulty is faced by a decision\nmaker to forecast the demand. Also, in any inventory system, goods in stock may\nsubject to deterioration or leakage. Deterioration of goods refers to decrease\nin quality whereas quantity remains more or less the same. On the other hand,\nleakage refers to loss in quantity whereas the quality remains unchanged for a\ncertain period of time. Leakages in the inventory system may be considered to\nbe very small, not detectable by the management immediately and hence it is\ndifficult to decide the exact leakage rate. The objective of this paper is to\nconsider these variable parameters and determine the optimal economic order\nquantity (EOQ) to maximise the annual total profit. So, fuzzy inventory models\nhave been proposed considering fuzzy leakage rate and fuzzy annual demand rate\nto estimate the total profit per unit time.

Recent work in economics\nintroduced clock auctions as a superior class of auctions for this problem, due\nto their transparency, simplicity, and strong incentive guarantees. Subsequent\nwork focused on evaluating the social welfare approximation guarantees of these\nauctions, leading to strong impossibility results: in the absence of prior\ninformation regarding the buyers' values, no deterministic clock auction can\nachieve a bounded approximation, even for simple feasibility constraints with\nonly two maximal feasible sets.\n  We show that these negative results can be circumvented by using prior\ninformation or by leveraging randomization. We provide clock auctions that give\na $O(\\log\\log k)$ approximation for general downward-closed feasibility\nconstraints with $k$ maximal feasible sets for three different information\nmodels, ranging from full access to the value distributions to complete absence\nof information. The more information the seller has, the simpler these auctions\nare. Under full access, we use a particularly simple deterministic clock\nauction, called a single-price clock auction, which is only slightly more\ncomplex than posted price mechanisms. In this auction, each buyer is offered a\nsingle price and a feasible set is selected among those who accept their\noffers. In the other extreme, where no prior information is available, this\napproximation guarantee is obtained using a complex randomized clock auction.\nIn addition to our main results, we propose a parameterization that\ninterpolates between single-price clock auctions and general clock auctions,\npaving the way for an exciting line of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 16:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Here we introduce a noise-robust and\nloss-tolerant test of quantum steering designed for single detector\nmeasurements that harnesses the advantages of high-dimensional entanglement. We\nshowcase the improvements over qubit-based systems by experimentally\ndemonstrating detection loophole-free quantum steering in 53 dimensions through\nsimultaneous loss and noise conditions corresponding to 14.2 dB loss equivalent\nto 79 km of telecommunication fibre, and 36% of white noise.

This chapter delves into\nissues of cyber human interaction from the perspective of humans interacting\nwith a subset of robots known as assistive robots. Assistive robots are robots\ndesigned to assist individuals with mobility or capacity limitations in\ncompleting everyday activities, commonly called instrumental activities of\ndaily living. These range from household chores, eating or drinking to any\nactivity with which a user may need the daily assistance of a caregiver to\ncomplete. One common type of assistive robot is the wheelchair mounted robotic\narm. This device is designed to attach to a user's wheelchair to allow him or\nher to complete their activities independently. In short, these devices have\nsensors that allow them to sense and process their environment with varying\nlevels of autonomy to perform actions that benefit and improve the well-being\nof people with capability limitations or disabilities. While human robot\ninteraction is a popular research topic, not much research has been dedicated\nwith regard to individual with limitations.

We studied the decrease in $\\Gamma_1$ due to the ionization of heavy\nelements in comparison with the value obtained for a pure hydrogen-helium\nplasma. These types of differences are denoted as \"Z contributions\", and we\nanalyzed them for eight elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe) as well as\nfor a mixture of elements corresponding to the solar chemical composition. We\ncompared linear combinations of individual Z contributions with the exact Z\ncontribution. Applying a least-squares technique to the decomposition of the\nfull Z contribution to a basis of individual-element contributions, we obtained\nthe mass fractions of the heavy elements.\n  Results. The Z contribution of heavy elements can be described by a linear\ncombination of individual-element Z contributions with a high level of accuracy\nof 5e-6 . The inverse problem of estimating the mass fractions of heavy\nelements from a given $\\Gamma_1$ profile was considered for the example of\nsolar-type mixtures. In ideal numerical simulations, the mass fractions of the\nmost abundant elements could be determined with a relative accuracy better than\na few tenths of a percent. In the presence of random or systematic errors in\nthe $\\Gamma_1$ profile, abundance estimations become remarkably less accurate.\nIf the amplitude of the errors does not exceed 1e-4, we can expect a\ndetermination of at least the oxygen abundance with a relative error of about\n10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 17:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In addition, the analysis of the MHD Poynting flux\nconfirms that the majority of the energy is directed in the horizontal\ndirection.

The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) is one of 6\nremote sensing instruments on-board Solar Orbiter.

To show that the visibility amplitude and phase\ncalibration of 24 out of 30 STIX sub-collimators is well advanced and that a\nset of imaging methods is able to provide the first hard X-ray images of the\nflaring Sun from Solar Orbiter.

We applied four visibility-based image\nreconstruction methods and a count-based one to calibrated STIX observations.\nThe resulting reconstructions are compared to those provided by an optimization\nalgorithm used for fitting the amplitudes of STIX visibilities.

When\napplied to six flares with GOES class between C4 and M4 which occurred in May\n2021, the five imaging methods produce results morphologically consistent with\nthe ones provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar\nDynamic Observatory (SDO/AIA) in UV wavelengths.

The techniques used by artists to impart realism to their\npaintings often rely on approaches based in mathematics, like linear\nperspective; yet the means used to assess the verisimilitude of realist\npaintings have remained subjective, even intuitive. An exploration of\nalternative and relatively objective methods for evaluating pictorial realism\ncould enhance existing art historical research. We propose a\nmachine-learning-based paradigm for studying pictorial realism in an\nexplainable way. Unlike subjective evaluations made by art historians or\ncomputer-based painting analysis exploiting inexplicable learned features, our\nframework assesses realism by measuring the similarity between clouds painted\nby exceptionally skillful 19th-century landscape painters like John Constable\nand photographs of clouds. The experimental results of cloud classification\nshow that Constable approximates more consistently than his contemporaries the\nformal features of actual clouds in his paintings. Our analyses suggest that\nartists working in the decades leading up to the invention of photography\nworked in a mode that anticipated some of the stylistic features of\nphotography.

The canonical approach to solving such problems is via the\nproximal gradient descent (ProxGD) algorithm, which is based on the evaluation\nof the gradient of $f$ and the prox operator of $\\psi$ in each iteration. In\nthis work we are specifically interested in the regime in which the evaluation\nof prox is costly relative to the evaluation of the gradient, which is the case\nin many applications. ProxSkip allows for the expensive prox operator to be\nskipped in most iterations: while its iteration complexity is\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\kappa \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$, where $\\kappa$ is\nthe condition number of $f$, the number of prox evaluations is\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ only.

In this context, ProxSkip offers an effective acceleration\nof communication complexity. Unlike other local gradient-type methods, such as\nFedAvg, SCAFFOLD, S-Local-GD and FedLin, whose theoretical communication\ncomplexity is worse than, or at best matching, that of vanilla GD in the\nheterogeneous data regime, we obtain a provable and large improvement without\nany heterogeneity-bounding assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 18:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 11:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

On\nthe hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact\nsolutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

This paper proposes a constrained Markov decision\nprocess model for identifying optimal priority list policies that is formulated\nas a mixed integer programming model, does not extend the Markov state space,\nand can be solved using standard algorithms. A series of computational examples\nillustrate the benefit of intuitive policies. The optimal mixed integer\nprogramming solutions to the computational examples have objective function\nvalues that are close to those of the unrestricted model and are superior to\nthose of heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 18:28:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 01:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Specifically, one can ask how the classical Shannon entropy,\nmutual information, and higher interaction information functions relate to each\nother. This is formally answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the\nform of information diagrams: it relates disjoint unions of shapes in a Venn\ndiagram to summation rules of information functions; this establishes a bridge\nfrom set theory to information theory. While a proof of this theorem is known,\nto date it was not analyzed in detail in what generality it could be\nestablished. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint\noperation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and\nentropy as the unique function satisfying the chain rule of information.

The distributed consensus problem\nis a classic problem that has been extensively studied and its convergence\ncharacteristics are well-known. Alas, state-of-the-art consensus methods build\non the idea of exchanging local information with neighboring nodes which leaks\ninformation about the users' local values. We propose an algorithmic framework\nthat is capable of achieving the convergence limit and rate of classic\nconsensus algorithms while keeping the users' local values private.

However, existing works are mostly\nhigh-level designs with no sufficient demonstration and treat blockchain as\nseparate storage system assisting third-party central servers, ignoring the\nimportance and capability of consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism. In\nthis paper, we propose a light-weight and fully third-party free\nBlockchain-Driven Contact Tracing framework (BDCT) to bridge the gap. In the\nBDCT framework, RSA encryption based transaction verification method (RSA-TVM)\nis proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness, which can achieve more than\n96\\% contact cases recording accuracy even each person has 60\\% probability of\nfailing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof\nof Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is proposed together with the incentive\nmechanism, which can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and keep\nblockchain decentralized. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is\ncreated, which considers three different contact scenarios based on population\ndensity. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and\nattack resistance of RSA-TVM and RC-DPoS in the proposed BDCT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 19:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 03:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Today, dissipative Kerr solitons generated in\nmicroresonators offer the prospect of attaining frequency combs in miniaturized\nsystems by capitalizing on advances in photonic integration. Most of the\napplications based on soliton microcombs rely on tuning a continuous-wave laser\ninto a longitudinal mode of a microresonator whose dimensions are engineered to\ndisplay anomalous dispersion at the pump laser frequency. In this\nconfiguration, however, nonlinear physics precludes from attaining dissipative\nKerr solitons with high power conversion efficiency, with typical comb powers\namounting to ~1% of the available laser power. Here, we demonstrate that this\nfundamental limitation can be overcome by inducing a controllable frequency\nshift to a selected cavity resonance. Experimentally, we realize this shift\nusing two linearly coupled anomalous-dispersion microresonators (a photonic\nmolecule), resulting in a coherent dissipative Kerr soliton with a conversion\nefficiency exceeding 50% and excellent line spacing stability. We describe the\nphysical soliton dynamics in this configuration, and discover the system\ndisplays unusual characteristics, such as the possibility to backwards initiate\nsolitons and stable operation with a blue detuned pump laser.

Although post-heat treatment is usually\nadopted to improve or manipulate NiTi alloy properties, it cannot realize the\nspatial control of thermal and/or mechanical properties of NiTi alloys. To\novercome the limitations of uniform post-heat treatment, this study proposes an\nin-situ heat treatment strategy that is integrated into the directed energy\ndeposition of NiTi alloys. The proposed method will potentially lead to new\nmanufacturing capabilities to achieve location-dependent performance or\nproperty manipulation. The influences of in-situ heat treatment on the thermal\nand mechanical properties of printed NiTi structures were investigated. The\ninvestigations were carried out in terms of thermal cycling, microstructure\nevolution, and mechanical properties by 3D finite element simulations and\nexperimental characterizations. A low-power laser beam was adopted to localize\nthe in-situ heat treatment only to the current printed layer, facilitating a\nreverse peritectic reaction and a transient high solution treatment\nsuccessively.

The new leader is often decided upon\na candidate server that collects votes from a quorum of servers. However,\nvoting-based election mechanisms intrinsically cause competition in leadership\ncandidacy when each candidate collects only partial votes. This split-vote\nscenario can result in no leadership winner and prolong the undesired\nview-change period. In this paper, we investigate a case study of Raft's leader\nelection mechanism and propose a new leader election protocol, called ESCAPE,\nthat fundamentally solves split votes by prioritizing servers based on their\nlog responsiveness. ESCAPE dynamically assigns servers with a configuration\nthat offers different priorities through Raft's periodic heartbeat. In each\nassignment, ESCAPE keeps track of server log responsiveness and assigns\nconfigurations that are inclined to win an election to more up-to-date servers,\nthereby preparing a pool of prioritized candidates. Consequently, when the next\nelection takes place, the candidate with the highest priority will defeat its\ncounterparts and becomes the next leader without competition. The evaluation\nresults show that ESCAPE progressively reduces the leader election time when\nthe cluster scales up, and the improvement becomes more significant under\nmessage loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

However, due to the batteryless nature, they suffer\nunpredictable frequent power outages. They thus require a lightweight mechanism\nfor crash consistency since saving/restoring checkpoints across the outages can\nlimit forward progress by consuming hard-won energy. For the reason, energy\nharvesting systems have been designed with a non-volatile memory (NVM) only.\nThe use of a volatile data cache has been assumed to be not viable or at least\nchallenging due to the difficulty to ensure cacheline persistence. In this\npaper, we propose ReplayCache, a software-only crash consistency scheme that\nenables commodity energy harvesting systems to exploit a volatile data cache.\nReplayCache does not have to ensure the persistence of dirty cachelines or\nrecord their logs at run time. Instead, ReplayCache recovery runtime\nre-executes the potentially unpersisted stores in the wake of power failure to\nrestore the consistent NVM state, from which interrupted program can safely\nresume. To support store replay during recovery, ReplayCache partitions program\ninto a series of regions in a way that store operand registers remain intact\nwithin each region, and checkpoints all registers just before power failure\nusing the crash consistency mechanism of the commodity systems. For\nperformance, ReplayCache enables region-level persistence that allows the\nstores in a region to be asynchronously persisted until the region ends,\nexploiting ILP. The evaluation with 23 benchmark applications show that\ncompared to the baseline with no caches, ReplayCache can achieve about 10.72x\nand 8.5x-8.9x speedup (on geometric mean) for the scenarios without and with\npower outages, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 21:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Ensuring that these services are resilient\n(that is, exhibiting efficient response to and recovery from disruptions) is a\nkey economic and social priority. Increasingly, the ability of urban rail\nsystems to cope with disruptions is a function of a complex patchwork of\nmobility options, wherein alternative modes can complement and fill service\ngaps. This study analyzes the role of ridesourcing in providing adaptive\nmobility capacity that could be leveraged to fill no-notice gaps in rail\ntransit services, addressing the question of distributional impacts of\nresilience. Using a natural experiment, we systematically identify 28 major\ntransit disruptions over the period of one year in Chicago and match them, both\ntemporally and spatially, with ridesourcing trip data. Using multilevel mixed\nmodeling, we quantify variation in the adaptive use of on-demand mobility\nacross the racially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Our findings show\nthat the gap-filling potential of adaptive ridesourcing during rail transit\ndisruptions is significantly influenced by station-, community-, and\ndistrict-level factors. Specifically, greater shifts to ridesourcing occur\nduring weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe disruptions, in community areas\nthat have higher percentages of White residents and transit commuters, and in\nthe more affluent North district of the city. These findings suggest that while\nridesourcing appears to provide adaptive capacity during rail disruptions, its\nbenefits do not appear to be equitable for lower-income communities of color\nthat already experience limited mobility options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 22:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Unfortunately, many protocols are only described in English prose, and\nimplementing even a simple network protocol as an FSM is time-consuming and\nprone to subtle logical errors. Automatically extracting protocol FSMs from\ndocumentation can significantly contribute to increased use of these techniques\nand result in more robust and secure protocol implementations.\n  In this work we focus on attacker synthesis as a representative technique for\nprotocol security, and on RFCs as a representative format for protocol prose\ndescription.

We show the\ngeneralizability of our FSM extraction by using the RFCs for six different\nprotocols: BGPv4, DCCP, LTP, PPTP, SCTP and TCP.

Most previous studies\nrely on either independent assumptions or simplified local spatial correlation\nstructures. In the real world, however, link travel time on a bus route could\nexhibit complex correlation structures, such as long-range correlations,\nnegative correlations, and time-varying correlations. Therefore, before\nintroducing strong assumptions, it is essential to empirically quantify and\nexamine the correlation structure of link travel time from real-world bus\noperation data. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian Gaussian model to\nestimate the link travel time correlation matrix of a bus route using\nsmart-card-like data. Our method overcomes the small-sample-size problem in\ncorrelation matrix estimation by borrowing/integrating those incomplete\nobservations (i.e., with missing/ragged values and overlapped link segments)\nfrom other bus routes. Next, we propose an efficient Gibbs sampling framework\nto marginalize over the missing and ragged values and obtain the posterior\ndistribution of the correlation matrix. Three numerical experiments are\nconducted to evaluate model performance.

Next, we\nperform experiments on a real-world bus route with smart card data; our results\nshow that both local and long-range correlations exist on this bus route.\nFinally, we demonstrate an application of using the estimated covariance matrix\nto make probabilistic forecasting of link and trip travel time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 01:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

When rewards provided by the environment are sparse, agents may\nnot receive immediate feedback on the quality of actions that they take,\nthereby affecting learning of policies. In this paper, we propose to methods to\naugment the reward signal from the environment with an additional reward termed\nshaping advice in both single and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The\nshaping advice is specified as a difference of potential functions at\nconsecutive time-steps. Each potential function is a function of observations\nand actions of the agents. The use of potential functions is underpinned by an\ninsight that the total potential when starting from any state and returning to\nthe same state is always equal to zero. We show through theoretical analyses\nand experimental validation that the shaping advice does not distract agents\nfrom completing tasks specified by the environment reward. Theoretically, we\nprove that the convergence of policy gradients and value functions when using\nshaping advice implies the convergence of these quantities in the absence of\nshaping advice. We design two algorithms- Shaping Advice in Single-agent\nreinforcement learning (SAS) and Shaping Advice in Multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (SAM). Shaping advice in SAS and SAM needs to be specified only once\nat the start of training, and can easily be provided by non-experts.\nExperimentally, we evaluate SAS and SAM on two tasks in single-agent\nenvironments and three tasks in multi-agent environments that have sparse\nrewards.

The major challenge of SBR is how to capture richer\nrelations in between items and learn ID-based item embeddings to capture such\nrelations. Recent studies propose to first construct an item graph from\nsessions and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode item embedding from\nthe graph. Although such graph-based approaches have achieved performance\nimprovements, their GNNs are not suitable for ID-based embedding learning for\nthe SBR task. In this paper, we argue that the objective of such ID-based\nembedding learning is to capture a kind of \\textit{neighborhood affinity} in\nthat the embedding of a node is similar to that of its neighbors' in the\nembedding space. We propose a new graph neural network, called Graph Spring\nNetwork (GSN), for learning ID-based item embedding on an item graph to\noptimize neighborhood affinity in the embedding space. Furthermore, we argue\nthat even stacking multiple GNN layers may not be enough to encode potential\nrelations for two item nodes far-apart in a graph. In this paper, we propose a\nstrategy that first selects some informative item anchors and then encode\nitems' potential relations to such anchors. In summary, we propose a GSN-IAS\nmodel (Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task.\nWe first construct an item graph to describe items' co-occurrences in all\nsessions.

When humans make catastrophic mistakes, they are\nexpected to learn never to repeat them, such as a toddler who touches a hot\nstove and immediately learns never to do so again. In this work we consider a\nnovel class of POMDPs, called POMDP with Catastrophic Actions (POMDP-CA) in\nwhich pairs of states and actions are labeled as catastrophic. Agents that act\nin a POMDP-CA do not have a priori knowledge about which (state, action) pairs\nare catastrophic, thus they are sure to make mistakes when trying to learn any\nmeaningful policy. Rather, their aim is to maximize reward while never\nrepeating mistakes.\n  As a first step of avoiding mistake repetition, we leverage the concept of a\nshield which prevents agents from executing specific actions from specific\nstates.\n  In particular, we store catastrophic mistakes (unsafe pairs of states and\nactions) that agents make in a database. Agents are then forbidden to pick\nactions that appear in the database. This approach is especially useful in a\ncontinual learning setting, where groups of agents perform a variety of tasks\nover time in the same underlying environment. In this setting, a task-agnostic\nshield can be constructed in a way that stores mistakes made by any agent, such\nthat once one agent in a group makes a mistake the entire group learns to never\nrepeat that mistake. This paper introduces a variant of the PPO algorithm that\nutilizes this shield, called ShieldPPO, and empirically evaluates it in a\ncontrolled environment.\n  Results indicate that ShieldPPO outperforms PPO, as well as baseline methods\nfrom the safe reinforcement learning literature, in a range of settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 03:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Organizations across North America perform outreach to sex\nindustry workers to offer assistance in the form of services (e.g., healthcare,\nfinancial assistance, housing), prayer, and intervention. Increasingly,\ntechnology is used to look for trafficking victims or facilitate the provision\nof assistance or services, for example through scraping and parsing sex\nindustry workers' advertisements into a database of contact information that\ncan be used by outreach organizations. However, little is known about the\nefficacy of anti-trafficking outreach technology, nor the potential risks of\nusing it to identify and contact the highly stigmatized and marginalized\npopulation of those working in the sex industry.\n  In this work, we investigate the use, context, benefits, and harms of an\nanti-trafficking technology platform via qualitative interviews with multiple\nstakeholders: the technology developers (n=6), organizations that use the\ntechnology (n=17), and sex industry workers who have been contacted or wish to\nbe contacted (n=24).

In addition, they have limitations in preserving vivid color and rich\ntextual details in defogging. To address these issues, we develop a novel\ngenerative adversarial network, called quad-path cycle consistent adversarial\nnetwork (QPC-Net), for single image defogging. QPC-Net consists of a\nFog2Fogfree block and a Fogfree2Fog block. In each block, there are three\nlearning-based modules, namely, fog removal, color-texture recovery, and fog\nsynthetic, which sequentially compose dual-path that constrain each other to\ngenerate high quality images. Specifically, the color-texture recovery model is\ndesigned to exploit the self-similarity of texture and structure information by\nlearning the holistic channel-spatial feature correlations between the foggy\nimage with its several derived images. Moreover, in the fog synthetic module,\nwe utilize the atmospheric scattering model to guide it to improve the\ngenerative quality by focusing on an atmospheric light optimization with a\nnovel sky segmentation network. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets show that QPC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art defogging\nmethods in terms of quantitative accuracy and subjective visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 09:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 08:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 02:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Most attention mechanisms are bound to\nthe convolutional layer and use local or global contextual information to\nrecalibrate the input. This is a popular attention strategy design method.\nGlobal contextual information helps the network to consider the overall\ndistribution, while local contextual information is more general. The\ncontextual information makes the network pay attention to the mean or maximum\nvalue of a particular receptive field. Different from the most attention\nmechanism, this article proposes a novel attention mechanism with the heuristic\ndifference attention module, HDAM. HDAM's input recalibration is based on the\ndifference between the local and global contextual information instead of the\nmean and maximum values. At the same time, to make different layers have a more\nsuitable local receptive field size and increase the exibility of the local\nreceptive field design, we use genetic algorithm to heuristically produce local\nreceptive fields. First, HDAM extracts the mean value of the global and local\nreceptive fields as the corresponding contextual information. Then the\ndifference between the global and local contextual information is calculated.\nFinally HDAM uses this difference to recalibrate the input. In addition, we use\nthe heuristic ability of genetic algorithm to search for the local receptive\nfield size of each layer. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that\nHDAM can use fewer parameters than other attention mechanisms to achieve higher\naccuracy. We implement HDAM with the Python library, Pytorch, and the code and\nmodels will be publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 09:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 10:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 06:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

EEG\nis non-stationary with low signal-to-noise, classifying motor imagery tasks of\nthe same participant from different EEG recording sessions is generally\nchallenging, as EEG data distribution may vary tremendously among different\nacquisition sessions. Although it is intuitive to consider the cross-session MI\nclassification as a domain adaptation problem, the rationale and feasible\napproach is not elucidated. In this paper, we propose a Siamese deep domain\nadaptation (SDDA) framework for cross-session MI classification based on\nmathematical models in domain adaptation theory. The proposed framework can be\neasily applied to most existing artificial neural networks without altering the\nnetwork structure, which facilitates our method with great flexibility and\ntransferability. In the proposed framework, domain invariants were firstly\nconstructed jointly with channel normalization and Euclidean alignment. Then,\nembedding features from source and target domain were mapped into the\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and aligned accordingly. A cosine-based\ncenter loss was also integrated into the framework to improve the\ngeneralizability of the SDDA. The proposed framework was validated with two\nclassic and popular convolutional neural networks from BCI research field\n(EEGNet and ConvNet) in two MI-EEG public datasets (BCI Competition IV IIA,\nIIB). Compared to the vanilla EEGNet and ConvNet, the proposed SDDA framework\nwas able to boost the MI classification accuracy by 15.2%, 10.2% respectively\nin IIA dataset, and 5.5%, 4.2% in IIB dataset.

In this paper, deep imitation learning is applied to tasks\nthat require force feedback, such as bottle opening.

Bilateral teleoperation has been used for\ndemonstration with force feedback; however, this requires an expensive and\ncomplex bilateral robot system. In this paper, a new master-to-robot (M2R)\ntransfer learning system is presented that does not require robots but can\nstill teach dexterous force feedback-based manipulation tasks to robots. The\nhuman directly demonstrates a task using a low-cost controller that resembles\nthe kinematic parameters of the robot arm. Using this controller, the operator\ncan naturally feel the force feedback without any expensive bilateral system.\nFurthermore, the M2R transfer system can overcome domain gaps between the\nmaster and robot using the gaze-based imitation learning framework and a simple\ncalibration method.

To tackle\nthis problem, the key point is to alleviate the harm of these noisy labels.\nMany existing methods try to divide training data into clean and noisy subsets\nin terms of loss values, and then process the noisy label data varied. One of\nthe reasons hindering a better performance is the hard samples. As hard samples\nalways have relatively large losses whether their labels are clean or noisy,\nthese methods could not divide them precisely. Instead, we propose a Tripartite\nsolution to partition training data more precisely into three subsets: hard,\nnoisy, and clean. The partition criteria are based on the inconsistent\npredictions of two networks, and the inconsistency between the prediction of a\nnetwork and the given label. To minimize the harm of noisy labels but maximize\nthe value of noisy label data, we apply a low-weight learning on hard data and\na self-supervised learning on noisy label data without using the given labels.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Tripartite can filter out noisy label\ndata more precisely, and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on five\nbenchmark datasets, especially on real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 11:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 02:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

It is observed that a single resonant\ntriad can saturate via three way phase locking where the phase differences\nbetween dominant modes converge to constant values as individual phases\nincrease in time. This allows the system to have approximately constant\namplitude solutions. Non-resonant triads show similar behavior only when one of\nits legs is a zonal wave number. However when an additional triad, which is a\nreflection of the original one with respect to the $y$ axis is included, the\nbehavior of the resulting triad pair is shown to be more complex. In\nparticular, it is found that triads involving small radial wave numbers (large\nscale zonal flows) end up transferring their energy to the subdominant mode\nwhich keeps growing exponentially, while those involving larger radial wave\nnumbers (small scale zonal flows) tend to find steady chaotic or limit cycle\nstates (or decay to zero). In order to study the dynamics in a connected\nnetwork of triads, a network formulation is considered including a pump mode,\nand a number of zonal and non-zonal subdominant modes as a dynamical system. It\nwas observed that the zonal modes become clearly dominant only when a large\nnumber of triads are connected. When the zonal flow becomes dominant as a\n'collective mean field', individual interactions between modes become less\nimportant, which is consistent with the inhomogeneous wave-kinetic picture.\nFinally, the results of direct numerical simulation is discussed for the same\nparameters and various forms of the order parameter are computed. It is\nobserved that nonlinear phase dynamics results in a flattening of the large\nscale phase velocity as a function of scale in direct numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 12:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Both\nindicators turned out to be quite inhomogeneous across the studied parameter\nranges. A striking feature is the completely different behaviour of He-poor and\nHe-rich hot subdwarfs. While the former have a high fraction of close binaries,\nalmost no significant RV variations could be detected for the latter. This led\nus to the conclusion that there likely is no evolutionary connection between\nthese subtypes. Intermediate He-rich- and extreme He-rich sdOB/Os on the other\nhand are likely related. We conclude further that the vast majority of this\npopulation is formed via one or several binary merger channels. Hot subdwarfs\nwith temperatures cooler than $\\sim24\\,000\\,{\\rm K}$ tend to show less and\nsmaller RV-variations. These objects might constitute a new subpopulation of\nbinaries with longer periods and late-type or compact companions. The\nRV-variability properties of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and\ncorresponding post-EHB populations of the He-poor hot subdwarfs match and\nconfirm the predicted evolutionary connection between them. Stars found below\nthe canonical EHB at somewhat higher surface gravities show large RV-variations\nand a high RV-variability fraction, which is consistent with most of them being\nlow-mass EHB stars or progenitors of low-mass helium white dwarfs in close\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 13:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Sparse sampling is an effective way, but it\nwill lead to severe artifacts on the reconstructed CT image, thus sparse-view\nCT image reconstruction has been a prevailing and challenging research area.\nWith the popularity of mobile devices, the requirements for lightweight and\nreal-time networks are increasing rapidly. In this paper, we design a novel\nlightweight network called CAGAN, and propose a dual-domain reconstruction\npipeline for parallel beam sparse-view CT. CAGAN is an adversarial\nauto-encoder, combining the Coordinate Attention unit, which preserves the\nspatial information of features. Also, the application of Shuffle Blocks\nreduces the parameters by a quarter without sacrificing its performance. In the\nRadon domain, the CAGAN learns the mapping between the interpolated data and\nfringe-free projection data. After the restored Radon data is reconstructed to\nan image, the image is sent into the second CAGAN trained for recovering the\ndetails, so that a high-quality image is obtained.

Dying cells, including those\noriginating from tumors, shed their DNA into the bloodstream and contribute to\na pool of circulating fragments called cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Identifying the\ntissue origin of these DNA fragments from their epigenetic features has\nimplications in various clinical contexts. Open chromatin regions (OCRs) are\nimportant epigenetic features of DNA that reflect cell types of origin.\nProfiling these features by DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq provides\ninsights into tissue-specific and disease-specific regulatory mechanisms.\nIntegration of genomic and epigenomic features for cancer detection by liquid\nbiopsy has previously been reported. However, many multimodal analyses require\nlarge amounts of cfDNA input and/or multiple types of experiments to cover the\ngenomic and epigenomic aspects of a single sample which is cost and time\nprohibitive. Thus, methods that capture genomic and epigenomic profiles in a\nsingle experiment type with low input requirements are of importance.\nPredicting OCRs from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is one such approach.\nHere, we applied a correlation clustering algorithm to predict OCRs. We used\nlocal sequencing depth as input to our algorithm. Multiple processing steps\nwere then applied as follows: count normalization, discrete Fourier transform\nconversion, graph construction, graph cut optimization by linear programming,\nand clustering. To validate the proposed method, we compared the output of our\npredictions (OCR vs. non-OCR) with previously validated open chromatin regions\nrelated to human blood samples of the ATAC-db.

Tools for data validation may save the day of computer programmers. In\nfact, processing invalid data is a waste of resources at best, and a drama at\nworst if the problem remains unnoticed and wrong results are used for business.\nAnswer Set Programming (ASP) is not an exception, but the quest for better and\nbetter performance resulted in systems that essentially do not validate data.\nEven under the simplistic assumption that input/output data are eventually\nvalidated by external tools, invalid data may appear in other portions of the\nprogram, and go undetected until some other module of the designed software\nsuddenly breaks. This paper formalizes the problem of data validation for ASP\nprograms, introduces a language to specify data validation, and presents\n\\textsc{valasp}, a tool to inject data validation in ordinary programs. The\nproposed approach promotes fail-fast techniques at coding time without imposing\nany lag on the deployed system if data are pretended to be valid. Validation\ncan be specified in terms of statements using YAML, ASP and Python.\nAdditionally, the proposed approach opens the possibility to use ASP for\nvalidating data of imperative programming languages.

However, the huge combinatorial search space of\ncandidate pipelines means that current AutoML techniques, generate sub-optimal\npipelines, or none at all, especially on large, complex datasets. In this work\nwe propose an AutoML technique SapientML, that can learn from a corpus of\nexisting datasets and their human-written pipelines, and efficiently generate a\nhigh-quality pipeline for a predictive task on a new dataset. To combat the\nsearch space explosion of AutoML, SapientML employs a novel divide-and-conquer\nstrategy realized as a three-stage program synthesis approach, that reasons on\nsuccessively smaller search spaces. The first stage uses a machine-learned\nmodel to predict a set of plausible ML components to constitute a pipeline. In\nthe second stage, this is then refined into a small pool of viable concrete\npipelines using syntactic constraints derived from the corpus and the\nmachine-learned model. Dynamically evaluating these few pipelines, in the third\nstage, provides the best solution. We instantiate SapientML as part of a fully\nautomated tool-chain that creates a cleaned, labeled learning corpus by mining\nKaggle, learns from it, and uses the learned models to then synthesize\npipelines for new predictive tasks.

In order to achieve a high attack\nsuccess rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing\nattack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class.\nThis practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the\nbackdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be\nidentified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms.\n  In this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the\nover-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a\n\\textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the\npoisoned sample $\\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability\nof $p_n(\\bm{x})$ instead of 100\\%, and the value of $p_n(\\bm{x})$ is\nspecifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be\nonly slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on\nseveral existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably\nimprove the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high\nattack success rate. In addition, our strategy makes it able to manually\ncontrol the prediction probability of the design output through manipulating\nthe applied and activated number of LSBAs\\footnote{Source code will be\npublished at \\url{https://github.com/v-mipeng/LabelSmoothedAttack.git}}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 01:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Most existing classifications are, however, only available at\nrelatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United\nStates. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial\nresolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly\nlocalized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into\nencroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications\nare often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data\n(e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the\nlongitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. Here, we develop a set of\ndistance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the\nremoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods\nof time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by constructing indices of\nurbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018 and further\ntest the plausibility of our results against a variety of evaluation datasets.\nWe call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL) and make the\nresulting datasets publicly available (https://doi.org/10.3886/E162941) so that\nother researchers can conduct long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and\nrural change. In addition, due to the simplistic nature of the input data,\nthese methods can be generalized to other time periods or regions of the world,\nparticularly to data-scarce environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 23:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

To mitigate this\nproblem, we propose two criteria to be the most relevant, one pertaining to a\nsystem's internal architecture and the other to the dissociation between\nabstract rules and specific input identities. From this perspective, we\ncritically examine prior work on the symbolic capacities of Transformers, and\ndeem the results to be fundamentally inconclusive for reasons inherent in\nexperiment design. We further maintain that there is no simple fix to this\nproblem, since it arises -- to an extent -- in all end-to-end settings.\nNonetheless, we emphasize the need for more robust evaluation of whether\nnon-symbolic explanations exist for success in seemingly symbolic tasks. To\nfacilitate this, we experiment on four sequence modelling tasks on the T5\nTransformer in two experiment settings: zero-shot generalization, and\ngeneralization across class-specific vocabularies flipped between the training\nand test set. We observe that T5's generalization is markedly stronger in\nsequence-to-sequence tasks than in comparable classification tasks.

However, this classifier has not been\nsuccessfully implemented into sleep stage classification systems due to high\ncomplexity and low accuracy of classification. The aim of this research is to\nincrease the accuracy and reduce the learning time of Convolutional Neural\nNetwork Classifier. Methodology: The proposed system used a modified Orthogonal\nConvolutional Neural Network and a modified Adam optimisation technique to\nimprove the sleep stage classification accuracy and reduce the gradient\nsaturation problem that occurs due to sigmoid activation function. The proposed\nsystem uses Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) instead of sigmoid activation\nfunction as an activation function.

The magnetization energy flux, eM X\nE, in crossed electric and magnetic fields strongly modifies the Poynting\nvector in magnetic materials and metamaterials, but do not contribute to the\nheat current.
