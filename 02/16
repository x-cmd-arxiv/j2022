Thus,\nairborne FSOC systems have been a recent subject of interest and activity,\nincluding emerging projects such as Google Loon and Facebook Aquila. One of\nmajor technical challenges of FSOC system is the stringent requirement of\npointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) capability to ensure the reliable\ntransmission between the transmitter and receiver, due to narrow beam width and\nmovement of airborne platforms.

We view these beams\nfrom two perspectives. The first perspective is one in which the beam is\ndescribed in terms of the position of its reference line and the orientation of\nits cross sections (expressed in some fixed coordinate system). This is the\ngenerally encountered model, due to Eric Reissner and Juan C. Simo. Of second\norder in time and space, it is a quasilinear system of six equations. The\nsecond perspective is one in which the beam is rather described by intrinsic\nvariables -- velocities and strains or internal forces and moments -- which are\nmoreover expressed in a moving coordinate system attached to the beam. This\nsystem, proposed in its most general form by Dewey H. Hodges, consists of twice\nas many equations, but is of first order in time and space, hyperbolic and only\nsemilinear (quadratic). From the definition of the state of the latter model,\none can see that both perspectives are linked by a nonlinear transformation.\nThe questions of well-posedness, stabilization and control are addressed for\nbeams governed by the intrinsic model, while by using the transformation we\nalso prove that the existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to the\nintrinsic model implies that of a classical solution to the model written in\nterms of positions and rotations.

However, it is unclear how\ndata augmentation performs theoretically and what the optimal algorithm is in\npresence of transformation invariances.

Repeatability is a key attribute of model\nrobustness. Repeatable models output predictions with low variation during\nindependent tests carried out under similar conditions. During model\ndevelopment and evaluation, much attention is given to classification\nperformance while model repeatability is rarely assessed, leading to the\ndevelopment of models that are unusable in clinical practice. In this work, we\nevaluate the repeatability of four model types (binary classification,\nmulti-class classification, ordinal classification, and regression) on images\nthat were acquired from the same patient during the same visit. We study the\nperformance of binary, multi-class, ordinal, and regression models on four\nmedical image classification tasks from public and private datasets: knee\nosteoarthritis, cervical cancer screening, breast density estimation, and\nretinopathy of prematurity. Repeatability is measured and compared on ResNet\nand DenseNet architectures. Moreover, we assess the impact of sampling Monte\nCarlo dropout predictions at test time on classification performance and\nrepeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increased\nrepeatability for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models\nleading to an average reduction of the 95\\% limits of agreement by 16% points\nand of the disagreement rate by 7% points. The classification accuracy improved\nin most settings along with the repeatability. Our results suggest that beyond\nabout 20 Monte Carlo iterations, there is no further gain in repeatability.

Constant-weight equality operators have a\nmultiplicative depth that depends only on the Hamming weight of the code, not\nthe bit-length of the elements.

The commonly used\nparadigm to categorize pathology images is patch-based processing, which often\nincorporates multiple instance learning (MIL) to aggregate local patch-level\nrepresentations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically\nrelevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and\ncurrent MIL-based approaches often process images uniformly, discarding the\ninter-patches interactions. To alleviate these issues, we propose ScoreNet, a\nnew efficient transformer that exploits a differentiable recommendation stage\nto extract discriminative image regions and dedicate computational resources\naccordingly. The proposed transformer leverages the local and global attention\nof a few dynamically recommended high-resolution regions at an efficient\ncomputational cost.

The Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field method is used to capture\nthe droplet interface. The simulations capture the spontaneous coalescence and\njumping of the droplets. The effect of elasticity and shear-thinning on the\ncoalescence and jumping is investigated at capillary-inertial and viscous\nregimes. The results reveal that the elasticity of the droplet changes the\nknown capillary-inertial velocity scaling of the Newtonian drops at large\nOhnesorge numbers; the resulting viscoelastic droplet jumps from the surface at\nlarger Ohnesorge numbers than a Newtonian drop, when elasticity gives rise to\nvisible shape oscillations of the merged droplet. The numerical results show\nthat polymer chains are stretched during the coalescence and prior to the\ndeparture of two drops, and the resulting elastic stresses at the interface\ninduce the jumping of the liquid out of the surface.

When the chemical potential approaches the edge of\na Q1D band in a single-band superconductor, the corresponding mean-field\ncritical temperature increases significantly but the superconductivity is\nquenched by fluctuations. However, recent investigation has revealed that when\na Q1D band is coupled to a higher dimensional one by the interband Cooper-pair\ntransfer, the thermal superconductive fluctuations can be suppressed so that\nthe resulting critical temperature can be close to its mean-field value.

The probability of\nfull disruptions by supermassive black hole binaries can be enhanced by up to a\nfactor of $40-50$ or suppressed by up to a factor of $10$, relative to that by\nsingle black holes, depending on the binary parameters. Relativistic effects\nare not important for the primary black hole mass $\\leq 10^{7}M_{\\odot}$, but\ncan provide an additional enhancement of the full disruption probability by\nless than a factor of $2-3$ for higher primary black hole masses. We provide a\nfitting formula for the full disruption probability by the hard supermassive\nblack hole binaries that works for a wide range of parameters. We also find\nthat partial disruption events can occur multiple times before full disruptions\nor direct captures, and their probabilities can be greater than that of full\ndisruption events by a factor of three. Because partial disruption events can\ninduce stellar spins and mass loss and change the orbits, it can significantly\naffect the overall full disruption event rate and the shape of the light\ncurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 16:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 09:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

In other words, two types of non-Hermiticity can\ncoexist: one from the bosonic BdG nature and the other from the open quantum\nnature. In this paper, we propose boundary-dependent dynamical instability. We\nfirst define the bosonic dissipative BdG Hamiltonian in terms of Green's\nfunction in Nambu space and discuss the correct particle-hole symmetry of the\ncorresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We then construct a model of the\nboundary-dependent dynamical instability so that it satisfies the correct\nparticle-hole symmetry. In this model, an anomalous term that breaks the\nparticle number conservation represents the non-Hermiticity of the BdG nature,\nwhile a normal term is given by a dissipative Hatano-Nelson model. Thanks to\nthe competition between the two types of non-Hermiticity, the imaginary part of\nthe spectrum can be positive without the help of the amplification of the\nnormal part and the particle-hole band touching that causes the Landau\ninstability. This leads to the boundary-dependent dynamical instability under\nthe non-Hermitian skin effect, -strong dependence of spectra on boundary\nconditions for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians-, of the Bogoliubov spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 19:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 09:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Regulators and standards bodies have made a\nstart by requiring some carbon-related disclosures and proposing others.

This description of the carbon flows\nenabled by the project shall be compatible with existing bank systems that\ntrack cashflows so that carbon flows have equal standing to cash flows. We\ndemonstrate that this transparency alone can align incentives by applying it to\nproject finance examples for power generation and by following through the\nfinancial analysis. The financial requirements to offset costs of carbon flows\nenabled in the future radically change project costs, and risk that assets\nbecome stranded, thus further increasing costs. This observation holds\nwhichever partner in the project bears the enabled-carbon costs. Mitigating\nthese risks requires project re-structuring to include negative emissions\ntechnologies. We also consider that sequestered carbon needs to remain\nsequestered permanently, e.g., for at least one hundred years. We introduce\nmixed financial-physical solutions to minimise this permanence cost, and price\nto them. This complements previous insurance-based proposals with lesser scope.\nFor financial viability we introduce project designs that are financially\nnet-zero, and as a consequence are carbon negative. Thus we see that adoption\nof the Carbon Equivalence Principle for financial products aligns incentives,\nrequires product redesign, and is simply good financial management driving\nsustainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 19:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

In particular, we are interested in the\nfollowing question: what is the maximal noise level $\\sigma^2$, for which the\nsample complexity is essentially the same as when estimating the centers from\nlabeled measurements? To that end, we restrict attention to a Bayesian\nformulation of the problem, where the centers are uniformly distributed on the\nsphere $\\sqrt{d}\\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$.

Dual control theory\naddresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive model\nas stochastic hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using\ninformation gathered during system operation. While able to optimally and\nautomatically trade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is\ncomputationally intractable for general interactive motion planning, mainly due\nto the fundamental coupling between robot trajectory optimization and human\nintent inference. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic approach to\nenable active uncertainty reduction for interactive motion planning based on\nthe implicit dual control paradigm.

Therefore, there is a need to develop interactive systems that\ncould replicate a more realistic and easier human-machine interaction. On the\nother hand, developers and researchers need to be aware of state-of-the-art\nmethodologies being used to achieve this goal. We present this survey to\nprovide researchers with state-of-the-art data fusion technologies implemented\nusing multiple inputs to accomplish a task in the robotic application domain.\nMoreover, the input data modalities are broadly classified into uni-modal and\nmulti-modal systems and their application in myriad industries, including the\nhealth care industry, which contributes to the medical industry's future\ndevelopment. It will help the professionals to examine patients using different\nmodalities. The multi-modal systems are differentiated by a combination of\ninputs used as a single input, e.g., gestures, voice, sensor, and haptic\nfeedback. All these inputs may or may not be fused, which provides another\nclassification of multi-modal systems. The survey concludes with a summary of\ntechnologies in use for multi-modal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 21:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 18:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 18:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

This contrast\nvariation can affect the quality of 2-D class averaging, 3-D ab-initio\nmodeling, and 3-D heterogeneity analysis. Contrast estimation is currently\nperformed during 3-D iterative refinement. As a result, the estimates are not\navailable at the earlier computational stages of class averaging and ab-initio\nmodeling. This paper aims to solve the contrast estimation problem directly\nfrom the picked particle images in the ab-initio stage, without estimating the\n3-D volume, image rotations, or class averages.\n  Methods: The key observation underlying our analysis is that the 2-D\ncovariance matrix of the raw images is related to the covariance of the\nunderlying clean images, the noise variance, and the contrast variability\nbetween images. We show that the contrast variability can be derived from the\n2-D covariance matrix and we apply the existing Covariance Wiener Filtering\n(CWF) framework to estimate it. We also demonstrate a modification of CWF to\nestimate the contrast of individual images.\n  Results: Our method improves the contrast estimation by a large margin,\ncompared to the previous CWF method. Its estimation accuracy is often\ncomparable to that of an oracle that knows the ground truth covariance of the\nclean images. The more accurate contrast estimation also improves the quality\nof image restoration as demonstrated in both synthetic and experimental\ndatasets.\n  Conclusions: This paper proposes an effective method for contrast estimation\ndirectly from noisy images without using any 3-D volume information. It enables\ncontrast correction in the earlier stage of single particle analysis, and may\nimprove the accuracy of downstream processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 21:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In contrast,\nfast-neutrons are much more penetrating and can escape relatively thick high-Z\nshielding without losing significant energy. Furthermore, fast neutrons provide\na clear and unambiguous signature of the presence of SNM with few competing\nnatural background sources. The challenge of detecting fast neutrons is\ntwofold. First, the neutron flux from SNM are only a fraction of the\ncorresponding gamma-ray flux. Second, fast neutrons can be difficult to\ndifferentiate from gamma rays. The ability to discriminate gamma rays from\nneutrons combined with neutron imaging can yield large benefit to isolate the\nlocalized SNM neutron source from background. With the recent developments of\npulse-shape-sensitive plastic scintillators that offer excellent\ngamma-ray/neutron discrimination, and arrays of silicon photomultipliers\ncombined with highly scalable and fast positron-emission-tomography (PET)\nmulti-channel readout systems, field-deployable neutron imagers suitable for\nSNM detection might now be within reach. In this paper, we present a\ncharacterization of the performance of a recently available commercial\nPET-scanner readout, including its sensitivity to pulse-shape differences\nbetween fast neutrons and gamma rays, energy and timing resolution, as well as\nlinearity and dynamic range. We find that, while the pulse-shape discrimination\nis achievable with stilbene, further improvement of the readout is required to\nachieve it with the best available plastic scintillators. The time and energy\nresolution appear to be adequate for neutron imaging in some circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 22:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

We detect CIV 1550 emission in all LyC emitters with\nescape fractions fesc $> 0.1$ and find a tentative increase in the flux ratio\nCIV 1550/ CIII] 1909 with fesc. Based on the data, we propose a new criterion\nto select and classify strong leakers (galaxies with fesc $> 0.1$): CIV 1550/\nCIII] 1909 $> 0.75$. Finally, we also find HeII 1640 emission in all the strong\nleakers with equivalent widths from 3 to 8 Ang rest frame. These are among the\nhighest values observed in star-forming galaxies and are primarily due to a\nhigh rate of ionizing photon production. The nebular HeII 1640 emission of the\nstrong LyC emitters does not require harder ionizing spectra at $>54$ eV\ncompared to those of typical star-forming galaxies at similarly low\nmetallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 22:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

In this paper, we highlight a counterintuitive\nproperty of such models and discuss the policy implications of this property.\nNamely, these generative models have an unusual combination of predictable loss\non a broad training distribution (as embodied in their \"scaling laws\"), and\nunpredictable specific capabilities, inputs, and outputs. We believe that the\nhigh-level predictability and appearance of useful capabilities drives rapid\ndevelopment of such models, while the unpredictable qualities make it difficult\nto anticipate the consequences of model deployment. We go through examples of\nhow this combination can lead to socially harmful behavior with examples from\nthe literature and real world observations, and we also perform two novel\nexperiments to illustrate our point about harms from unpredictability.\nFurthermore, we analyze how these conflicting properties combine to give model\ndevelopers various motivations for deploying these models, and challenges that\ncan hinder deployment. We conclude with a list of possible interventions the AI\ncommunity may take to increase the chance of these models having a beneficial\nimpact. We intend this paper to be useful to policymakers who want to\nunderstand and regulate AI systems, technologists who care about the potential\npolicy impact of their work, and academics who want to analyze, critique, and\npotentially develop large generative models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 23:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 21:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Motivated by the above consideration, this paper exploits\ncontent caching in vehicular edge networks (VENs) with a software-defined\nuser-centric virtual cell (VC) based RAT solution for delivering the requested\ncontents from a proximity edge server. Moreover, to capture the heterogeneous\ndemands of the CVs, we introduce a preference-popularity tradeoff in their\ncontent request model. To that end, we formulate a joint optimization problem\nfor content placement, CV scheduling, VC configuration, VC-CV association and\nradio resource allocation to minimize long-term content delivery delay.\nHowever, the joint problem is highly complex and cannot be solved efficiently\nin polynomial time. As such, we decompose the original problem into a cache\nplacement problem and a content delivery delay minimization problem given the\ncache placement policy.

Complete leverage of these image\ntokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in\nMHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or\ndistractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT\npredictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the\nfeed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during\ntraining. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens\nbetween MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by\nthe corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by\npreserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite\nsubsequent MHSA and FFN computations.

Here, we investigate the winds of O and B stars in the\nMilky Way (MW) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We gathered a sample of 96\nstars analyzed by means of the NLTE code CMFGEN. We explored their wind\nstrengths and terminal velocities to address the $Z$ dependence, over a large\nluminosity range. The empirical wind-luminosity relation (WLR) obtained updates\nand extends previous results in the literature. It reveals a luminosity and $Z$\ndependence, in agreement with the radiatively driven wind theory. For bright\nobjects ($\\log L/L_\\odot \\gtrsim 5.4$), we infer that $\\dot{M} \\sim\nZ^{0.5-0.8}$.

A popular verification scheme known as $f$-routing\ninvolves requiring the prover to redirect a quantum system based on the value\nof a Boolean function $f$. Cheating strategies for the $f$-routing scheme\nrequire the prover use pre-shared entanglement, and security of the scheme\nrests on assumptions about how much entanglement a prover can manipulate. Here,\nwe give a new cheating strategy in which the quantum system is encoded into a\nsecret-sharing scheme, and the authorization structure of the secret-sharing\nscheme is exploited to direct the system appropriately. This strategy completes\nthe $f$-routing task using $O(SP_p(f))$ EPR pairs, where $SP_p(f)$ is the\nminimal size of a span program over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ computing $f$.\nThis shows we can efficiently attack $f$-routing schemes whenever $f$ is in the\ncomplexity class $\\text{Mod}_p\\text{L}$, after allowing for local\npre-processing.

With the increasing prevalence of CNNs in\nself-driving cars, it is vital to ensure these algorithms are robust to prevent\ncollisions from occurring due to failure in recognizing a situation. In the\nAdversarial Self-Driving framework, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is\nimplemented to generate realistic perturbations in an image that cause a\nclassifier CNN to misclassify data. This perturbed data is then used to train\nthe classifier CNN further. The Adversarial Self-driving framework is applied\nto an image classification algorithm to improve the classification accuracy on\nperturbed images and is later applied to train a self-driving car to drive in a\nsimulation. A small-scale self-driving car is also built to drive around a\ntrack and classify signs. The Adversarial Self-driving framework produces\nperturbed images through learning a dataset, as a result removing the need to\ntrain on significant amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the\nAdversarial Self-driving framework identifies situations where CNNs are\nvulnerable to perturbations and generates new examples of these situations for\nthe CNN to train on. The additional data generated by the Adversarial\nSelf-driving framework provides sufficient data for the CNN to generalize to\nthe environment. Therefore, it is a viable tool to increase the resilience of\nCNNs to perturbations. Particularly, in the real-world self-driving car, the\napplication of the Adversarial Self-Driving framework resulted in an 18 %\nincrease in accuracy, and the simulated self-driving model had no collisions in\n30 minutes of driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 01:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Our work\nprovides the first experimental evidence for 2D WTIs, which significantly\nadvances our understanding on the strong and weak nature of topological\ninsulators, the robustness of flat bands, and the itinerant and anisotropic\nfeature of Dirac cones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 01:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

I discuss the early\nhistory of this notion of quantization with emphasis on the works of\nSchr\\\"odinger and Dirac, and how quantization fit into their overall\nunderstanding of quantum theory in the 1920's. Dirac, in particular, proposed a\nquantization map which should satisfy certain properties, including the\nproperty that quantum commutators should be related to classical Poisson\nbrackets in a particular way. However, in 1946, Groenewold proved that Dirac's\nmapping was inconsistent, making the problem of defining a rigorous\nquantization map more elusive than originally expected. This result, known as\nthe Groenewold-Van Hove theorem, is not often discussed in physics texts, but\nhere I will give an account of the theorem and what it means for potential\n\"corrections\" to Dirac's scheme. Other proposals for quantization have arisen\nover the years, the first major one being that of Weyl in 1927, which was later\ndeveloped by many, including Groenewold, and which has since become known as\nWeyl Quantization in the mathematical literature. Another, known as Geometric\nQuantization, formulates quantization in differential-geometric terms by\nappealing to the character of classical phase spaces as symplectic manifolds;\nthis approach began with the work of Souriau, Kostant, and Kirillov in the\n1960's. I will describe these proposals for quantization and comment on their\nrelation to Dirac's original program.

Here we propose and realize the orbit-transfer torque (OTT), that\nis, exerting torque on the magnetization using the orbital magnetic moments,\nand thus demonstrate a new strategy for current-driven PM reversal without\nexternal magnetic field. The perpendicular polarization of orbital magnetic\nmoments is generated by a direct current in a few-layer WTe2 due to the\nexistence of nonzero Berry curvature dipole, and the polarization direction can\nbe switched by changing the current polarity. Guided by this principle, we\nconstruct the WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructures, where the OTT driven field-free\ndeterministic switching of PM is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 03:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Though\nDP-RTF fully encodes the sound spatial cues and serves as a reliable\nlocalization feature, it is often erroneously estimated in the presence of\nnoise and reverberation. This paper proposes to learn DP-RTF with deep neural\nnetworks for robust binaural sound source localization. A DP-RTF learning\nnetwork is designed to regress the binaural sensor signals to a real-valued\nrepresentation of DP-RTF. It consists of a branched convolutional neural\nnetwork module to separately extract the inter-channel magnitude and phase\npatterns, and a convolutional recurrent neural network module for joint feature\nlearning. To better explore the speech spectra to aid the DP-RTF estimation, a\nmonaural speech enhancement network is used to recover the direct-path\nspectrograms from the noisy ones. The enhanced spectrograms are stacked onto\nthe noisy spectrograms to act as the input of the DP-RTF learning network. We\ntrain one unique DP-RTF learning network using many different binaural arrays\nto enable the generalization of DP-RTF learning across arrays. This way avoids\ntime-consuming training data collection and network retraining for a new array,\nwhich is very useful in practical application. Experimental results on both\nsimulated and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed method for\ndirection of arrival (DOA) estimation in the noisy and reverberant environment,\nand a good generalization ability to unseen binaural arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 03:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

To avoid the\nassignment ambiguity and the problem of uncertain output-dimension encountered\nwhen simultaneously predicting multiple targets, the learning target is\ndesigned in a weighted sum format, which encodes source activity in the weight\nand direct-path phase differences in the summed value. The learned direct-path\nphase differences for all microphone pairs can be directly used to construct\nthe spatial spectrum according to the formulation of steered response power\n(SRP).

In rural areas, the predation motives of perpetrators can explain the\npositive relationship between prices and conflict. Predation happens at places\nand in periods where and when spoils to be appropriated are available. In\npredominantly agrarian societies, such opportune times align with the harvest\nseason. Does the seasonality of agricultural income lead to the seasonality of\nconflict? We address this question by analyzing over 55 thousand incidents\ninvolving violence against civilians staged by paramilitary groups across\nAfrica during the 1997-2020 period. We investigate the crop year pattern of\nviolence in response to agricultural income shocks via changes in international\ncereal prices. We find that a year-on-year one standard deviation annual growth\nof the price of the major cereal grain results in a harvest-time spike in\nviolence by militias in a one-degree cell where this cereal grain is grown.\nThis translates to a nearly ten percent increase in violence during the early\npostharvest season. We observe no such change in violence by state forces or\nrebel groups--the other two notable actors. By further investigating the\nmechanisms, we show that the violence by militias is amplified after plausibly\nrich harvest seasons when the value of spoils to be appropriated is higher. By\nfocusing on harvest-related seasonality of conflict, as well as actors more\nlikely to be involved in violence against civilians, we contribute to the\ngrowing literature on the economic causes of conflict in predominantly agrarian\nsocieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 05:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 23:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 03:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 10:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

With the vast advances of artificial neural networks (NNs), many\nresearchers recently turned to data-driven approaches to solving the IK\nproblem. Unfortunately, NNs become inadequate for robotic arms with redundant\nDegrees-of-Freedom (DoFs). This is because such arms may have multiple angle\nsolutions to reach the same desired pose, while typical NNs only implement\none-to-one mapping functions, which associate just one consistent output for a\ngiven input.

To better separate the imprints of density and velocity\nfluctuations to the channel maps, a new theory-based technique, the Velocity\nDecomposition Algorithm (VDA,Yuen et.al 2021), has been created. The technique\ndemonstrates that the intensity fluctuations are separated into a component pv\nthat mostly arises from velocity fluctuations and pd that mostly arise from\ndensity fluctuations. The VDA helps to clarify the nature of the filamentary\nstructure observed in channel maps. A recent publication (Kalberla et.al\n2022,K22) claims that the application of VDA to HI4PI data provides negative\ncorrelation of pv and pd,which according to the authors invalidates the\ntechnique since it requires that pv and pd have zero correlation. However, the\nquantities pv and pd given by VDA are naturally orthogonal which can be\ntrivially checked analytically or numerically. That means the correct\napplication of the VDA to any data must provide zero correlation. This is the\npoint that we clarify in this paper and search for the cause of the mistake in\nthe application of the VDA in K22 that resulted in the erroneous conclusion.

BOS is a simple image-based measurement technique that detects the\napparent displacement (local distortion) of a background image caused by the\ndensity gradient of the fluid in front of the background. The cross-correlation\nparticle image velocimetry (PIV) method, which is commonly employed in the BOS\ntechnique for detecting the apparent displacement, uses a random-dot\nbackground, whereas FCD uses a periodic pattern as the background (e.g.,\ncheckerboard pattern, lattice grid pattern (grid scale)) to detect the apparent\ndisplacement as the phase change of the pattern in the Fourier space. In this\nstudy, we measured the apparent displacement, which is proportional to density\ngradient of fluid, of an underwater shock wave using FCD and PIV. The results\nshowed that FCD can measure a displacement gradient of up to 2.5 times larger\nthan that which PIV can measure. Furthermore, we systematically investigated\nthe measurement limit of FCD-BOS by changing several parameters of the periodic\npatterns, such as the grid size. Also, we explored the related parameters in\nthe Fourier space to understand the limitations. It is worth noting that\nFCD-BOS with lattice grid pattern (grid scale) can measure the apparent\ndisplacement as accurately as that with a custom-made pattern, indicating that\nlarge density-gradient fields of fluids can be measured using a simple setup\nwith a commercially available (inexpensive) pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 06:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

The\nmultipartite entanglement is quantified by quantum Fisher information with the\ngenerator defined as the operator of the ferromagnetic order parameter due to\nthe system symmetry.

We introduce Aryl, a new cluster scheduler to address\nthese problems. Aryl introduces capacity loaning to loan idle inference GPU\nservers for training jobs. It further exploits elastic scaling that scales a\ntraining job's GPU allocation to better utilize loaned resources. Capacity\nloaning and elastic scaling create new challenges to cluster management.

We aim to elucidate these effects by performing\na comprehensive study of the temperature dependence of LSSE in biphase iron\noxide (BPIO = alpha-Fe2O3 + Fe3O4) thin films grown on Si (100) and Al2O3 (111)\nsubstrates. A combination of temperature-dependent anomalous Nernst effect\n(ANE) and electrical resistivity measurements show that the contribution of ANE\nfrom the BPIO layer is negligible compared to the intrinsic LSSE in the\nSi/BPIO/Pt heterostructure even at room temperature. Below the Verwey\ntransition of the Fe3O4 phase, the total signal across BPIO/Pt is dominated by\nthe LSSE. Noticeable changes in the intrinsic LSSE signal for both Si/BPIO/Pt\nand Al2O3/BPIO/Pt heterostructures around the Verwey transition of the Fe3O4\nphase and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Morin transition of the alpha-Fe2O3 phase\nare observed. The LSSE signal for Si/BPIO/Pt is found to be almost two times\ngreater than that for Al2O3/BPIO/Pt, an opposite trend is observed for the\nsaturation magnetization though. Magnetic force microscopy reveals the higher\ndensity of surface magnetic moments of the Si/BPIO film compared to the\nAl2O3/BPIO film, which underscores a dominant role of interfacial magnetism on\nthe LSSE signal and thereby explains the larger LSSE for Si/BPIO/Pt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 07:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

The hybrid learning model shows promising results in\nexperiments.

In-situ proton observations from a few\nMeV to $\\sim$500 MeV were combined with the detection of a solar flare in soft\nX-rays (SXRs), a coronal mass ejection (CME), radio bursts and extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) observations to identify the solar origin of the GLE. Timing\nanalysis was performed and a relation to the solar sources was outlined.\nResults. GLE73 reached a maximum particle rigidity of $\\sim$2.4 GV and is\nassociated with type III, type II, type IV radio bursts and an EUV wave. A\ndiversity of time profiles recorded by NMs was observed. This points to an\nanisotropic nature of the event. The peak flux at E$>$10 MeV was only $\\sim$30\npfu and remained at this level for several days. The release time of $\\geq$1 GV\nparticles was found to be $\\sim$15:40 UT. GLE73 had a moderately hard rigidity\nspectrum at very high energies ($\\gamma$ $\\sim$5.5). Comparison of GLE73 to\nprevious GLEs with similar solar drivers is performed\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In this paper, we propose a dual-branch federative magnitude\nand phase estimation framework, dubbed DBT-Net, for monaural speech\nenhancement, aiming at recovering the coarse- and fine-grained regions of the\noverall spectrum in parallel. From the complementary perspective, the magnitude\nestimation branch is designed to filter out dominant noise components in the\nmagnitude domain, while the complex spectrum purification branch is elaborately\ndesigned to inpaint the missing spectral details and implicitly estimate the\nphase information in the complex-valued spectral domain. To facilitate the\ninformation flow between each branch, interaction modules are introduced to\nleverage features learned from one branch, so as to suppress the undesired\nparts and recover the missing components of the other branch. Instead of\nadopting the conventional RNNs and temporal convolutional networks for sequence\nmodeling, we employ a novel attention-in-attention transformer-based network\nwithin each branch for better feature learning.

The\nmain aim of this investigation is to perform a new and accurate abundance\nanalysis of two tens of calibrating Galactic Cepheids using high spectral\nresolution (R$\\sim$40,000-115,000) and high S/N spectra ($\\sim$400) covering\nthe entire pulsation cycle. We focus our attention on possible systematics\naffecting the estimate of atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances along\nthe pulsation cycle. We cleaned the line list by using atomic transition\nparameters based on laboratory measurements and by removing lines that are\neither blended or display abundance variations along the pulsation cycle.

We also provide new and accurate\neffective temperature templates by splitting the calibrating Cepheids into four\ndifferent period bins, ranging from short to long periods. For each period bin,\nwe performed an analytical fit with Fourier series providing $\\theta =\n5040/{T_{\\rm eff}}$ as a function of the pulsation phase.

To\ndeal with ACR, existing work is to serialize the abstract syntax tree (AST).\nHowever, making sense of the whole AST with sequence encoding approach is a\ndaunting task, mostly due to some redundant nodes in AST hinder the\ntransmission of node information. Not to mention that the serialized\nrepresentation is inadequate to grasp the information of tree structure in AST.\nIn this paper, we first present a new large-scale Apache Automatic Code Review\n(AACR) dataset for ACR task since there is still no publicly available dataset\nin this task. The release of this dataset would push forward the research in\nthis field. Based on it, we propose a novel Simplified AST based Graph\nConvolutional Network (SimAST-GCN) to deal with ACR task. Concretely, to\nimprove the efficiency of node information dissemination, we first simplify the\nAST of code by deleting the redundant nodes that do not contain connection\nattributes, and thus deriving a Simplified AST. Then, we construct a relation\ngraph for each code based on the Simplified AST to properly embody the\nrelations among code fragments of the tree structure into the graph.\nSubsequently, in the light of the merit of graph structure, we explore a graph\nconvolution networks architecture that follows an attention mechanism to\nleverage the crucial implications of code fragments to derive code\nrepresentations. Finally, we exploit a simple but effective subtraction\noperation in the representations between the original and revised code,\nenabling the revised difference to be preferably learned for deciding the\nresults of ACR.

We find an anomalous Bloch\noscillation in such edge bands, in which the flat dispersion freezes electron\nmotion along the field direction, while the topological connection of the bands\nthrough the bulk leads to electron oscillation in the transverse direction\nbetween edges of different configurations on opposite sides/layers of a bilayer\nribbon.

Early detection of AMD is of great\nimportance, as the vision loss caused by this disease is irreversible and\npermanent. Color fundus photography is the most cost-effective imaging modality\nto screen for retinal disorders. Cutting edge deep learning based algorithms\nhave been recently developed for automatically detecting AMD from fundus\nimages. However, there are still lack of a comprehensive annotated dataset and\nstandard evaluation benchmarks. To deal with this issue, we set up the\nAutomatic Detection challenge on Age-related Macular degeneration (ADAM), which\nwas held as a satellite event of the ISBI 2020 conference. The ADAM challenge\nconsisted of four tasks which cover the main aspects of detecting and\ncharacterizing AMD from fundus images, including detection of AMD, detection\nand segmentation of optic disc, localization of fovea, and detection and\nsegmentation of lesions. As part of the challenge, we have released a\ncomprehensive dataset of 1200 fundus images with AMD diagnostic labels,\npixel-wise segmentation masks for both optic disc and AMD-related lesions\n(drusen, exudates, hemorrhages and scars, among others), as well as the\ncoordinates corresponding to the location of the macular fovea. A uniform\nevaluation framework has been built to make a fair comparison of different\nmodels using this dataset. During the challenge, 610 results were submitted for\nonline evaluation, with 11 teams finally participating in the onsite challenge.\nThis paper introduces the challenge, the dataset and the evaluation methods, as\nwell as summarizes the participating methods and analyzes their results for\neach task.

Although booming with a vast number of emerging methods and\ntechniques, most of the literature is built on the in-distribution hypothesis,\ni.e., testing and training graph data are identically distributed. However,\nthis in-distribution hypothesis can hardly be satisfied in many real-world\ngraph scenarios where the model performance substantially degrades when there\nexist distribution shifts between testing and training graph data. To solve\nthis critical problem, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs,\nwhich goes beyond the in-distribution hypothesis, has made great progress and\nattracted ever-increasing attention from the research community. In this paper,\nwe comprehensively survey OOD generalization on graphs and present a detailed\nreview of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal problem\ndefinition of OOD generalization on graphs. Second, we categorize existing\nmethods into three classes from conceptually different perspectives, i.e.,\ndata, model, and learning strategy, based on their positions in the graph\nmachine learning pipeline, followed by detailed discussions for each category.\nWe also review the theories related to OOD generalization on graphs and\nintroduce the commonly used graph datasets for thorough evaluations. Finally,\nwe share our insights on future research directions.

Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently\nobserved in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class.\nFor example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate\nthe rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission.\nPeriodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently\nreported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery\nof FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced\nby 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important\nclues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that\nof FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the\nmain FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A\ncomponents to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these\nagainst the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with\nsub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from\nrepeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the\nperiodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5$\\sigma$. Its\nrepeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the\nrequired spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star\nequations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict\nwith a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could,\nhowever, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a\nmagnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the\nsmallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star\nrotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 11:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

It maps nonlinear\nsystems into equivalent linear systems in embedding space, ready for real-time\nlinear control methods. However, designing an appropriate Koopman embedding\nfunction remains a challenging task. Furthermore, most Koopman-based algorithms\nonly consider nonlinear systems with linear control input, resulting in lousy\nprediction and control performance when the system is fully nonlinear with the\ncontrol input. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework\nto learn the Koopman embedding function and Koopman Operator together to\nalleviate such difficulties. We first parameterize the embedding function and\nKoopman Operator with the neural network and train them end-to-end with the\nK-steps loss function. Then, an auxiliary control network is augmented to\nencode the nonlinear state-dependent control term to model the nonlinearity in\nthe control input.

These semantics decouple the\nevaluation in the local environments from the evaluation in the global\nenvironment by generating abstract, symbolic traces for the individual, local\nsystems. The traces are then composed and concretized, resulting in global\ntraces for the global system. Hence, these semantics are called Locally\nAbstract, Globally Concrete (LAGC).\n  In this work, we present a formalization of the LAGC semantics in the popular\ntheorem proving environment Isabelle/HOL.

Existing FL methods\nusually assume the global model can be trained on any participating client.\nHowever, in real applications, the devices of clients are usually\nheterogeneous, and have different computing power. Although big models like\nBERT have achieved huge success in AI, it is difficult to apply them to\nheterogeneous FL with weak clients. The straightforward solutions like removing\nthe weak clients or using a small model to fit all clients will lead to some\nproblems, such as under-representation of dropped clients and inferior accuracy\ndue to data loss or limited model representation ability. In this work, we\npropose InclusiveFL, a client-inclusive federated learning method to handle\nthis problem. The core idea of InclusiveFL is to assign models of different\nsizes to clients with different computing capabilities, bigger models for\npowerful clients and smaller ones for weak clients. We also propose an\neffective method to share the knowledge among multiple local models with\ndifferent sizes. In this way, all the clients can participate in the model\nlearning in FL, and the final model can be big and powerful enough.

A big share of PPM approaches adopts a Machine Learning\n(ML) technique to address a prediction task, especially non-process-aware PPM\napproaches. Consequently, PPM inherits the challenges faced by ML approaches.\nOne of these challenges concerns the need to gain user trust in the predictions\ngenerated. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses\nthis issue. However, the choices made, and the techniques employed in a PPM\ntask, in addition to ML model characteristics, influence resulting\nexplanations.

An asymptotically\npivotal test is proposed, which does not require the estimation of nuisance\nparameters and long-run covariances.

It is cost\neffective, hazardless, portable and implemented routinely in numerous clinical\nprocedures. Nonetheless, image quality is characterized by granulated\nappearance, poor SNR and speckle noise. Specific for malignant tumors, the\nmargins are blurred and indistinct. Thus, there is a great need for improving\nultrasound image quality. We hypothesize that this can be achieved, using\nneural networks, by translation into a more realistic display which mimics an\nanatomical cut through the tissue. In order to achieve this goal, the\npreferable approach would be to use a set of paired images. However, this is\npractically impossible in our case. Therefore, Cycle Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (CycleGAN) was used, in order to learn each domain properties\nseparately and enforce cross domain cycle consistency. The two datasets which\nwere used for training the model were \"Breast Ultrasound Images\" (BUSI) and a\nset of optic images of poultry breast tissue samples acquired at our lab. The\ngenerated pseudo anatomical images provide improved visual discrimination of\nthe lesions with clearer border definition and pronounced contrast. In order to\nevaluate the preservation of the anatomical features, the lesions in the\nultrasonic images and the generated pseudo anatomical images were both\nautomatically segmented and compared. This comparison yielded median dice score\nof 0.91 for the benign tumors and 0.70 for the malignant ones. The median\nlesion center error was 0.58% and 3.27% for the benign and malignancies\nrespectively and the median area error index was 0.40% and 4.34% for the benign\nand malignancies respectively. In conclusion, these generated pseudo anatomical\nimages, which are presented in a more intuitive way, enhance tissue anatomy and\ncan potentially simplify the diagnosis and improve the clinical outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 10:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

One of the best existing methods for this task, in terms of accuracy\nand computation time, is MiniROCKET. In this work, we extend this approach to\nprovide better global temporal encodings using hyperdimensional computing (HDC)\nmechanisms. HDC (also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures, VSA) is a general\nmethod to explicitly represent and process information in high-dimensional\nvectors. It has previously been used successfully in combination with deep\nneural networks and other signal processing algorithms. We argue that the\ninternal high-dimensional representation of MiniROCKET is well suited to be\ncomplemented by the algebra of HDC. This leads to a more general formulation,\nHDC-MiniROCKET, where the original algorithm is only a special case. We will\ndiscuss and demonstrate that HDC-MiniROCKET can systematically overcome\ncatastrophic failures of MiniROCKET on simple synthetic datasets. These results\nare confirmed by experiments on the 128 datasets from the UCR time series\nclassification benchmark. The extension with HDC can achieve considerably\nbetter results on datasets with high temporal dependence without increasing the\ncomputational effort for inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

Consequently, the threats of GIA can be easily alleviated or even\nprevented by homophily-based defenses designed to recover the original\nhomophily. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a novel constraint -- homophily\nunnoticeability that enforces GIA to preserve the homophily, and propose\nHarmonious Adversarial Objective (HAO) to instantiate it.

There is, however, a lack of\nsimulated results from the theory of holonomic control of quantum registers\nwith more than two qubits describing the transition between the dark states. In\nlight of this, we have been experimenting with the IBM Quantum Experience\ntechnology to determine the capabilities of simulating holonomic control of\nNV-centers for three qubits describing an eight-level system that produces a\nnon-Abelian geometric phase. The tunability of the geometric phase via the\ndetuning frequency is demonstrated through the high fidelity (about 80%) of\n3-qubit off-resonant holonomic gates over the on-resonant ones. The transition\nbetween the dark states shows the alignment of the gate dark state with the\nqubits initial state hence decoherence of the multi-qubit system is\nwell-controlled through a 0.33pi rotation. The electron return probability can\nexhibit spin-orbit coupling-like behavior as observed in topological materials\nbased on the extra geometric phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

In the\n$(k,K)$-gap edit distance problem the task is to distinguish whether the edit\ndistance of two strings is at most $k$ or at least $K$.

One of the most natural questions\nin this line of research is whether the $(k,k^2)$-gap is best-possible for the\nrunning time $\\widetilde O(n/k+\\operatorname{poly}(k))$.\n  In this work we answer this question by significantly improving the gap.\nSpecifically, we show that in time $O(n/k+\\operatorname{poly}(k))$ we can even\nsolve the $(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem. This is the first algorithm that breaks\nthe $(k,k^2)$-gap in this running time. Our algorithm is almost optimal in the\nfollowing sense: In the low distance regime ($k\\le n^{0.19}$) our running time\nbecomes $O(n/k)$, which matches a known $n/k^{1+o(1)}$ lower bound for the\n$(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem up to lower order factors.\n  Our result also reveals a surprising similarity of Hamming distance and edit\ndistance in the low distance regime: For both, the $(k,k^{1+o(1)})$-gap problem\nhas time complexity $n/k^{1\\pm o(1)}$ for small $k$.\n  In contrast to previous work, which employed a subsampled variant of the\nLandau-Vishkin algorithm, we instead build upon the algorithm of Andoni,\nKrauthgamer and Onak (FOCS '10).

Focusing on image classification, we show\nthat neural networks also unintentionally memorise unique features even when\nthey occur only once in training data. An example of a unique feature is a\nperson's name that is accidentally present on a training image. Assuming access\nto the inputs and outputs of a trained model, the domain of the training data,\nand knowledge of unique features, we develop a score estimating the model's\nsensitivity to a unique feature by comparing the KL divergences of the model's\noutput distributions given modified out-of-distribution images.

The\nbasic idea behind this work is to (i) formulate fault detection and isolation\nas projection of measurement signals onto (system) subspaces in Hilbert space,\nand (ii) solve the resulting problems by means of projection methods with\northogonal projection operators and gap metric as major tools. In the new\nframework, fault diagnosis issues are uniformly addressed both in the\nmodel-based and data-driven fashions. Moreover, the design and implementation\nof the projection-based fault diagnosis systems, from residual generation to\nthreshold setting, can be unifiedly handled. Thanks to the well-defined\ndistance metric for projections in Hilbert subspaces, the projection-based\nfault diagnosis systems deliver optimal fault detectability. In particular, a\nnew type of residual-driven thresholds is proposed, which significantly\nincreases the fault detectability.

We characterise\nextensional reflexivity in compact closed categories, and consider how this may\nbe `strictified' to give monoidally equivalent categories where the\nisomorphisms exhibiting reflexivity are identity arrows.\n  This results in two-object compact closed categories consisting of a unit\nobject, and a non-unit extensionally reflexive object.\n  We study the endomorphism monoids of such `strictly extensionally reflexive'\nobjects from an algebraic viewpoint. They necessarily contain an interesting\nmonoid that may be thought of as Richard Thompson's iconic group F together\nwith the equally iconic bicyclic monoid of semigroup theory, with non-trivial\ninteractions between the two derived from the Frobenius algebra identity. We\nclaim this as a significant example of the (unitless) Frobenius algebras of\nAbramsky and Heunen.\n  We then give concrete examples, based on the algebra and category theory\nbehind the Geometry of Interaction program. These are based on the traced\nmonoidal category of partial injections, and reflexive objects in the compact\nclosed category that results from applying the Int or GoI construction. We give\ncompact closed categories, monoidally equivalent to compact closed\nsubcategories of Int(pInj), where this reflexivity is exhibited by identity\narrows, and show how the above algebraic structures (Thompson's F, the bicyclic\nmonoid, and Frobenius algebras) arise in a fundamental manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 15:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

However, current methods\nare insufficient to enable this optimization and lead to a large degradation in\nmodel performance. In this paper, we identify a fundamental limitation in the\nformulation of current methods, namely that their saliency criteria look at a\nsingle step at the start of training without taking into account the\ntrainability of the network. While pruning iteratively and gradually has been\nshown to improve pruning performance, explicit consideration of the training\nstage that will immediately follow pruning has so far been absent from the\ncomputation of the saliency criterion. To overcome the short-sightedness of\nexisting methods, we propose Prospect Pruning (ProsPr), which uses\nmeta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which\nweights to prune. ProsPr combines an estimate of the higher-order effects of\npruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable\nsub-network.

So far, state-of-the-art approaches completely rely on the\navailability of a ground-truth supervision signal, obtained via manual\nannotation, thus expensive to collect at large scale. In this paper, we present\nFUN-SIS, a Fully-UNsupervised approach for binary Surgical Instrument\nSegmentation. FUN-SIS trains a per-frame segmentation model on completely\nunlabelled endoscopic videos, by solely relying on implicit motion information\nand instrument shape-priors. We define shape-priors as realistic segmentation\nmasks of the instruments, not necessarily coming from the same dataset/domain\nas the videos. The shape-priors can be collected in various and convenient\nways, such as recycling existing annotations from other datasets. We leverage\nthem as part of a novel generative-adversarial approach, allowing to perform\nunsupervised instrument segmentation of optical-flow images during training. We\nthen use the obtained instrument masks as pseudo-labels in order to train a\nper-frame segmentation model; to this aim, we develop a\nlearning-from-noisy-labels architecture, designed to extract a clean\nsupervision signal from these pseudo-labels, leveraging their peculiar noise\nproperties.

It finds applications in customer and/or\nrepresentative behavior analysis in call centers, gaming, personal assistants,\nand social robots, to mention a few. Therefore, there has been an increasing\ndemand to develop robust automatic methods to analyze and recognize the various\nemotions. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based emotion recognition\nframework that uses a late fusion of transfer-learned and fine-tuned models\nfrom speech and text modalities. More specifically, we i) adapt a residual\nnetwork (ResNet) based model trained on a large-scale speaker recognition task\nusing transfer learning along with a spectrogram augmentation approach to\nrecognize emotions from speech, and ii) use a fine-tuned bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformers (BERT) based model to represent and recognize\nemotions from the text. The proposed system then combines the ResNet and\nBERT-based model scores using a late fusion strategy to further improve the\nemotion recognition performance. The proposed multimodal solution addresses the\ndata scarcity limitation in emotion recognition using transfer learning, data\naugmentation, and fine-tuning, thereby improving the generalization performance\nof the emotion recognition models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our\nproposed multimodal approach on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture\n(IEMOCAP) dataset.

We model fairness as a linear\noperator whose null space contains the set of strictly {\\it fair} indexes.

How should the human player play against these algorithms to\nmaximize his utility? Does anything change if he faces one or more artificial\nplayers? The main goal of the paper is to answer these two questions. Consider\nn-player games in normal form repeated over time, where we call the human\nplayer optimizer, and the (n -- 1) artificial players, learners. We assume that\nlearners play no-regret algorithms, a class of algorithms widely used in online\nlearning and decision-making. In these games, we consider the concept of\nStackelberg equilibrium. In a recent paper, Deng, Schneider, and Sivan have\nshown that in a 2-player game the optimizer can always guarantee an expected\ncumulative utility of at least the Stackelberg value per round. In our first\nresult, we show, with counterexamples, that this result is no longer true if\nthe optimizer has to face more than one player. Therefore, we generalize the\ndefinition of Stackelberg equilibrium introducing the concept of correlated\nStackelberg equilibrium. Finally, in the main result, we prove that the\noptimizer can guarantee at least the correlated Stackelberg value per round.\nMoreover, using a version of the strong law of large numbers, we show that our\nresult is also true almost surely for the optimizer utility instead of the\noptimizer's expected utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

We\nconsidered two main issues the prediction of good/bad performance and the\nprediction of the final exam grade. To build the proposed model, we evaluated\nthe most popular classification and regression algorithms on data from a data\nstructures and algorithms course (CS2) offered in a large public research\nuniversity. Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression have been\napplied in Regression. While Logistic Regression, decision tree, Random Forest\nClassifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine have been applied\nin classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 11:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

To do\nso, we used APCs information provided by the OpenAPC database, citation scores\nof publications from the WoS database and, for Altmetrics, data from\nAltmetrics.com database, over the period from 2006 to 2019 for 83,752 articles\npublished in 4751 journals belonging to 267 distinct publishers. Results show\nthat contrary to common belief, paying high APCs does not necessarily increase\nthe impact of publications. First, large publishers with high impact are not\nthe most expensive. Second, publishers with the highest APCs are not\nnecessarily the best in terms of impact. Correlation between APCs and impact is\nmoderate. Regarding the determinants, results indicate that APCs are on average\n50% higher in hybrid journals than in full OA journals. The results also\nsuggest that Altmetrics do not have a great impact: OA articles that have\ngarnered the most attention on internet are articles with relatively low APCs.\nAnother interesting result is that the ''number of readers'' indicator is more\neffective as it is more correlated with classic bibliometrics indicators than\nthe Altmetrics score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 12:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 08:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

Edge\ncomputing is a new paradigm to solve these challenges by offloading tasks from\nthe resource-limited vehicles to Edge Servers (ESs) in Road Side Units (RSUs).\nHowever, most of the traditional offloading schedules for vehicular networks\nconcentrate on the edge, while some tasks may be too complex for ESs to\nprocess. To this end, we consider a collaborative vehicular network in which\nthe cloud, edge and terminal can cooperate with each other to accomplish the\ntasks. The vehicles can offload the computation intensive tasks to the cloud to\nsave the resource of edge. We further construct the virtual resource pool which\ncan integrate the resource of multiple ESs since some regions may be covered by\nmultiple RSUs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scenario offloading schedule\nfor biomedical data processing and analysis in Cloud-Edge-Terminal\ncollaborative vehicular networks called MSCET. The parameters of the proposed\nMSCET are optimized to maximize the system utility. We also conduct extensive\nsimulations to evaluate the proposed MSCET and the results illustrate that\nMSCET outperforms other existing schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}
