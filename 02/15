That is, for every such game, there exists a constant\n$c>0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is\nat most $n^{-c}$. Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two\nadditional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer games, that may be of\nindependent interest:\n  Playerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet\nsize): We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every\ngame with value $<1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel\nrepetition of the game decays polynomially fast to 0. More precisely, our\nresult applies for playerwise connected games, with any number of players and\nany alphabet size. The class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger\nthan the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which\nexponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected\ngames that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were\npreviously known [Ver96].\n  Exponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game: In the 3-player\nanti-correlation game, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the\nremaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce\ndifferent outputs in $\\{0,1\\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold\nparallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to 0. Only inverse\nAckermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96]. This game was studied and\nmotivated in several previous works. In particular, Holmgren and Yang gave it\nas an example for a 3-player game whose non-signaling value (is smaller than 1\nand yet) does not decrease at all under parallel repetition [HY19].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 16:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

The best\ncurrent approximation algorithm achieves an $O(n^{1/2-\\varepsilon}\\cdot\n\\text{poly}(\\Delta\\cdot\\log n))$-approximation, for a small fixed constant\n$\\epsilon$, while the best negative result is APX-hardness, leaving a large gap\nin our understanding of this basic problem.

A highly misaligned circumbinary disk around\nthe inner binary is subject to two competing effects: (i) nodal precession\nabout the inner binary eccentricity vector that leads to an increase in\nmisalignment (polar alignment) and (ii) Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations of\neccentricity and inclination driven by the outer companion that leads to a\nreduction in the misalignment. The outcome depends upon the ratio of the\ntimescales of these effects. If the inner binary torque dominates, then the\ndisk aligns to a polar orientation. If the outer companion torque dominates,\nthen the disk undergoes KL oscillations. In that case, the highly eccentric and\nmisaligned disk is disrupted and accreted by the inner binary, while some mass\nis transferred to the outer companion. However, when the torques are similar,\nthe outer parts of the circumbinary disk can undergo large eccentricity\noscillations while the inclination remains close to the polar orientation. The\nrange of initial disk inclinations that evolve to a polar orientation is\nsmaller in the presence of the outer companion. Disk breaking is also more\nlikely, at least temporarily, during the polar alignment process. The stellar\norbits in HD 98800 have parameters such that polar alignment of the\ncircumbinary disk is expected. In the absence of the gas, solid particles are\nunstable at much smaller radii than the gas disk inner tidal truncation radius\nbecause KL driven eccentricity leads to close encounters with the binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 17:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Namely, a generalized MF surrogate model is used for design-space\nexploration, exploiting an arbitrary number of hierarchical fidelity levels,\ni.e., performance evaluations coming from different models, solvers, or\ndiscretizations, characterized by different accuracy. The method is intended to\naccurately predict the design performance while reducing the computational\neffort required by simulation-driven design (SDD) to achieve the global\noptimum. The overall MF prediction is evaluated as a low-fidelity trained\nsurrogate corrected with the surrogates of the errors between consecutive\nfidelity levels. Surrogates are based on stochastic radial basis functions\n(SRBF) with least squares regression and in-the-loop optimization of\nhyperparameters to deal with noisy training data. The method adaptively queries\nnew training data, selecting both the design points and the required fidelity\nlevel via an active learning approach. This is based on the lower confidence\nbounding method, which combines performance prediction and associated\nuncertainty to select the most promising design regions. The fidelity levels\nare selected considering the benefit-cost ratio associated with their use in\nthe training. The method's performance is assessed and discussed using four\nanalytical tests and three SDD problems based on computational fluid dynamics\nsimulations, namely the shape optimization of a NACA hydrofoil, the DTMB 5415\ndestroyer, and a roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry.

Nonetheless,\nthe desired invariant representation is achieved by utilising prior online\ntransformation functions on the input data. As a result, each SSL framework is\ncustomised for a particular data type, e.g., visual data, and further\nmodifications are required if it is used for other dataset types. On the other\nhand, autoencoder (AE), which is a generic and widely applicable framework,\nmainly focuses on dimension reduction and is not suited for learning invariant\nrepresentation. This paper proposes a generic SSL framework based on a\nconstrained self-labelling assignment process that prevents degenerate\nsolutions. Specifically, the prior transformation functions are replaced with a\nself-transformation mechanism, derived through an unsupervised training process\nof adversarial training, for imposing invariant representations. Via the\nself-transformation mechanism, pairs of augmented instances can be generated\nfrom the same input data. Finally, a training objective based on contrastive\nlearning is designed by leveraging both the self-labelling assignment and the\nself-transformation mechanism. Despite the fact that the self-transformation\nprocess is very generic, the proposed training strategy outperforms a majority\nof state-of-the-art representation learning methods based on AE structures. To\nvalidate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on four types of\ndata, namely visual, audio, text, and mass spectrometry data, and compare them\nin terms of four quantitative metrics.

Rapid\nstellar rotation can dramatically change a star's luminosity and spectral\nenergy distribution and, therefore, can impact the habitability of any\nsurrounding planets. Stars of mass $M_\\star\\gtrsim1.3M_\\odot$ commonly rotate\nnear their breakup speeds, which causes two effects relevant to planet\nhabitability. First, these stars flatten into oblate spheroids with shorter\npolar radii and elongated equatorial radii. Second, rapid rotation induces a\npole-to-equator temperature gradient on the surface of these stars. Using a 1D\nclimate model, we calculate the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone of\nwell-known rapid rotators and average theoretical stars in our stellar mass\nrange. We find that, in general, rapid rotation causes the habitable zone to\nreside closer in than for a non-rotating equivalent star. We also find that\ngravity darkening dramatically reduces stellar UV emission, which combats the\ncommon assumption that high-mass stars emit too much UV light for habitable\nworlds.

Such games model a basic clustering or coalition\nformation scenario in which selfish agents are represented by the vertices of\nan edge-weighted digraph $G=(V,E)$, and the weight of an arc $uv$ denotes the\nutility $u$ gains by being in the same coalition as $v$. We focus on (arguably)\nthe most basic stability question about such a game: given a graph, does a Nash\nstable solution exist and can we find it efficiently?\n  We study the (parameterized) complexity of ASHG stability when the underlying\ngraph has treewidth $t$ and maximum degree $\\Delta$. The current best FPT\nalgorithm for this case was claimed by Peters [AAAI 2016], with time complexity\nroughly $2^{O(\\Delta^5t)}$. We present an algorithm with parameter dependence\n$(\\Delta t)^{O(\\Delta t)}$, significantly improving upon the parameter\ndependence on $\\Delta$ given by Peters, albeit with a slightly worse dependence\non $t$. Our main result is that this slight performance deterioration with\nrespect to $t$ is actually completely justified: we observe that the previously\nclaimed algorithm is incorrect, and that in fact no algorithm can achieve\ndependence $t^{o(t)}$ for bounded-degree graphs, unless the ETH fails. This,\ntogether with corresponding bounds we provide on the dependence on $\\Delta$ and\nthe joint parameter establishes that our algorithm is essentially optimal for\nboth parameters, under the ETH.\n  We then revisit the parameterization by treewidth alone and resolve a\nquestion also posed by Peters by showing that Nash Stability remains strongly\nNP-hard on stars under additive preferences. Nevertheless, we also discover an\nisland of mild tractability: we show that Connected Nash Stability is solvable\nin pseudo-polynomial time for constant $t$, though with an XP dependence on $t$\nwhich, as we establish, cannot be avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 18:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

We investigate this hypothesis using the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a sample of 2779 nearby unbarred star-forming\nmain-sequence spiral galaxies. The strength of spiral arms is quantified by\ntheir average Fourier amplitude relative to the axisymmetric disk. The star\nformation properties in the central 1--3\\,kpc region were derived from the SDSS\nspectra. We show that galaxies with stronger spiral arms not only tend to have\nmore intense central specific star formation rate (sSFR), larger Balmer\nabsorption line index, and lower 4000-\\AA\\ break strength, but also have\nenhanced central sSFR relative to sSFR measured for the whole galaxy. This link\nis independent of redshift, stellar mass, surface density, and concentration.\nThere is a lack of evidence for strong spiral arms being associated with a\nsignificant fraction of starburst or post-starburst galaxies, implying that the\nspiral-induced central star formation is likely continuous rather than bursty.\nWe also show that stronger spiral arms tend to have an increasing fraction of\npseudo bulges, a relatively unchanged fraction of star-forming classical\nbulges, and a decreasing fraction of quenched classical bulges. Moreover, the\nconcentration of galaxies hosting pseudo bulges mildly increases with stronger\nspiral arms, implying that spirals help pseudo bulges grow. The connection\nbetween spirals and the bulge type is partly attributed to the suppression of\nspirals by classical bulges and partly to the enhanced central star formation\ndriven by spirals. We explain our results in a picture where spiral arms\ntransport cold gas inward to trigger continuous central star formation, which\nfacilitates the build-up of pseudo bulges. Spiral arms thus play a role in the\nsecular evolution of disk galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 18:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Secondly, the formation of stellar clusters is extremely sensitive to\nthe baryonic physics that govern the properties of the cold, dense gas\nreservoir in the galaxy.

By using\nthe TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project, we show that it is possible\nto infer the unobservable stellar assembly and merger history of central\ngalaxies from their observable properties by using machine learning techniques.\nIn particular, in this first paper of ERGO-ML (Extracting Reality from Galaxy\nObservables with Machine Learning), we choose a set of 7 observable integral\nproperties of galaxies (i.e. total stellar mass, redshift, color, stellar size,\nmorphology, metallicity, and age) to infer, from those, the stellar ex-situ\nfraction, the average merger lookback times and mass ratios, and the lookback\ntime and stellar mass of the last major merger. To do so, we use and compare a\nMultilayer Perceptron Neural Network and a conditional Invertible Neural\nNetwork (cINN): thanks to the latter we are also able to infer the posterior\ndistribution for these parameters and hence estimate the uncertainties in the\npredictions.

The cluster stars are separated into two\ngroups at BP-RP $=2$ or $0.56 M_\\odot$ to give a high mass (${\\bar M} = 0.95\nM_\\odot$) and a low mass (${\\bar M} = 0.32 M_\\odot$) population. We show that:\n(i) the high mass population has a half-mass radius $r_{\\rm h}$ of 4.88 pc,\nwhilst the low mass population has $r_{\\rm h} = 8.10$ pc; (ii) despite the\ndifferences in spatial extent, the kinematics and binarity properties of the\nhigh and low mass populations are similar. They have isotropic velocity\nellipsoids with mean 1d velocity dispersions $\\sigma$ of 0.427 and 0.415 km\ns$^{-1}$ respectively. The dynamical state of the Hyades is far from energy\nequipartition ($\\sigma \\propto {\\bar M}^{-1/2}$). We identify a new mass\nsegregation instability for clusters with escape speed $V$. Populations with\n$V/\\sigma \\lesssim 2\\sqrt{2}$ can never attain thermal equilibrium and\nequipartition. This regime encompasses many Galactic open and globular\nclusters. For the Hyades, there must be an outward energy flux of at least $9.5\n\\times 10^{-4} M_\\odot\\,{\\rm km^2\\, s^{-2} Myr^{-1}}$ to maintain its current\nconfiguration. The present mass loss of $0.26 M_\\odot {\\rm Myr}^{-1}$ due to\ntidal stripping by itself implies a substantial energy flow beyond the required\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Current challenges to state preparation,\nincluding barren plateaus and the high-dimensionality of the optimization\nlandscape, make state preparation through ansatz optimization unreliable. In\nthis work, we introduce the method of ground state boosting, which uses a\nlimited-depth quantum circuit to reliably increase the overlap with the ground\nstate.

The stochastic model displays slow dynamics, including power law\ndecaying autocorrelation functions and hierarchical relaxation processes due to\nexponential localization. Like in other kinetically constrained models, the\nFredkin chain has a rich structure in its dynamical large deviations - which we\ncompute accurately via numerical MPS - including an active-inactive phase\ntransition, and a hierarchy of trajectory phases connected to particular\nequilibrium states of the model. We also propose, via its height field\nrepresentation, a generalization of the Fredkin model to two dimensions in\nterms of constrained dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 19:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 12:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

A comparison between\nthe simulations and observations reveals no X-ray detection of Cygnus A-2 to a\n0.5-7.0 keV flux upper limit of $1.04 \\times\n10^{-12}\\rm\\,erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$, or a rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity of\n$8.6\\times 10^{42}\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of Cygnus\nA-2 based on our X-ray flux limit and find it to be consistent with a flaring\nblack hole rather than a steadily accreting source. The HRC observations are\nadditionally compared with archival ACIS data from 2016-2017, and both the\noverall morphology and the flux limits of the AGN complex agree between the two\ndatasets. This consistency is despite the pile-up effect in ACIS which was\npreviously considered to bias the observed morphology of the AGN. The agreement\nbetween the datasets demonstrates the viability of utilizing the archival\nChandra data of Cygnus A to analyze its AGN at an unprecedented level of\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 19:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

In this paper we focus on cases when this sensitivity to priors\nleads to counterintuitive predictions of the framework. Our domain of interest\nis exhaustivity effects, whereby a sentence such as \"Mary came\" is understood\nto mean that only Mary came. We show that in the baseline RSA model, under\ncertain conditions, anti-exhaustive readings are predicted (e.g., \"Mary came\"\nwould be used to convey that both Mary and Peter came). The specific question\nwe ask is the following: should exhaustive interpretations be derived as purely\npragmatic inferences (as in the classical Gricean view, endorsed in the\nbaseline RSA model), or should they rather be generated by an encapsulated\nsemantic mechanism (as argued in some of the recent formal literature)? To\nanswer this question, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of different\nRSA models and evaluate them against data obtained in a new study which tested\nthe effects of prior beliefs on both production and comprehension, improving on\nprevious empirical work. We found no anti-exhaustivity effects, but observed\nthat message choice is sensitive to priors, as predicted by the RSA framework\noverall. The best models turn out to be those which include an encapsulated\nexhaustivity mechanism (as other studies concluded on the basis of very\ndifferent data). We conclude that, on the one hand, in the division of labor\nbetween semantics and pragmatics, semantics plays a larger role than is often\nthought, but, on the other hand, the tradeoff between informativity and cost\nwhich characterizes all RSA models does play a central role for genuine\npragmatic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 20:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

We show that neural fragility is a\nwell-defined model given a good estimator of the linear dynamical system from\ndata. Specifically, we provide bounds on neural fragility as a function of the\nunderlying linear system and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 20:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

We build hence models based on vector\nfields conformally and disformally coupled to dark matter and derive explicitly\nthe general covariant form of the interaction term in an independent way of the\ngravity theory, whereby this result can be applied to general vector-tensor\ntheories. For concreteness, the standard Proca theory with a vector exponential\npotential is taken to describe the vector-tensor sector, and some specific\ncoupling functions are assumed to study the cosmological background dynamics by\ndynamical system techniques. Despite of choosing such a minimalist form for the\nunderlying theory, the parameter space is considerably enriched compared to the\nuncoupled case due to the novel interactions, leading to new branches of\nsolutions for the vector equation of motion. Thus, different trajectories can\nexist in phase space depending on the coupling parameters associated to the\nconformal and disformal functions. From here, new emerging vector-dark matter\nscaling solutions, and renewed stable attractor points are found to drive the\nlate-time accelerated expansion of the universe.

For deterministic systems\nwith infinitely many degrees of freedom, normal form and center manifold theory\nhave shown a prodigious efficiency to often completely characterize how the\nonset of linear instability translates into the emergence of nonlinear\npatterns. However, in presence of random fluctuations, this reduction procedure\nis seriously challenged due to large excursions caused by the noise, and the\napproach needs to be revisited.\n  We present an alternative framework to cope with these difficulties\nexploiting the approximation theory of stochastic invariant manifolds and\nenergy estimates measuring the defect of parameterization of the high-modes. To\noperate for fluid problems, these error estimates are derived under assumptions\nregarding dissipation effects brought by the high-modes that suitably\ncounterbalance the loss of regularity due to the nonlinear terms.

We here employ large-matrix\nanalysis to explore the effect of vector coded caching in realistic wireless\nmulti-antenna downlink systems. Our analysis answers a simple question: Under a\nfixed set of antenna and SNR resources, and a given downlink MISO system which\ncan already enjoy an optimized exploitation of multiplexing and beamforming\ngains, what is the multiplicative boost in the throughput when we are now\nallowed to occasionally add content inside reasonably-sized receiver-side\ncaches? The derived closed-form expressions capture various linear precoders,\nand a variety of practical considerations such as power dissemination across\nsignals, realistic SNR values, as well as feedback costs. The schemes are very\nsimple (we simply collapse precoding vectors into a single vector), and the\nrecorded gains are notable. For example, for 32 transmit antennas, a received\nSNR of 20 dB, a coherence bandwidth of 300 kHz, a coherence period of 40 ms,\nand under realistic file-size and cache-size constraints, vector coded caching\nis here shown to offer a multiplicative throughput boost of about 310% with\nZF/RZF precoding and a 430% boost in the performance of already optimized\nMF-based systems. Interestingly, vector coded caching also accelerates channel\nhardening to the benefit of feedback acquisition, often surpassing 540% gains\nover traditional hardening-constrained downlink systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 21:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

There has been a growing interest in taking this\naggregate approach at the individual-level, for example by equipping each agent\nof an Agent-Based Model with its own FCM to express its behavior. Although\nframeworks and studies have already taken this approach, an ongoing limitation\nhas been the difficulty of creating as many FCMs as there are individuals.\nIndeed, current studies have been able to create agents whose traits are\ndifferent, but whose decision-making modules are often identical, thus limiting\nthe behavioral heterogeneity of the simulated population.

This study uses a queueing model to\nestimate impacts on CSC capacity due to transfers from PSCs.\n  Methods: The model assumes that the number of AS patients arriving at each\nPSC, proportion of AS patients transferred, and length of stay in the CSC\nNeurologic Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) by type of AS are random, while the\ntransfer rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic AS patients are control variables.\nThe main outcome measure is the \"overflow\" probability, namely, the probability\nof a CSC not having capacity (unavailability of a Neuro-ICU bed) to accept a\ntransfer. Data simulations of the model, using a base case and an expanded\ncase, were performed to illustrate the effects of changing key parameters, such\nas transfer rates from PSCs and CSC Neuro-ICU capacity on overflow capacity.\n  Results: Data simulations of the model using a base case show that an\nincrease of a PSC's ischemic stroke transfer rate from 15% to 55% raises the\noverflow probability from 30.62% to 36.13%. Further simulations of the expanded\ncase show that to maintain an a priori CSC overflow probability of 30.62% when\nadding a PSC with a AS transfer rate of 15% to the network, other PSCs would\nneed to decrease their transfer rate by 12.5% or the CSC Neuro-ICU would need\nto add 2 beds.\n  Discussion: A queuing model can be used to estimate the effects of change in\nthe size of a PSC-CSC network, change in AS transfer rates, or change in number\nof CSC Neuro-ICU beds of a CSC on its capacity on the overflow probability in\nthe CSC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 22:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

However, as a ubiquitous graph\nproperty in numerous real-world scenarios, heterophily, i.e., nodes with\ndifferent labels tend to be linked, significantly limits the performance of\ntailor-made homophilic GNNs. Hence, \\textit{GNNs for heterophilic graphs} are\ngaining increasing attention in this community. To the best of our knowledge,\nin this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of GNNs for heterophilic\ngraphs for the first time.

This is followed by quantification and\nstatistical analysis of vascular alterations in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), the biggest cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative\ndisorders. Results: We determined that the CoW is fully formed in only 35\npercent of healthy adults and found significantly increased tortuosity and\nfractality, with increasing age and with disease -- both AIS and AD.

These large-scales structures are thus a remarkable fossil\nrecord of the integrated history of the enrichment of our Universe. In this\nChapter, we briefly discuss the chemical properties of this intracluster - or\nintragroup - medium (ICM).

Unfortunately, the quantum coherence\nproperties of multiphoton systems degrade upon propagation leading to undesired\nquantum-to-classical transitions. Furthermore, the manipulation of multiphoton\nquantum systems requires of nonlinear interactions at the few-photon level.\nHere, we introduce the quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem to describe the\nscattering and interference effects of propagating multiphoton systems. This\nfundamental theorem demonstrates that the quantum statistical fluctuations,\nwhich define the nature of diverse light sources, can be modified upon\npropagation in the absence of light-matter interactions.

Eulerian-Eulerian\nmethod with two-way coupling is used and detailed chemical mechanism is\nconsidered. Different droplet diameters and liquid fuel equivalence ratios (ER)\nare studied. The evaporation completion front (ECF) is defined to study the\ninteractions between the evaporation zone and flame front. The gas composition\nat the flame front is quantified through an effective ER. The results show that\nthe kernel trajectory is considerably affected by droplet size and liquid ER.\nGenerally, the flame ER reaches the maximum when the ECF start to move from the\nspherical center. It gradually decreases and reaches a constant value when the\nflame freely propagates. Quasi-stationary spherical flame is observed when the\nliquid ER is low, whilst kernel extinction/re-ignition appears when liquid ER\nis high. These flame behaviors are essentially affected by the heat conduction\nand species diffusion timescales between the droplet evaporation zone and flame\nfront. The dependence of the minimum ignition energy (MIE) on liquid ER is\nU-shaped and there is an optimal liquid equivalence ratio range (ERo) with the\nsmallest MIE. Long and short ignition failure modes are observed, respectively\nfor small and large liquid ERs. When liquid ER is less than ERo (long failure\nmode), larger energy is required to initiate the kernel due to very lean\ncomposition near the spark. For liquid ER larger than ERo (short mode),\nignition failure is caused by strong evaporative heat loss and rich gas\ncomposition due to heavy droplet loading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 01:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

To overcome the\nfundamental trade-off between color diversity and cooling performance, we\npropose a radiatively integrated, conductively insulated system that exploits\nthermal non-equilibrium between colorants and thermal emitters. This allows\nsuch radiative coolers to be cooled below the ambient temperature at all times\nof the day while exhibiting any desired exterior color including black. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that even black coolers, absorbing 646 Wm-2 of solar\npower under AM1.5 conditions, cools down to a maximum of 6.9 K (average of 3.5\nK) below the ambient temperature during the daytime. These systems can\npotentially be used in outdoor applications, especially in commercial buildings\nand residential houses, where carbon-free thermal management is in high demand\nbut diversity of colors is also important for visual appeal and comfort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Most of the existing works are\nto find patterns between relationships and effectively model them to accomplish\nthis task. Previous works have mainly discovered 6 important patterns like\nnon-commutativity. Although some bilinear methods succeed in modeling these\npatterns, they neglect to handle 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations (or\ncomplex relations) concurrently, which hurts their expressiveness. To this end,\nwe integrate scaling, the combination of translation and rotation that can\nsolve complex relations and patterns, respectively, where scaling is a\nsimplification of projection. Therefore, we propose a corresponding bilinear\nmodel Scaling Translation and Rotation (STaR) consisting of the above two\nparts. Besides, since translation cannot be incorporated into the bilinear\nmodel directly, we introduce translation matrix as the equivalent. Theoretical\nanalysis proves that STaR is capable of modeling all patterns and handling\ncomplex relations simultaneously, and experiments demonstrate its effectiveness\non commonly used benchmarks for link prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Yet these datasets are\ntime-consuming and labor-exhaustive to obtain on realistic tasks. To mitigate\nthe requirement for labeled data, self-training is widely used in\nsemi-supervised learning by iteratively assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled\nsamples. Despite its popularity, self-training is well-believed to be\nunreliable and often leads to training instability. Our experimental studies\nfurther reveal that the bias in semi-supervised learning arises from both the\nproblem itself and the inappropriate training with potentially incorrect pseudo\nlabels, which accumulates the error in the iterative self-training process. To\nreduce the above bias, we propose Debiased Self-Training (DST). First, the\ngeneration and utilization of pseudo labels are decoupled by two\nparameter-independent classifier heads to avoid direct error accumulation.\nSecond, we estimate the worst case of self-training bias, where the pseudo\nlabeling function is accurate on labeled samples, yet makes as many mistakes as\npossible on unlabeled samples. We then adversarially optimize the\nrepresentations to improve the quality of pseudo labels by avoiding the worst\ncase. Extensive experiments justify that DST achieves an average improvement of\n6.3% against state-of-the-art methods on standard semi-supervised learning\nbenchmark datasets and 18.9%$ against FixMatch on 13 diverse tasks.\nFurthermore, DST can be seamlessly adapted to other self-training methods and\nhelp stabilize their training and balance performance across classes in both\ncases of training from scratch and finetuning from pre-trained models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 01:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 13:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 03:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 12:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

By centrally controlling a fleet of\nself-driving vehicles, these systems provide mobility service to customers and\nare currently starting to be deployed in a number of cities around the world.\nCurrent learning-based approaches for controlling AMoD systems are limited to\nthe single-city scenario, whereby the service operator is allowed to take an\nunlimited amount of operational decisions within the same transportation\nsystem. However, real-world system operators can hardly afford to fully\nre-train AMoD controllers for every city they operate in, as this could result\nin a high number of poor-quality decisions during training, making the\nsingle-city strategy a potentially impractical solution. To address these\nlimitations, we propose to formalize the multi-city AMoD problem through the\nlens of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) and devise an actor-critic\nalgorithm based on recurrent graph neural networks. In our approach, AMoD\ncontrollers are explicitly trained such that a small amount of experience\nwithin a new city will produce good system performance. Empirically, we show\nhow control policies learned through meta-RL are able to achieve near-optimal\nperformance on unseen cities by learning rapidly adaptable policies, thus\nmaking them more robust not only to novel environments, but also to\ndistribution shifts common in real-world operations, such as special events,\nunexpected congestion, and dynamic pricing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

The quick release of\nenergetic X-ray photons during such bursts interacts with the surrounding\naccretion disk, which raises the accretion rate due to Poynting-Robertson drag\nand, thus, a fraction of the burst emission is reflected. We analyzed two\nphotospheric radius expansion bursts in the NS low-mass X-ray binary 4U\n1636--536 that took place in 2017, using data from Neutron star Interior\nComposition Explorer. The time-resolved burst spectra showed clear deviations\nfrom a blackbody model. The spectral fitting can be significantly improved by\nintroducing either the enhanced persistent emission (the $f_a$ model) or the\nreflection from the accretion disk (the \\texttt{relxillNS} model). The $f_a$\nmodel provides a higher blackbody temperature and higher burst flux compared\nwith the \\texttt{relxillNS} model.

In the present work, we consider plasma\noscillations supported by a two-dimensional electron gas confined at the\nsurface of a sphere or a cylinder.

More precisely, the system consists of an unknown number of\nanonymous nodes with congestion on links and local computation. Links can\nchange arbitrarily from round to round, with only limitation that the union of\nany T consecutive networks must form a temporarily connected (multi-)graph on\nall nodes (knowledge of T is the only information the nodes require, otherwise\nthe communication would not be feasible). Nodes do not have any IDs, only some\nnumber l of them have a bit distinguishing them from nodes without such a bit.\nIn each round a node can send and receive messages from its current neighbors.\nLinks and nodes are congested, in the sense that the length of messages and\nlocal cache memory for local computation is (asymptotically) logarithmic.\n  All-to-all communication is a fundamental principle in distributed computing\n- it assumes that each node has an input message to be delivered to all other\nnodes. Without loss of generality, the size of each input message is\nlogarithmic to fit in the link and node congestion assumption; otherwise, they\ncould be split in logarithmic batches and considered one-by-one. Because of\nanonymity, each node needs to receive only a set of all input messages, each\naccompanied by a number of initiating nodes (message multiplicity). We prove\nthat this task can be done in time polynomial in the (initially unknown) number\nof nodes n and in the lower bound on the isoperimetric numbers of dynamically\nevolving graphs.

This block structure has two seemingly contradictory\nproperties: on the one hand, its constituent layers exhibit highly similar\ndominant first principal components (PCs), but on the other hand, their\nrepresentations, and their common first PC, are highly dissimilar across\ndifferent random seeds. Our work seeks to reconcile these discrepant properties\nby investigating the origin of the block structure in relation to the data and\ntraining methods. By analyzing properties of the dominant PCs, we find that the\nblock structure arises from dominant datapoints - a small group of examples\nthat share similar image statistics (e.g. background color). However, the set\nof dominant datapoints, and the precise shared image statistic, can vary across\nrandom seeds. Thus, the block structure reflects meaningful dataset statistics,\nbut is simultaneously unique to each model. Through studying hidden layer\nactivations and creating synthetic datapoints, we demonstrate that these simple\nimage statistics dominate the representational geometry of the layers inside\nthe block structure. We explore how the phenomenon evolves through training,\nfinding that the block structure takes shape early in training, but the\nunderlying representations and the corresponding dominant datapoints continue\nto change substantially. Finally, we study the interplay between the block\nstructure and different training mechanisms, introducing a targeted\nintervention to eliminate the block structure, as well as examining the effects\nof pretraining and Shake-Shake regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 04:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Consequently, the per-layer sparsity makes up of the pruned network\nstructure in our filter pruning. Then, we introduce a recommendation-based\nfilter selection scheme where each filter recommends a group of its closest\nfilters. To pick the preserved filters from these recommended groups, we\nfurther devise a k-Reciprocal Nearest Filter (RNF) selection scheme where the\nselected filters fall into the intersection of these recommended groups.

Many learning tasks often encountered by living organisms\ninvolve a specific set-up centered around a relatively small set of patterns\npresented in a particular environment. For example, at a party, people\nrecognize friends immediately, without deep analysis, just by seeing a fragment\nof their clothes. This set-up with reduced \"ontology\" is referred to as a\n\"situation\". Situations are usually local in space and time. In this work, we\npropose that neuron-astrocyte networks provide a network topology that is\neffectively adapted to accommodate situation-based memory. In order to\nillustrate this, we numerically simulate and analyze a well-established model\nof a neuron-astrocyte network, which is subjected to stimuli conforming to the\nsituation-driven environment. Three pools of stimuli patterns are considered:\nexternal patterns, patterns from the situation associative pool regularly\npresented to the network and learned by the network, and patterns already\nlearned and remembered by astrocytes. Patterns from the external world are\nadded to and removed from the associative pool.

The broadly accepted trick to overcoming this is through the use of\nbiased gradient estimators: surrogate gradients which approximate thresholding\nin Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), and Straight-Through Estimators (STEs),\nwhich completely bypass thresholding in Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs). While\nnoisy gradient feedback has enabled reasonable performance on simple supervised\nlearning tasks, it is thought that such noise increases the difficulty of\nfinding optima in loss landscapes, especially during the later stages of\noptimization.

A scale-independent rate of\nenergy cascade $\\varepsilon_u\\approx-4.6\\times10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be\nidentified. The energy cascade leads to a two-thirds law for pairwise velocity\nand a four-thirds law for halo density. Both scaling laws can be confirmed by\nN-body simulations and galaxy rotation curves. For collisionless dark matter\nwith only gravity involved, scaling laws can be extended down to the smallest\nscale, where quantum effects become important.

Existing attack methods generally add/delete\npoints or perform point-wise perturbation over point clouds to generate\nadversarial examples in the data space, which may neglect the geometric\ncharacteristics of point clouds. Instead, we propose point cloud attacks from a\nnew perspective -- Graph Spectral Domain Attack (GSDA), aiming to perturb\ntransform coefficients in the graph spectral domain that corresponds to varying\ncertain geometric structure. In particular, we naturally represent a point\ncloud over a graph, and adaptively transform the coordinates of points into the\ngraph spectral domain via graph Fourier transform (GFT) for compact\nrepresentation. We then analyze the influence of different spectral bands on\nthe geometric structure of the point cloud, based on which we propose to\nperturb the GFT coefficients in a learnable manner guided by an energy\nconstraint loss function. Finally, the adversarial point cloud is generated by\ntransforming the perturbed spectral representation back to the data domain via\nthe inverse GFT (IGFT).

To address the issues mentioned above, we devise a\nhyper-relationship learning network, termed HLN, for SGG. Specifically, the\nproposed HLN stems from hypergraphs and two graph attention networks (GATs) are\ndesigned to infer relationships: 1) the object-relationship GAT or OR-GAT to\nexplore interactions between objects and relationships, and 2) the\nhyper-relationship GAT or HR-GAT to integrate transitive inference of\nhyper-relationships, i.e., the sequential relationships between three objects\nfor transitive reasoning.

The recently developed\ndifferentiable neural computer (DNC) is a MANN that has been shown to\noutperform in representing complicated data structures and learning long-term\ndependencies. DNC's higher performance is derived from new history-based\nattention mechanisms in addition to the previously used content-based attention\nmechanisms. History-based mechanisms require a variety of new compute\nprimitives and state memories, which are not supported by existing neural\nnetwork (NN) or MANN accelerators. We present HiMA, a tiled, history-based\nmemory access engine with distributed memories in tiles. HiMA incorporates a\nmulti-mode network-on-chip (NoC) to reduce the communication latency and\nimprove scalability. An optimal submatrix-wise memory partition strategy is\napplied to reduce the amount of NoC traffic; and a two-stage usage sort method\nleverages distributed tiles to improve computation speed. To make HiMA\nfundamentally scalable, we create a distributed version of DNC called DNC-D to\nallow almost all memory operations to be applied to local memories with\ntrainable weighted summation to produce the global memory output. Two\napproximation techniques, usage skimming and softmax approximation, are\nproposed to further enhance hardware efficiency. HiMA prototypes are created in\nRTL and synthesized in a 40nm technology. By simulations, HiMA running DNC and\nDNC-D demonstrates 6.47x and 39.1x higher speed, 22.8x and 164.3x better area\nefficiency, and 6.1x and 61.2x better energy efficiency over the\nstate-of-the-art MANN accelerator.

However, in\npractice, a user that uses an RL policy may have different preferences over its\nperformance across environments. Clearly, the aforementioned max-min robustness\nis oftentimes too conservative to satisfy user preference. Therefore, in this\npaper, we integrate user preference into policy learning in robust RL, and\npropose a novel User-Oriented Robust RL (UOR-RL) framework. Specifically, we\ndefine a new User-Oriented Robustness (UOR) metric for RL, which allocates\ndifferent weights to the environments according to user preference and\ngeneralizes the max-min robustness metric. To optimize the UOR metric, we\ndevelop two different UOR-RL training algorithms for the scenarios with or\nwithout a priori known environment distribution, respectively. Theoretically,\nwe prove that our UOR-RL training algorithms converge to near-optimal policies\neven with inaccurate or completely no knowledge about the environment\ndistribution.

Ehlers, F.\nPirani and A. Schild and the global space-time structure elaborated by R.\nPenrose, S.W. Hawking, B. Carter and others, we argue that the current way of\ndoing relativistic physics presupposes treating time and causality as primitive\nconcepts, neither of them being `more primitive' than the other. The decision\nregarding which concepts to assume as primitive and which statements to regard\nas axioms depends on the choice of the angle at which we contemplate the whole.\nThis standard approach is based on the presupposition that the concept of a\npoint-like particle is a viable approximation. However, this assumption is not\nsupported by a realistic approach to doing physics and, in particular, by\nquantum theory. We remove this assumption by analysing the recent works by M.\nEckstein and T. Miller. They consider the space $P(M)$ of probability measures\non space-time $M$ such that, for an element $\\mu \\in P(M)$, the number $\\mu\n(K)$ specifies the probability of the occurrence of some event associated with\nthe space-time region $K$ and the measure $\\mu$. In this way, $M$ is not to be\nregarded as a collection of space-time events, but rather as a support for\ncorresponding probability measures. As shown by Eckstein and Miller, the space\n$P(M)$ inherits the causal order from the underlying space-time and facilitates\na rigorous notion of a `causal evolution of probability measures'. We look at\nthe deductive chains creating temporal and causal structures analysed in these\nworks, in order to highlight their operational (or quasi-operational) aspect.\nThis is impossible without taking into account the relative frequencies and\ncorrelations observed in relevant experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

As a dynamic effect, we include the existence of natural dispersal\nvectors (e.g., dust, asteroids) in a way that avoids assumptions about their\nagency. By assuming that dispersal vectors have a finite velocity and range,\nthe model includes the parameter of 'optical depth of life spreading'.

This work proposes a Maxwell-Amp\\`{e}re Nernst-Planck (MANP)\nframework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a\ncurl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy\ndissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated\nto be equivalent to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model. By the energy dissipation\nlaw, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving\nPoisson--Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach\nto study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a\ncompanion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally\npreserve the discrete Gauss's law and converge robustly with linear\ncomputational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main\nadvantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with\nspace-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient\nPoisson's equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb\ncorrelations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified\nMANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical\nresults on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in\ninhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the\nperformance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics,\nillustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for\nmodeling charge dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 12:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 02:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 03:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In some circumstances, cells need to make decisions\naccurately and quickly, therefore it has been suggested the SPRT may be used to\nunderstand the speed-accuracy tradeoff in cellular decision making. It is\ngenerally thought that in order for cells to make use of the SPRT, it is\nnecessary to find biochemical circuits that can compute the log-likelihood\nratio needed for the SPRT. However, this paper takes a different approach. We\nrecognise that the high-level behaviour of the SPRT is defined by its positive\ndetection or hit rate, and the computation of the log-likelihood ratio is just\none way to realise this behaviour. In this paper, we will present a method\nwhich uses a transcription-based detector to emulate the hit rate of the SPRT\nwithout computing the exact log-likelihood ratio. We consider the problem of\nusing a promoter with multiple binding sites to accurately and quickly detect\nwhether the concentration of a transcription factor is above a target level. We\nshow that it is possible to find binding and unbinding rates of the\ntranscription factor to the promoter's binding sites so that the probability\nthat the amount of mRNA produced will be higher than a threshold is\napproximately equal to the hit rate of the SPRT detector. Moreover, we show\nthat the average time that this transcription-based detector needs to make a\npositive detection is less than or equal to that of the SPRT for a wide range\nof concentrations.

This offer is intended to address concerns of\nusers when moving critical tasks into the cloud. However, TEEs only allow to\nattest the integrity of the environment at launch-time. To also enable the\nattestation of a TEE's integrity at run-time, we present GuaranTEE. GuaranTEE\nuses control-flow attestation to ensure the integrity of a service running\nwithin a TEE. By additionally placing all components of GuaranTEE in TEEs, we\nare able to not only detect a compromised target, but are also able to protect\nourselves from malicious administrators. We show the practicability of\nGuaranTEE by providing a detailed performance and security evaluation of our\nprototype based on Intel SGX in Microsoft Azure. Our evaluation shows that the\nneed to transfer information between TEEs and the additional verification\nprocess add considerable overhead under high CPU load. Yet, we are able to\nreduce this overhead by securely caching collected information and by\nperforming the analysis in parallel to executing the application. In summary,\nour results show that GuaranTEE provides a practical solution for cloud users\nfocused on protecting the integrity of their data and processes at run-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 07:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

The framework in which the properties of waves\nare discussed depends on the relative magnitude of collisions between\nparticles, but also on the relative magnitude of the collisional frequencies\ncompared to the gyro-frequency of charged particles. Our investigation shows\nthat the weakly ionised solar atmospheric plasma can divided into two regions\nand this division occurs, roughly, at the base of the chromosphere. In the\nsolar photosphere the plasma is non-magnetised and the dynamics can described\nwithin the three-fluid framework where acoustic waves associated to each\nspecies can propagate. Due to the very high concentration of neutrals, the\nneutral sound waves propagates with no damping, while for the other two modes\nthe damping rate is determined by collisions with neutrals. The ion and\nelectron-related acoustic modes propagate with a cut-off determined by the\ncollisional frequency of these species with neutrals. In the weakly ionised\nchromosphere only electrons are magnetised, however, the strong coupling of\ncharged particles reduces the working framework to a two-fluid model. The\ndisassociation of charged particles creates electric currents that can\ninfluence the characteristic of waves. The propagation properties of waves with\nrespect to the angle of propagation are studied with the help of polar\ndiagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

More specifically, this procedure aims to generate a\nsequence of numerical approximations, which results from the iterative solution\nof related (stabilised) linearised discrete problems, and tends to a local\nminimum of the underlying energy functional. Simultaneously, the\nfinite-dimensional approximation spaces are adaptively refined; this is\nimplemented in terms of a new mesh refinement strategy in the context of finite\nelement discretisations, which again relies on the energy structure of the\nproblem under consideration, and does not involve any a posteriori error\nindicators. In combination, the resulting adaptive algorithm consists of an\niterative linearisation procedure on a sequence of hierarchically refined\ndiscrete spaces, which we prove to converge towards a solution of the\ncontinuous problem in an appropriate sense. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthe robustness and reliability of our approach for a series of examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

By means of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at\nambient conditions, PA molecules adsorbed on surfaces of epitaxial magnetic\nAl2O3/Pt/Au/Co/Au nanostructures with perpendicular anisotropy were studied.\nThereby, a correlation between the PA molecules ordering at the surface with\nthe electron tunneling across this hybrid system as a function of the substrate\nmagnetization orientation as well as the coverage density and helicity of the\nwas observed. The highest spin polarization values, P, were found for\nwell-ordered self-assembled monolayers and with a defined chemical coupling of\nthe molecules to the magnetic substrate surface, showing that the current\ninduced spin selectivity is a cooperative effect. Thereby, P deduced from the\nelectron transmission along unoccupied molecular orbitals of the helical\nmolecules is larger as compared to values derived from the occupied molecular\norbitals. Apparently, the larger orbital overlap is resulting in a higher\nelectron mobility yielding a higher P value. By switching the magnetization\ndirection of the Co-layer, it was demonstrated that the non-spin-polarized STM\ncan be used to study chiral molecules with a sub-molecular resolution, to\ndetect properties of buried magnetic layers and to detect the spin polarization\nof the molecules from the change of the magnetoresistance of such hybrid\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 14:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Matter that\nviolates this condition is usually referred to as \"exotic.\" For any wormhole\nhaving a moderately-sized throat, the radial tension is equal to that at the\ncenter of a massive neutron star. Attributing this outcome to exotic matter\nseems reasonable enough, but it ignores the fact that exotic matter was\nintroduced for a completely different reason. Moreover, its problematical\nnature suggests that the amount of exotic matter be held to a minimum, but this\nwould make the high radial tension harder to explain. If the amount is\ninfinitely small, this explanation breaks down entirely. By invoking $f(R)$\nmodified gravity, the need for exotic matter at the throat could actually be\neliminated, but the negation of the above condition, i.e., $\\tau <\\rho c^2$,\nshows that we have not necessarily eliminated the high radial tension.

Analysis of these series shows that conjugated substructures\nconsisting of two connected formally-double bonds and containing at least s\nsingle heteroatom play the role of fragments being sought. Nine potential\nfragments of this type are considered separately that differ one from another\nin the number of heteroatoms and/or their relative positions inside and are\ncalled elementary conjugated fragments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 14:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

We are\npartly motivated to study tides due to massive short-period hot Jupiters, which\npreferentially orbit stars with convective cores, for which wave breaking near\nthe stellar centre cannot operate. We develop a theory (and test it with\nnumerical calculations) for the nonlinear excitation of super-harmonic\n\"secondary\" waves (with frequencies $2\\omega_p$) by a \"primary\" tidal wave\n(with frequency $\\omega_p$) near the interface between the radiation zone and\nconvective envelope. These waves have the same horizontal phase speeds to\nleading order, and this nonlinear effect could contribute importantly to tidal\ndissipation if the secondary waves can efficiently damp the primary. We derive\ncriteria involving the orbital and stellar parameters required to excite these\nsecondary waves to large amplitudes using a local model of the\nradiative/convective interface, which we convert to apply to tides in a\nspherical star. We numerically evaluate the critical amplitudes required for\nthis new nonlinear effect to become important using stellar models, comparing\nthem to the \"conventional\" criteria for wave breaking in radiative cores and\nthe application of WKBJ theory near convective cores. The criteria for this new\neffect are easier to satisfy than the conventional measures of nonlinearity in\n$1.4$ and $2M_\\odot$ stars on the main-sequence.

For Rabin games with $k$ pairs, the\ncomplexity of the new algorithm is $O(n^{k+2}k!)$ symbolic steps, which is\nindependent of the number of live edges in the strong transition fairness\nassumption. Further, we show that GR(1) specifications with strong transition\nfairness assumptions can be solved with a 3-nested fixpoint algorithm, same as\nthe usual algorithm.

An isolated spherical magnetic particle undergoes a transition between a\nrotating state at low magnetic field and a static orientation at high magnetic\nfield. The effect of interactions for spherical dipolar and polarisable\nparticles with static orientation is examined for a dilute viscous suspension.\nThere are magnetic interactions due to the magnetic field disturbance at one\nparticle caused by the dipole moment of another, hydrodynamic interactions due\nto the antisymmetric force moment of a non-rotating particle in a shear flow,\nand a modification of the magnetic field due to the particle magnetic moment\ndensity. When there is a concentration variation, the torque balance condition\nresults in a disturbance to the orientation of the particle magnetic moment.\nThe net force and the drift velocity due to these disturbances is calculated,\nand the collective motion generated is equivalent to an anisotropic diffusion\nprocess.

Adjusting inverter injection setpoints for distributed energy\nresources can be an effective grid control mechanism. However, finding such\nsetpoints optimally requires solving an optimal power flow (OPF), which can be\ncomputationally taxing in real time. This work proposes learning the mapping\nfrom grid conditions to OPF minimizers using Gaussian processes (GPs). This\nGP-OPF model predicts inverter setpoints when presented with a new instance of\ngrid conditions. Training enjoys closed-form expressions, and GP-OPF\npredictions come with confidence intervals. To improve upon data efficiency, we\nuniquely incorporate the sensitivities (partial derivatives) of the OPF mapping\ninto GP-OPF. This expedites the process of generating a training dataset as\nfewer OPF instances need to be solved to attain the same accuracy. To further\nreduce computational efficiency, we approximate the kernel function of GP-OPF\nleveraging the concept of random features, which is neatly extended to\nsensitivity data. We perform sensitivity analysis for the second-order cone\nprogram (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF, whose sensitivities can be computed by\nmerely solving a system of linear equations. Extensive numerical tests using\nreal-world data on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus benchmark feeders corroborate the\nmerits of GP-OPF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 15:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 21:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 12:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Following the common\npractices of blind SR, our method proposes to improve both the kernel\nestimation as well as the kernel-based high-resolution image restoration. To be\nmore specific, we first reformulate the degradation model such that the\ndeblurring kernel estimation can be transferred into the low-resolution space.\nOn top of this, we introduce a dynamic deep linear filter module. Instead of\nlearning a fixed kernel for all images, it can adaptively generate deblurring\nkernel weights conditional on the input and yield a more robust kernel\nestimation.

It was shown by Barrow that the quantum\ngravitational effects may instigate complex fractal features in the structure\nof a black hole. Since the length scale during the inflation is expected to be\nsmall, the energy density obtained from the application of the holographic\nprinciple in the early universe will be large enough to support the\ninflationary scenario. Using the Granda-Oliveros IR cut-off we have studied the\ninflationary scenario with the universe filled with BHDE. Various analytic\nsolutions for the model were found out including the slow-roll parameters,\nscalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.

In this paper,\nwe focus on external audits that are conducted by interacting with the user\nside of the target algorithm, hence considered as a black box. Yet, the legal\nframework in which these audits take place is mostly ambiguous to researchers\ndeveloping them: on the one hand, the legal value of the audit outcome is\nuncertain; on the other hand the auditors' rights and obligations are unclear.\nThe contribution of this paper is to articulate two canonical audit forms to\nlaw, to shed light on these aspects: 1) the first audit form (we coin the Bobby\naudit form) checks a predicate against the algorithm, while the second\n(Sherlock) is more loose and opens up to multiple investigations. We find that:\nBobby audits are more amenable to prosecution, yet are delicate as operating on\nreal user data. This can lead to reject by a court (notion of admissibility).\nSherlock audits craft data for their operation, most notably to build\nsurrogates of the audited algorithm. It is mostly used for acts for\nwhistleblowing, as even if accepted as a proof, the evidential value will be\nlow in practice. 2) these two forms require the prior respect of a proper right\nto audit, granted by law or by the platform being audited; otherwise the\nauditor will be also prone to prosecutions regardless of the audit outcome.\nThis article thus highlights the relation of current audits with law, in order\nto structure the growing field of algorithm auditing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 14:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

This work investigates the\neffects of transverse inclination on an aeroelastic prism through\nforced-vibration wind tunnel experiments. The aerodynamic characteristics are\ntri-parametrically evaluated under different wind speeds, inclination angles,\nand oscillation amplitudes. Results show that transverse inclination\nfundamentally changes the wake phenomenology by impinging the fix-end horseshoe\nvortex and breaking the separation symmetry. The aftermath is a bi-polar,\nonce-for-all change in the aerodynamics near the prism base. The suppression of\nthe horseshoe vortex unleashes the Karman vortex, which significantly increases\nthe unsteady crosswind force. After the initial morphology switch, the\naerodynamics become independent of inclination angle and oscillation amplitude\nand depend solely on wind speed. The structure's upper portion does not feel\nthe effect, so this phenomenon is called Base Intensification. The phenomenon\nonly projects notable impacts on the low-speed and VIV regime and is\nindifferent in the high-speed, quasi-steady Galloping regime. In practice, Base\nIntensification will disrupt the pedestrian-level wind environment from the\nunleashed Bernard-Karman vortex shedding, making it erratic and gusty.\nMoreover, it increases the aerodynamic load at a structure base by as much as\n4.3 times. Since fix-end stiffness prevents elastic dissipation, the load\ntranslates to massive stress, making detection trickier and failures, if they\nare to occur, more sudden, extreme, and without any warnings. The 4.3-time\namplification also surpasses the safety factor of many standard designs, so\ntransverse inclination deserves engineering attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 02:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}
