The generally accepted description of the\nisomerization pathway starts with a valence excitation to the lowest-lying\nbright state, followed by a passage through a conical intersection to a dark\ndoubly excited state, and finally a branching between either the return to the\nground state of the cyclic molecule or the actual ring-opening reaction leading\nto the open-chain isomer. It was traditionally assumed that the dark reactive\nstate corresponds to the second excited state of CHD at the Franck-Condon\ngeometry. Here in a joint experimental and computational effort we demonstrate\nthat the evolution of the excitation-deexcitation process is much more complex\nthan usually described. In particular, we show that an initially high-lying\nelectronic state smoothly decreasing in energy along the reaction path plays a\nkey role in the ring-opening reaction. The conceptual basis of our work is that\nthe dynamics to consider here is determined by diabatic states, whose\npopulations are the ones closely related to the observed photoelectron signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

This can easily be achieved by measuring the mass flow through\neach cabinet, however, that is expensive and not feasible in large-scale\ndeployments. Therefore it is important to be able to estimate the valve sizes\nfrom the monitoring data, which is typically measured. The valve size is\nmeasured by an area, which can be used to calculate mass flow through the valve\n-- this estimated value is referred to as the valve constant. A novel method\nfor estimating the cabinet evaporator valve constants is proposed in the\npresent paper. It is demonstrated using monitoring data from a refrigeration\nsystem in a supermarket consisting of data sampled at a one-minute sampling\nrate, however it is shown that a sampling time of around 10-20 minutes is\nadequate for the method. Through thermodynamic analysis of a two-stage CO2\nrefrigeration system, a linear regression model for estimating valve constants\nwas developed using time series data. The linear regression requires that\ntransient dynamics are not present in the data, which depends on multiple\nfactors e.g. the sampling time. If dynamics are not modeled it can be detected\nby a significant auto-correlation of the residuals. In order to include the\ndynamics in the model, an Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous\nvariables (ARMAX) was applied, and it is shown how it effectively eliminates\nthe auto-correlation and provides more unbiased estimates, as well as improved\nthe accuracy estimates.

This is the case of cyber-physical defense\nresearch, a distinct but complementary discipline to cyber-physical protection.\nCyber-physical defense refers to the capability to detect and react in response\nto cyber-physical attacks. Concretely, it involves the integration of\nmechanisms to identify adverse events and prepare response plans, during and\nafter incidents occur. In this paper, we make the assumption that the\neventually available quantum computer will provide an advantage to adversaries\nagainst defenders, unless they also adopt this technology. We envision the\nnecessity for a paradigm shift, where an increase of adversarial resources\nbecause of quantum supremacy does not translate into higher likelihood of\ndisruptions. Consistently with current system design practices in other areas,\nsuch as the use of artificial intelligence for the reinforcement of attack\ndetection tools, we outline a vision for next generation cyber-physical defense\nlayers leveraging ideas from quantum computing and machine learning. Through an\nexample, we show that defenders of NCSs can learn and improve their strategies\nto anticipate and recover from attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Given the assumptions underlying this setup, when stimulus\nproperties are predictive of the activity in a zone, these properties are\nunderstood to cause activity in that zone.\n  In recent years, researchers have used neural networks to construct\nrepresentations that capture the diverse properties of complex stimuli, such as\nnatural language or natural images. Encoding models built using these\nhigh-dimensional representations are often able to significantly predict the\nactivity in large swathes of cortex, suggesting that the activity in all these\nbrain zones is caused by stimulus properties captured in the representation.

In this\nwork, we consider the delegation gap of the generalized Pandora's box problem,\na search problem in which searching for solutions incurs known costs and\nsolutions are restricted by some downward-closed constraint. First, we show\nthat there is a special case when all random variables have binary support for\nwhich there exist constant-factor delegation gaps for matroid constraints.\nHowever, there is no constant-factor delegation gap for even simple non-binary\ninstances of the problem.

Each such a multi-torus can\nbe unfolded into elementary polygon pattern (EPP). A rational billiards Riemann\nsurface (RBRS) corresponding to each RB is then an infinite mosaic made by a\nperiodic distribution of EPP. Periods of RBRS are directly related to periodic\norbits of RB. It is shown that any stationary solutions (SS) to the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (SE) in RB can be extended on the whole RBRS. The\nextended stationary wave functions (ESS) are then periodic on RBRS with its\nperiods. Conversely, for each system of boundary conditions (i.e. the Dirichlet\nor the the Neumann ones or their mixture) consistent with EPP one can find so\ncalled stationary pre-solutions (SPS) of the Schr\\\"odinger equation defined on\nRBRS and respecting its periodic structure together with their energy spectra.\nUsing SPS one can easily construct SS of RB for most boundary conditions on it\nby a trivial algebra over SPS. It proves therefore that the energy spectra\ndefined by the boundary conditions for SS corresponding to each RB are totally\ndetermined by $2g$ independent periods of RBRS being homogeneous functions of\nthese periods. RBRS can be constructed exclusively due to the rationality of\nthe polygon billiards considered. Therefore the approach developed in the\npresent paper can be seen as a new way in obtaining SS to SE in RB. SPS can be\nconstructed explicitly for a class of RB which EPP can be decomposed into a set\nof periodic orbit channel (POC) parallel to each other (POCDRB). For such a\nclass of RB the respective RBRS can be built as a standard multi-sheeted\nRiemann surface with a periodic structure. For POCDRB a discussion of the\nexistence of the superscar states (SSS) can be done thoroughly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Here, we treat cells as noisy\nmotile particles that exert contractile dipolar stresses on elastic substrates\nas they move. By combining this minimal model for the motility of individual\ncells with a linear elastic model that accounts for substrate mediated cell\ncell interactions, we examine emergent collective states that result from the\ninterplay of cell motility and long range elastic dipolar interactions. In\nparticular, we show that particles self assemble into flexible, motile chains\nwhich can cluster to form diverse larger scale compact structures with polar\norder. By computing key structural and dynamical metrics, we distinguish\nbetween the collective states at weak and strong elastic interactions, as well\nas at low and high motility. We also show how these states are affected by\nconfinement, an important characteristic of the complex mechanical\nmicroenvironment inhabited by cells.

In\nthis work, we derive novel guarantees for its convergence rate when the\ninvolved measures are different, possibly supported on different spaces. Our\ncentral observation is that the statistical performance of the empirical OT\ncost is determined by the less complex measure, a phenomenon we refer to as\nlower complexity adaptation of empirical OT. For instance, under Lipschitz\nground costs, we find that the empirical OT cost based on $n$ observations\nconverges at least with rate $n^{-1/d}$ to the population quantity if one of\nthe two measures is concentrated on a $d$-dimensional manifold, while the other\ncan be arbitrary. For semi-concave ground costs, we show that the upper bound\nfor the rate improves to $n^{-2/d}$. Similarly, our theory establishes the\ngeneral convergence rate $n^{-1/2}$ for semi-discrete OT. All of these results\nare valid in the two-sample case as well, meaning that the convergence rate is\nstill governed by the simpler of the two measures. On a conceptual level, our\nfindings therefore suggest that the curse of dimensionality only affects the\nestimation of the OT cost when both measures exhibit a high intrinsic\ndimension. Our proofs are based on the dual formulation of OT as a maximization\nover a suitable function class $\\mathcal{F}_c$ and the observation that the\n$c$-transform of $\\mathcal{F}_c$ under bounded costs has the same uniform\nmetric entropy as $\\mathcal{F}_c$ itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Consequently, this paper reports a year-long,\nparticipant-observation, constructivist grounded theory study investigating the\nimpact of working from home on software development. This study resulted in a\ntheory of software team coordination. Briefly, shifting from in-office to\nat-home work fundamentally altered coordination within software teams. While\ngroup cohesion and more effective communication appear protective, coordination\nis undermined by distrust, parenting and communication bricolage. Poor\ncoordination leads to numerous problems including misunderstandings, help\nrequests, lower job satisfaction among team members, and more ill-defined\ntasks. These problems, in turn, reduce overall project success and prompt\nprofessionals to alter their software development processes (in this case, from\nScrum to Kanban). Our findings suggest that software organizations with many\nremote employees can improve performance by encouraging greater engagement\nwithin teams and supporting employees with family and childcare\nresponsibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 18:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 13:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Total variation methods based on\nL1-norm minimization have recently been proposed as a powerful technique for\nnoise removal in gravitational-wave data. In particular, the regularized\nRudin-Osher-Fatemi (rROF) model has proven effective to denoise signals\nembedded in either simulated Gaussian noise or actual detector noise. Importing\nthe rROF model to existing search pipelines seems therefore worth considering.\nIn this paper, we discuss the implementation of two variants of the rROF\nalgorithm as two separate plug-ins of the coherent Wave Burst (cWB) pipeline\ndesigned to conduct searches of unmodelled gravitational-wave burst sources.\nThe first approach is based on a single-step rROF method and the second one\nemploys an iterative rROF procedure. Both approaches are calibrated using\nactual gravitational-wave events from the first three observing runs of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, namely GW1501914, GW151226, GW170817, and\nGW190521, encompassing different types of compact binary coalescences. Our\nanalysis shows that the iterative version of the rROF denoising algorithm\nimplemented in the cWB pipeline effectively eliminates noise while preserving\nthe waveform signals intact. Therefore, the combined approach yields higher\nsignal-to-noise values than those computed by the cWB pipeline without the rROF\ndenoising step. The incorporation of the iterative rROF algorithm in the cWB\npipeline might hence impact the detectability capabilities of the pipeline\nalong with the inference of source properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 17:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

We constrain the couplings of the theory by imposing CFT unitarity and\npositivity of energy (which we show to be equivalent to causality in the bulk)\nas well as positive-entropy bounds from the weak gravity conjecture. The\nthermodynamic properties of the dual plasma at finite chemical potential are\nstudied in detail, and we find that exotic zeroth-order phase transitions may\nappear, but that many of them are ruled out by the physical constraints. We\nfurther compute the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, and we show that\nit can be taken to zero while respecting all the constraints, providing that\nthe chemical potential is large enough. We also obtain the charged R\\'enyi\nentropies and we observe that the chemical potential always increases the\namount of entanglement and that the usual properties of R\\'enyi entropies are\npreserved if the physical constraints are met. Finally, we compute the scaling\ndimension and magnetic response of twist operators and we provide a holographic\nderivation of the universal relations between the expansion of these quantities\nand the coefficients of $\\langle JJ\\rangle$ and $\\langle TJJ \\rangle$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 13:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 10:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Independently, Milky Way observations show that the\nclose-binary fraction of solar-type stars is higher at lower metallicity.\nMotivated by these observations, we use the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in\nsimulations to explore the impact of varying Ia rate models, including\nmetallicity dependence, on galaxies across a range of stellar masses: 10^7 Msun\n- 10^{11} Msun.

Models in which the Ia rate increases with decreasing\nmetallicity (as ~ Z^{-0.5} to Z^{-1}) provide significantly better agreement\nwith observations.

We\npresent here a novel approach that addresses each challenge. In the context of\nthe Dark Energy Survey (DES), we analyze a SNIa sample with host galaxies in\nthe redMaGiC galaxy catalog, a selection of Luminous Red Galaxies.

In this work, a one year mixed integer programming (MIP)\nproblem has been developed to compare the power consumption between 2019 and\n2020 in the United States as an example regarding the COVID19 pandemic effect\nin order to better prepare for possible similar future events. 100 percent\nrenewable single microgrids (SMGs) are studied using wind turbines and\nphotovoltaics.

Planets around a\ncircular binary form coplanar while planets around an eccentric binary can form\ncoplanar or polar depending on the initial disk misalignment and the binary\neccentricity. The more massive a terrestrial planet is, the more aligned it is\n(to coplanar or polar) since it has undergone more mergers that lead on average\nto smaller misalignment angles.

We start with a free-space ST wave packet that is\ncoupled to a ST-SPP at a gold-dielectric interface, and unambiguously identify\nthe ST-SPP via an axial beating detected in two-photon fluorescence produced by\nthe superposition of incident ST wave packet and the excited surface-bound\nST-SPP. These results highlight a viable approach for efficient and reliable\ncoupling to ST-SPPs, and thus represent the first crucial step towards\nrealization of the full potential of ST-SPPs for plasmonic sensing and imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 19:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

However, most existing deep\nclustering methods suffer from two major drawbacks. First, most cluster\nassignment methods are based on simple distance comparison and highly dependent\non the target distribution generated by a handcrafted nonlinear mapping. These\nfacts largely limit the possible performance that deep clustering methods can\nreach. Second, the clustering results can be easily guided towards wrong\ndirection by the misassigned samples in each cluster. The existing deep\nclustering methods are incapable of discriminating such samples. To address\nthese issues, a novel modular Self-Evolutionary Clustering (Self-EvoC)\nframework is constructed, which boosts the clustering performance by\nclassification in a self-supervised manner. Fuzzy theory is used to score the\nsample membership with probability which evaluates the intermediate clustering\nresult certainty of each sample.

The augmented data are employed to fine-tune an\noff-the-shelf deep network classifier with the labels from the clustering,\nwhich results in a model to generate the target distribution.

Period-spacing patterns caused by gravity modes are a particularly\npowerful asteroseismic tool that are useful for probing the near-core rotation\nand mixing of chemical elements in main-sequence stars with convective cores.\nAims: we aim to compose a catalog of intermediate-mass stars in the TESS\nsouthern continuous viewing zone to reveal period-spacing patterns caused by\ngravity modes for use in future asteroseismic modeling. Methods: TESS full\nframe images were inspected to select stars of intermediate- and high-mass\nusing color-magnitude criteria.

Instead of\nestimating traffic flow patterns assuming certain user behavior (e.g., user\nequilibrium or system optimal), here we explore the idea of learning those flow\npatterns directly from the data. To implement this idea, we have formulated the\ntraffic-assignment problem as a data-driven learning problem and developed a\nneural network-based framework known as Graph Convolutional Neural Network\n(GCNN) to solve it. The proposed framework represents the transportation\nnetwork and OD demand in an efficient way and utilizes the diffusion process of\nmultiple OD demands from nodes to links. We validate the solutions of the model\nagainst analytical solutions generated from running static user\nequilibrium-based traffic assignments over Sioux Falls and East Massachusetts\nnetworks. The validation result shows that the implemented GCNN model can learn\nthe flow patterns very well with less than 2% mean absolute difference between\nthe actual and estimated link flows for both networks under varying congested\nconditions. When the training of the model is complete, it can instantly\ndetermine the traffic flows of a large-scale network.

By complementary slackness conditions of semidefinite\nprogramming, if an optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank, any\noptimal primal solution must have low rank. We attempt to characterize graphs\nfor which we can show that the corresponding dual optimal solution must have\nsufficiently high rank. In the case of the original Karger, Motwani, and Sudan\nvector program, we show that any graph which is a $k$-tree has sufficiently\nhigh dual rank, and we can extract the coloring from the corresponding low-rank\nprimal solution. We can also show that if the graph is not uniquely colorable,\nthen no sufficiently high rank dual optimal solution can exist. This allows us\nto completely characterize the planar graphs for which dual optimal solutions\nhave sufficiently high dual rank. We then modify the semidefinite program to\nhave an objective function with costs, and explore when we can create a cost\nfunction whose optimal dual solution has sufficiently high rank.

In this paper, we close this gap and present a novel BFGS\nmethod that has the best of both worlds in that it leverages the approximation\nideas of both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS to properly approximate the Newton direction\nand the Hessian matrix simultaneously. Our theoretical results show that our\nmethod out-performs both BFGS and Greedy-BFGS in terms of convergence rate,\nwhile it reaches its quadratic convergence rate with fewer steps compared to\nGreedy-BFGS. Numerical experiments on various datasets also confirm our\ntheoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 21:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 02:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In the context of cancer, intra-tumor\nheterogeneity (ITH), characterized by cells with genetic and phenotypic\nvariability that co-exist within a single tumor, is often the cause of\nineffective therapy and recurrence of cancer. Multi-region sequencing (M-Seq),\nobtained by sampling multiple regions of a single tumor, has vividly\ndemonstrated the pervasive nature of ITH, raising the need for a theory that\naccounts for evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Here, we develop a statistical\nmechanical theory to quantify ITH, using the Hamming distance, between genetic\nmutations in distinct regions within a single tumor. An analytic expression for\nITH, expressed in terms of cell division probability ($\\alpha$) and mutation\nprobability ($p$), is validated using cellular-automaton type simulations.\nApplication of the theory successfully captures ITH extracted from M-seq data\nin patients with exogenous cancers (melanoma and lung). The theory, based on\npunctuated evolution at the early stages of the tumor followed by neutral\nevolution, is accurate provided the spatial variation in the tumor mutation\nburden is not large. We show that there are substantial variations in ITH in\ndistinct regions of a single solid tumor, which supports the notion that\ndistinct subclones could co-exist. The simulations show that there are\nsubstantial variations in the sub-populations, with the ITH increasing as the\ndistance between the regions increases. The analytical and simulation framework\ndeveloped here could be used in the quantitative analyses of the experimental\n(M-Seq) data. More broadly, our theory is likely to be useful in analyzing\ndynamic heterogeneity in complex systems such as super-cooled liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

A remarkable property of our protocol is\nthat it is passive, while existing protocols are active, namely they switch\nbetween at least two measurement settings. Since thermal noise is equivalent to\nan independent phase-flip error, our estimation protocol also works for that\nerror. By generalizing our protocol to hypergraph states, we apply our protocol\nto the quantum-computational-supremacy demonstration with instantaneous quantum\npolynomial time circuits. Our results should make the characterization of\nentangled matter qubits extremely feasible under thermal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 02:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 02:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

In general, adversarial\ntraining is believed to defend against backdoor attacks since it helps models\nto keep their prediction unchanged even if we perturb the input image (as long\nas within a feasible range). Unfortunately, few previous studies succeed in\ndoing so. To explore whether adversarial training could defend against backdoor\nattacks or not, we conduct extensive experiments across different threat models\nand perturbation budgets, and find the threat model in adversarial training\nmatters.

Edge and fog computing provide similar\nservices with lower latency but with limited capacity, capability, and\ncoverage. A single computing paradigm cannot fulfil all the requirements of IoT\ndevices and a federation between them is needed to extend their capacity,\ncapability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and\nproviders and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between\nclouds, edges, and fogs. Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the\nproblem of traffic offloading. However, in such a complex federated system,\ntraditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency requirements of\ndecision making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds.

However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces the\nfollowing challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model\ndevelopment cost, and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective\nfinetuning. This paper introduces a new technique called model reprogramming to\nbridge this gap. Model reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain\nmachine learning by repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model\nfrom a source domain to solve tasks in a target domain without model\nfinetuning, where the source and target domains can be vastly different.

Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) is seen as a promising solution to automating the process of\npenetration tests by reducing human effort and improving reliability. Existing\nRL solutions focus on finding a specific attack path to impact the target\nhosts. However, in reality, a diverse range of attack variations are needed to\nprovide comprehensive assessments of the target network's security level.\nHence, the attack agents must consider multiple objectives when penetrating the\nnetwork. Nevertheless, this challenge is not adequately addressed in the\nexisting literature. To this end, we formulate the automatic penetration\ntesting in the Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) framework and\npropose a Chebyshev decomposition critic to find diverse adversary strategies\nthat balance different objectives in the penetration test. Additionally, the\nnumber of available actions increases with the agent consistently probing the\ntarget network, making the training process intractable in many practical\nsituations. Thus, we introduce a coverage-based masking mechanism that reduces\nattention on previously selected actions to help the agent adapt to future\nexploration.

We propose to\nlearn the trellis diagram real-time using an artificial neural network (ANN)\ntrained by a pilot sequence. This approach, termed as the online learning of\ntrellis diagram (OLTD), requires neither the CSI nor statistics of the noise,\nand can be incorporated into the classic Viterbi and the BCJR algorithm.\n%Compared with the state-of-the-art ViterbiNet and BCJRNet algorithms in the\nliterature, it It is shown to significantly outperform the model-based methods\nin non-Gaussian channels.

Graph filters can be compactly written as polynomials of a\ngraph shift operator (typically, a sparse matrix description of the graph).\nThis has led to relating the properties of the filters with the spectral\nproperties of the corresponding matrix -- which encodes global structure of the\ngraph. In this work, we propose a framework that relies solely on the local\ndistribution of the neighborhoods of a graph.

Due to the intrinsic entangling of three local atomic motions: shear,\ndilatation and rotation, the precise physical process of shear band emergence\nis still an enigma. To unveil this mystery, we formulate for the first time a\ntheoretical protocol covering both affine and non-affine components of\ndeformation, to decode these highly entangled local atomic-scale events. In\ncontrast to the broad concept of shear transformation zone, plastic behavior\ncan be demonstrated comprehensively as the operative manipulation of more exact\nshear-dominated zones (SDZs), dilatation-dominated zones (DDZs) and\nrotation-dominated zones (RDZs). Their spatiotemporal evolution exhibits a\nnovel transition from synchronous motion to separate distribution at the onset\nof shear band, which is in striking resemblance with the transition from\nlaminar flow to turbulent flow in flow dynamics. The hidden mechanism is\nrevealed with the help of extreme value theory (EVT) and percolation analysis.\nAnalysis of EVT indicates dilatation is the dominant mode at the embryo of\ninitial plastic units. The percolation analysis points towards the critical\npower-law scaling nature at the transition from stochastic activation to\npercolation of plastic regions. Then the comprehensive pictures of shear\nbanding emergence are uncovered. Firstly, dilatation triggers initial shear and\nrotation in soft regions, leading to embryo of flow units, which is followed by\nthe inhomogeneous turbulent-like pattern manifesting as the secondary\nactivation of rotation in neighboring hard material. Such rotation activation\ncontributes to further perturbation, and ultimately, leads to shear band\nformation.

Moreover, without additional assumptions, the\ncausal effects are not point-identifiable due to the noise in these\nmeasurements. To this end, we study the partial identification of causal\neffects given noisy covariates, under a user-specified assumption on the noise\nlevel. The key observation is that we can formulate the identification of the\naverage treatment effects (ATE) as a robust optimization problem. This\nformulation leads to an efficient robust optimization algorithm that bounds the\nATE with noisy covariates. We show that this robust optimization approach can\nextend a wide range of causal adjustment methods to perform partial\nidentification, including backdoor adjustment, inverse propensity score\nweighting, double machine learning, and front door adjustment.

As a fundamental task in natural language\nprocessing, it is crucial to ensure the robustness of RC models. Despite the\nhigh accuracy current deep neural models have achieved in RC tasks, they are\neasily affected by spurious correlations. One solution to this problem is to\ntrain the model with counterfactually augmented data (CAD) such that it can\nlearn the causation rather than the confounding. However, no attempt has been\nmade on generating counterfactuals for RC tasks. In this paper, we formulate\nthe problem of automatically generating CAD for RC tasks from an entity-centric\nviewpoint, and develop a novel approach to derive contextual counterfactuals\nfor entities. Specifically, we exploit two elementary topological properties,\ni.e., the centrality and the shortest path, in syntactic and semantic\ndependency graphs, to first identify and then intervene on the contextual\ncausal features for entities.

For instance, most FLV APIs do not use\nanti-deepfake detection; even for those with such defenses, their effectiveness\nis concerning (e.g., it may detect high-quality synthesized videos but fail to\ndetect low-quality ones). We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the factors\nimpacting the attack performance of LiveBugger: a) the bias (e.g., gender or\nrace) in FLV can be exploited to select victims; b) adversarial training makes\ndeepfake more effective to bypass FLV; c) the input quality has a varying\ninfluence on different deepfake techniques to bypass FLV. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a customized, two-stage approach that can boost the attack\nsuccess rate by up to 70%. Further, we run proof-of-concept attacks on several\nrepresentative applications of FLV (i.e., the clients of FLV APIs) to\nillustrate the practical implications: due to the vulnerability of the APIs,\nmany downstream applications are vulnerable to deepfake.

This paper proposes a novel model of\nsequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs),\nwhere a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of\nmyopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative\nutilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and\nutility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding\na signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers\nand inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender.\nNevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out\nthat we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. $\\epsilon$-optimal) policy\nwith finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified\nformulation of the Bellman equation.\n  Our main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online\nreinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal\nsignaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the\nknowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the\nMarkov transition kernels. We design a provably efficient no-regret learning\nalgorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which\nfeatures a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. Our\nalgorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear $\\sqrt{T}$-regret\nupper bound.

By contrast, the underdamped bound acquires\ntwo additional positive terms, which characterize the local mean acceleration\nand the fluctuations of the velocity. We generalize the bound to the cases of a\nmagnetic field and anisotropic temperature, and derive a joint bound for\nseveral observables. Finally, we apply our results to biased free diffusion and\nthe Brownian gyrator (with and without magnetic field), as well as to diffusion\nin periodic potentials. In the latter case, we show that the underdamped bound\ncan be tight when taking into account the correlations between the current and\nother observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 06:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

We introduce the stabilizer\nprojector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern, and\nconstruct the test application using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather\nrobust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation.\nHowever, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing\nnumber of the stabilizer projectors.

The model shows that there are many\nroutes to achieving molecular discrimination - by varying degrees of\nflexibility and shape/chemistry complementarity - but the key ingredient is\nprecision. Harder discrimination tasks require more collective and precise\ncoaction of structure, forces and movements. Proteins can achieve this through\ncorrelated mutations extending far from a binding site, which fine-tune the\nlocalized interaction with the ligand. Thus, the solution of more complicated\ntasks is enabled by increasing the protein size, and proteins become more\nevolvable and robust when they are larger than the bare minimum required for\ndiscrimination. The model makes testable, specific predictions about the role\nof flexibility and shape mismatch in discrimination, and how evolution can\nindependently tune affinity and specificity. Thus, the proposed theory of\nspecific binding addresses the natural question of \"why are proteins so big?\".\nA possible answer is that molecular discrimination is often a hard task best\nperformed by adding more layers to the protein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 07:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 06:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 01:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

However, the problem with\npatch-level prediction is that pathologist generally annotates at image-level\nand not at patch level. Due to this limitation most of the patches may not\ncontain enough class-relevant features. Through this work, we tried to\nincorporate patch descriptive capability within the deep framework by using Bag\nof Visual Words (BoVW) as a kind of regularisation to improve generalizability.\nUsing this hypothesis, we aim to build a patch based classifier to discriminate\nbetween four classes of breast biopsy image patches (normal, benign, \\textit{In\nsitu} carcinoma, invasive carcinoma).

MDA is a challenging task due to\nthe severe domain shift, which not only exists between target and source but\nalso exists among diverse sources. Prior studies on MDA either estimate a mixed\ndistribution of source domains or combine multiple single-source models, but\nfew of them delve into the relevant information among diverse source domains.\nFor this reason, we propose a novel MDA approach, termed Pseudo Target for MDA\n(PTMDA). Specifically, PTMDA maps each group of source and target domains into\na group-specific subspace using adversarial learning with a metric constraint,\nand constructs a series of pseudo target domains correspondingly. Then we align\nthe remainder source domains with the pseudo target domain in the subspace\nefficiently, which allows to exploit additional structured source information\nthrough the training on pseudo target domain and improves the performance on\nthe real target domain. Besides, to improve the transferability of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), we replace the traditional batch normalization layer with an\neffective matching normalization layer, which enforces alignments in latent\nlayers of DNNs and thus gains further promotion. We give theoretical analysis\nshowing that PTMDA as a whole can reduce the target error bound and leads to a\nbetter approximation of the target risk in MDA settings. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate PTMDA's effectiveness on MDA tasks, as it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in most experimental settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

To do so, we want a data structure which can always\nsuggest a greedy move. In other words, we want a data structure which maintains\na set of $O(n)$ rectangles, supports queries which return where to drop the\nrectangle, and updates which insert a rectangle dropped at a certain position\nand return the height of the highest point in the updated set of rectangles.

The vacuum states of\nvariety of fields, subject to special boundary conditions, may contribute to\nnon-trivial macroscopic vacuum energy, i.e. the Casimir effect, which become an\ninterdisciplinary subject and plays an important role in a variety of fields of\nphysics. We adopt Schwinger's source theory and study the Casimir effect due to\nthe quantization of gravitation, i.e. the gravitational Casimir effect (GCE),\nin inspiraling neutron star (NS) binaries with wide separation of $10^9 \\rm m$.\nBy considering gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) arising from the spiral-in orbital\nmotion and evaluating the contributions of GEM to the vacuum energy of\ngravitons radiated during the orbital decay, we demonstrate that, when the\norbital separation of the binary decay a distance of $L$ in radial direction,\nthe GEM results in a small Casimir correction to the gravitational vacuum\nenergy, which contributes to an attractive gravitational Casimir force to the\nbinary, in addition the gravitational force. The gravitational waves (GWs),\nemitted from wide inspiraling NS binaries, locate in the low-frequency band of\n$10^{-4}-1$ Hz. For a characteristic GW frequency of $10^{-3}$ Hz, the\ngravitational Casimir correction to the signals is estimated as of the order of\n$\\sim10^{-24}$, which corresponds to a force of $10^{-20}$ N. By considering\nthat the sensitivity of space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA/eLISA\nand Taiji, can be reduced to $10^{-24}$, we would expect that LISA/eLISA and\nTaiji with sensitivity improvements give the powerful tool to detect GCE in the\nnear future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 09:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Even cloud ERP is deployed quite often these days, organizations\nsomehow still lack the knowledge of it; to be specific, there are many issues\nattached to cloud ERP implementation yet to be solved. Hence, this paper\ncompares four leading cloud ERP platforms in Australia and proposes a hybrid\ncloud ERP framework to process online purchasing transactions. By adopting a\ncase study approach, a purchasing web-based application is designed and\npresented in this paper. In general, the proposed hybrid cloud ERP framework\nand the integrated web-based purchasing application allow user companies to\nprocess online purchasing transactions with short operation time and increased\nbusiness efficiency; in the meantime, the proposed framework also reduces\nsecurity risks attached to the public cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 10:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Nonetheless, various forms\nof regularization, such as \"explicit regularization\" (via weight decay), are\noften used to avoid overfitting, especially when the data is corrupted. There\nare several challenges with explicit regularization, most notably unclear\nconvergence properties. Inspired by convergence properties of stochastic mirror\ndescent (SMD) algorithms, we propose a new method for training DNNs with\nregularization, called regularizer mirror descent (RMD). In highly\noverparameterized DNNs, SMD simultaneously interpolates the training data and\nminimizes a certain potential function of the weights. RMD starts with a\nstandard cost which is the sum of the training loss and a convex regularizer of\nthe weights. Reinterpreting this cost as the potential of an \"augmented\"\noverparameterized network and applying SMD yields RMD. As a result, RMD\ninherits the properties of SMD and provably converges to a point \"close\" to the\nminimizer of this cost. RMD is computationally comparable to stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) and weight decay, and is parallelizable in the same\nmanner. Our experimental results on training sets with various levels of\ncorruption suggest that the generalization performance of RMD is remarkably\nrobust and significantly better than both SGD and weight decay, which\nimplicitly and explicitly regularize the $\\ell_2$ norm of the weights. RMD can\nalso be used to regularize the weights to a desired weight vector, which is\nparticularly relevant for continual learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 10:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The\nelectronic structure of the MnO$_2$ chain remains almost unchanged upon\nadsorption.

We employ a method of determining the most\nsimilar tasks for selecting the best location in our network to add new nodes\nwith trainable parameters.

Existing models on the scene graph generation task\nnotoriously require tens or hundreds of labeled samples. By contrast, human\nbeings can learn visual relationships from a few or even one example. Inspired\nby this, we design a task named One-Shot Scene Graph Generation, where each\nrelationship triplet (e.g., \"dog-has-head\") comes from only one labeled\nexample. The key insight is that rather than learning from scratch, one can\nutilize rich prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose Multiple Structured\nKnowledge (Relational Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge) for the one-shot\nscene graph generation task. Specifically, the Relational Knowledge represents\nthe prior knowledge of relationships between entities extracted from the visual\ncontent, e.g., the visual relationships \"standing in\", \"sitting in\", and \"lying\nin\" may exist between \"dog\" and \"yard\", while the Commonsense Knowledge encodes\n\"sense-making\" knowledge like \"dog can guard yard\". By organizing these two\nkinds of knowledge in a graph structure, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are\nused to extract knowledge-embedded semantic features of the entities.

SGD is widely used for approximating the minimum of a cost\nfunction $Q$, as a core part of optimization and learning algorithms. Our\nalgorithms are designed for the cluster-based model, which combines\nmessage-passing and shared-memory communication layers. Processes may fail by\ncrashing, and the algorithm inside each cluster is wait-free, using only reads\nand writes.\n  For a strongly convex function $Q$, our algorithm tolerates any number of\nfailures, and provides convergence rate that yields the maximal distributed\nacceleration over the optimal convergence rate of sequential SGD.\n  For arbitrary functions, the convergence rate has an additional term that\ndepends on the maximal difference between the parameters at the same iteration.\n(This holds under standard assumptions on $Q$.) In this case, the algorithm\nobtains the same convergence rate as sequential SGD, up to a logarithmic\nfactor. This is achieved by using, at each iteration, a multidimensional\napproximate agreement algorithm, tailored for the cluster-based model.\n  The algorithm for arbitrary functions requires that at least a majority of\nthe clusters contain at least one nonfaulty process.

In AMOT,\neach camera only receives partial information from its observation, which may\nmislead cameras to take locally optimal action. Besides, the global goal, i.e.,\nmaximum coverage of objects, is hard to be directly optimized. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a coordinate-aligned multi-camera collaboration system\nfor AMOT. In our approach, we regard each camera as an agent and address AMOT\nwith a multi-agent reinforcement learning solution. To represent the\nobservation of each agent, we first identify the targets in the camera view\nwith an image detector, and then align the coordinates of the targets in 3D\nenvironment. We define the reward of each agent based on both global coverage\nas well as four individual reward terms. The action policy of the agents is\nderived with a value-based Q-network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to study the AMOT task. To train and evaluate the efficacy of our system,\nwe build a virtual yet credible 3D environment, named \"Soccer Court\", to mimic\nthe real-world AMOT scenario.

In this paper, we reveal the\nweaknesses of these strategies, i.e., they lead to the loss of predictive\ninformation when enforcing the domain invariance; and the treatment effect\nestimation performance is unstable, which heavily relies on the characteristics\nof the domain distributions and the choice of domain divergence metrics.\nMotivated by information theory, we propose to learn the Infomax and\nDomain-Independent Representations to solve the above puzzles.

These kinds of simulations are\nrequired for e.g., the numerical investigation of wear mechanisms at small\nlength scales, which is still a challenging task in engineering. The basic idea\nof the proposed algorithm is to combine the advantages of the Finite Cell\nMethod allowing for a convenient integration of heterogeneous finite element\nproblems with the eigenerosion approach to still enable the mesh-independent\nsimulation of crack propagation. The major component is to switch from finite\nsubcells to finite elements wherever the crack progresses, thereby\nautomatically adaptively refining at the crack tip by managing the newly\nappearing nodes as hanging nodes. Technically relevant problems of crack\npropagation at the microscale are mostly linked with sub-critical crack growth\nwhere the crack moves fast and stepwise with subsequent load cycles. Therefore,\ninertia may become important which is why dynamics are taken into account by\nspreading the mass of the eroded elements to the nodes to avoid a loss in mass\nresulting from the erosion procedure. Furthermore, a certain treatment for the\nfinite cell decomposition is considered in order to ensure efficiency and\naccuracy. The numerical framework as well as the voxel decomposition techniques\nare analyzed in detail in different three-dimensional numerical examples to\nshow the performance of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 14:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The path-entangled states\ncan generate higher bitrates compared to heralded single photon or entangled\nphoton schemes which are limited by the coincidence counts. The scheme involves\ndistribution of photons along multiple paths resulting in multiple bits from\none photon and avoids the limitation imposed by the detection dead time of one\ndetector.

In this\npaper, we wish to contribute to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the\nCOVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms which can cause\nreticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to\ninfluence a wider public on social media.

While debates over vaccines\nexperienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share of\nvaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited\nnumber of short periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing\nthe community structure of the re-tweets hyper-graph, we reconstruct the\nmesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and characterizing\nthe major communities of users.

We show that a pronounced non-thermal momentum distribution can\nbe created with pump pulses of suitable resonance frequencies, and discuss how\nto distinguish them from thermal states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 14:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Because the scheme is based on a\nperturbative subtraction at the level of the matrix element, with a freely\nadaptable infrared factorization scale, it can be implemented with little\neffort for any observable where the GC is relevant. The scheme depends on the\nrenormalon norm of the GC which has to be supplemented independently. We apply\nthe scheme to the fixed-order (FOPT) and contour-improved (CIPT) perturbative\nexpansions of $\\tau$ hadronic spectral function moments.

Due to their small scale (500 km in widths,\n1500 km in lengths) and short timescales ($<$ 15 s), it is unclear how\npervasive nanojets are in the solar corona. In this paper, we present IRIS and\nSDO observations of nanojets found in multiple coronal structures, namely in a\ncoronal loop powered by a blowout jet, and in two other coronal loops with\ncoronal rain. In agreement with previous findings, we observe that nanojets are\naccompanied by small nanoflare-like intensity bursts in the (E)UV, have\nvelocities of 150-250 km s$^{-1}$ and occur transversely to the field line of\norigin, which is sometimes observed to split.

This is collectively encoded by the agent's type, which is unknown\nto the principal, but randomly drawn according to a finitely-supported,\ncommonly-known probability distribution. In Bayesian principal-agent problems,\nthe principal may be better off by committing to a menu of contracts specifying\na contract for each agent's type, rather than committing to a single contract.\nThis induces a two-stage process that resembles interactions studied in\nclassical mechanism design: after the principal has committed to a menu, the\nagent first reports a type to the principal, and, then, the latter puts in\nplace the contract in the menu that corresponds to the reported type. Thus, the\nprincipal's computational problem boils down to designing a menu of contracts\nthat incentivizes the agent to report their true type and maximizes expected\nutility. Previous works showed that computing an optimal menu of contracts is\nAPX-hard. Crucially, previous works focus on menus of deterministic contracts.\nSurprisingly, we show that, if one considers menus of randomized contracts\ndefined as probability distributions over payment vectors, then an\n\"almost-optimal\" menu can be computed in polynomial time. Indeed, the problem\nof computing a principal-optimal menu of randomized contracts may not admit a\nmaximum, but only a supremum.

The existence of a maximum correlation angle ($\\theta_{max} \\gtrsim\n60^{\\circ}$) in the two-point angular temperature correlations of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) radiation, measured by WMAP and Planck, stands in\nsharp contrast to the prediction of standard inflationary cosmology, in which\nthe correlations should extend across the full sky (i.e., $180^{\\circ}$). The\nintroduction of a hard lower cutoff ($k_{min}$) in the primordial power\nspectrum, however, leads naturally to the existence of $\\theta_{max}$. Among\nother cosmological anomalies detected in these data, an apparent dominance of\nodd-over-even parity multipoles has been seen in the angular power spectrum of\nthe CMB. This feature, however, may simply be due to observational\ncontamination in certain regions of the sky.\n  Aims. In attempting to provide a more detailed assessment of whether this\nodd-over-even asymmetry is intrinsic to the CMB, we therefore proceed in this\npaper, first, to examine whether this odd-even parity imbalance also manifests\nitself in the angular correlation function and, second, to examine in detail\nthe interplay between the presence of $\\theta_{max}$ and this observed anomaly.\n  Methods.

SR refers\nto techniques that estimate high-resolution images from those in low resolution\nand has lately been applied in fluid mechanics. The rotational equivariance of\nSR models is defined as the property in which the super-resolved velocity field\nis rotated according to a rotation of the input, which leads to the inference\ncovariant to the orientation of fluid systems. Generally, the covariance in\nphysics is related to symmetries. To clarify a relationship to symmetries, the\nrotational consistency of datasets for SR is newly introduced as the invariance\nof pairs of low- and high-resolution velocity fields with respect to rotation.\nThis consistency is sufficient and necessary for SR models to acquire\nrotational equivariance from large datasets with supervised learning. Such a\nlarge dataset is not required when rotational equivariance is imposed on SR\nmodels through weight sharing of convolution kernels as prior knowledge. Even\nif a fluid system has rotational symmetry, this symmetry may not carry over to\na velocity dataset, which is not rotationally consistent. This inconsistency\ncan occur when the rotation does not commute with the generation of\nlow-resolution velocity fields.

Time delays, motivated by the gene expression process,\ncan also greatly affect the behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems. In this\ndissertation, we explore their effects on Turing pattern mechanisms. By\nincorporating time delays, modelled as both a fixed parameter and as a\ncontinuous distribution, into classical reaction-diffusion systems that exhibit\nTuring instabilities, we investigate the changing behaviour of these systems.\nWe find that an introduction of increasing time delay increases the time taken\nfor spatially inhomogeneous patterns to stabilise, and the two are related\nlinearly. We also present results to show, through a linear stability analysis,\nthat an increasing time delay can act both to expand or shrink the Turing space\nof a certain reaction-diffusion mechanism, depending on the placement of\ntime-delayed terms. Significantly, we find that modelling time delays as a\ncontinuous distribution has a negligible impact on qualitative or quantitative\naspects of the results seen compared with a fixed time delay of the mean of the\ndistribution.

We also discovered in the meantime that, in our first book\nof 1978, we had already used a new way for studying the various compatibility\nconditions (CC) of an operator that may not be necessarily formally integrable\n(FI) in order to construct canonical formally exact differential sequences on\nthe jet level. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the combination of\nthese two facts clearly shows the specific importance of the Spencer operator\nand the Spencer $\\delta$-cohomology, totally absent from mathematical physics\ntoday. The results obtained are unavoidable because they only depend on\nelementary combinatorics and diagram chasing. They also provide for the first\ntime the purely intrinsic interpretation of the respective numbers of\nsuccessive first, second, third and higher order generating CC. However, if\nthey of course agree with the linearized Killing operator over the Minkowski\nmetric, they largely disagree with recent publications on the respective\nnumbers of generating CC for the linearized Killing operator over the\nSchwarzschild and Kerr metrics. Many similar examples are illustrating these\nnew techniques, providing in particular the only symbol existing in the\nliterature which is 2-ayclic witout being of finite type, contrary to the\nconformal situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 10:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Millimetre-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz)\nbands combined with the beamforming technology offer significant performance\nenhancements for ultra-dense networks (UDNs). Unfortunately, shrinking cell\ncoverage and severe penetration loss experienced at higher spectrum render\nmobility management a critical issue in UDNs, especially optimizing beam\nblockages and frequent handover (HO). Mobility management challenges have\nbecome prevalent in city centres and urban areas. To address this, we propose a\nnovel mechanism driven by exploiting wireless signals and on-road surveillance\nsystems to intelligently predict possible blockages in advance and perform\ntimely HO. This paper employs computer vision (CV) to determine obstacles and\nusers' location and speed. In addition, this study introduces a new HO event,\ncalled block event {BLK}, defined by the presence of a blocking object and a\nuser moving towards the blocked area. Moreover, the multivariate regression\ntechnique predicts the remaining time until the user reaches the blocked area,\nhence determining best HO decision. Compared to typical wireless networks\nwithout blockage prediction, simulation results show that our BLK detection and\nPHO algorithm achieves 40\\% improvement in maintaining user connectivity and\nthe required quality of experience (QoE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}
