From interactive interfaces containing either textual or graphical\ninformation, intention to perceive desired information is subjective and\nstrongly connected with eye gaze. In this work, we determine such intention by\nanalyzing real-time eye gaze data with a low-cost regular webcam. We extracted\nunique features (e.g., Fixation Count, Eye Movement Ratio) from the eye gaze\ndata of 31 participants to generate a dataset containing 124 samples of visual\nintention for perceiving textual or graphical information, labeled as either\nTEXT or IMAGE, having 48.39% and 51.61% distribution, respectively. Using this\ndataset, we analyzed 5 classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n(Accuracy: 92.19%). Using the trained SVM, we investigated the variation of\nvisual intention among 30 participants, distributed in 3 age groups, and found\nout that young users were more leaned towards graphical contents whereas older\nadults felt more interested in textual ones. This finding suggests that\nreal-time eye gaze data can be a potential source of identifying visual\nintention, analyzing which intention aware interactive interfaces can be\ndesigned and developed to facilitate human cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

To answer, we have revisited the experimental magnetic\nsusceptibility and knight shift of four different compounds,\nLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_{1-x}$Y$_x$Cu$_2$O$_8$,\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+y}$, and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$, as a function of\ntemperature and doping. The susceptibility can be described by the same\nfunction for all materials, having a magnetic and an electronic contributions.\nThe former is the 2D antiferromagnetic (AF) square lattice response, with a\ncharacteristic temperature of magnetic correlations $T_{max}$. The latter is\nthe `Pauli' term, revealing the gap opening in the electronic density of states\nat the pseudogap temperature $T^*$.\n  From precise fits of the data, we find that $T_{max}(p)$ decreases linearly\nas a function of doping ($p$) over a wide range, but saturates abruptly in the\noverdoped regime. Concomitantly, $T^*(p)$ is {\\it linear and tangent} to the\ndome, either crossing or approaching $T_{max}(p)$ at the top of the dome,\nindicating a qualitative change of behavior from underdoped to overdoped\nregimes.\n  Contrary to the idea that the pseudogap terminates just above optimal doping,\nour analysis suggests that the gap exists throughout the phase diagram. It is\nconsistent with a pseudogap due to hole pairs, or `pairons', above $T_c$. We\nconclude that $T_{max}$, reflecting the AF magnetic correlations, has often\nbeen misinterpreted as the pseudogap temperature $T^*$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 16:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

In\nparticular, we consider void shapes with corners for which the strain energy\ndensity is singular at the corner. The elasticity problem is formulated as a\nboundary integral equation using complex potentials. By incorporating the\nasymptotic behavior of the singular elastic fields at corners of the void, we\ndevelop a numerical spectral method for determining the stress for a class of\narbitrary void shapes and corner angles. We minimize the total energy of\nsurface energy and elastic potential energy using calculus of variations to\nobtain an Euler-Lagrange equation on the boundary that is coupled to the\nelastic field. The shape of the void boundary is determined using a numerical\nspectral method that simultaneously determines the equilibrium void shape and\nsingular elastic fields. Our results show that the precise corner angles that\nminimize the total energy are not affected by the presence of the singular\nelastic fields. However, the stress singularity on the void surface at the\ncorner must be balanced by a singularity in the curvature at the corner that\neffectively changes the macroscopic geometry of the shape and effectively\nchanges the apparent corner angle. These results reconcile the apparent\ncontradiction regarding the effect of elasticity on equilibrium corner angles\nin the results of Srolovitz and Davis (2001) and Siegel, Miksis and Voorhees\n(2004), and identify an important nontrivial singular behavior associated with\ncorners on free-boundary elasticity problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 16:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 12:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

RLAs examine paper ballots cast during the\nelection to statistically assess the possibility of a disagreement between the\nwinner determined by the ballots and the winner reported by tabulation. The\nmost ballot efficient approaches proceed by \"ballot comparison.\" However,\nballot comparison requires an untrusted declaration of the contents of each\ncast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This \"cast-vote\nrecord table\" (CVR) is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. In\nmany practical settings, the cost of generating a suitable CVR dominates the\ncost of conducting the audit, preventing widespread adoption of these\nsample-efficient techniques.\n  We introduce a new RLA procedure: an \"adaptive ballot comparison\" audit. In\nthis audit, a global CVR is never produced; instead, a three-stage procedure is\niterated:\n  1) a batch is selected,\n  2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and\n  3) a ballot within the batch is sampled, inspected by auditors, and compared\nwith the CVR.\n  We prove that such an audit can achieve risk commensurate with standard\ncomparison audits while generating a fraction of the CVR. We present three main\ncontributions:\n  1) a formal adversarial model for RLAs;\n  2) definition and analysis of an adaptive audit procedure with rigorous risk\nlimits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental\nerrors arising in typical audits; and\n  3) an analysis of practical efficiency.\n  This method can be organized in rounds (as is typical for comparison audits)\nwhere sampled CVRs are produced in parallel.

However, generating\nlarge numbers of images can be costly, and plot-specific (but data independent)\nchoices can affect the SSIM value. A natural question is whether we can apply\nthe SSIM directly to the floating-point simulation data and obtain an\nindication of whether differences in the data are likely to impact a visual\nassessment, effectively bypassing the creation of a specific set of images from\nthe data. To this end, we propose an alternative to the popular SSIM that can\nbe applied directly to the floating point data, which we refer to as the Data\nSSIM (DSSIM). While we demonstrate the usefulness of the DSSIM in the context\nof evaluating differences due to lossy compression on large volumes of\nsimulation data from a popular climate model, the DSSIM may prove useful for\nmany other applications involving simulation or image data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 19:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 20:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

An appropriate solution to adversarial\nattacks is adversarial training, which reaches a trade-off between robustness\nand generalization. This paper introduces a novel framework (Layer\nSustainability Analysis (LSA)) for the analysis of layer vulnerability in an\narbitrary neural network in the scenario of adversarial attacks. LSA can be a\nhelpful toolkit to assess deep neural networks and to extend the adversarial\ntraining approaches towards improving the sustainability of model layers via\nlayer monitoring and analysis. The LSA framework identifies a list of Most\nVulnerable Layers (MVL list) of the given network. The relative error, as a\ncomparison measure, is used to evaluate representation sustainability of each\nlayer against adversarial inputs. The proposed approach for obtaining robust\nneural networks to fend off adversarial attacks is based on a layer-wise\nregularization (LR) over LSA proposal(s) for adversarial training (AT); i.e.\nthe AT-LR procedure. AT-LR could be used with any benchmark adversarial attack\nto reduce the vulnerability of network layers and to improve conventional\nadversarial training approaches.

A plethora\nof work has studied the cascading failure in power systems to calculate its\nimpact on the system. Understanding how failures propagate into the system in\ntime and space can help the system operator to take preventive actions and\nupgrade the system accordingly.

Achromatic focusing -\nassociated with traditional multi-element refractive counterparts - is\nfrequently attempted with single-layer metalens designs, which has proven\ndifficult to achieve with bounded refractive indices and total lens thickness.\nA recent study (F.Presutti and F.Monticone, 2020) formalized this, applying\noptical delay-line limitations to metalenses, resulting in a generalized\ntrade-off in achromaticity for focusing systems. In this work, we (1)\ntheoretically explore achromaticity in metalens design, and (2) propose a\nthin-film multilayer design as an alternative to the discrete meta-atom\napproach for large numerical aperture (NA) achromatic metalenses. It is shown\nthat wavefront modulation can also be achieved with spectrally-varying\ntransmission magnitudes, rather than purely matching a phase profile. In fact,\neven with a bounded refractive index, perfect achromatic operation over a given\nspectral range can be offset by imperfect operation elsewhere, resulting in a\nNA limited by the smallest general spectral feature controlled.

In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight a\nperhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can be\nquite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without any\ndelicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, we\nempirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network from\nscratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two key\nfactors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as the\noriginal dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training a\nrandomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its dense\nequivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsity\nratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be another\nimportant performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetwork\nof Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense Wide\nResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networks\noutperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such as\nout-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarial\nrobustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-expected\nroom for sparse training at scale, and the benefits of sparsity might be more\nuniversal beyond carefully designed pruning.

Given the\nforward-scattering nature of protons, we frame 3D particle transport as\nmodeling a sequence of 2D geometries in the beam's eye view. DoTA combines\nconvolutional neural networks extracting spatial features (e.g., tissue and\ndensity contrasts) with a transformer self-attention backbone that routes\ninformation between the sequence of geometry slices and a vector representing\nthe beam's energy, and is trained to predict low noise MC simulations of proton\nbeamlets using 80,000 different head and neck, lung, and prostate geometries.\nPredicting beamlet doses in 5 ms with a very high gamma pass rate of 99.37%\n(1%, 3 mm) compared to the ground truth MC calculations, DoTA significantly\nimproves upon analytical pencil beam algorithms both in precision and speed.\nOffering MC accuracy 100 times faster than PBAs for pencil beams, our model\ncalculates full treatment plan doses in 10 to 15 s depending on the number of\nbeamlets, achieving a 99.70% (2%, 2 mm) gamma pass rate across 9 test patients.\nOutperforming all previous analytical pencil beam and deep learning based\napproaches, DoTA represents a new state of the art in data-driven dose\ncalculation and can directly compete with the speed of even commercial GPU MC\napproaches. Providing the sub-second speed required for adaptive treatments,\nstraightforward implementations could offer similar benefits to other steps of\nthe radiotherapy workflow or other modalities such as helium or carbon\ntreatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2022 22:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Recent work proposed the\nuse of function names as semantic cues that can be learned by a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) to aid in the hunt for vulnerability of functions.\n  Combining identifier splitting, which splits each function name into its\nconstituent words, with a novel frequency-based algorithm, we explore the\nextent to which the words that make up a function's name can predict\npotentially vulnerable functions. In contrast to *lightweight* predictions by a\nDNN that considers only function names, avoiding the use of a DNN provides\n*featherweight* predictions. The underlying idea is that function names that\ncontain certain \"dangerous\" words are more likely to accompany vulnerable\nfunctions. Of course, this assumes that the frequency-based algorithm can be\nproperly tuned to focus on truly dangerous words.\n  Because it is more transparent than a DNN, the frequency-based algorithm\nenables us to investigate the inner workings of the DNN. If successful, this\ninvestigation into what the DNN does and does not learn will help us train more\neffective future models.\n  We empirically evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset containing\nover 73000 functions labeled vulnerable, and over 950000 functions labeled\nbenign. Our analysis shows that words alone account for a significant portion\nof the DNN's classification ability. We also find that words are of greatest\nvalue in the datasets with a more homogeneous vocabulary. Thus, when working\nwithin the scope of a given project, where the vocabulary is unavoidably\nhomogeneous, our approach provides a cheaper, potentially complementary,\ntechnique to aid in the hunt for source-code vulnerabilities.

In the common case of a Gaussian integral one can also\npre-integrate over any linear combination of variables. We propose to do that\nand we choose the first eigenvector in an active subspace decomposition to be\nthe pre-integrated linear combination.

We\nconsider the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling function in such a way that it gets\ncompatible with the event GW170817. Using suitable reconstruction technique, we\nobtain the non-trivial scalar field potential as well as the GB coupling\nfunction. Such scalar potential and GB coupling function source a smooth\nunified scenario from an ekpyrotic bounce to the dark energy era with an\nintermediate deceleration era. The occurrence of ekpyrotic contraction phase\njustifies the resolution of the anisotropic problem (also known as BKL\ninstability) in the background evolution. The Hubble radius shows an asymmetric\nbehaviour around the bounce, in particular, the evolution of the Hubble radius\nleads to the generation era of the primordial perturbation modes far before the\nbounce in the deep sub-Hubble regime. Accordingly we perform the scalar and\ntensor perturbation evolution in the present context, and as a result, the\nscalar power spectrum at large scale modes is found to be problematic. Thus an\nextended scenario is proposed where we consider a pre-ekpyrotic phase having\nthe equation of state parameter is less than unity, and re-examine the scalar\nand tensor power spectra, on large scales that cross the Hubble radius during\nthe pre-ekpyrotic stage. In this regard, the GB coupling function shows\nconsiderable effects in reducing the tensor to scalar ratio compared to the\ncase where the GB coupling is absent. Furthermore the dark energy epoch is\nconsistent with the Planck+SNe+BAO data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 03:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

We\ncharacterize every click behavior by aggregating the information of several\ninterest units to alleviate the elusive motivation problem. The attention\nmechanism determines users' preference for different interest units. By\nselecting diverse and relative triangles, TGIN brings in novel and\nserendipitous items to expand exploration opportunities of user interests.\nThen, we aggregate the multi-level interests of historical behavior sequences\nto improve CTR prediction.

A\nfirst-passage functional is defined as $V=\\int_0^{t_f} Z[x(\\tau)]$ where $t_f$\nis the first-passage time of a reset Brownian process $x(\\tau)$, i.e., the\nfirst time the process crosses zero. In here, the particle is reset to $x_R>0$\nat a constant rate $r$ starting from $x_0>0$ and we focus on the following\nfunctionals: (i) local time $T_{loc} = \\int _0^{t_f}d \\tau ~ \\delta (x-x_R)$,\n(ii) residence time $T_{res} = \\int _0^{t_f} d \\tau ~\\theta (x-x_R)$, and (iii)\nfunctionals of the form $A_n = \\int _{0}^{t_f} d \\tau [x(\\tau)]^n $ with $n\n>-2$.

A similar phenomena is also\nobserved for the moments of the functional $A_n$.

In particular, exact distribution for the\nfirst passage time under resetting (which corresponds to the $n=0$ case) is\nderived and shown to be exponential at large time limit in accordance with the\ngeneric observation. This behavioural drift from the underlying process can be\nunderstood as a ramification due to the resetting mechanism which curtails the\nundesired long Brownian first passage trajectories and leads to an accelerated\ncompletion.

In many financial models such prices can be approximated\nby means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To obtain a good approximation the MC\nsample size usually needs to be considerably large resulting in a long\ncomputing time to obtain a single approximation. In this paper we introduce a\nnew approximation strategy for parametric approximation problems including the\nparametric financial pricing problems described above. A central aspect of the\napproximation strategy proposed in this article is to combine MC algorithms\nwith machine learning techniques to, roughly speaking, learn the random\nvariables (LRV) in MC simulations. In other words, we employ stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) optimization methods not to train parameters of standard\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) but to learn random variables appearing in MC\napproximations. We numerically test the LRV strategy on various parametric\nproblems with convincing results when compared with standard MC simulations,\nQuasi-Monte Carlo simulations, SGD-trained shallow ANNs, and SGD-trained deep\nANNs. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate that the LRV strategy might\nbe capable to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the $L^\\infty$-norm in\nseveral cases where the standard deep learning approach has been proven not to\nbe able to do so. This is not a contradiction to lower bounds established in\nthe scientific literature because this new LRV strategy is outside of the class\nof algorithms for which lower bounds have been established in the scientific\nliterature.

Two-dimensional\nconfiguration is considered, and a skeletal chemical mechanism (24 species and\n104 reactions) is applied for methane combustion. The gas and particulate phase\nequations are solved using an OpenFOAM code for two-phase compressible reacting\nflow, RYrhoCentralFOAM. The effects of char combustion on methane detonation\ndynamics are investigated and devolatized coal particles are modelled. The\nresults show that propagation of the methane detonation wave in coal particle\nsuspensions are considerably affected by coal particle concentration and size.\nDetonation extinction occurs when the coal particle size is small and\nconcentration is high. The averaged lead shock speed generally decreases with\nincreased particle concentration and decreased particle size. Mean structure of\nmethane and coal particle hybrid detonation is analysed, based on the gas and\nparticle quantities. It is found that char combustion proceeds in the subsonic\nregion behind the detonation wave and heat release is relatively distributed\ncompared to that from gas phase reaction. Moreover, for 1 {\\mu}m particle, if\nthe particle concentration is beyond a threshold value, detonation\nre-initiation occurs after it is quenched at the beginning of the coal dust\nsuspensions. This is caused by hot spots from the shock focusing along the\nreaction front in a decoupled detonation and these shocks are generated from\nchar combustion behind the lead shock. A regime map of detonation propagation\nand extinction is predicted. It is found that the re-initiation location\ndecreases with the particle concentration and approaches a constant value when\nthe concentration exceeds 1000 g/m3. The results from this study are useful for\nprevention and suppression of methane/coal dust hybrid explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 08:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, the\nhigh activation barrier of breaking the O-H bond within the water molecule has\nbeen identified as the bottleneck, even for the water adsorbed on the graphene\noxide (GO). Herein, using the density functional theory calculations, we\ndemonstrate that the water molecule can be spontaneously dissociated on GO\nsupported by the (111) surface of the copper substrate (Copper-GO). This\nprocess involves a proton transferring from water to the interfacial oxygen\ngroup, and a hydroxide covalently bonding to GO. Compared to that on GO, the\nwater dissociation barrier on Copper-GO is significantly decreased to be less\nthan or comparable to thermal fluctuations. This is ascribed to the\norbital-hybridizing interaction between copper substrate and GO, which enhances\nthe reaction activity of interfacial oxygen groups along the basal plane of GO\nfor water dissociation. Our work provides a novel strategy to access water\ndissociation via the substrate-enhanced reaction activity of interfacial oxygen\ngroups on GO and indicates that the substrate can serve as an essential key to\ntuning the catalytic performance of various two-dimensional material devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 09:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 08:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The vertical buoyancy flux is such that turbulence\ntransports buoyancy along isopycnals, except in narrow layers near the the top\nand bottom boundaries, the thickness of which decreases as the diffusivities go\nto zero.

When designing an efficient network,\ntrainable layers such as the depthwise convolution is the source of efficiency\nin the number of parameters and FLOPs, but there was little improvement to the\nmodel speed in practice. This paper argues that simple built-in parameter-free\noperations can be a favorable alternative to the efficient trainable layers\nreplacing spatial operations in a network architecture. We aim to break the\nstereotype of organizing the spatial operations of building blocks into\ntrainable layers. Extensive experimental analyses based on layer-level studies\nwith fully-trained models and neural architecture searches are provided to\ninvestigate whether parameter-free operations such as the max-pool are\nfunctional. The studies eventually give us a simple yet effective idea for\nredesigning network architectures, where the parameter-free operations are\nheavily used as the main building block without sacrificing the model accuracy\nas much.

The conventional DA\nstrategy is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. Recently,\nincreasing researches have focused on self-training or other semi-supervised\nalgorithms to explore the data structure of the target domain. However, the\nbulk of them depend largely on confident samples in order to build reliable\npseudo labels, prototypes or cluster centers. Representing the target data\nstructure in such a way would overlook the huge low-confidence samples,\nresulting in sub-optimal transferability that is biased towards the samples\nsimilar to the source domain. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning method by processing low-confidence samples, which\nencourages the model to make use of the target data structure through the\ninstance discrimination process. To be specific, we create positive and\nnegative pairs only using low-confidence samples, and then re-represent the\noriginal features with the classifier weights rather than directly utilizing\nthem, which can better encode the task-specific semantic information.\nFurthermore, we combine cross-domain mixup to augment the proposed contrastive\nloss. Consequently, the domain gap can be well bridged through contrastive\nlearning of intermediate representations across domains.

The Massive Online Data Annotation (MODA) project has recently\naddressed this problem by forming a consensus from multiple such rating\nexperts, thus providing a corpus of spindle annotations of enhanced quality.\nBased on this dataset, we present a U-Net-type deep neural network model to\nautomatically detect sleep spindles. Our model's performance exceeds that of\nthe state-of-the-art detector and of most experts in the MODA dataset.

In one approach, the\ndistance between the equilibrium position and the maximal displacement is\ndivided into N equal segments. In each segment, the motion is approximated as\none with constant acceleration under the average of two forces at each end of\nthe segment. Summing up the time to cover each segment and taking a large-N\nlimit reproduce one quarter of the period for SHM. In the other approach, the\ntime moving from the maximal displacement to the equilibrium position is\ndivided into N equal intervals. The motion during each interval is approximated\nas one with constant acceleration. A second order recurrence relation for\ndisplacement is obtained. The large-N limit of its solution results in the same\nsolution obtained from solving differential equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 01:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

However, for the business which requires low\nlatency and high reliability, the cloud-based solution is not suitable, because\nof the slow response time caused by long distance data transmission. Therefore,\nto solve the problem mentioned above, in this paper, we introduce fog computing\ninto swarm of drones (FCSD). Focusing on the latency and reliability sensitive\nbusiness scenarios, the latency and reliability is constructed as the\nconstraints of the optimization problem. And in order to enhance the\npracticality of the FCSD system, we formulate the energy consumption of FCSD as\nthe optimization target function, to decrease the energy consumption as far as\npossible, under the premise of satisfying the latency and reliability\nrequirements of the task. Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm based on genetic\nalgorithm is designed to perform optimal task allocation in FCSD system. The\nsimulation results validate that the proposed fog based computation offloading\nwith the heuristic algorithm can complete the computing task effectively with\nthe minimal energy consumption under the requirements of latency and\nreliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 14:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}
