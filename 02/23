Softness, which is a machine-learned feature from local atomic\nstructures, is used to predict the microscopic activation energetics and\nlong-term dynamics. The FTS is found to originate from a change in the\ntemperature dependence of the microscopic activation energetics. Furthermore,\nresults suggest there are two diffusion channels with different energy barriers\nin BKS silica. The fast dynamics at high temperatures is dominated by the\nchannel with small energy barriers ($<\\sim$1 eV), which is controlled by the\nshort-range order. The rapid closing of this diffusion channel when lowering\ntemperature leads to the fragile behavior. On the other hand, the slow dynamics\nat low temperatures is dominated by the channel with large energy barriers\ncontrolled by the medium-range order. This slow diffusion channel changes only\nsubtly with temperature, leading to the strong behavior. The distributions of\nbarriers in the two channels show different temperature dependences, causing a\ncrossover at $\\sim$3100 K. This transition temperature in microscopic dynamics\nis consistent with the inflection point in the configurational entropy,\nsuggesting there is a fundamental correlation between microscopic dynamics and\nthermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 16:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Most existing methods have two key\nshortcomings: first, they require extensive up-front parameter tuning to each\nspecific registration problem, and second, they have difficulty capturing large\ndeformations and content mismatches between images. There have however been\ndevelopments that have laid the foundation for potential solutions to both\nshortcomings. Towards the first shortcoming, a multi-objective optimization\napproach using the Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm\n(RV-GOMEA) has been shown to be capable of producing a diverse set of\nregistrations for 2D images in one run of the algorithm, representing different\ntrade-offs between conflicting objectives in the registration problem. This\nallows the user to select a registration afterwards and removes the need for\nup-front tuning. Towards the second shortcoming, a dual-dynamic grid\ntransformation model has proven effective at capturing large differences in 2D\nimages. These two developments have recently been accelerated through GPU\nparallelization, delivering large speed-ups. Based on this accelerated version,\nit is now possible to extend the approach to 3D images. Concordantly, this work\nintroduces the first method for multi-objective 3D deformable image\nregistration, using a 3D dual-dynamic grid transformation model based on\nsimplex meshes while still supporting the incorporation of annotated guidance\ninformation and multi-resolution schemes. Our proof-of-concept prototype shows\npromising results on synthetic and clinical 3D registration problems, forming\nthe foundation for a new, insightful method that can include bio-mechanical\nproperties in the registration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 16:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

The eccentricity\nof the Earth's orbit and the orientation of its axis in the space can be\nmeasured, since Ptolemy, by knowing the exact timing of the solstices and the\nequinoxes. The dates of 1703 equinoxes and solstices have been published by\nFrancesco Bianchini in local roman mean time, referred to the local (roman)\nmean noon, i.e. after the solar meridian mean transit time. By using the\nobservations of the three lunar eclipses of 1703 we found the equation of time\nfor that year, and the UTC corresponding timings of the beginning of the\nseasons.

However, we argue that a limited number of policies\nare actually relevant when we also account for the structure of the environment\nand of the policy parameterization, as many of them would induce very similar\ninteractions, i.e., state-action distributions.

The strong stellar winds\nof these very luminous stars impact their evolution and the surrounding\nenvironment. We currently lack detailed knowledge of the wind structure that is\nneeded to quantify this impact. Aims: To observationally constrain the stellar\nand wind properties of the massive stars in R136, in particular the parameters\nrelated to wind clumping. Methods: We simultaneously analyse optical and UV\nspectroscopy of 53 O-type and 3 WNh-stars using the FASTWIND model atmosphere\ncode and a genetic algorithm. The models account for optically thick clumps and\neffects related to porosity and velocity-porosity, as well as a non-void\ninterclump medium. Results: We obtain stellar parameters, surface abundances,\nmass-loss rates, terminal velocities and clumping characteristics and compare\nthese to theoretical predictions and evolutionary models. The clumping\nproperties include the density of the interclump medium and the\nvelocity-porosity of the wind. For the first time, these characteristics are\nsystematically measured for a wide range of effective temperatures and\nluminosities. Conclusions: We confirm a cluster age of 1.0-2.5 Myr and derive\nan initial stellar mass of $\\geq 250 {\\rm M}_\\odot$ for the most massive star\nin our sample, R136a1.

We study the dynamical role of weak and moderate-to-strong toroidal\nmagnetic fields during the first hundreds of seconds of jet propagation,\nfocusing on the magnetized flow dynamics and the mechanisms of energy\nconversion. We have developed the code L\\'ostrego v1.0, a new 3D RMHD code to\nsimulate astrophysical plasmas in Cartesian coordinates. Using this tool, we\nperformed the first 3D RMHD numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized\njets propagating through the clumpy stellar wind in a HMXB. The overall\nmorphology and dynamics of weakly magnetized jet models is similar to previous\nhydrodynamical simulations, where the jet head generates a strong shock in the\nambient medium and the initial over-pressure with respect to the stellar wind\ndrives one or more recollimation shocks. In the time scales of our simulations,\nthese jets are ballistic and seem to be more stable against internal\ninstabilities than jets with the same power in the absence of fields. However,\nmoderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic fields favour the development of\ncurrent-driven instabilities and the disruption of the jet within the binary. A\ndetailed analysis of the energy distribution in the relativistic outflow and\nthe ambient medium reveals that both magnetic and internal energies can\ncontribute to the effective acceleration of the jet. We certify that the jet\nfeedback into the ambient medium is highly dependent on the jet energy\ndistribution at injection, where hotter, more dilute and/or more magnetized\njets are more efficient, as anticipated by feedback studies in the case of jets\nin active galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 19:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The projected physics reach of the detectors is\noften quantified with simulation studies. However, a complete Monte Carlo\nestimate of detector performance is costly from a computational perspective,\nrestricting the number of detector configurations considered when designing the\ninstruments. In this paper, we present a new Python-based software framework,\ntoise, which forecasts the performance of a high-energy neutrino detector using\nparameterizations of the detector performance, such as the effective areas,\nangular and energy resolutions, etc. The framework can be used to forecast\nperformance of a variety of physics analyses, including sensitivities to\ndiffuse fluxes of neutrinos and sensitivity to both transient and steady state\npoint sources. This parameterized approach reduces the need for extensive\nsimulation studies in order to estimate detector performance, and allows the\nuser to study the influence of single performance metrics, like the angular\nresolution, in isolation. The framework is designed to allow for multiple\ndetector components, each with different responses and exposure times, and\nsupports paramterization of both optical- and radio-Cherenkov (Askaryan)\nneutrino telescopes.

We reveal the driver of such dynamics as the flow of\ncurrents of Gaussian curvature of the evolving surface, rather than the\nexistence of an energetically favored target metric, as in the elastic\nanalogue. Focusing on the prototypical example of a bubble collapsing after\nrapid depressurization, we show that the spherically-shaped viscous film\nevolves via a topological instability, whose elastic analogue is forbidden by\nthe existence of an energy barrier. The topological transition brings about\ncompression within the film, triggering another, symmetry breaking instability\nand radial wrinkles that grow in amplitude and invade the flattening film.\nBuilding on an analogy between surface currents of Gaussian curvature and\npolarization in electrostatic conductors, we obtain quantitative predictions\nfor the evolution of the flattening film.

With a\nmotivation to monitor airflow from building ventilation systems through\ncommodity sensing devices, we present FlowSense, a machine learning-based\nalgorithm to predict airflow rate from sensed audio data in indoor spaces. Our\nML technique can predict the state of an air vent-whether it is on or off-as\nwell as the rate of air flowing through active vents. By exploiting a low-pass\nfilter to obtain low-frequency audio signals, we put together a\nprivacy-preserving pipeline that leverages a silence detection algorithm to\nonly sense for sounds of air from HVAC air vent when no human speech is\ndetected. We also propose the Minimum Persistent Sensing (MPS) as a\npost-processing algorithm to reduce interference from ambient noise, including\nongoing human conversation, office machines, and traffic noises.

In order to perform this inference the robot relies on an\ninternal mapping between joystick inputs and discrete tasks: e.g., pressing the\njoystick left indicates that the human wants a plate, while pressing the\njoystick right indicates a cup. This approach works well after the human\nunderstands how the robot interprets their inputs -- but inexperienced users\nstill have to learn these mappings through trial and error! Here we recognize\nthat the robot's mapping between tasks and inputs is a convention. There are\nmultiple, equally efficient conventions that the robot could use: rather than\npassively waiting for the human, we introduce a shared autonomy approach where\nthe robot actively reveals its chosen convention.

More recently, data pooling has flourished,\nmaking the result generalizable across a large population. But, this success\ndepends on the population diversity and variability introduced due to the\npooling of the data that is not a primary research interest. Here, we look at\nhierarchical Sparse Connectivity Patterns (hSCPs) as biomarkers for major\ndepressive disorder (MDD). We propose a novel model based on hSCPs to predict\nMDD patients from functional connectivity matrices extracted from resting-state\nfMRI data. Our model consists of three coupled terms. The first term decomposes\nconnectivity matrices into hierarchical low-rank sparse components\ncorresponding to synchronous patterns across the human brain. These components\nare then combined via patient-specific weights capturing heterogeneity in the\ndata. The second term is a classification loss that uses the patient-specific\nweights to classify MDD patients from healthy ones. Both of these terms are\ncombined with the third term, a robustness loss function to improve the\nreproducibility of hSCPs. This reduces the variability introduced due to site\nand population diversity (age and sex) on the predictive accuracy and pattern\nstability in a large dataset pooled from five different sites. Our results show\nthe impact of diversity on prediction performance. Our model can reduce\ndiversity and improve the predictive and generalizing capability of the\ncomponents.

In the third part of the paper, we consider the\nimplications by assuming instead an axion amplitude $a(z)$ depending on one\ncoordinate $z$ only. If such an axion field is contained within two large metal\nplates one obtains an axion-generated splitting of the eigenmodes for the\ndispersion relation. These modes yield equal, though opposite, contributions to\nthe pressure on the plates. We calculate the magnitude of the splitting effect,\nin a simple one-dimensional model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 20:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

However, specific database instances are not ideal for such\nobservations: they often include large amounts of superfluous details that are\nnot only irrelevant to understanding the query but also cause cognitive\noverload; and one specific database may not be enough. Given a relational\nquery, is it possible to provide a simple and generic \"representative\" instance\nthat (1) illustrates how the query can be satisfied, (2) summarizes all\nspecific instances that would satisfy the query in the same way by abstracting\naway unnecessary details? Furthermore, is it possible to find a collection of\nsuch representative instances that together completely characterize all\npossible ways in which the query can be satisfied? This paper takes initial\nsteps towards answering these questions. We design what these representative\ninstances look like, define what they stand for, and formalize what it means\nfor them to satisfy a query in \"all possible ways.\" We argue that this problem\nis undecidable for general domain relational calculus queries, and develop\npractical algorithms for computing a minimum collection of such instances\nsubject to other constraints.

Herein, we extend our model to\nsituations having a moderate Dean number (in the microfluidics context) while\nthe particle Reynolds number remains small. This extension allows us to capture\nchanges in the background flow that occur with increasing flow rate, namely a\nshift in local extrema towards the outside wall.

In this study, the third of a series of papers where we analyse a\nsample of SNe II observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project-I, we present\ncorrelations between their observed and physical properties. Our analysis shows\nthat explosion energy is the physical property that correlates with the highest\nnumber of parameters. We recover previously suggested relationships between the\nhydrogen-rich envelope mass and the plateau duration, and find that more\nluminous SNe II with higher expansion velocities, faster declining light\ncurves, and higher Ni masses are consistent with higher energy explosions. In\naddition, faster declining SNe II are also compatible with more concentrated Ni\nin the inner regions of the ejecta. Positive trends are found between the\ninitial mass, explosion energy, and Ni mass. While the explosion energy spans\nthe full range explored with our models, the initial mass generally arises from\na relatively narrow range. Observable properties were measured from our grid of\nmodels to determine the effect of each physical parameter on the observed SN II\ndiversity. We argue that explosion energy is the physical parameter causing the\ngreatest impact on SN II diversity, when assuming standard single-star\nevolution as in the models used in this study. The inclusion of pre-SN models\nassuming higher mass loss produces a significant increase in the strength of\nsome correlations, particularly those between the progenitor hydrogen-rich\nenvelope mass and the plateau and optically thick phase durations.

We consider an elastically-mounted NACA66 hydrofoil section\nthat is free to vibrate in the transverse flow direction. Cavitating flow\ndynamics coupled with the transverse vibration are studied at low angles of\nattack. For the numerical study, we employ a recently developed unified\nvariational fluid-structure interaction framework based on homogeneous\nmixture-based cavitation with hybrid URANS-LES turbulence modeling. We first\nvalidate the numerical implementation against experimental data for turbulent\ncavitating flow. For freely oscillating hydrofoil, we observe large-amplitude\nvibrations during unsteady partial cavitating conditions that are absent in the\nnon-cavitating flow. We identify a frequency lock-in phenomenon as the main\nsource of sustained large-amplitude vibration whereby the unsteady lift forces\nlock into a sub-harmonic of the hydrofoil natural frequency. During cavity\ncollapse and shedding, we find a periodic generation of clockwise vorticity,\nleading to unsteady lift generation.

In\nthis work, we propose an approach that integrates learning and planning, and\ncan utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and GPS\ncoordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate.\nOur method, ViKiNG, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at\nthe robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how\neasily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks\nat overhead maps for hints and attempts to evaluate the appropriateness of\nthese subgoals in order to reach the goal.

An analysis of the convergence\nof BiMSGAMP along with a study of its computational complexity is carried out.\nNumerical results show that BiMSGAMP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms,\nhighlighting the gains achieved by using the dynamic scheduling strategies and\nthe effects of the channel decoding part in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 02:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Firstly, the gap between the low-level vision task\nrepresented by rain removal and the high-level vision task represented by\nobject detection is significant, and the low-level vision task can hardly\ncontribute to the high-level vision task. Secondly, the quality of the\nderaining dataset needs to be improved. In fact, the rain lines in many\nbaselines have a large gap with the real rain lines, and the resolution of the\nderaining dataset images is generally not ideally. Meanwhile, there are few\ncommon datasets for both the low-level vision task and the high-level vision\ntask. In this paper, we explore the combination of the low-level vision task\nwith the high-level vision task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end object\ndetection network for reducing the impact of rainfall, which consists of two\ncascaded networks, an improved image deraining network and an object detection\nnetwork, respectively. We also design the components of the loss function to\naccommodate the characteristics of the different sub-networks.

It is expected to capture the\ndiscriminative geometric difference between the source neighborhood and the\ncorresponding pseudo target neighborhood for effective inlier distinction.\nSpecifically, our model consists of a matching map refinement module and an\ninlier evaluation module. In our matching map refinement module, we improve the\npoint-wise matching map estimation by integrating the matching scores of\nneighbors into it. The aggregated neighborhood information potentially\nfacilitates the discriminative map construction so that high-quality\ncorrespondences can be provided for generating the pseudo target point cloud.\nBased on the observation that the outlier has the significant structure-wise\ndifference between its source neighborhood and corresponding pseudo target\nneighborhood while this difference for inlier is small, the inlier evaluation\nmodule exploits this difference to score the inlier confidence for each\nestimated correspondence. In particular, we construct an effective graph\nrepresentation for capturing this geometric difference between the\nneighborhoods. Finally, with the learned correspondences and the corresponding\ninlier confidence, we use the weighted SVD algorithm for transformation\nestimation.

Several tens of dendrogram structures have been\nextracted in the position-position-velocity space of H13CO+, which include 21\nsmall-scale leaves and 20 larger-scale branches. Overall, their gas motions are\nsupersonic but they exhibit the interesting behavior where leaves tend to be\nless dynamically supersonic than the branches. For the larger-scale, branch\nstructures, the observed velocity-size relation (i.e., velocity\nvariation/dispersion versus size) are seen to follow the Larson scaling\nexponent while the smaller-scale, leaf structures show a systematic deviation\nand display a steeper slope. We argue that the origin of the observed\nkinematics of the branch structures is likely to be a combination of turbulence\nand gravity-driven ordered gas flows. In comparison, gravity-driven chaotic gas\nmotion is likely at the level of small-scale leaf structures. The results\npresented in our previous paper and this current follow-up study suggest that\nthe main driving mechanism for mass accretion/inflow observed in G34 varies at\ndifferent spatial scales.

In\nparticular, 1/f (frequency) noise can be a dominant noise mechanism, which\narises from Two-Level System defects (TLSs) in the circuit dielectrics and\nmaterial interfaces. Here we present a Dual-Resonator KID (DuRKID), which is\ndesigned for improved signal to noise (or noise equivalent power) relative to\n1/f-noise limited KIDs. We first show the DuRKID schematic, fabricated circuit,\nand we follow with a description of the intended operation, first measurements,\ntheory, and discussion. The circuit consists of two superconducting resonators\nsharing an electrical capacitance bridge of 4 capacitors, each of which hosts\nTLSs. The device is intended to operate using hybridization of the modes, which\ncauses TLSs to either couple to one mode or the other, depending upon which\ncapacitor they reside in. In contrast, the intended KID signal is directed to\nan inductor, and due to hybridization this causes correlated frequency changes\nin both (hybridized) modes. Therefore, one can distinguish photon signal from\nTLS frequency noise. To achieve hybridization, a TiN inductor is current biased\nto allow tuning of one bare resonator mode into degeneracy with the other and\nmeasurements show that the intended resonator modes frequency tune and\nhybridize as expected. The interresonator coupling and unintentional coupling\nof the 2 resonators to transmission lines are also characterized in\nmeasurements.

This is observed\nespecially with underrepresented demographic groups sharing similar voice\ncharacteristics.

These attacks are less powerful in terms of adversarial\ncontrol over the victim receiver location and time, but by acting at the signal\nlevel, they are not thwarted by NMA. This makes replaying/relaying attacks a\nsignificant threat for GNSS. While there are numerous investigations on\nmeaconing, the majority does not rely on actual implementation and experimental\nevaluation in real-world settings. In this work, we contribute to the\nimprovement of the experimental understanding of meaconing attacks.

Using the collected data and the causal graph,\nthe user-item-ratings and their corresponding user-item-tags are automatically\ngenerated, which provides the reasons (selected tags) why the user rates the\nitems. Descriptive statistics and baseline results regarding the CTAR dataset\nare also reported. The proposed data generation framework is not limited to\nrecommendation, and the released APIs can be used to generate customized\ndatasets for other research tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called\n{\\em Preformer}.

A\nmulti-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different\ntemporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer\nfurther designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value\ncome from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if\na key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its\nsuccessive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our Preformer outperforms other\nTransformer-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Traditional sequence-based approaches\nsuch as propagating neighboring information to gradually fill in the missing\nregions are cost-effective. But they generate less satisfactory outcomes when\ndealing with larger missing regions and texture-rich structures. Emerging deep\nlearning-based methods such as encoder-decoder networks have shown promising\nresults in natural image inpainting tasks. However, they typically need a long\ncomputational time for network training in addition to the high demand on the\nsize of datasets, which makes it difficult to be applied on often small medical\ndatasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale shadow\ninpainting framework for OCT images by synergically applying sparse\nrepresentation and deep learning: sparse representation is used to extract\nfeatures from a small amount of training images for further inpainting and to\nregularize the image after the multi-scale image fusion, while convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is employed to enhance the image quality. During the image\ninpainting, we divide preprocessed input images into different branches based\non the shadow width to harvest complementary information from different scales.\nFinally, a sparse representation-based regularizing module is designed to\nrefine the generated contents after multi-scale feature aggregation.\nExperiments are conducted to compare our proposal versus both traditional and\ndeep learning-based techniques on synthetic and real-world shadows.

This is\nachieved by employing the SNN of the first step for triplet-based deep metric\nlearning that exploits not only labeled samples but also unlabeled samples. For\nthe end-to-end training of DML-S2R, we investigate an alternate learning\nstrategy for the two steps. Due to this strategy, the encoded information in\neach step becomes a guidance for learning phase of the other step. The\nexperimental results confirm the success of DML-S2R compared to the\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised regression methods.

When present, form drag is usually the most significant\nbetween the two and in many applications, streamlining efficiently reduces or\nprevents flow separation. As studied here, when the operating fluid is water, a\npromising technique for form drag reduction is to modify the walls of the body\nwith superhydrophobic surfaces.

As a possible explanation, recent studies explored\nthe recycling hypothesis and showed that atmosphere-disk recycling is able to\nfully compensate for radiative cooling and thereby halt Kelvin-Helmholtz\ncontraction to prevent runaway gas accretion.\n  To understand the parameters that determine the efficiency of atmospheric\nrecycling, we extend our earlier studies by exploring the effects of the core\nmass, the effect of circumstellar gas on sub-Keplerian orbits (headwind), and\nthe optical depth of the surrounding gas on the recycling timescale.\nAdditionally, we analyze their effects on the size and mass of the forming\natmosphere.\n  For the explored parameter space, all simulations eventually reach an\nequilibrium where heating due to hydrodynamic recycling fully compensates\nradiative cooling. In this equilibrium, the atmosphere-to-core mass ratio stays\nwell below $10 \\, \\%$, preventing the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating\nand entering runaway gas accretion. Higher core masses cause the atmosphere to\nbecome turbulent, which further enhances recycling.\n  Even for our highest core mass of $10 \\, M_\\mathrm{Earth}$, atmosphere-disk\nrecycling is efficient enough to fully compensate for radiative cooling and\nprevent the atmosphere from becoming self-gravitating. Hence, in-situ formation\nof hot Jupiters is very unlikely, and migration of gas giants is a key process\nrequired to explain their existence.

Specifically,\nMIDGN disentangles the user's intents from two different perspectives,\nrespectively: 1) In the global level, MIDGN disentangles the user's intent\ncoupled with inter-bundle items; 2) In the Local level, MIDGN disentangles the\nuser's intent coupled with items within each bundle.\n  Meanwhile, we compare the user's intents disentangled from different views\nunder the contrast learning framework to improve the learned intents. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIDGN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by over 10.7% and 26.8%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 11:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 02:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 03:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

The collection of\na sufficient number of reliable labeled images is time consuming, complex and\ncostly in operational scenarios, and can significantly affect the final\naccuracy of CM-RSIR. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised\nCM-RSIR method that aims to: i) model mutual-information between different\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner; ii) retain the distributions of\nmodal-specific feature spaces similar to each other; and iii) define the most\nsimilar images within each modality without requiring any annotated training\nimage.

Two assumptions are often made for them, i.e. the\nstatic world assumption of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the\nexact ego-pose assumption of object tracking, respectively. However, these\nassumptions are difficult to hold in highly dynamic road scenarios where SLAM\nand object tracking become correlated and mutually beneficial. In this paper,\nDL-SLOT, a dynamic Lidar SLAM and object tracking method is proposed. This\nmethod integrates the state estimations of both the ego vehicle and the static\nand dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework,\nto realize SLAM and object tracking (SLOT) simultaneously. Firstly, we\nimplement object detection to remove all the points that belong to potential\ndynamic objects. Then, LiDAR odometry is conducted using the filtered point\ncloud. At the same time, detected objects are associated with the history\nobject trajectories based on the time-series information in a sliding window.\nThe states of the static and dynamic objects and ego vehicle in the sliding\nwindow are integrated into a unified local optimization framework. We perform\nSLAM and object tracking simultaneously in this framework, which significantly\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of SLAM in highly dynamic road scenarios\nand the accuracy of objects' states estimation.

In this\nwork, we study such hybrid algorithms and we show that classical computation,\nunless it by itself can solve the Search problem, cannot assist quantum\ncomputation.

When applied to\nautoregressive models, our algorithm has different biases than beam search has,\nwhich enables a new analysis of the role of decoding bias in autoregressive\nmodels. Empirically, we show that our adaptive tree search algorithm finds\noutputs with substantially better model scores compared to beam search in\nautoregressive models, and compared to reranking techniques in models whose\nscores do not decompose additively with respect to the words in the output. We\nalso characterise the correlation of several translation model objectives with\nrespect to BLEU.

To this end, we propose a novel method that can synthesize\nparameterized and controllable handwriting Styles for arbitrary-Length and\nOut-of-vocabulary text based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed\nSLOGAN. Specifically, we propose a style bank to parameterize the specific\nhandwriting styles as latent vectors, which are input to a generator as style\npriors to achieve the corresponding handwritten styles. The training of the\nstyle bank requires only the writer identification of the source images, rather\nthan attribute annotations. Moreover, we embed the text content by providing an\neasily obtainable printed style image, so that the diversity of the content can\nbe flexibly achieved by changing the input printed image. Finally, the\ngenerator is guided by dual discriminators to handle both the handwriting\ncharacteristics that appear as separated characters and in a series of cursive\njoins. Our method can synthesize words that are not included in the training\nvocabulary and with various new styles.

However, our bound\napplies under an estimator-dependent geometric condition (the \"offset\ncondition\") instead of the estimator-independent (but, in general,\ndistribution-dependent) Bernstein condition on which the classical theory\nrelies. Our results apply to improper prediction regimes not directly covered\nby the classical theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 12:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

In this work, we investigate the properties of symmetry energy by\nusing a hybrid star with the hadron-quark phase transition. The interaction\namong strange quark matter (SQM) in hybrid stars is based on a 3-flavor NJL\nmodel with different vector and isovector channels, while the equation of state\n(EOS) of the nuclear matter is obtained by considering the ImMDI-ST interaction\nby varying the parameters x, y, and z.

An\nellipsoid with three different axes is chosen as a testing ground for\nthree-dimensional drainage and spreading.

The physics component pertains to the laws that\ngovern the movements of the rider and his bicycle, and the neurobiological\ncomponent pertains to the mechanisms via which the central nervous system (CNS)\nuses these laws for balance control.

The central concept in this model is a computational\nsystem, implemented in the CNS, that controls a mechanical system outside the\nCNS.

Three research questions are answered by this\nstudy - What levels of awareness do Australian businesses have for BYOD\nsecurity aspects? How are employees currently responding to the security\nmechanisms applied by their organisations for mobile devices? What are the\npotential weaknesses in businesses IT networks that have a direct effect on\nBYOD security? Overall, the aim of this research is to illuminate the findings\nof these research objectives so that they can be used as a basis for building\nnew and strengthening existing BYOD security frameworks in order to enhance\ntheir effectiveness against an ever-growing list of attacks and threats\ntargeting mobile devices in a virtually driven work force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 13:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

A simple yet\neffective binary classification algorithm that follows this strategy is\ntwo-naive-Bayes (2NB), which enforces statistical parity - requiring that the\ngroups comprising the dataset receive positive labels with the same likelihood.\nIn this paper, we generalise this algorithm into N-naive-Bayes (NNB) to\neliminate the simplification of assuming only two sensitive groups in the data\nand instead apply it to an arbitrary number of groups.\n  We propose an extension of the original algorithm's statistical parity\nconstraint and the post-processing routine that enforces statistical\nindependence of the label and the single sensitive attribute. Then, we\ninvestigate its application on data with multiple sensitive features and\npropose a new constraint and post-processing routine to enforce differential\nfairness, an extension of established group-fairness constraints focused on\nintersectionalities. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NNB\nalgorithm on US Census datasets and compare its accuracy and debiasing\nperformance, as measured by disparate impact and DF-$\\epsilon$ score, with\nsimilar group-fairness algorithms.

We discuss in\nthis paper the origin of the latter effect using the framework of a non-local\nTwistable Wormlike Chain (nlTWLC). We show, by comparing all-atom simulations\ndata for DNA and RNA double helices, that the non-local couplings are of very\nsimilar nature in these two molecules: couplings between distal sites are\nstrong for tilt and twist degrees of freedom and weak for roll. We introduce\nand analyze a simple double-stranded polymer model which clarifies the origin\nof this universal distal couplings behavior.

Differently from its local counterpart, the nlTWLC is\ncharacterized by a length-scale-dependent elasticity.

By controlling and\nsynchronizing frequency sweeps, electrochemical gating and liquid flow in the\nmicrofluidic channel, we generate multidimensional datasets that enable a\nthorough investigation of the solution under study. As proof of concept, we\nfunctionalize the graphene surface in order to identify specific\nsingle-stranded DNA sequences dispersed in phosphate buffered saline solution.\nWe achieve a limit of detection of ~1 attomole per litre for a perfect match\nDNA strand and a sensitivity of ~3 dB/decade for sub-pM concentrations. These\nresults show that our devices represent a new and accurate metrological tool\nfor chemical and biological sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 14:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 09:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Self-potential and other geophysical investigations of the volcano have\nshown the existence of a well-established hydrothermal system within the summit\ncone. The present study investigates the relationship between changes in the\nhydrothermal system and eruptive activity at the summit cone of Piton de la\nFournaise. Here, we consider the depth of the hydrothermal activity section to\nbe the area where the hydrothermal flow is the most intense along its path. Ten\ncomplete-loop self-potential surveys have been analyzed through multi-scale\nwavelet tomography (MWT) to characterize depth variations of the hydrothermal\nsystem between 1993 and 2008. Our MWT models strongly support the existence of\nsix main hydrothermalflow pathways associated with the main edifice structure.\nEach of these pathways is part of the main hydrothermal system and is connected\nto the main hydrothermal reservoir at depth. In both 2006 and 2008, around\nDolomieu crater, based on our results, the hydrothermal activity sections are\nlocated between 2300 and 2500 m a.s.l., which correlate well with the elevation\nof the observed fumarole belt within the post-2007-collapse crater wall. Our\nresults show that the depths of the local hydrothermal activity sections change\nsubstantially over the investigated period. Vertical displacement of the main\npotential generation area, associated withthese hydrothermal activity sections,\nis observed on the order of several hundred meters at the transition between\nthe period of quiescence (1993--1997) and the resumption of eruptive activity\nin 1998 and 2007, respectively. From 1999 to March 2008, the hydrothermal\nsystem was consistently located at relatively shallow depths.By quantitatively\ndetermining the vertical displacement of hydrothermal fluids over 16 years, we\nidentify a significant link between hydrothermal system and magmatic activity.\nHydrothermal system depth below the surface is an indicator of the activity\nlevel (pressurization/depressurization of the volcano) within the\nshallowmagmatic systems. Thus, when used in conjunction with long term volcano\nmonitoring, this approach can contribute substantially to detection of the\nprecursory signals of changes in volcanic activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 14:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Antiprotons produced in this way may leave footprints in\nexperiments such as AMS--02. Several groups have reported an excess of events\nin the antiproton flux in the rigidity range of $10$--$20$ GV. However, the\ntheoretical modeling of baryon production is not straightforward and relies in\npart on phenomenological models in Monte Carlo event generators. In this work,\nwe assess the impact of QCD uncertainties on the spectra of antiprotons from\ndark-matter annihilation. As a proof-of-principle, we show that for a\ntwo-parameter model that depends only on the thermally-averaged annihilation\ncross section ($\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$) and the dark-matter mass ($M_\\chi$),\nQCD uncertainties can affect the best-fit mass by up to $\\sim 14 \\%$ (with\nlarge uncertainties for large DM masses), depending on the choice of $M_\\chi$\nand the annihilation channel ($b\\bar{b}$ or $W^+ W^-$), and $\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle$ by up to $\\sim 10\\%$. For comparison, changes to the underlying\ndiffusion parameters are found to be within $1\\%$--$5\\%$, and the results are\nalso quite resilient to the choice of cosmic-ray propagation model.

We address this coplanarity issue by an approach where the\ninterface is approximated via discrete level set functions. This approach is\nvery convenient from a computational point of view since in many practical\napplications the exact interface is often unknown, and only a discrete level\nset function is available. As this approach has also not be considered in the\n2D IFE methods, in this paper we present a unified framework for both 2D and 3D\ncases.

Identifying the representative protein\nstructures for protein sequences is essential for analysis of proteins at\nproteome scale.

Existing databases of mapping between structures\nand sequences are usually static that are not suitable for studying proteomes\nwith frequent gene model revisions. They often do not provide reliable and\nconsistent representative structures that maximizes sequence coverage.\nFurthermore, proteins isomers are usually not properly resolved. Results: To\novercome these difficulties, we have developed a computational pipeline called\nSeqMapPDB to provide high-quality representative PDB structures of given\nsequences. It provides mapping to structures that fully cover the sequences\nwhen available, or to the set of partial non-overlapping structural domains\nthat maximally cover the query sequence. The residue indices are accurate\nmapped and isomeric proteins are resolved. SeqMapPDB is efficient and can\nrapidly carry out proteome-wide mapping to the selected version of reference\ngenomes in real-time.

Therefore, this paper proposes a simple and universal framework\nfor generating and absorbing waves based on machine learning. This framework\ntrains neural networks to establish the transfer function between the\nfree-surface elevation on the wavemaker and the wavemaker velocity.\nSignificantly, penalty term and data augmentation techniques based on\nwave-making mechanisms are introduced to increase the generalization ability of\nneural networks, rather than pure data-driven. Therefore, once the target wave\nprofiles in front of the wavemaker are given, it can realize generating waves\nand absorbing reflected waves at the same time. Taking piston and plunger\nwavemakers as examples, an in-house numerical solver is applied to simulate\nboth wave generation and absorption. The simulated wave profiles and wave\norbital velocities are validated with analytical solutions, showing that the\nproposed framework is effective at eliminating the re-reflection wave. Then,\nthe validation for generating the solitary wave and the New-year wave is\nperformed, indicating that the generated waves agree quite well with the\ndesired wave elevation. The proposed framework can facilitate the wavemaker\ndesign in the future, and no complex theoretical derivation is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 15:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Directly applying\noff-policy algorithms to offline RL usually fails due to the extrapolation\nerror caused by the out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Previous methods tackle\nsuch problem by penalizing the Q-values of OOD actions or constraining the\ntrained policy to be close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, such methods\ntypically prevent the generalization of value functions beyond the offline data\nand also lack precise characterization of OOD data. In this paper, we propose\nPessimistic Bootstrapping for offline RL (PBRL), a purely uncertainty-driven\noffline algorithm without explicit policy constraints. Specifically, PBRL\nconducts uncertainty quantification via the disagreement of bootstrapped\nQ-functions, and performs pessimistic updates by penalizing the value function\nbased on the estimated uncertainty. To tackle the extrapolating error, we\nfurther propose a novel OOD sampling method. We show that such OOD sampling and\npessimistic bootstrapping yields provable uncertainty quantifier in linear\nMDPs, thus providing the theoretical underpinning for PBRL.

A grid\nconvergence study and an optimization of the number of discrete point light\nsources employed for some of the radiation models was carried out.

A similar\nsituation occurred in biometric security applications where the goal is to\nidentify or verify an individual using his signature or handwriting. These\nstudies do not consider the distance of the pen tip to the writing surface.\nThis is due to the fact that current acquisition devices do not provide height\nformation. However, it is quite straightforward to differentiate movements at\ntwo different heights: a) short distance: height lower or equal to 1 cm above a\nsurface of digitizer, the digitizer provides x and y coordinates. b) long\ndistance: height exceeding 1 cm, the only information available is a time stamp\nthat indicates the time that a specific stroke has spent at long distance.\nAlthough short distance has been used in several papers, long distances have\nbeen ignored and will be investigated in this paper. Methods In this paper, we\nwill analyze a large set of databases (BIOSECURID, EMOTHAW, PaHaW,\nOxygen-Therapy and SALT), which contain a total amount of 663 users and 17951\nfiles.

We therefore consider a music-generating\nalgorithm as a counterpart to a human musician, in a setting where reciprocal\ninterplay is to lead to new experiences, both for the musician and the\naudience. To obtain this behaviour, we resort to the framework of recurrent\nVariational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and learn to generate music, seeded by a human\nmusician. In the learned model, we generate novel musical sequences by\ninterpolation in latent space. Standard VAEs however do not guarantee any form\nof smoothness in their latent representation. This translates into abrupt\nchanges in the generated music sequences. To overcome these limitations, we\nregularise the decoder and endow the latent space with a flat Riemannian\nmanifold, i.e., a manifold that is isometric to the Euclidean space. As a\nresult, linearly interpolating in the latent space yields realistic and smooth\nmusical changes that fit the type of machine--musician interactions we aim for.\nWe provide empirical evidence for our method via a set of experiments on music\ndatasets and we deploy our model for an interactive jam session with a\nprofessional drummer.

Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is utilized\nas a data-driven technique to forecast this parameter at Tabriz in East\nAzerbaijan. Various input patterns, namely T min, T max, and T mean, are\nutilized for training the architecture whilst DPT is the model's output. The\nfindings indicate that, in general, ANFIS method is capable of identifying data\npatterns with a high degree of accuracy. However, the approach demonstrates\nthat processing time and computer resources may substantially increase by\nadding additional functions. Based on the results, the number of iterations and\ncomputing resources might change dramatically if new functionalities are\nincluded. As a result, tuning parameters have to be optimized inside the method\nframework. The findings demonstrate a high agreement between results by the\ndata-driven technique (machine learning method) and the observed data. Using\nthis prediction toolkit, DPT can be adequately forecasted solely based on the\ntemperature distribution of Tabriz. This kind of modeling is extremely\npromising for predicting DPT at various sites. Besides, this study thoroughly\ncompares the Bilayered Neural Network (BNN) and ANFIS models on various scales.\nWhilst the ANFIS model is extremely stable for almost all numbers of membership\nfunctions, the BNN model is highly sensitive to this scale factor to predict\nDPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 14:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 19:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

A collection of\nprinciples, algorithms, and tools has been developed for performing such tasks\nin the last decades (Pearl, 2000). One of the pervasive requirements found\nthroughout this literature is the articulation of assumptions, which commonly\nappear in the form of causal diagrams. Despite the power of this approach,\nthere are significant settings where the knowledge necessary to specify a\ncausal diagram over all variables is not available, particularly in complex,\nhigh-dimensional domains. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical modeling\ntool called cluster DAGs (for short, C-DAGs) that allows for the partial\nspecification of relationships among variables based on limited prior\nknowledge, alleviating the stringent requirement of specifying a full causal\ndiagram. A C-DAG specifies relationships between clusters of variables, while\nthe relationships between the variables within a cluster are left unspecified,\nand can be seen as a graphical representation of an equivalence class of causal\ndiagrams that share the relationships among the clusters. We develop the\nfoundations and machinery for valid inferences over C-DAGs about the clusters\nof variables at each layer of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (Pearl and Mackenzie\n2018; Bareinboim et al. 2020) - L1 (probabilistic), L2 (interventional), and L3\n(counterfactual). In particular, we prove the soundness and completeness of\nd-separation for probabilistic inference in C-DAGs. Further, we demonstrate the\nvalidity of Pearl's do-calculus rules over C-DAGs and show that the standard ID\nidentification algorithm is sound and complete to systematically compute causal\neffects from observational data given a C-DAG. Finally, we show that C-DAGs are\nvalid for performing counterfactual inferences about clusters of variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 21:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 20:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

In order to\nprovide better customer experience, retrieval based query reformulation (QR)\nsystems are widely used to reformulate those misinterpreted user queries.\nCurrent QR systems typically focus on neural retrieval model training or direct\nentities retrieval for the reformulating. However, these methods rarely focus\non query expansion and entity weighting simultaneously, which may limit the\nscope and accuracy of the query reformulation retrieval. In this work, we\npropose a novel Query Expansion and Entity Weighting method (QEEW), which\nleverages the relationships between entities in the entity catalog (consisting\nof users' queries, assistant's responses, and corresponding entities), to\nenhance the query reformulation performance.
