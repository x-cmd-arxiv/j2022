We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal\ngraphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when\nrestricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain\ntwo polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it\nis well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it\ncontains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general\ncharacterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the\ntemporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden\nconfigurations on at most five vertices.

We investigate to what extent keyword localisation\nis possible using a visually grounded speech (VGS) model. VGS models are\ntrained on unlabelled images paired with spoken captions. These models are\ntherefore self-supervised -- trained without any explicit textual label or\nlocation information. To obtain training targets, we first tag training images\nwith soft text labels using a pretrained visual classifier with a fixed\nvocabulary. This enables a VGS model to predict the presence of a written\nkeyword in an utterance, but not its location. We consider four ways to equip\nVGS models with localisations capabilities. Two of these -- a saliency approach\nand input masking -- can be applied to an arbitrary prediction model after\ntraining, while the other two -- attention and a score aggregation approach --\nare incorporated directly into the structure of the model. Masked-based\nlocalisation gives some of the best reported localisation scores from a VGS\nmodel, with an accuracy of 57% when the system knows that a keyword occurs in\nan utterance and need to predict its location. In a setting where localisation\nis performed after detection, an $F_1$ of 25% is achieved, and in a setting\nwhere a keyword spotting ranking pass is first performed, we get a localisation\nP@10 of 32%. While these scores are modest compared to the idealised setting\nwith unordered bag-of-word-supervision (from transcriptions), these models do\nnot receive any textual or location supervision. Further analyses show that\nthese models are limited by the first detection or ranking pass. Moreover,\nindividual keyword localisation performance is correlated with the tagging\nperformance from the visual classifier. We also show qualitatively how and\nwhere semantic mistakes occur, e.g. that the model locates surfer when queried\nwith ocean.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 16:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

The same mechanism that enables its success, i.e., information sharing\namong participating agents, however, also leads to the disclosure of individual\nagents' private information, which is unacceptable when sensitive data are\ninvolved. As differential privacy is becoming a de facto standard for privacy\npreservation, recently results have emerged integrating differential privacy\nwith distributed optimization. However, directly incorporating differential\nprivacy design in existing distributed optimization approaches significantly\ncompromises optimization accuracy. In this paper, we propose to redesign and\ntailor gradient methods for differentially-private distributed optimization,\nand propose two differential-privacy oriented gradient methods that can ensure\nboth rigorous epsilon-differential privacy and optimality. The first algorithm\nis based on static-consensus based gradient methods, and the second algorithm\nis based on dynamic-consensus (gradient-tracking) based distributed\noptimization methods and, hence, is applicable to general directed interaction\ngraph topologies. Both algorithms can simultaneously ensure almost sure\nconvergence to an optimal solution and a finite privacy budget, even when the\nnumber of iterations goes to infinity.

To this end,\nin this paper we propose a framework called probabilistic robustness that\nbridges the gap between the accurate, yet brittle average case and the robust,\nyet conservative worst case by enforcing robustness to most rather than to all\nperturbations. From a theoretical point of view, this framework overcomes the\ntrade-offs between the performance and the sample-complexity of worst-case and\naverage-case learning. From a practical point of view, we propose a novel\nalgorithm based on risk-aware optimization that effectively balances average-\nand worst-case performance at a considerably lower computational cost relative\nto adversarial training. Our results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN illustrate\nthe advantages of this framework on the spectrum from average- to worst-case\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 17:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 17:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 18:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

This is particularly so for calculations based on 2-\nor 4-component relativistic Hamiltonians, which often employ uncontracted basis\nsets and lead to large virtual molecular orbital (VMO) spaces. This problem may\nbe alleviated by employing a more compact set of virtual spinors than those\nprovided by the canonical Hartree-Fock (HF) set, such as those based on natural\norbitals (NOs). In this paper we describe the implementation of a module for\ngenerating NOs for correlated wavefunctions, and in particular MP2 frozen\nnatural orbitals (MP2FNOs), as a component of our novel implementation of\nrelativistic coupled cluster theory for massively parallel architectures [J.\nPototschnig et. al., J.

Our\nimplementation is capable of manipulating both complex and quaternion density\nmatrices, thus allowing for the generation of both Kramers-restricted and\nKramers-unrestricted MP2FNOs. Furthermore, NOs are re-expressed in the parent\natomic orbital (AO) basis, so that the code also makes it possible to generate\nCCSD natural orbitals in AO basis for further analysis. By investigating the\ntruncation errors of MP2FNOs for both the correlation energy and molecular\nproperties at CCSD level such as the electric field gradients at the nuclei\n(EFGs), electric dipole and quadrupole moments for hydrogen halides HX\n(X=F-Ts), and parity-violating energy differences (PV) for H$_2$Y$_2$ (Y=O-Se),\nwe find that MP2FNOs accelerate the convergence of the correlation energy in a\nroughly uniform manner across the periodic table and that, with VMO spaces\ntruncated to around half the size of the full spaces ones, it is possible to\nobtain reliable estimates for both energies and all molecular properties\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 17:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 17:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

In continuum physics such a requirement\nis fulfilled by postulating the constitutive equations which represent the\nmaterial properties of the bodies in such a way that second law of\nthermodynamics is satisfied in arbitrary processes. Such an approach, first\nassumed in some pioneering papers by Coleman and Noll \\cite{ColNol} and Coleman\nand Mizel \\cite{ColMiz}, in practice regards second law of thermodynamics as a\nrestriction on the constitutive equations, which must guarantee that any\nsolution of the balance laws satisfies also the entropy inequality. As observed\nby Muschik and Ehrentraut \\cite{MusEhr}, this is a useful operative assumption,\nbut not a consequence of general physical laws. Indeed, a different point of\nview, which regards second law of thermodynamics as a restriction on the\nthermodynamic processes, i.e., on the solutions of the system of balance laws,\nis possible. This is tantamount to assume that there are solutions of the\nbalance laws which satisfy the entropy inequality, and solutions which do not\nsatisfy it. In order to decide what is the correct approach, Muschik and\nErhentraut postulated an amendment to the second law, which makes explicit the\nevident but rather hidden assumption that in any point of the body the entropy\nproduction is zero if, and only if, this point is thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThen they proved that, given the amendment, second law of thermodynamics is\nnecessarily a restriction on the constitutive equations and not on the\nthermodynamic processes. In the present paper we revisit their proof, lighting\nup some geometric aspects which were hidden in Ref. \\cite{MusEhr}. Moreover, we\npropose an alternative formulation of second law of thermodynamics which\nincorporates the amendment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 17:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

To fulfill the potential\nimpacts, it is crucial to design quantum algorithms that utilize the\ncomputation power of the quantum computing devices. Here we present a quantum\nkernel function expansion (QKFE) algorithm for solving thermodynamic properties\nof quantum many-body systems. In this quantum algorithm, the many-body density\nof states is approximated by a kernel-Fourier expansion, whose expansion\nmoments are obtained by random state sampling and quantum interferometric\nmeasurements. As compared to its classical counterpart, namely the kernel\npolynomial method (KPM), QKFE has an exponential advantage in the cost of both\ntime and memory. In computing low temperature properties, QKFE becomes\ninefficient, as similar to classical KPM. To resolve this difficulty, we\nfurther construct a thermal ensemble and approaches the low temperature regime\nstep-by-step. For quantum Hamiltonians, whose ground states are preparable with\npolynomial quantum circuits, THEI has an overall polynomial complexity.

The\nquality of such embeddings crucially depends on whether the geometry of the\nspace matches that of the graph. Euclidean spaces are often a poor choice for\nmany types of real-world graphs, where hierarchical structure and a power-law\ndegree distribution are linked to negative curvature. In this regard, it has\nrecently been shown that hyperbolic spaces and more general manifolds, such as\nproducts of constant-curvature spaces and matrix manifolds, are advantageous to\napproximately match nodes pairwise distances.

As a result, different instruments provide different\nvalues of $T_{\\rm 90}$ for a burst. GRB 210217A is detected with different\nduration by {\\it Swift} and {\\it Fermi}.

We present the multi-wavelength\nanalysis of GRB 210217A (lying in the overlapping regime of long and short\nGRBs) to identify its actual class using multi-wavelength data.

MmWave link configuration problems often\ninvolve a search for optimal system parameter under environmental\nuncertainties, from a finite set of alternatives that are supported by the\nsystem hardware and protocol. For example, beam sweeping aims at identifying\nthe optimal beam(s) for data transmission from a discrete codebook. Selecting\nparameters such as the beam sweeping period and the beamwidth are crucial to\nachieving high overall system throughput. In this article, we motivate the use\nof the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to intelligently search out the\noptimal configuration when establishing the mmWave links. MAB is a\nreinforcement learning framework that guides a decision-maker to sequentially\nselect one action from a set of actions. As an example, we show that within the\nMAB framework, the optimal beam sweeping period, beamwidth, and beam directions\ncould be dynamically learned with sample-computational-efficient bandit\nalgorithms.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that AMSB\nneeds to be a small (but still exact) perturbation, there are two other major\nproblems remaining unsolved: first, in order to derive the chiral symmetry\nbreaking pattern, one needs to minimize the potential along a certain specific\ndirection, identifying this direction fully as an outcome is nontrivial given\nthe moduli space of degenerate vacua in the SUSY limit; second, when SUSY is\nbroken, non-holomorphic states might emerge and be relevant for determining the\nvacuum structure. In this work, we focus on SUSY QCD with $N_f\\leq N_c+1$ and\nperturb the theories using AMSB. Without minimizing the potential along a\ncertain specific direction in the moduli space, we successfully derive the\nexpected chiral symmetry breaking pattern when $N_f<N_c$. However, when\n$N_f=N_c$ and $N_f=N_c+1$, we show that tree-level AMSB would induce runaway\ndirections, along which baryon number is spontaneously broken, and the vacua\nwith broken baryon number can be deeper while the field values are not far from\nthe origin. This implies that phase transitions and/or non-holomorphic physics\nare necessary. Moreover, we perform explicit consistency checks on ultraviolet\ninsensitivity for different $N_f$ by adding the holomorphic mass term for the\nlast flavor, we find that the jump of AMSB potential indeed matches the\ncontribution from the holomorphic mass term. We also show in general that, when\ntree-level AMSB is not vanishing, the origin of the moduli space in s-confining\ntheories does not persist as a minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 19:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 10:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

This makes QD algorithms slow when used in\napplications where solution evaluations are computationally costly. A common\napproach to speed up QD algorithms is to evaluate solutions in parallel, for\ninstance by using physical simulators in robotics. Yet, this approach is\nlimited to several dozen of parallel evaluations as most physics simulators can\nonly be parallelized more with a greater number of CPUs. With recent advances\nin simulators that run on accelerators, thousands of evaluations can now be\nperformed in parallel on single GPU/TPU.

We analyzed the broadband SED of the\nstar and the high-resolution SPIRou spectra to constrain the stellar parameters\nand thus improve the accuracy of the derived planet parameters. A LSD analysis\nof the SPIRou Stokes $V$ polarized spectra detects Zeeman signatures in\nTOI-1759. We model the rotational modulation of the magnetic stellar activity\nusing a GP regression with a quasi-periodic covariance function, and find a\nrotation period of $35.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ d. We reconstruct the large-scale\nsurface magnetic field of the star using ZDI, which gives a predominantly\npoloidal field with a mean strength of $18\\pm4$ G. Finally, we perform a joint\nBayesian MCMC analysis of the TESS photometry and SPIRou RVs to optimally\nconstrain the system parameters. At $0.1176\\pm0.0013$ au from the star, the\nplanet receives $6.4$ times the bolometric flux incident on Earth, and its\nequilibrium temperature is estimated at $433\\pm14$ K. TOI-1759 b is a likely\ngas-dominated sub-Neptune with an expected high rate of photoevaporation.\nTherefore, it is an interesting target to search for neutral hydrogen escape,\nwhich may provide important constraints on the planetary formation mechanisms\nresponsible for the observed sub-Neptune radius desert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 19:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

This structure is easily\nsatisfied for vehicle routing, crew scheduling and various logistics problems\nwhere pricing is a constrained shortest path problem. The construction of such\ngraphs trades off the size/diversity of a subset of columns modeled by the\ngraphs versus the additional computational time required to solve the problems\ninduced by larger graphs.\n  Graph Generation (GG) has two computational bottlenecks. The first is\npricing. Pricing in GG and Column Generation (CG) is identical because of the\nstructure of the problems solved. The second bottleneck is the restricted\nmaster problem (RMP), which is more computationally intensive in GG than in CG\ngiven the same number of columns generated. By design GG converges in fewer\niterations than CG, and hence requires fewer calls to pricing. Therefore, when\nthe computation time of GG is dominated by pricing, as opposed to solving the\nRMP, GG converges much faster than CG in terms of time.

Coded caching\nachieves significant performance gains compared to uncoded caching schemes and\nis thus a promising technique to boost performance in future networks. In the\noriginal model introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), a server stores\nmultiple files and is connected to multiple cache-aided users through an\nerror-free shared link; once the local caches have been filled and all users\nhave sent their demand to the server, the server can start sending coded\nmulticast messages to satisfy all users' demands. A practical limitation of the\noriginal MAN model is that it halts if the server does not receive all users'\ndemands, which is the limiting case of asynchronous coded caching when the\nrequests of some users arrive with infinite delay. In this paper we formally\ndefine a coded caching system where some users are offline. We propose\nachievable and converse bounds for this novel setting and show under which\nconditions they meet, thus providing an optimal solution, and when they are to\nwithin a constant multiplicative gap of two. Interestingly, when optimality can\nbe be shown, the optimal load-memory tradeoff only depends on the number active\nusers, and not on the total (active plus offline) number of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 21:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

This challenge often requires communities to design formal\ngovernance systems from scratch. But the characteristics of successful\ninstitutional designs are unclear. Communities that are more mature and\nestablished may have more elaborate formal policy systems. Alternatively, they\nmay require less formalization precisely because of their maturity. Indeed,\nscholars often downplay the role that formal rules relative to unwritten rules,\nnorms, and values. But in a community with formal rules, decisions are more\nconsistent, transparent, and legitimate. To understand the relationship of\nformal institutions to community maturity and governance style, we conduct a\nlarge-scale quantitative analysis applying institutional analysis frameworks of\nself-governance scholar Elinor Ostrom to 80,000 communities across 3 platforms:\nthe sandbox game Minecraft, the MMO game World of Warcraft, and Reddit. We\nclassify communities' written rules to test predictors of institutional\nformalization. From this analysis we extract two major findings. First,\ninstitutional formalization, the size and complexity of an online community's\ngovernance system, is generally positively associated with maturity, as\nmeasured by age, population size, or degree of user engagement.

The uncertainties in the polarization angle of each detector set are\nrelated to a given bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ parameter. The\napproach is grounded in using a linear combination of the detector sets to\nobtain the CMB polarization signal. In addition, assuming that the\nuncertainties on the polarization angle are in the small angle limit (lower\nthan a few degrees), it is possible to derive analytic expressions to establish\nthe requirements. The methodology also accounts for possible correlations among\ndetectors, that may originate from the optics, wafers, etc. The approach is\napplied to the LiteBIRD space mission. We show that, for the most restrictive\ncase (i.e., full correlation of the polarization angle systematics among\ndetector sets), the requirements on the polarization angle uncertainties are of\naround 1 arcmin at the most sensitive frequency bands (i.e., $\\approx 150$ GHz)\nand of few tens of arcmin at the lowest (i.e., $\\approx 40$ GHz) and highest\n(i.e., $\\approx 400$ GHz) observational bands.

At the global and the telescope levels,\npolarization angle knowledge of a few arcmins is sufficient for correlated\nglobal systematic errors and can be relaxed by a factor of two for fully\nuncorrelated errors in detector polarization angle. The reported uncertainty\nlevels are needed in order to have the bias on $r$ due to systematics below the\nlimit established by the LiteBIRD collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 23:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 15:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Unfortunately, the fact that personalized IoT\nadapts to user context opens a side-channel that leaks private information\nabout the user. To that end, we start by studying the extent to which a\nmalicious eavesdropper can monitor the actions taken by an IoT system and\nextract users' private information. In particular, we show two concrete\ninstantiations (in the context of mobile phones and smart homes) of a new\ncategory of spyware which we refer to as Context-Aware Adaptation Based Spyware\n(SpyCon). Experimental evaluations show that the developed SpyCon can predict\nusers' daily behavior with an accuracy of 90.3%. The rest of this paper is\ndevoted to introducing VindiCo, a software mechanism designed to detect and\nmitigate possible SpyCon. Being new spyware with no known prior signature or\nbehavior, traditional spyware detection that is based on code signature or app\nbehavior is not adequate to detect SpyCon. Therefore, VindiCo proposes a novel\ninformation-based detection engine along with several mitigation techniques to\nrestrain the ability of the detected SpyCon to extract private information. By\nhaving general detection and mitigation engines, VindiCo is agnostic to the\ninference algorithm used by SpyCon. Our results show that VindiCo reduces the\nability of SpyCon to infer user context from 90.3% to the baseline accuracy\n(accuracy based on random guesses) with negligible execution overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 00:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

However, linking distant silicon quantum processors\nis challenging as two-qubit gates in spin qubits typically utilize short-range\nexchange coupling, which is only effective between nearest-neighbor quantum\ndots.

On the one hand, the Internet\nof things (IoT) based on ICPSs construction needs a large amount of reasonable\nnetwork resources support. On the other hand, ICPSs are facing severe network\nsecurity problems. The integration of ICPSs and network virtualization (NV) can\nprovide more efficient network resource support and security guarantees for IoT\nusers. Based on the above two problems faced by ICPSs, we propose a virtual\nnetwork embedded (VNE) algorithm with computing, storage resources and security\nconstraints to ensure the rationality and security of resource allocation in\nICPSs. In particular, we use reinforcement learning (RL) method as a means to\nimprove algorithm performance. We extract the important attribute\ncharacteristics of underlying network as the training environment of RL agent.\nAgent can derive the optimal node embedding strategy through training, so as to\nmeet the requirements of ICPSs for resource management and security. The\nembedding of virtual links is based on the breadth first search (BFS) strategy.\nTherefore, this is a comprehensive two-stage RL-VNE algorithm considering the\nconstraints of computing, storage and security three-dimensional resources.\nFinally, we design a large number of simulation experiments from the\nperspective of typical indicators of VNE algorithms.

Superconducting Single Flux\nQuantum (SFQ) is a classical logic technology with low power consumption and\nultra-high speed, and thus is a promising candidate for in-fridge classical\ncontrollers with maximized scalability. Prior work has demonstrated\nhigh-fidelity SFQ-based single-qubit gates.

Our observations show that SFQ-based two-qubit gates tend to have high\nleakage to qubit non-computational subspace, which presents severe design\nchallenges. We show that despite these challenges, we can realize gates with\nhigh fidelity by carefully designing optimal control methods and qubit\narchitectures. We develop optimal control methods that suppress leakage, and\nalso investigate various qubit architectures that reduce the leakage. After\ncarefully engineering our SFQ-friendly quantum system, we show that it can\nachieve similar gate fidelity and gate time to microwave-based quantum systems.\nThe promising results of this paper show that (1) SFQ-based universal quantum\ncomputation is both feasible and effective; and (2) SFQ is a promising approach\nin designing classical controller for quantum machines because it can increase\nthe scalability while preserving gate fidelity and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 05:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

In anticipating the\neducational challenges and opportunities of the future higher education\nenvironment, this research reflected on Generation Alpha as the next cohort of\nuniversity students, considering their preferred learning styles, perceptions\nand expectations relating to education. The research employed a theoretical\nanalysis based on the characteristics and traits that distinguishes Generation\nAlpha, spearheaded by technology advances. The empirical investigation\nconsidered three independent studies that were previous conducted by authors\nfrom Slovakia, Hungary, Australia, and Turkey to understand the challenges and\nopportunities pertaining to Generation Alpha. The research identified the\ninfluence of social media, social connections, high levels of perceptions and\nthe Generation Alpha's ability to interpret information as strengths to\nconsider in future teaching-learning approaches in the higher education\nenvironment. This research concluded with recommendations on how universities\ncould be transformed to ensure a better learning experience for Generation\nAlpha students, aligned with their characteristics, perceptions and\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 05:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

The chosen system for this\nstudy is a passively-actuated tilted Furuta pendulum, which is known to have a\nhighly non linear and coupled model. The pendulum is tilted to ensure the\nexistence of a stable equilibrium configuration for all its degrees of freedom,\nand the link weights are the only external forces applied to the system. A\nnonlinear analytical model of the pendulum is derived, and a continuous\nfriction model considering static friction, dynamic friction, viscous friction,\nand the stribeck effect is selected from the literature. A high-gain Universal\nAdaptive Stabilizer (UAS) observer is designed to identify friction model\nparameters using joint angle measurements. The methodology is tested in\nsimulation and validated on an experimental setup. Despite the high\nnonlinearity of the system, the methodology is proven to converge to the exact\nparameter values, in simulation, and to yield qualitative parameter magnitudes\nin experiments where the goodness of fit was around 85\\% on average. The\ndiscrepancy between the simulation and the experimental results is attributed\nto the limitations of the friction model. The main advantage of the proposed\nmethod is the significant reduction in computational needs and the time\nrequired relative to conventional optimization-based identification routines.\nThe proposed approach yielded more than 99\\% reduction in the estimation time\nwhile being considerably more accurate than the optimization approach in every\ntest performed. One more advantage is that the approach can be easily adapted\nto fit other models to experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 05:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

This work contrasts predictions from the Tavis-Cummings (TC) model,\nin which the material is a collection of two-level systems, with the\nimplications of considering additional energy levels with harmonic and\nanharmonic structures. We discuss the exact eigenspectrum, up to the second\nexcitation manifold, of an arbitrary number $N$ of oscillators collectively\ncoupled to a single cavity mode in the rotating-wave approximation. Elaborating\non our group-theoretic approach [New J. Phys. 23, 063081 (2021)], we simplify\nthe brute-force diagonalization of a gigantic $N^2\\times N^2$ Hamiltonian\n(where $N=10^6-10^{10}$, as experiments suggest) to the diagonalization of, at\nmost, $4\\times4$ matrices. We thoroughly discuss the eigenstates and the\nconsequences of weak and strong anharmonicities. Furthermore, we find resonant\nconditions between bipolaritons and anharmonic transitions where two-photon\nabsorption can be enhanced. Finally, we conclude that energy shifts in the\npolaritonic states induced by anharmonicities become negligible for large $N$.\nThus, calculations with a single or few emitters qualitatively fail to\nrepresent the nonlinear optical response of the collective strong coupling\nregime. Our work highlights the rich physics of multilevel anharmonic systems\ncoupled to cavities absent in standard models of quantum optics.

The most effective way to train deep SNNs is through\nANN-to-SNN conversion, which have yielded the best performance in deep network\nstructure and large-scale datasets. However, there is a trade-off between\naccuracy and latency. In order to achieve high precision as original ANNs, a\nlong simulation time is needed to match the firing rate of a spiking neuron\nwith the activation value of an analog neuron, which impedes the practical\napplication of SNN. In this paper, we aim to achieve high-performance converted\nSNNs with extremely low latency (fewer than 32 time-steps). We start by\ntheoretically analyzing ANN-to-SNN conversion and show that scaling the\nthresholds does play a similar role as weight normalization. Instead of\nintroducing constraints that facilitate ANN-to-SNN conversion at the cost of\nmodel capacity, we applied a more direct way by optimizing the initial membrane\npotential to reduce the conversion loss in each layer. Besides, we demonstrate\nthat optimal initialization of membrane potentials can implement expected\nerror-free ANN-to-SNN conversion. We evaluate our algorithm on the CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, using\nfewer time-steps. For example, we reach top-1 accuracy of 93.38\\% on CIFAR-10\nwith 16 time-steps. Moreover, our method can be applied to other ANN-SNN\nconversion methodologies and remarkably promote performance when the time-steps\nis small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 07:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

We\ndemonstrate the properties of nonlinear electromagnetic wave in a\ntwo-dimensional rectangular cavity by calculating the nonlinear correction for\ntwo classical standing waves. We apply the linear approximation in a short\ntimescale. A part of the nonlinear correction increases with time. In\nparticular, a one-dimensional second harmonic grows if the cavity size\nsatisfies a specific condition. We also analyze the nonlinear electromagnetic\nwave in a timescale longer than the applicable limit of the linear\napproximation. We formulate the self-modulation of the amplitude and phase,\nincluding the effect of static magnetic flux density. In the viewpoint of\nenergy flow between the two modes of the standing wave, the behavior of\nnonlinear electromagnetic wave can be classified into three types. Namely, the\nenergy flow keeps oscillating, eventually decreases to zero, or never occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 09:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

Currently, most trajectory forecasting methods assume\nthat object trajectories have been extracted and directly develop trajectory\npredictors based on the ground truth trajectories.

Trajectories obtained from object\ndetection and tracking are inevitably noisy, which could cause serious\nforecasting errors to predictors built on ground truth trajectories. In this\npaper, we propose a trajectory predictor directly based on detection results\nwithout relying on explicitly formed trajectories. Different from the\ntraditional methods which encode the motion cue of an agent based on its\nclearly defined trajectory, we extract the motion information only based on the\naffinity cues among detection results, in which an affinity-aware state update\nmechanism is designed to take the uncertainty of association into account. In\naddition, considering that there could be multiple plausible matching\ncandidates, we aggregate the states of them. This design relaxes the\nundesirable effect of noisy trajectory obtained from data association.\nExtensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and its\ngeneralization ability on different detectors.

One of the\nattractive features of physics-based models is that in those models (most)\nparameters have a clear physical meaning. Nevertheless, the determination of\nthese parameters is often very elaborate and costly and shows a large scatter\nwithin the population. Hence, it is essential to identify the most important\nparameter for a particular problem at hand. In order to distinguish parameters\nwhich have a significant influence on a specific model output from\nnon-influential parameters, we use sensitivity analysis, in particular the\nSobol method as a global variance-based method. However, the Sobol method\nrequires a large number of model evaluations, which is prohibitive for\ncomputationally expensive models. We therefore employ Gaussian processes as a\nmetamodel for the underlying full model. Metamodelling introduces further\nuncertainty, which we also quantify. We demonstrate the approach by applying it\nto two different problems: nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in a multiphase\ntumour-growth model, and arterial growth and remodelling. Even relatively small\nnumbers of evaluations of the full model suffice to identify the influential\nparameters in both cases and to separate them from non-influential parameters.\nThe approach also allows the quantification of higher-order interaction\neffects. We thus show that a variance-based global sensitivity analysis is\nfeasible for computationally expensive biomechanical models. Different aspects\nof sensitivity analysis are covered including a transparent declaration of the\nuncertainties involved in the estimation process.

Notably, convex RL covers several\nrelevant applications that do not fall into the scalar formulation, including\nimitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration. In classic RL, it is\ncommon to optimize an infinite trials objective, which accounts for the state\ndistribution instead of the empirical state visitation frequencies, even though\nthe actual number of trajectories is always finite in practice. This is\ntheoretically sound since the infinite trials and finite trials objectives can\nbe proved to coincide and thus lead to the same optimal policy.

These data locate on decentralized devices in modern factories.\nTo protect the confidentiality of industrial data, federated learning (FL) was\nintroduced to collaboratively train shared machine learning models. However,\nthe local data collected by different devices skew in class distribution and\ndegrade industrial FL performance. This challenge has been widely studied at\nthe mobile edge, but they ignored the rapidly changing streaming data and\nclustering nature of factory devices, and more seriously, they may threaten\ndata security. In this paper, we propose FedGS, which is a hierarchical\ncloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered industries, to improve industrial\nFL performance on non-i.i.d. data. Taking advantage of naturally clustered\nfactory devices, FedGS uses a gradient-based binary permutation algorithm\n(GBP-CS) to select a subset of devices within each factory and build\nhomogeneous super nodes participating in FL training. Then, we propose a\ncompound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process\nwithin and among these super nodes, which shows great robustness against data\nheterogeneity.

In particular, observing the final\ndeceleration phase, often poorly sampled, is fundamental to obtain a reliable\nestimate of the jet's energy. During its 2019/2020 outburst, the BH LMXB MAXI\nJ1348$-$630 launched a single-sided radio-emitting jet that was detected at\nlarge scales after a strong deceleration due to the interaction with the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). We successfully modelled the jet motion with a\ndynamical external shock model, which allowed us to constrain the jet initial\nLorentz factor $\\Gamma_0 = 1.85^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$, inclination angle $\\theta =\n29.3_{-3.2}^{+2.7}$ deg and ejection date $t_{\\rm ej} = 21.5_{-3.0}^{+1.8}$\n(MJD $-$ $58500$).

This implies that\ndiscrete ejecta radiate away only a small fraction of their total energy, which\nis instead transferred to the environment.

These processes may be important as the materials involved were abundant\nin these objects. Our model is based on the model by (Gobi & Kereszturi 2017),\nand contains improvements in the consideration of heat capacities and\nlithospheric pressure, and in the calculation of the amount of interfacial\nwater. Comparison of our results with previous calculations shows that there\nare significant differences in the e.g. the serpentinization time -- the time\nnecessary to consume most of the reactants at specific initial conditions -- or\nthe amount of heat produced by this process. In a simple application we show\nthat in icy bodies, under some realistic conditions, below the melting point of\nwater ice, serpentinization reaction using interfacial water may be able to\nproceed and eventually push the local temperature above the melting point to\nstart a 'runaway' serpentinization.

Although OPE in contextual bandits has been studied extensively,\nits naive application to the ranking setting faces a critical variance issue\ndue to the huge item space. To tackle this problem, previous studies introduce\nsome assumptions on user behavior to make the combinatorial item space\ntractable. However, an unrealistic assumption may, in turn, cause serious bias.\nTherefore, appropriately controlling the bias-variance tradeoff by imposing a\nreasonable assumption is the key for success in OPE of ranking policies.

This\npaper proposes a new optimization framework to minimize total transmit power of\nBC-NOMA cooperative vehicle-to-everything networks (V2XneT) while ensuring the\nquality of services. More specifically, the base station (BS) transmits a\nsuperimposed signal to its associated roadside units (RSUs) in the first time\nslot. Then the RSUs transmit the superimposed signal to their serving vehicles\nin the second time slot exploiting decode and forward protocol. A backscatter\ndevice (BD) in the coverage area of RSU also receives the superimposed signal\nand reflect it towards vehicles by modulating own information. Thus, the\nobjective is to simultaneously optimize the transmit power of BS and RSUs along\nwith reflection coefficient of BDs under perfect and imperfect channel state\ninformation. The problem of energy efficiency is formulated as non-convex and\ncoupled on multiple optimization variables which makes it very complex and hard\nto solve. Therefore, we first transform and decouple the original problem into\ntwo sub-problems and then employ iterative sub-gradient method to obtain an\nefficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BC-NOMA\nV2XneT provides high energy efficiency than the conventional NOMA V2XneT\nwithout BC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 13:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

Our chief motivation behind\nthis study is to assess the vacuum expectation values of $V(\\phi)$ and $\\phi$,\nboth of which can be negative, and hence may lead to some screening of the\ninflationary cosmological constant value. First using the in-in formalism, the\nrenormalised quantum correction to the cubic potential appearing in the\nenergy-momentum tensor is computed at two loop, which is the leading order in\nthis case. The quantum correction to the kinetic term at two loop are\nsubleading compared to the above result at late cosmological times.

The Henyey-Greenstein\nphase function has become the standard for describing anisotropic scattering by\ndust grains, but it is a poor representation of the real scattering phase\nfunction outside the optical range. Aims: We investigate alternatives for the\nHenyey-Greenstein phase function that would allow the scattering properties of\ndust grains to be described. Our goal is to find a balance between realism and\ncomplexity: the scattering phase function should be flexible enough to provide\nan accurate fit to the scattering properties of dust grains over a wide\nwavelength range, and it should be simple enough to be easy to handle,\nespecially in the context of radiative transfer calculations. Methods: We fit\nvarious analytical phase functions to the scattering phase function\ncorresponding to the BARE-GR-S model, one of the most popular and commonly\nadopted models for interstellar dust. We weigh the accuracy of the fit against\nthe number of free parameters in the analytical phase functions. Results: We\nconfirm that the Henyey-Greenstein phase functions poorly describe scattering\nby dust grains, particularly at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with relative\ndifferences of up to 50%. The Draine phase function alleviates this problem at\nnear-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, but not in the UV. The two-term\nReynolds-McCormick phase function, recently advocated in the context of light\nscattering in nanoscale materials and aquatic media, describes the BARE-GR-S\ndata very well, but its five free parameters are degenerate.

Currently leading\nlow-frequency surveys reach an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. However,\nthis resolution is not yet sufficient to study the more compact and distant\nsources in detail. Sub-arcsecond resolution is therefore the next milestone in\nadvancing these fields. The biggest challenge at low radio frequencies is the\nionosphere. If not adequately corrected for, ionospheric seeing blurs the\nimages to arcsecond or even arcminute scales. Additionally, the required image\nsize to map the degree-scale field of view of low-frequency radio telescopes at\nthis resolution is far greater than what typical soft- and hardware is\ncurrently capable of handling. Here we present for the first time (to the best\nof our knowledge) widefield sub-arcsecond imaging at low radio frequencies. We\nderive ionospheric corrections in a few dozen individual directions and apply\nthose during imaging efficiently using a recently developed imaging algorithm\n(arXiv:1407.1943, arXiv:1909.07226).

This\nset is called dataset in machine learning and data science. Manifold hypothesis\nstates that the dataset lies on a low-dimensional submanifold with high\nprobability. All dimensionality reduction and manifold learning methods have\nthe assumption of manifold hypothesis. In this paper, we show that the dataset\nlies on an embedded hypersurface submanifold which is locally\n$(d-1)$-dimensional. Hence, we show that the manifold hypothesis holds at least\nfor the embedding dimensionality $d-1$. Using an induction in a pyramid\nstructure, we also extend the embedding dimensionality to lower embedding\ndimensionalities to show the validity of manifold hypothesis for embedding\ndimensionalities $\\{1, 2, \\dots, d-1\\}$. For embedding the hypersurface, we\nfirst construct the $d$ nearest neighbors graph for data. For every point, we\nfit an osculating hypersphere $S^{d-1}$ using its neighbors where this\nhypersphere is osculating to a hypothetical hypersurface. Then, using surgery\ntheory, we apply surgery on the osculating hyperspheres to obtain $n$\nhyper-caps. We connect the hyper-caps to one another using partial\nhyper-cylinders. By connecting all parts, the embedded hypersurface is obtained\nas the disjoint union of these elements. We discuss the geometrical\ncharacteristics of the embedded hypersurface, such as having boundary, its\ntopology, smoothness, boundedness, orientability, compactness, and injectivity.\nSome discussion are also provided for the linearity and structure of data.

The interaction wrenches that arise from\ncontact are used to steer the robot Center of Mass (CoM) and reject\nperturbations that make the system deviate from the desired trajectory and\noften make them fall. The feasibility of a given control target (desired CoM\nwrench or acceleration) is conditioned by the contact point distribution,\nground friction, and actuation limits. In this work, we develop a method to\ncompute the set of feasible wrenches that a legged robot can exert on its CoM\nthrough contact. The presented method can be used with any amount of\nnon-co-planar contacts and takes into account actuation limits and limitations\nbased on an inelastic contact model with Coulomb friction. This is exemplified\nwith a planar biped model standing with the feet at different heights.\nExploiting assumptions from the contact model, we explain how to compute the\nset of wrenches that are feasible on the CoM when the contacts remain in\nposition as well as the ones that are feasible when some of the contacts are\nbroken. Therefore, this method can be used to assess whether a switch in\ncontact configuration is feasible while achieving a given control task.\nFurthermore, the method can be used to identify the directions in which the\nsystem is not actuated (i.e. a wrench cannot be exerted in those directions).\nWe show how having a joint be actuated or passive can change the non-actuated\nwrench directions of a robot at a given pose using a spatial model of a\nlower-extremity exoskeleton. Therefore, this method is also a useful tool for\nthe design phase of the system.

The\nH$\\alpha$ is characterised by two emission components, one at $+3000$ km/s and\na second at $-7500$ km/s, with a third, near-zero velocity component appearing\nafter a delay. The blue and central components can be described by Gaussian\nprofiles of intermediate width, but the red component is significantly broader\nand Lorentzian.

We performed 3D MHD simulations that describe the\nremnant evolution from the SN to its interaction with a circumstellar shell.\nThe initial conditions are provided by a 3D neutrino-driven SN model whose\nmorphology resembles Cas A. We explored the parameter space of the shell,\nsearching for a set of parameters able to produce reverse shock asymmetries at\nthe age of 350 years analogous to those observed in Cas A. The interaction of\nthe remnant with the shell can produce asymmetries resembling those observed in\nthe reverse shock if the shell was asymmetric with the densest portion in the\nnearside to the northwest (NW). The reverse shock shows the following\nasymmetries at the age of Cas A: i) it moves inward in the observer frame in\nthe NW region, while it moves outward in other regions; ii) the geometric\ncenter of the reverse shock is offset to the NW from the geometric center of\nthe forward shock; iii) the reverse shock in the NW region has enhanced\nnonthermal emission because, there, the ejecta enter the reverse shock with a\nhigher velocity (between 4000 and 7000 km/s) than in other regions (below 2000\nkm/s).

Extensive\nefforts have been made recently to develop smart skin-like sensors to extend\nthe capabilities of biological skins; however, simultaneous sensing of several\ntypes of stimuli in a large area remains challenging because this requires\nlarge-scale sensor integration with numerous wire connections. We propose a\nsimple, highly sensitive, and multimodal sensing approach, which does not\nrequire integrating multiple sensors. The proposed approach is based on an\noptical interference technique, which can encode the information of various\nstimuli as a spatial pattern. In contrast to the existing approach, the\nproposed approach, combined with a deep neural network, enables us to freely\nselect the sensing mode according to our purpose. As a key example, we\ndemonstrate simultaneous sensing mode of three different physical quantities,\ncontact force, contact location, and temperature, using a single soft material\nwithout requiring complex integration. Another unique property of the proposed\napproach is spatially continuous sensing with ultrahigh resolution of few tens\nof micrometers, which enables identifying the shape of the object in contact.\nFurthermore, we present a haptic soft device for a human-machine interface.

Most importantly, the proposed\nAP-mMIMO is suited for the varying block fading channel scenario. To deal with\nsuch scenarios, we consider a two-stage precoding scheme: 1) a NN-precoder is\nused to address the PA non-linearities and 2) a linear precoder is used to\nsuppress the multiuser interference. The NN-precoder and the receive decoder\nare trained off-line and when the channel varies, only the linear precoder\nchanges on-line.

The proposed scheme is analyzed with\ndifferent distance cases, device scenarios, and modulation schemes. The bit\nerror rate (BER) performance analysis concludes that a performance gain of more\nthan 4 dB is achieved at the BER of 0:004 for the proposed double\nthreshold-based ODS scheme compared to the existing ODS scheme at a high signal\nto noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the proposed scheme enhances the physical\nlayer security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 15:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

It is used to allow the sending of hidden information\nthrough communication channels where third parties would only be aware of the\nexplicit information in the carrier message. With the growth of internet\nsurveillance and the increased need for secret communication, steganography\nsystems continue to find new applications. In semantic steganography, the\nredundancies in the semantics of a language are used to send a text\nsteganographic message. In this article we go over the concepts behind semantic\nsteganography and propose a hierarchy for classifying systems within the\ncontext of text steganography and steganography in general. After laying this\ngroundwork we list systems for semantic steganography that have been published\nin the past and review their properties. Finally, we comment on and briefly\ncompare the described systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 15:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

These algorithms simulate natural selection to explore a\nparameter space in search of solutions for a broad variety of problems. In this\npaper, we explore the effects of introducing temporal heterogeneity in genetic\nalgorithms. In particular, we set the crossover probability to be inversely\nproportional to the individual's fitness, i.e., better solutions change slower\nthan those with a lower fitness. As case studies, we apply heterogeneity to\nsolve the $N$-Queens and Traveling Salesperson problems. We find that temporal\nheterogeneity consistently improves search without having prior knowledge of\nthe parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 22:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}
