Its testing metrics,\ne.g., mean-average precision, count on a sorted candidate list ordered by\npair-wise code similarity. However, scarcely does one train a deep hashing\nmodel with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable\nnature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of\ntraining and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss\noften fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper, we tackle\nthis problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming\ndistances of samples' hash codes and accordingly gather their latent\nrepresentations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in\ndifferentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from\nthe sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training\nprocedure. Additionally, we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive\nEstimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative\nsamples for contrastive learning, which allows NSH to mine data semantic\nrelations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments\nshow the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised\nhashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 16:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 11:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Where classical control approaches require a priori\nsystem knowledge, data-driven control approaches like RL allow a model-free\ncontroller design procedure, rendering them emergent techniques for systems\nwith changing plant structures and varying parameters. While it was already\nshown in various applications that the transient control behavior for complex\nsystems can be sufficiently handled by RL, the challenge of non-vanishing\nsteady-state control errors remains, which arises from the usage of control\npolicy approximations and finite training times. To overcome this issue, an\nintegral action state augmentation (IASA) for actor-critic-based RL controllers\nis introduced that mimics an integrating feedback, which is inspired by the\ndelta-input formulation within model predictive control. This augmentation does\nnot require any expert knowledge, leaving the approach model free. As a result,\nthe RL controller learns how to suppress steady-state control deviations much\nmore effectively. Two exemplary applications from the domain of electrical\nenergy engineering validate the benefit of the developed method both for\nreference tracking and disturbance rejection.

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) have shown promising performance in optical flow estimation and have been\nadopted for USE displacement estimation. Networks trained on computer vision\nimages are not optimized for USE displacement estimation since there is a large\ngap between the computer vision images and the high-frequency Radio Frequency\n(RF) ultrasound data. Many researchers tried to adopt the optical flow CNNs to\nUSE by applying transfer learning to improve the performance of CNNs for USE.\nHowever, the ground truth displacement in real ultrasound data is unknown, and\nsimulated data exhibits a domain shift compared to the real data and is also\ncomputationally expensive to generate.

It does so using simplicial complexes, where\nrelationships between climbers are captured through simplexes that correspond\nto joint previous expeditions with dimension given by the number of climbers\nminus one and weight given by the number of occurrences of the simplex. First,\nthis analysis establishes the importance of relationships and shows that\nchances of failure to summit reduce drastically when climbing with repeat\npartners.

An axion\nfield coupled to electromagnetism predicts a nearly frequency-independent\nbirefringence angle, $\\beta_\\nu = \\beta$, while Faraday rotation from local\nmagnetic fields and Lorentz violating theories predict a cosmic birefringence\nangle that is proportional to the frequency, $\\nu$, to the power of some\ninteger $n$, $\\beta_\\nu \\propto \\nu^n$. In this work, we first sample\n$\\beta_\\nu$ individually for each polarized HFI frequency band in addition to\nthe 70 GHz channel from the LFI. We also constrain a power-law formula for the\nbirefringence angle, $\\beta_\\nu=\\beta_0(\\nu/\\nu_0)^n$, with $\\nu_0 = 150$ GHz.\nFor a nearly full-sky measurement, $f_{\\text{sky}}=0.93$, we find $\\beta_0 =\n0.26^{\\circ}\\pm0.11^\\circ$ $(68\\% \\text{ C.L.})$ and $n=-0.45^{+0.61}_{-0.82}$\nwhen we ignore the intrinsic $EB$ correlations of the polarized foreground\nemission, and $\\beta_0 = 0.33^\\circ \\pm 0.12^\\circ$ and\n$n=-0.37^{+0.49}_{-0.64}$ when we use a filamentary dust model for the\nforeground $EB$. Next, we use all the polarized Planck maps, including the 30\nand 44 GHz frequency bands. These bands have a negligible foreground\ncontribution from polarized dust emission. We, therefore, treat them\nseparately. Without any modeling of the intrinsic $EB$ of the foreground, we\ngenerally find that the inclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz frequency bands raises\nthe measured values of $\\beta_\\nu$ and tightens $n$. At nearly full-sky, we\nmeasure $\\beta_0=0.29^{\\circ+0.10^\\circ}_{\\phantom{\\circ}-0.11^\\circ}$ and\n$n=-0.35^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$. Assuming no frequency dependence, we measure\n$\\beta=0.33^\\circ \\pm 0.10^\\circ$. If our measurements have effectively\nmitigated the $EB$ of the foreground, our constraints are consistent with a\nmostly frequency-independent signal of cosmic birefringence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 16:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 09:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Replacing carbon by hydrogen as the\nreductant offers a pathway to reduce emissions. However, production of hydrogen\nusing renewable energy will remain a bottlenecks, because making the annual\ncrude steel production of 1.8 billion tons sustainable requires a minimum\namount of ~97 million tons of green hydrogen per year. Another fundamental\naspect to make ironmaking sector more sustainable lies in an optimal\nutilization of green hydrogen and energy, thus reducing efforts for costly\nin-process hydrogen recycling. We therefore demonstrate here how the efficiency\nin hydrogen and energy consumption during iron ore reduction can be\ndramatically improved by the knowledge-based combination of two technologies:\npartially reducing the ore at low temperature via solid-state direct reduction\n(DR) to a kinetically defined degree, and subsequently melting and completely\ntransforming it to iron under a reducing plasma (i.e. via hydrogen plasma\nreduction, HPR). Results suggest that an optimal transition point between these\ntwo technologies occurs where their efficiency in hydrogen utilization is\nequal. We found that the reduction of hematite through magnetite into wustite\nvia DR is clean and efficient, but it gets sluggish and inefficient when iron\nforms at the outermost layers of the iron ore pellets. Conversely, HPR starts\nviolent and unstable with arc delocalization, but proceeds smoothly and\nefficiently when processing semi-reduced oxides. We performed hybrid reduction\nexperiments by partially reducing hematite pellets via DR at 700{\\deg}C to 38%\nglobal reduction (using a standard thermogravimetry system) and subsequently\ntransferring them to HPR, conducted with a gas mixture of Ar-10%H2 in an\narc-melting furnace, to achieve conversion into liquid iron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 17:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

A 3D scene graph describes the environment as a layered\ngraph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction\nand edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve\nas an advanced \"mental model\" for robots, how to build such a rich\nrepresentation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes\na real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D\nscene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop\nreal-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as\nthe robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local Euclidean\nSigned Distance Function (ESDF) around the current robot location, extract a\ntopological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms\nusing an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second\ncontribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D\nscene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical\ndescriptors for loop closure detection; our descriptors capture statistics\nacross layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance to\nsummary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first\nalgorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our\napproach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all\nlayers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed Spatial Perception System\ninto a architecture named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level\nperception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on\nsimulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with\nan accuracy comparable with batch offline methods despite running online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 17:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

The\ncurrent state-of-the-art gearbox fault diagnosis algorithms rely on statistical\nor machine learning methods based on fault signatures that have been defined by\nhuman analysts. This has multiple disadvantages. Defining the fault signatures\nby human analysts is a time-intensive process that requires highly detailed\nknowledge of the gearbox composition. This effort needs to be repeated for\nevery new turbine, so it does not scale well with the increasing number of\nmonitored turbines, especially in fast growing portfolios.

We perform a suite of\n960 direct $N$-body simulations of SCs, orbiting within a range of spherical\nbackground potentials fit to ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy simulations. We\nfind only two scenarios that come close to explaining EriII's SC.

In this\nmodel, the high ellipticity of EriII's SC is set at birth, with the lack of\ntidal forces in the core allowing its ellipticity to remain frozen in for long\ntimes. In the second, EriII's SC orbits in a partial core, with its high\nellipticity owing to its imminent tidal destruction. However, this latter model\nstruggles to reproduce the large size of EriII's SC, and it predicts\nsubstantial tidal tails around EriII's SC that should have already been seen in\nthe data. This leads us to favour the cored model. We discuss potential caveats\nto these findings, and the implications of the cored model for galaxy formation\nand the nature of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 18:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 09:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

In a similar way, the DRSR for\nM_{T_{cc}^{0^+}}/M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}} calibrated to M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}} gives\nM_{T_{cc}^{0^+}}= 3883(3) MeV. The SU3 breaking ratios M_{T_{ccss}^{0^+}}/\nM_{T_{cc}^{0^+}} lead to the improved mass predictions:\nM_{T_{ccss}^{0^+}}=3988(12) MeV. In the 3rd part, the analysis is extended to\nthe beauty mesons, where we find the tetramole masses : M_{ T_{Z_b}}=10579(99)\nMeV and M_{X_b}=10545(131) MeV. We also observe that the T^{1^+,0^+}_{bbqq'}\nstates are (almost) stable (within the errors) against strong interactions. In\nthe 4th part, we (critically) review and correct some recent LSR estimates of\nthe T^{1^+,0^+}_{QQqq'} masses.

Holographically, these fast erasure processes can be depicted by\ngeneralized AdS-Vaidya geometries described previously in which no assumption\nof specific form of bulk matter is needed. We show that the quantum null energy\ncondition gives analytic results for the minimal finite temperature needed for\nthe deletion which is larger than the initial background temperature in\nconsistency with Landauer's principle. In particular, we find a simple\nexpression for the minimum final temperature needed for the erasure of a large\nnumber of encoding qubits. We also find that if the encoding qubits are\nlocalized over an interval shorter than a specific localization length, then\nthe fast erasure process is impossible, and furthermore this localization\nlength is the largest for an optimal amount of encoding qubits determined by\nthe central charge. We estimate the optimal encoding qubits for realistic\nprotection against fast erasure. We discuss possible generalizations of our\nstudy for novel constructions of fault-tolerant quantum gates operating at\nfinite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Also, it is well known that a LL in proximity to a superconductor\n(SC) shows enhancement in TDOS in the vicinity of the junction in the zero\nenergy limit. In this paper, we study the interplay of nonlocal density-density\ninteraction and superconducting correlations in the TDOS in the vicinity of the\nSC-LL junction, where the LL maybe realized on the edge of an integer or a\nfractional quantum Hall state. We show that the TDOS enhancement in a LL\nquantum wire (QW) due to superconducting correlation at the junction can be\nfarther amplified in presence of appropriate choice of non-local interaction\nparameters, which is demonstrated through a neat algebraic expression in the\nweak interaction limit.

Previous methods focus on learning embedding networks for identity and\npose disentanglement which proves to be a rather hard task, degrading the\nquality of the generated images. We take a different approach, bypassing the\ntraining of such networks, by using (fine-tuned) pre-trained GANs which have\nbeen shown capable of producing high-quality facial images. Because GANs are\ncharacterized by weak controllability, the core of our approach is a method to\ndiscover which directions in latent GAN space are responsible for controlling\nfacial pose and expression variations. We present a simple pipeline to learn\nsuch directions with the aid of a 3D shape model which, by construction,\nalready captures disentangled directions for facial pose, identity and\nexpression. Moreover, we show that by embedding real images in the GAN latent\nspace, our method can be successfully used for the reenactment of real-world\nfaces. Our method features several favorable properties including using a\nsingle source image (one-shot) and enabling cross-person reenactment.

The student network is trained to emulate the behavior of the\nteacher on training input samples, which, in turn, contain images that do not\ninclude any damaged regions. Therefore, the student network only learns the\ndistribution of no damage data and would have different behavior from the\nteacher network-facing damages. To detect damage, we utilize the difference\nbetween features generated by two networks using a defined score function that\ndemonstrates the probability of damages occurring.

However,\nmost of these studies were performed in healthy volunteers. In addition,\nvalidating PT using ECG as a reference can be problematic because both PT and\nECG tend to be unreliable in patients with arrhythmias. Purpose: We seek to\nevaluate the accuracy and reliability of the cardiac and respiratory signals\nextracted from PT in patients clinically referred for cardiovascular MRI with\nthe image-derived signals as the reference. Methods: Twenty-three patients were\nscanned on a 1.5 T scanner using balanced steady-state free-precession\nreal-time (RT) cine sequence. The PT signal was generated by a built-in PT\ntransmitter integrated within the body array coil. For comparison, commercial\nECG and BioMatrix (BM) respiratory sensor signals were synchronously recorded.\nResults: The respiratory motion extracted from PT correlated positively with\nthe image-derived respiratory signal in all cases and showed a stronger\ncorrelation (absolute coefficient: 0.95+-0.09) than BM (0.72+-0.24). For the\ncardiac signal, PT trigger jitter (standard deviation of PT trigger locations\nrelative to ECG triggers) ranged from 6.6 to 83.3 ms, with a median of 21.8 ms.\nThe mean absolute difference between the PT and corresponding ECG cardiac cycle\nduration was less than 5% of the averaged ECG RR interval for 21 out of 23\npatients. Overall, the performance of PT-based trigger extraction was\ncomparable to that of ECG. We did not observe significant linear dependence\n(p>0.28) of PT delay and PT jitter on the patients' BMI or cardiac cycle\nduration. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of PT to monitor\nboth respiratory and cardiac motion in patients clinically referred for\ncardiovascular MRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 20:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

WFI observations of faint, diffuse\nsources will be limited by uncertainty in the background produced by\nhigh-energy particles. These particles produce easily identified \"cosmic-ray\ntracks\" along with signals from secondary photons and electrons generated by\nparticle interactions with the instrument. The signal from these secondaries is\nidentical to the X-rays focused by the optics, and cannot be filtered without\nalso eliminating these precious photons. As part of a larger effort to\nunderstand the WFI background, we here present results from a study of\nbackground-reduction techniques that exploit the spatial correlation between\ncosmic-ray particle tracks and secondary events. We use Geant4 simulations to\ngenerate a realistic particle background, sort this into simulated WFI frames,\nand process those frames in a similar way to the expected flight and ground\nsoftware to produce a WFI observation containing only particle background. The\ntechnique under study, Self Anti-Coincidence or SAC, then selectively filters\nregions of the detector around particle tracks, turning the WFI into its own\nanti-coincidence detector. We show that SAC is effective at improving the\nsystematic uncertainty for observations of faint, diffuse sources, but at the\ncost of statistical uncertainty due to a reduction in signal. If sufficient\npixel pulse-height information is telemetered to the ground for each frame,\nthen this technique can be applied selectively based on the science goals,\nproviding flexibility without affecting the data quality for other science.

In such cases, the\nexisting methods are insufficient to describe the data structure. This paper\nproposes a Joint mUlti-linear and nonLinear IdentificAtion (JULIA) framework\nfor large-scale tensor completion. JULIA unifies the multi-linear and nonlinear\ntensor completion models with several advantages over the existing methods: 1)\nFlexible model selection, i.e., it fits a tensor by assigning its values as a\ncombination of multi-linear and nonlinear components; 2) Compatible with\nexisting nonlinear tensor completion methods; 3) Efficient training based on a\nwell-designed alternating optimization approach. Experiments on six real\nlarge-scale tensors demonstrate that JULIA outperforms many existing tensor\ncompletion algorithms. Furthermore, JULIA can improve the performance of a\nclass of nonlinear tensor completion methods. The results show that in some\nlarge-scale tensor completion scenarios, baseline methods with JULIA are able\nto obtain up to 55% lower root mean-squared-error and save 67% computational\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 20:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

The\nemerging smart city technology such as monitoring cameras provides an\nunprecedented opportunity to address the data issue. However, estimating the\nwater accumulation on the land surface based on the monitoring footage is\nunreliable using the traditional segmentation technique because the boundary of\nthe water accumulation, under the influence of varying weather, background, and\nillumination, is usually too fuzzy to identify, and the oblique angle and image\ndistortion in the video monitoring data prevents georeferencing and\nobject-based measurements.

However,\nthere has been a lot of interest recently in quantum phase transitions occuring\nin finite size systems such as a single two-level system interacting with a\nsingle bosonic mode e.g. in the Quantum Rabi Model (QRM). Since, these phase\ntransitions occur at a finite system size, the traditional FSS method is\nrendered inapplicable for these cases. For cases like this, we propose an\nalternative FSS method in which the truncation of the system is done in the\nHilbert space instead of the physical space.

Here\nboth the curse of dimensionality ($d\\gg 1$) and the lack of domain knowledge\nwith $\\Omega$ potentially irregular and/or disconnected are confounding factors\nfor sampling-based methods. Na\\\"{i}ve approaches often lead to wasted samples\nand inefficient approximation schemes. For example, uniform sampling can result\nin upwards of 20\\% wasted samples in some problems. In surrogate model\nconstruction in computational uncertainty quantification (UQ), the high cost of\ncomputing samples needs a more efficient sampling procedure. In the last years,\nmethods for computing such approximations from sample data have been studied in\nthe case of irregular domains. The advantages of computing sampling measures\ndepending on an approximation space $P$ of $\\dim(P)=N$ have been shown.

It is shown that the dynamic model of the compliant robot\nincludes not only matched but also mismatched disturbances that act on the\nsystem through a different channel from the control input. To tackle this\ncomplex robust control problem, the unified robust motion controller is\nsynthesised by employing a second-order Disturbance Observer (DOb), which\nallows us to estimate not only disturbances but also their first and second\norder derivatives, and a novel controller design approach in state space.

While deep-learning-based methods have simplified\nthe optimization by end-to-end training, they fail to generalize well to blurs\nunseen in the training dataset. Thus, training image-specific models is\nimportant for higher generalization. Deep image prior (DIP) provides an\napproach to optimize the weights of a randomly initialized network with a\nsingle degraded image by maximum a posteriori (MAP), which shows that the\narchitecture of a network can serve as the hand-crafted image prior. Different\nfrom the conventional hand-crafted image priors that are statistically\nobtained, it is hard to find a proper network architecture because the\nrelationship between images and their corresponding network architectures is\nunclear.

This\npaper formalizes the question using the theory of reference priors. Reference\npriors are objective, uninformative Bayesian priors that maximize the mutual\ninformation between the task and the weights of the model. Such priors enable\nthe task to maximally affect the Bayesian posterior, e.g., reference priors\ndepend upon the number of samples available for learning the task and for very\nsmall sample sizes, the prior puts more probability mass on low-complexity\nmodels in the hypothesis space. This paper presents the first demonstration of\nreference priors for medium-scale deep networks and image-based data. We\ndevelop generalizations of reference priors and demonstrate applications to two\nproblems. First, by using unlabeled data to compute the reference prior, we\ndevelop new Bayesian semi-supervised learning methods that remain effective\neven with very few samples per class. Second, by using labeled data from the\nsource task to compute the reference prior, we develop a new pretraining method\nfor transfer learning that allows data from the target task to maximally affect\nthe Bayesian posterior.

Using nearly circular bound\norbits of stars, we obtain a simple formula for the precession rate.

We clarify that each\nsublattice has specific types of confined states, which in turn leads to an\ninteresting spatial pattern in the local magnetizations in the weak coupling\nregime.

These results imply that a\nferrimagnetically ordered state is realized even in the weak coupling limit.\nThe introduction of the Coulomb interaction lifts the macroscopic degeneracy at\nthe Fermi level, and induces finite staggered magnetization as well as uniform\nmagnetization. Likewise, the spatial distribution of the magnetizations\ncontinuously changes with increasing interaction strength. The crossover\nbehavior in the magnetically ordered states is also addressed in terms of the\nperpendicular space analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 03:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

B) if the portion of other agents who have chosen A exceeds (falls\nshort of) her threshold, and updates to B (resp. A) otherwise. We define the\nstate of the population dynamics as the distribution over the thresholds of\nthose who have chosen A. We show that the population can admit several\nminimally positively invariant sets, where the solution trajectory oscillates.\nWe explicitly characterize a class of positively invariant sets, prove their\ninvariance, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for their\nstability. Our results highlight the possibility of non-trivial, complex\noscillations in the absence of noise and population structure and shed light on\nthe reported oscillations in nature and human societies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 05:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 13:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-11"}

Further complexity is introduced when multiple\nhazards occur simultaneously, such as a flood evacuation taking place amid a\nviral pandemic that requires physical distancing. Such multi-hazard events can\nnecessitate a nuanced navigation of competing decision-making strategies\nwherein a desire to follow peers is weighed against contagion risks. To better\nunderstand these nuances, we distributed an online survey during a pandemic\nsurge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern\nstates in the United States with high risk of flooding.

Here, we frame the problem of parking search in a very\ngeneric, but mathematically compact formulation which puts the focus on the\nrole of the street network and the unequal attractiveness of parking spaces.\nThis problem is solved in two independent ways, valid in any street network and\nfor a wide range of drivers' behaviours. Numerically, this is done by means of\na computationally efficient and versatile agent-based model. Analytically, we\nleverage the machinery of Statistical Physics and Graph Theory to derive a\ngeneric mean-field relation giving the parking search time as a function of the\noccupancy of parking spaces; an expression for the latter is obtained in the\nstationary regime. We show that these theoretical results are applicable in toy\nnetworks as well as in complex, realistic cases such as the large-scale street\nnetwork of the city of Lyon, France. Taken as a whole, these findings clarify\nthe parameters that directly control the search time and provide transport\nengineers with a quantitative grasp of the parking problem. Besides, they\nestablish formal connections between the parking issue in realistic settings\nand physical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 07:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 13:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Recent success in isolating molecularly thin hybrid\nperovskite nanosheets and their intriguing edge phenomena have raised the need\nfor understanding the role of edges and the properties that dictate their\nfundamental behaviours. In this work, we perform a prototypical study on the\nedge effects in ultrathin hybrid perovskites by considering monolayer\n(BA)$_2$PbI$_4$ as a representative system. Based on first-principles\nsimulations of nanoribbon models, we show that in addition to significant\ndistortions of the octahedra network at the edges, strong edge stresses are\nalso present in the material. Structural instabilities that arise from the edge\nstress could drive the relaxation process and dominate the morphological\nresponse of edges in practice. A clear downward shift of the bands at the\nnarrower ribbons, as indicative of the edge effect, facilitates the separation\nof photo-excited carriers (electrons move towards the edge and holes move\ntowards the interior part of the nanosheet). Moreover, the desorption energy of\nthe organic molecule can also be much lower at the free edges, making it easier\nfor functionalization and/or substitution events to take place. The findings\nreported in this work elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for edge\nstates in HRPPs and will be important in guiding the rational design and\ndevelopment of high-performance layer$-$edge devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 09:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Machine learning methods have\nthe potential to learn the behavior of interacting particle systems by\ncombining experiments with data analysis methods. However, most existing\nalgorithms focus on learning the kinetics at the particle level. Learning\npairwise interaction, e.g., pairwise force or pairwise potential energy,\nremains an open challenge. Here, we propose an algorithm that adapts the Graph\nNetworks framework, which contains an edge part to learn the pairwise\ninteraction and a node part to model the dynamics at particle level. Different\nfrom existing approaches that use neural networks in both parts, we design a\ndeterministic operator in the node part that allows to precisely infer the\npairwise interactions that are consistent with underlying physical laws by only\nbeing trained to predict the particle acceleration. We test the proposed\nmethodology on multiple datasets and demonstrate that it achieves superior\nperformance in inferring correctly the pairwise interactions while also being\nconsistent with the underlying physics on all the datasets. The proposed\nframework is scalable to larger systems and transferable to any type of\nparticle interactions, contrary to the previously proposed purely data-driven\nsolutions.

Since the principal ratio compares the extreme\nvalues of the principal eigenvector it is sensitive to outliers. This can be\nproblematic for graphs (networks) drawn from empirical data. To account for\nthis we consider the dispersion of the principal eigenvector (and degree\nvector). More precisely, we consider the coefficient of variation of the\naforementioned vectors, that is, the ratio of the vector's standard deviation\nand mean. We show how both of these statistics are bounded above by the same\nfunction of the principal ratio. Further this bound is sharp for regular\ngraphs. The goal of this paper is to show that the coefficient of variation of\nthe principal eigenvector (and degree vector) can converge or diverge to the\nprincipal ratio in the limit.

We show that randomly\nreshuffling real scientometric data (varying numbers of citations) amongst\ninstitutions of varying size, while maintaining the volume of their research\noutputs, has little effect on their departmental h-index. This suggests that\nthe relative position in ratings based on the collective h-index is determined\nnot only by quality (impact) of particular research outputs but by their\nvolume. Therefore, the application of the collective h-index in its original\nform is disputable as a basement for comparison at aggregated levels such as to\nresearch groups, institutions or journals.

High-throughput\nexperimental data and Big Data promise to open new windows on complex systems\nsuch as cells, the brain or our societies. Yet, the puzzling success of\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning shows that we still have a poor\nconceptual understanding of learning. These applications push statistical\ninference into uncharted territories where data is high-dimensional and scarce,\nand prior information on \"true\" models is scant if not totally absent. Here we\nreview recent progress on understanding learning, based on the notion of\n\"relevance\". The relevance, as we define it here, quantifies the amount of\ninformation that a dataset or the internal representation of a learning machine\ncontains on the generative model of the data. This allows us to define\nmaximally informative samples, on one hand, and optimal learning machines on\nthe other. These are ideal limits of samples and of machines, that contain the\nmaximal amount of information about the unknown generative process, at a given\nresolution (or level of compression). Both ideal limits exhibit critical\nfeatures in the statistical sense: Maximally informative samples are\ncharacterised by a power-law frequency distribution (statistical criticality)\nand optimal learning machines by an anomalously large susceptibility. The\ntrade-off between resolution (i.e. compression) and relevance distinguishes the\nregime of noisy representations from that of lossy compression. These are\nseparated by a special point characterised by Zipf's law statistics. This\nidentifies samples obeying Zipf's law as the most compressed loss-less\nrepresentations that are optimal in the sense of maximal relevance. Criticality\nin optimal learning machines manifests in an exponential degeneracy of energy\nlevels, that leads to unusual thermodynamic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 11:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Specifically, we\nstudy the performance of the method for the two-qubit, two-qutrit, and\ntwo-ququart entangled state. In addition, we investigate the properties of the\nlocal depolarization and the generalized amplitude damping channel in the\nframework of the confusion scheme. Within our approach and setting the\nparameterization of special trajectories, we obtain an entanglement-breakdown\n'phase diagram' of a quantum channel, which indicates regions of entangled\n(separable) states and the entanglement-breakdown region. Then we extend the\nway of using the 'learning by confusion' scheme for recognizing whether an\narbitrary given state is entangled or separable. We show that the developed\nmethod provides correct answers for a variety of states, including entangled\nstates with positive partial transpose. We also present a more practical\nversion of the method, which is suitable for studying entanglement breakdown in\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We demonstrate its performance using\nan available cloud-based IBM quantum processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 11:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 05:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

Such studies have relied on\nnumerical simulations to demonstrate the improved bandwidth of the bi-stable\nabsorbers. In this work, we aim to understand how the shape of the bi-stable\nrestoring force influences the effective bandwidth of the absorber. To this\nend, we use perturbation methods to obtain an approximate analytical solution\nof the nonlinear differential equations governing the complex motion of the\nabsorber under harmonic wave excitations. The approximate solution is validated\nagainst a numerical solution obtained via direct integration of the equations\nof motion. Using a local stability analysis of the equations governing the slow\nmodulation of the amplitude and phase of the response, the loci of the\ndifferent bifurcation points are determined as function of the wave frequency\nand amplitude. Those bifurcation points are then used to define an effective\nbandwidth of the absorber. The influence of the shape of the restoring force on\nthe effective bandwidth is also characterized by generating design maps that\ncan be used to predict the kind of response behavior (small amplitude periodic,\nlarge amplitude periodic, or aperiodic) for any given combination of wave\namplitude and frequency. Such maps are critical towards designing efficient\nbi-stable PWAs for known wave conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 11:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

The eruption originates from a small-scale loop\ncomplex commonly known as a Coronal Bright Point (CBP). The event is uniquely\nrecorded in both the imaging and spectroscopic data taken with IRIS. We analyse\nIRIS spectroscopic and slit-jaw imaging observations as well as images taken in\nthe extreme-ultraviolet channels of AIA, and line-of-sight magnetic-field data\nfrom HMI onboard the SDO. We also employ an NLFFF relaxation approach based on\nthe HMI magnetogram time series. We identify a strong small-scale brightening\nas a micro-flare in a CBP. The mini-eruption manifests with the ejection of hot\n(CBP loops) and cool (mini-filament) plasma recorded in both the imaging and\nspectroscopic data. The micro-flare is preceded by the appearance of an\nelongated bright feature in the IRIS slit-jaw 1400 A images located above the\npolarity inversion line. The micro-flare starts with an IRIS pixel size\nbrightening and propagates bi-directionally along the elongated feature. We\ndetect in both the spectral and imaging IRIS data and AIA data, strong flows\nalong and at the edges of the elongated feature which we believe represent\nreconnection outflows. Both edges of the elongated feature that wrap around the\nedges of the erupting MF evolve into a J-type shape creating a sigmoid\nappearance. A quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) is identified in the vicinity of the\npolarity inversion line by computing the squashing factor Q in different\nhorizontal planes of the NLFFF model.

Even\nthough the fRG is an exact formulation, a naive application of the fRG equation\nwould miss contributions from the $\\theta$ term due to the differential nature\nof the formulation. We first review this quantum mechanical system on $S^1$\nthat is solvable with both the path integral and the canonical quantization. We\ndiscuss how to construct the quantum effective action including the $\\theta$\ndependence. Such an explicit calculation poses a subtle question of whether a\nLegendre transform is well defined or not for general systems with the sign\nproblem. We then consider a deformed theory to relax the integral winding by\nintroducing a wine-bottle potential with the finite depth $\\propto g$, so that\nthe original $S^1$ theory is recovered in the $g\\to\\infty$ limit.

Remaining faithful to the deterministic approach, we extend the\noriginal work by the introduction of (a) an asymmetric influence of the players\nin their surrounding area, (b) the frictional forces to the players' motion,\nand (c) the simultaneous combination of both effects. The asymmetric influence\nis fairly intuitive; players have more control in the direction they are\nrunning than any other direction. The sharper the turn they must make to reach\na point on the pitch, the weaker their control of that point will be. From\nsimple kinematical laws, this effect can be quantified explicitly. For the\nfrictional force, a portion comes from air resistance, and so will be\nproportional to the square of the player's speed, as is well known from fluid\ndynamics. There are no other external frictional forces, but, at the suggestion\nof biokinematics, there is an internal frictional force, relating to the\nconsumption of energy by the muscles, which is proportional to the player's\nspeed.\n  Although these additions are intuitively understood, mathematically they\nintroduce many analytical complexities.

Based on the homophily assumption, the\ncurrent message passing always aggregates features of connected nodes, such as\nthe graph Laplacian smoothing process. However, real-world graphs tend to be\nnoisy and/or non-smooth. The homophily assumption does not always hold, leading\nto sub-optimal results. A revised message passing method needs to maintain each\nnode's discriminative ability when aggregating the message from neighbors. To\nthis end, we propose a Memory-based Message Passing (MMP) method to decouple\nthe message of each node into a self-embedding part for discrimination and a\nmemory part for propagation. Furthermore, we develop a control mechanism and a\ndecoupling regularization to control the ratio of absorbing and excluding the\nmessage in the memory for each node. More importantly, our MMP is a general\nskill that can work as an additional layer to help improve traditional GNNs\nperformance.

There have been a variety of\ndifferent models of this effect and recently it has been experimentally\nobserved. However, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the role of\nscattering on harmonic generation in graphene. In this work, we model\nthird-harmonic generation in doped monolayer graphene at THz frequencies by\nemploying a nearest-neighbour tight-binding model in the length gauge. We\ninclude optical phonon and neutral impurity scattering at the microscopic\nlevel, and examine the effects of scattering on the third harmonic response.

To solve such problem, most approaches either rely on\nweight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the joint\ntask distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields\ncomprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an\narbitrary order into an unordered task set.

Higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) extends the SVD and can\napproximate higher order data using sums of a few rank-one components.

One can generalize matrices and tensors\nover t-scalars and then extend many canonical matrix and tensor algorithms,\nincluding HOSVD, to obtain higher-performance versions.

THOSVD also unifies a wide range\nof principal component analysis algorithms. To exploit the potential of\ngeneralized algorithms using t-scalars for approximating images, we use a pixel\nneighborhood strategy to convert each pixel to \"deeper-order\" t-scalar.\nExperiments on publicly available images show that the generalized algorithm\nover t-scalars, namely THOSVD, compares favorably with its canonical\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 15:01:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 02:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 05:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 13:49:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 15:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 16:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 03:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 09:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Existing contrastive representation learning methods\nlack such an important model capability. In addition, the negative pairs used\nin these methods are not guaranteed to be semantically distinct, which could\nfurther hamper the structural correctness of learned image representations.

This behaviour presents a puzzle, as it appears to imply\nthe growth of a non-zero Saffman integral, which would require the longitudinal\nvelocity correlation function, $\\chi(r)$, to satisfy $\\chi(r\\to \\infty)\\propto\nr^{-3}$. As is well known, the Saffman integral is an invariant of decaying\nturbulence, precisely because non-local interactions (i.e., interactions via\nexchange of pressure waves) are too weak to generate such correlations. Subject\nto certain restrictions on the nature of the forcing, we argue that the same\nshould be true for forced turbulence. We show that long-range correlations and\na $k^2$ spectrum arise as a result of the turbulent diffusion of linear\nmomentum, and extend only up to a maximum scale that grows slowly with time.\nThis picture has a number of interesting consequences. First, if the forcing\ngenerates eddies with significant linear momentum (as in so-called Saffman\nturbulence), a thermal spectrum is not reached - instead, a shallower spectrum\ndevelops. Secondly, the energy of turbulence that is forced for a while and\nthen allowed to decay obeys Saffman's decay laws for a period that is much\nlonger than the duration of the forcing stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 15:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 11:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Several\nwell-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis\nby learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec\nand GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word\nco-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been\nunclear.

Since it minimizes the\nacross-cluster similarity, there is no need to model the distribution within\neach cluster. As a result, one reduces the chance of model misspecification,\nwhich is often a risk in mixture model-based clustering. Nevertheless, compared\nto the latter, spectral clustering has no direct ways of quantifying the\nclustering uncertainty (such as the assignment probability), or allowing easy\nmodel extensions for complicated data applications. To fill this gap, we\npropose the Bayesian forest model as a generative graphical model for spectral\nclustering. This is motivated by our discovery that the posterior connecting\nmatrix in a forest model has almost the same leading eigenvectors, as the ones\nused by normalized spectral clustering. To induce a distribution for the\nforest, we develop a ``forest process'' as a graph extension to the urn\nprocess, while we carefully characterize the differences in the partition\nprobability. We derive a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for\nposterior estimation, and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing\nalgorithms.

A potential attacker may have enough time\nto launch an attack targeting these vulnerabilities (such as rerouting the\ntarget request to a malicious server or hijacking the traffic). A viable\nstrategy to solve this problem is, by dynamically changing the system\nproperties, configurations and create unique fingerprints to identify the\nsource. However, the existing work of fingerprinting mainly focuses on\nlower-level properties (e.g IP address), and only these types of properties are\nrestricted for mutation.\n  We develop a novel system, called Verify-Pro, to provide server\nauthentication using communication protocol dialects, that uses a client-server\narchitecture based on network protocols for customizing the communication\ntransactions. For each session, a particular sequence of handshakes will be\nused as dialects. So, given the context, with the establishment of a one-time\nusername and password, we use the dialects as an authentication mechanism for\neach request (e.g get filename in FTP) throughout the session, which enforces\ncontinuous authentication.

Deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded well-suited approaches for\nimage registration by learning the transformation priors from a large dataset.\nThe improvement in the performance of these methods is related to their ability\nto learn information from several sample medical images that are difficult to\nobtain and bias the framework to the specific domain of data. In this paper, we\npropose a novel diffeomorphic training-free approach; this is built upon the\nprinciple of an ordinary differential equation.\n  Our formulation yields an Euler integration type recursive scheme to estimate\nthe changes of spatial transformations between the fixed and the moving image\npyramids at different resolutions. The proposed architecture is simple in\ndesign. The moving image is warped successively at each resolution and finally\naligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that at each\nresolution, a fully convolutional network (FCN) models a progressive change of\ndeformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and\noptimized for each pair of images from scratch. In comparison to learning-based\nmethods, the proposed method neither requires a dedicated training set nor\nsuffers from any training bias. We evaluate our method on three cardiac image\ndatasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art registration accuracy while maintaining desirable\ndiffeomorphic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 15:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

However, despite\nthe enormous success of CDCL solvers, there is still only a limited\nunderstanding of what influences the performance of these solvers in what way.\n  Considering different measures, this paper demonstrates, quite surprisingly,\nthat clause learning (without being able to get rid of some clauses) can not\nonly help the solver but can oftentimes deteriorate the solution process\ndramatically. By conducting extensive empirical analysis, we furthermore find\nthat the runtime distributions of CDCL solvers are multimodal.

Simultaneously, it also gives an indication of why clause\nlearning in combination with clause deletion is virtually the de facto standard\nof SAT solving, in spite of this phenomenon. As a final contribution, we show\nthat Weibull mixture distributions can accurately describe the multimodal\ndistributions.

One factor\ncontributing to these performance gaps is a lack of representation in the data\nthe models are trained on. It is often unclear, however, how to operationalize\nrepresentativeness in specific applications. Here we formalize the problem of\ncreating equitable training datasets, and propose a statistical framework for\naddressing this problem. We consider a setting where a model builder must\ndecide how to allocate a fixed data collection budget to gather training data\nfrom different subgroups. We then frame dataset creation as a constrained\noptimization problem, in which one maximizes a function of group-specific\nperformance metrics based on (estimated) group-specific learning rates and\ncosts per sample. This flexible approach incorporates preferences of\nmodel-builders and other stakeholders, as well as the statistical properties of\nthe learning task. When data collection decisions are made sequentially, we\nshow that under certain conditions this optimization problem can be efficiently\nsolved even without prior knowledge of the learning rates.

We propose an\nAI-based approach for the detection of potential pharmaceutical safety signals\nfrom patients' reviews that can be used as part of the pharmacovigilance\nsurveillance process to flag the necessity of an in-depth pharmacovigilance\ninvestigation. We focus on the Levothyrox case in France which triggered huge\nattention from the media following the change of the medication formula,\nleading to an increase in the frequency of adverse drug reactions normally\nreported by patients. Our approach is two-fold. (1) We investigate various\nNLP-based indicators extracted from patients' reviews including words and\nn-grams frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and\nsentiment analysis. (2) We propose a deep learning architecture, named Word\nCloud Convolutional Neural Network (WC-CNN) which trains a CNN on word clouds\nextracted from the patients comments. We study the effect of different time\nresolutions and different NLP pre-processing techniques on the model\nperformance. Our results show that the proposed indicators could be used in the\nfuture to effectively detect new safety signals. The WC-CNN model trained on\nword clouds extracted at monthly resolution outperforms the others with an\naccuracy of 75%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 10:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

Yet, it is well-known that the\ndecision-makers routinely use soft text-based documents that interpret the hard\ndata they narrate. Recent advances in computational methods for analyzing\nunstructured and soft text-based data at scale offer possibilities for\nunderstanding financial market behavior that could improve investments and\nmarket equity. A critical and ubiquitous form of soft data are earnings calls.\nEarnings calls are periodic (often quarterly) statements usually by CEOs who\nattempt to influence investors' expectations of a company's past and future\nperformance. Here, we study the statistical relationship between earnings\ncalls, company sales, stock performance, and analysts' recommendations. Our\nstudy covers a decade of observations with approximately 100,000 transcripts of\nearnings calls from 6,300 public companies from January 2010 to December 2019.\nIn this study, we report three novel findings. First, the buy, sell and hold\nrecommendations from professional analysts made prior to the earnings have low\ncorrelation with stock price movements after the earnings call. Second, using\nour graph neural network based method that processes the semantic features of\nearnings calls, we reliably and accurately predict stock price movements in\nfive major areas of the economy. Third, the semantic features of transcripts\nare more predictive of stock price movements than sales and earnings per share,\ni.e., traditional hard data in most of the cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 17:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}
