This provides some\nshift-invariance while reducing the computational complexity of the whole\narchitecture. A critical hyperparameter of such layers is their stride: the\ninteger factor of downsampling. As strides are not differentiable, finding the\nbest configuration either requires cross-validation or discrete optimization\n(e.g. architecture search), which rapidly become prohibitive as the search\nspace grows exponentially with the number of downsampling layers. Hence,\nexploring this search space by gradient descent would allow finding better\nconfigurations at a lower computational cost. This work introduces DiffStride,\nthe first downsampling layer with learnable strides. Our layer learns the size\nof a cropping mask in the Fourier domain, that effectively performs resizing in\na differentiable way. Experiments on audio and image classification show the\ngenerality and effectiveness of our solution: we use DiffStride as a drop-in\nreplacement to standard downsampling layers and outperform them. In particular,\nwe show that introducing our layer into a ResNet-18 architecture allows keeping\nconsistent high performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet even when\ntraining starts from poor random stride configurations. Moreover, formulating\nstrides as learnable variables allows us to introduce a regularization term\nthat controls the computational complexity of the architecture. We show how\nthis regularization allows trading off accuracy for efficiency on ImageNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 16:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

Whether a jet is launched depends on the properties of the merger\nremnant and of the surrounding accretion disc, which in turn are a function of\nthe progenitor binary masses and equation of state (EoS). The incidence of jets\nin the population therefore carries information about the binary component mass\ndistribution and EoS.

Statistical boosting is a computational approach that\nemerged from machine learning, which allows to fit regression models in the\npresence of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the algorithm can lead to\ndata-driven variable selection. In practice, however, the final models\ntypically tend to include too many variables in some situations. This occurs\nparticularly for low-dimensional data (p<n), where we observe a slow\noverfitting behavior of boosting.

We formulate conditions\nunder which the ROP approach and cascade model can be directly compared. We\nfeed the NEUT cascade with events from a relativistic distorted-wave impulse\napproximation calculation that uses the real part of an optical potential.

For $T_p < 100$ MeV the ROP\nand NEUT cross sections differ in shape and differences in magnitude are larger\nthan 50 \\%. Single transverse variables allow to distinguish different\napproaches to FSI, but due to a large non-QE contribution the comparison to T2K\ndata does not give an unambiguous view of FSI. We discuss electron scattering\nand argue that with a cut in missing energy FSI can be studied with minimal\nconfounding factors in e.g. $e4\\nu$. The agreement of the ROP and NEUT for T2K\nconditions lends confidence to these models as a tool in oscillation analyses\nfor sufficiently large nucleon kinetic energies. These results urge for caution\nwhen a cascade model is applied for small nucleon energies. The assessment of\nmodel assumptions relevant to this region are strongly encouraged.

Hence, we can arbitrarily scale the inducing point\nsize, even to the point of putting inducing points at every observed location.\nWe compare VNNGP to other scalable GPs through various experiments, and\ndemonstrate that VNNGP (1) can dramatically outperform low-rank methods, and\n(2) is less prone to overfitting than other nearest neighbor methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 17:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 02:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 04:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

We obtained the kinematics of the\nstars and ionised gas, and compared them with molecular gas kinematics from\nALMA CO(2-1). We separated the ionised gas into HII regions and diffuse ionised\ngas (DIG) and determined the fraction of Ha luminosity originating from the DIG\n(f_DIG). We observe that both stars and gas trace the galactic disk rotation,\nas well as a fast-rotating nuclear component, likely connected to secular\nprocesses driven by the galactic bar. In the gas kinematics, we observe a\nstream east of the nucleus, redshifted with respect to the disk. The stream is\nsurrounded by an extended ionised gas region with enhanced velocity dispersion\nand a high ionisation state, which is largely consistent with being ionised by\nslow shocks. We interpret this feature as either the superposition of the disk\nand an extraplanar layer of DIG, or as a bar-driven inflow of shocked gas. A\ndouble Gaussian component fit to the Ha line also reveals the presence of a\nnuclear biconic structure whose axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the bar.\nThe two cones appear blue- and redshifted along the line of sight and stand out\nfor having an Ha emission separated by up to 200 km s-1 from that of the disk,\nand a high velocity dispersion ~80-200 km s-1.

With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, the\nusage of VC services has drastically increased, leading to more and more\nreports about the ZF or VCF phenomenon. The paper is motivated by the fact that\nsome of the media outlets initially starting the debate on what Zoom fatigue is\nand how it can be avoided, as well as some of the scientific papers addressing\nthe topic, contain assumptions that are rather hypothetical and insufficiently\nunderpinned by scientific evidence. Most of these works are acknowledge the\nlacking evidence and partly suggest directions for future research.

How can\nwe best leverage such unlabeled data in offline RL? One natural solution is to\nlearn a reward function from the labeled data and use it to label the unlabeled\ndata. In this paper, we find that, perhaps surprisingly, a much simpler method\nthat simply applies zero rewards to unlabeled data leads to effective data\nsharing both in theory and in practice, without learning any reward model at\nall. While this approach might seem strange (and incorrect) at first, we\nprovide extensive theoretical and empirical analysis that illustrates how it\ntrades off reward bias, sample complexity and distributional shift, often\nleading to good results. We characterize conditions under which this simple\nstrategy is effective, and further show that extending it with a simple\nreweighting approach can further alleviate the bias introduced by using\nincorrect reward labels.

In reality, network connections are far more\ndynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals\nand make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model\nmyriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. In this\npaper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of\nco-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary\nnetworks, which receive feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the\nnetworks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the\nco-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto\nnetworks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a\ngeneralized Vlasov type equation. We treat the graph limits as graph measures,\nmotivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph\nmeasures, arXiv:2107.08419, 2021]. Under a mild condition on the initial graph\nmeasure, we show that the graph measures are positive over a finite time\ninterval. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled\non non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent\nnetworks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work is the first to\nrigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model. The approach is\nbased on our formulation of a generalization of the co-evolutionary network as\na hybrid system of ODEs and measure differential equations parametrized by a\nvertex variable, together with an analogue of the variation of parameters\nformula, as well as the generalized Neunzert's in-cell-particle method\ndeveloped in [Kuehn, Xu.

The focus of this paper is\nin highlighting the identifiability and estimation of DAGs with general error\ndistributions through a general sequential sorting procedure that orders\nvariables one at a time, starting at root nodes, followed by children of the\nroot nodes, and so on until completion. We demonstrate a novel application of\nthis general approach to estimate the topological ordering of a DAG. At each\nstep of the procedure, only simple likelihood ratio scores are calculated on\nregression residuals to decide the next node to append to the current partial\nordering. The computational complexity of our algorithm on a p-node problem is\nO(pd), where d is the maximum neighborhood size.

Our approach yields\na speedup of at least 10 when compared against publicly available Monte Carlo\nbased GPU implementations.

In this\napproach, goals and observations are represented as a sequence of embeddings,\nand a policy network initialized with a pre-trained LM predicts the next\naction. We demonstrate that this framework enables effective combinatorial\ngeneralization across different environments and supervisory modalities. We\nbegin by assuming access to a set of expert demonstrations, and show that\ninitializing policies with LMs and fine-tuning them via behavior cloning\nimproves task completion rates by 43.6% in the VirtualHome environment. Next,\nwe integrate an active data gathering procedure in which agents iteratively\ninteract with the environment, relabel past \"failed\" experiences with new\ngoals, and update their policies in a self-supervised loop. Active data\ngathering further improves combinatorial generalization, outperforming the best\nbaseline by 25.1%. Finally, we explain these results by investigating three\npossible factors underlying the effectiveness of the LM-based policy.

These findings lay a\nsolid foundation for developing a scientific approach based on the physics of\ncomplex systems to the analysis of companies, which has been lacking until now.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 19:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Our goal is to design mechanisms for answering count queries of the\nfollowing form: How many users in the database have a specific set of genotypes\nat certain locations in their genome? At the same time, we aim to achieve\nperfect privacy (zero information leakage) of the sensitive genotypes at a\npre-specified set of secret locations.

It is worth claiming that, at the\nmoment, strong evidence that the temperature of the stars is zero during the\nlast orbits before coalescing, does not exist. Nevertheless, theoretical\nstudies suggest that the temperature concerning the inspiral phase, could reach\neven a few MeV. According to the main theory, tides transfer mechanical energy\nand angular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction\nwithin the star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral,\nthese effects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used\nto estimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal\nfriction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger\ntidal effects.

Two different approaches\nare used for the integration of the advective terms appearing in the equation:\na Forward Time and Central in Space (FTCS) and an Upwind scheme. We compare\nthem in terms of accuracy and performance. We explore the impact of the Upwind\nmethod on convergence according to the ratio of planar to vertical field and\nthe Hall parameter. In the limit of a low strength planar field the use of an\nUpwind scheme provides a vast improvement leading to the convergence of\nsimulations where the Hall parameter is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that\nof the FTCS. Upwind is still better if the planar field is stronger, yet, the\ndifference of the maximum value of the Hall parameter reached is within a\nfactor of 10 or a few. Moreover, we notice if the schemes diverge their\nbehaviour is very different, with FTCS producing infinite energy, while the\nUpwind scheme only temporarily increasing the overall magnetic field energy.\n  Overall, the Upwind scheme enhances the efficiency of the simulations\nallowing the exploration of environments with higher value of electric\nconductivity getting us closer than before to realistic environmental\nconditions of magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 19:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

The data are time resolved measurements of the pressure\nwave gathered by an acquisition system which probes the unknown medium with\npulses and measures the generated waves. We propose to solve the inverse\nproblem of velocity estimation by minimizing the square misfit between the ROM\ncomputed from the recorded data and the ROM computed from the modeled data, at\nthe current guess of the velocity. We give the step by step computation of the\nROM, which depends nonlinearly on the data and yet can be obtained from them in\na non-iterative fashion, using efficient methods from linear algebra.

They can be used for the purpose of\ngrouping nodes into communities or discovering and analyzing a latent structure\nof a network. The stochastic block model is a generative model for random\ngraphs that tends to produce graphs containing subsets of nodes characterized\nby being connected to each other, called communities.\n  Many researchers from various areas have been using computational tools to\nadjust these models without, however, analyzing their suitability for the data\nof the networks they are studying. The complexity involved in the estimation\nprocess and in the goodness-of-fit verification methodologies for these models\ncan be factors that make the analysis of adequacy difficult and a possible\ndiscard of one model in favor of another.\n  And it is clear that the results obtained through an inappropriate model can\nlead the researcher to very wrong conclusions about the phenomenon studied.\n  The purpose of this work is to present a simple methodology, based on\nHypothesis Tests, to verify if there is a model specification error for these\ntwo cases widely used in the literature to represent complex networks: the ERGM\nand the SBM.

The predicted probability of possible\noutcomes can inform high-stakes decision making, particularly when assessing\nthe expected value of alternative decisions or the risk of bad outcomes. These\ndecisions require well-calibrated probabilities, not just the correct\nprediction of the most likely class. Black-box classifier calibration methods\ncan improve the reliability of a classifier's output without requiring\nretraining. However, these methods are unable to detect subpopulations where\ncalibration could also improve prediction accuracy. Such subpopulations are\nsaid to exhibit \"hidden heterogeneity\" (HH), because the original classifier\ndid not detect them. This paper proposes a quantitative measure for HH. It also\nintroduces two similarity-weighted calibration methods that can address HH by\nadapting locally to each test item: SWC weights the calibration set by\nsimilarity to the test item, and SWC-HH explicitly incorporates hidden\nheterogeneity to filter the calibration set. Experiments show that the\nimprovements in calibration achieved by similarity-based calibration methods\ncorrelate with the amount of HH present and, given sufficient calibration data,\ngenerally exceed calibration achieved by global methods.

Three Iodine-131 SPECT/CT imaging studies\nwere performed using a homogeneous, Jaszczak, and an anthropomorphic phantom to\nquantify the SPECT images. The impact of collimator detector response (CDR)\nmodeling and volume-based partial volume corrections (PVC) upon the absorbed\ndose was calculated using an image based, Geant4 Monte Carlo RPT dosimetry\nworkflow and compared against a ground truth scenario. Finally, uncertainties\nwere quantified in accordance with recent EANM guidelines.\n  Results: The 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom was an accurate re-creation\nof patient anatomy including bone. The extrapolated Jaszczak recovery\ncoefficients were greater than that of the 3D printed insert (~22.8 ml) for\nboth the CDR and non-CDR cases.

Recently, a\nquantum simulator, specifically a Gaussian boson sampler, has been proposed to\ngenerate molecular vibronic spectra efficiently, which is an essential property\nof molecules and an important tool for analyzing chemical components and\nstudying molecular structures. Computing molecular vibronic spectra has been a\nchallenging task, and its best-known classical algorithm scales combinatorially\nin the system size. Thus, it is a candidate of tasks for which quantum devices\nprovide computational advantages. In this work, we propose a quantum-inspired\nclassical algorithm for molecular vibronic spectra for harmonic potential. We\nfirst show that the molecular vibronic spectra problem corresponding to\nFock-state boson sampling can be efficiently solved using a classical algorithm\nas accurately as running a boson sampler. In particular, we generalize\nGurvits's algorithm to approximate Fourier components of the spectra of\nFock-state boson sampling and prove using Parseval's relation that the error of\nthe spectra can be suppressed as long as that of the Fourier components are\nsmall. We also show that the molecular vibronic spectra problems of Gaussian\nboson sampling, which corresponds to the actual molecular vibronic spectra\nproblem in chemistry, can be exactly solved even without Gurvits-type\nalgorithms.

Explainability\nis one way to bridge the gap between human decision-makers and machine learning\nmodels. However, most of the existing work on explainability focuses on\none-off, static explanations like feature importances or rule lists. These\nsorts of explanations may not be sufficient for many use cases that require\ndynamic, continuous discovery from stakeholders. In the literature, few works\nask decision-makers about the utility of existing explanations and other\ndesiderata they would like to see in an explanation going forward. In this\nwork, we address this gap and carry out a study where we interview doctors,\nhealthcare professionals, and policymakers about their needs and desires for\nexplanations. Our study indicates that decision-makers would strongly prefer\ninteractive explanations in the form of natural language dialogues. Domain\nexperts wish to treat machine learning models as \"another colleague\", i.e., one\nwho can be held accountable by asking why they made a particular decision\nthrough expressive and accessible natural language interactions. Considering\nthese needs, we outline a set of five principles researchers should follow when\ndesigning interactive explanations as a starting place for future work.\nFurther, we show why natural language dialogues satisfy these principles and\nare a desirable way to build interactive explanations. Next, we provide a\ndesign of a dialogue system for explainability and discuss the risks,\ntrade-offs, and research opportunities of building these systems. Overall, we\nhope our work serves as a starting place for researchers and engineers to\ndesign interactive explainability systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 22:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Such a model is gradually built as a system evolves\nthrough phase space from both the frequency of visits to distinct states and\ngeneralized force estimates corresponding to such states. A common feature of\nthe methods is that the underlying functional models and their gradients are\neasily expressed in terms of the same parameters, thereby providing faster and\nmore effective fitting of the model from simulation data than other available\nsampling techniques. They also eliminate the need to train simultaneously\nseparate neural networks, while retaining the advantage of generating smooth\nand continuous functional estimates that enable biasing outside the support\ngrid.

This notion, which plays a key role in areas\nsuch as data privacy and optimization, has been the focus of several program\nanalysis techniques introduced in recent years. Among the most successful ones,\nwe can highlight type systems inspired by linear logic, as pioneered by Reed\nand Pierce in the Fuzz programming language. In Fuzz, each type is equipped\nwith its own distance, and sensitivity analysis boils down to type checking. In\nparticular, Fuzz features two product types, corresponding to two different\nnotions of distance: the tensor product combines the distances of each\ncomponent by adding them, while the with product takes their maximum.\n  In this work, we show that these products can be generalized to arbitrary\n$L^p$ distances, metrics that are often used in privacy and optimization. The\noriginal Fuzz products, tensor and with, correspond to the special cases $L^1$\nand $L^\\infty$. To ease the handling of such products, we extend the Fuzz type\nsystem with bunches -- as in the logic of bunched implications -- where the\ndistances of different groups of variables can be combined using different\n$L^p$ distances.

This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a\nBHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC\ncurve is derived, and it is shown to converge to the true optimal ROC curve in\nthe \\levy\\ metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. A classical\nempirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities\nfrom two separate sets of samples, is also considered. The maximum likelihood\nestimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more\naccurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples\nobtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum\nlikelihood estimator is derived; it is a consistent estimator of the true area\nunder the optimal ROC curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 03:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

In\nparticular, attention was given to estimating distances using the minimum\nnumber of events required to transform one genome into another. In hindsight,\nthis approach is analogous to early methods for inferring phylogenetic trees\nfrom DNA sequences such as maximum parsimony -- both are motivated by the\nprinciple that the true distance minimises evolutionary change, and both are\neffective if this principle is a true reflection of reality. Recent literature\nconsiders genome rearrangement under statistical models, continuing this\nparallel with DNA-based methods; the goal here is to use model-based methods\n(for example maximum likelihood techniques) to compute distance estimates that\nincorporate the large number of rearrangement paths that can transform one\ngenome into another. Crucially, this approach requires one to decide upon a set\nof feasible rearrangement events and, in this paper, we focus on characterising\nwell-motivated models for signed, uni-chromosomal circular genomes, where the\nnumber of regions remains fixed. Since rearrangements are often mathematically\ndescribed using permutations, we isolate the sets of permutations representing\nrearrangements that are biologically reasonable in this context, for example\ninversions and translocations.

Most previous studies focused on the experimental\ncharacterization of the dealloying process and on the properties of the\ndealloyed materials, leaving the theoretical study incomplete to fully\nunderstand the fundamental mechanisms of LMD. In this paper, we use theoretical\nmodels and phase-field simulations to clarify the kinetics and pattern\nformation during LMD. Our study starts from a theoretical analysis of the 1D\ndissolution of a binary precursor alloy, which reveals that the 1D dissolution\nprocess involves two regimes. In the first regime, due to the low solubility of\none of the elements in the melt, it accumulates at the solid-liquid interface,\nwhich reduces the dissolution kinetics. In the second regime, the interface\nkinetics reaches a stationary regime where both elements of the precursor alloy\ndissolve into the melt. Previous works revealed that in the early dealloying\nstage, the dealloying front is destabilized by an interfacial spinodal\ndecomposition, which triggers the formation of interconnected ligaments. We\nextend this line of work by proposing a linear stability analysis able to\npredict the initial length-scale of the ligaments formed in the initial stage\nof the dealloying. Combining this analysis with the 1D dissolution model\nproposed here enables us to better understand the initial conditions\n(composition of the precursor alloy and the melt) leading to a planar\ndissolution without interface destabilization. Finally, we report a strong\ninfluence of solid-state diffusion on dealloying that was overlooked in\nprevious studies. Although the solid-state diffusivity is four to five orders\nof magnitude smaller than in the liquid phase, it is found to affect both\ndissolution kinetics and ligament morphologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 05:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Generally, MAS methods register multiple atlases, i.e., medical\nimages with corresponding labels, to a target image; and the transformed atlas\nlabels can be combined to generate target segmentation via label fusion\nschemes. Many conventional MAS methods employed the atlases from the same\nmodality as the target image. However, the number of atlases with the same\nmodality may be limited or even missing in many clinical applications. Besides,\nconventional MAS methods suffer from the computational burden of registration\nor label fusion procedures. In this work, we design a novel cross-modality MAS\nframework, which uses available atlases from a certain modality to segment a\ntarget image from another modality. To boost the computational efficiency of\nthe framework, both the image registration and label fusion are achieved by\nwell-designed deep neural networks. For the atlas-to-target image registration,\nwe propose a bi-directional registration network (BiRegNet), which can\nefficiently align images from different modalities. For the label fusion, we\ndesign a similarity estimation network (SimNet), which estimates the fusion\nweight of each atlas by measuring its similarity to the target image. SimNet\ncan learn multi-scale information for similarity estimation to improve the\nperformance of label fusion. The proposed framework was evaluated by the left\nventricle and liver segmentation tasks on the MM-WHS and CHAOS datasets,\nrespectively. Results have shown that the framework is effective for\ncross-modality MAS in both registration and label fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 07:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 04:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 11:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

A main application of machine\nlearning is the construction of quality prediction models, which can be used,\namong other things, for documentation purposes, as assistance systems for\nprocess operators, or for adaptive process control. The quality of such machine\nlearning models typically strongly depends on the amount and the quality of\ndata used for training. In manufacturing, the size of available datasets before\nstart of production is often limited. In contrast to data, expert knowledge\ncommonly is available in manufacturing. Therefore, this study introduces a\ngeneral methodology for building quality prediction models with machine\nlearning methods on small datasets by integrating shape expert knowledge, that\nis, prior knowledge about the shape of the input-output relationship to be\nlearned. The proposed methodology is applied to a brushing process with $125$\ndata points for predicting the surface roughness as a function of five process\nvariables. As opposed to conventional machine learning methods for small\ndatasets, the proposed methodology produces prediction models that strictly\ncomply with all the expert knowledge specified by the involved process\nspecialists. In particular, the direct involvement of process experts in the\ntraining of the models leads to a very clear interpretation and, by extension,\nto a high acceptance of the models.

In the case of mission-critical (MC) scenarios, for instance, when\nnatural disasters strike, providing ubiquitous connectivity becomes challenging\nby using traditional wireless networks. In this context, unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) based aerial networks offer a promising alternative for fast,\nflexible, and reliable wireless communications. Due to unique characteristics\nsuch as mobility, flexible deployment, and rapid reconfiguration, drones can\nreadily change location dynamically to provide on-demand communications to\nusers on the ground in emergency scenarios. As a result, the usage of UAV base\nstations (UAV-BSs) has been considered an appropriate approach for providing\nrapid connection in MC scenarios.

Among many other reasons, a large number of existing\nsolutions rely on access to it. Identifying and estimating the transition\nmatrix without ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task.

To date, neural networks for image\nreconstruction are almost exclusively convolutional. The most popular\narchitecture is the U-Net, a convolutional network with a multi-resolution\narchitecture. In this work, we show that a simple network based on the\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer enables state-of-the art image\nreconstruction performance without convolutions and without a multi-resolution\narchitecture, provided that the training set and the size of the network are\nmoderately large. Similar to the original MLP-mixer, the image-to-image\nMLP-mixer is based exclusively on MLPs operating on linearly-transformed image\npatches. Contrary to the original MLP-mixer, we incorporate structure by\nretaining the relative positions of the image patches. This imposes an\ninductive bias towards natural images which enables the image-to-image\nMLP-mixer to learn to denoise images based on fewer examples than the original\nMLP-mixer. Moreover, the image-to-image MLP-mixer requires fewer parameters to\nachieve the same denoising performance than the U-Net and its parameters scale\nlinearly in the image resolution instead of quadratically as for the original\nMLP-mixer. If trained on a moderate amount of examples for denoising, the\nimage-to-image MLP-mixer outperforms the U-Net by a slight margin. It also\noutperforms the vision transformer tailored for image reconstruction and\nclassical un-trained methods such as BM3D, making it a very effective tool for\nimage reconstruction problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 08:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

The aim of this paper is\nto understand how controlled drug release can be achieved by tuning the initial\ndistribution of drug molecules in a hydrogel. A mathematical model is presented\nfor a spherical drug-loaded hydrogel. The model captures the nonlinear\nelasticity of the polymer network and thermodynamics of swelling. By assuming\nthat the drug molecules are dilute, the equations for hydrogel swelling and\ndrug transport partially decouple. A fast optimisation method is developed to\naccurately compute the optimal initial drug concentration by minimising the\nerror between the numerical drug-release profile and a target profile. By\ntaking the target drug efflux to be piecewise constant, the optimal initial\nconfiguration consists of a central drug-loaded core with isolated drug packets\nnear the free boundary of the hydrogel. The optimal initial drug concentration\nis highly effective at mitigating the burst effect, where a large amount of\ndrug is rapidly released into the environment. The hydrogel stiffness can be\nused to further tune the rate of drug release. Although stiffer gels lead to\nless swelling and hence reduce the drug diffusivity, the drug-release kinetics\nare faster than for soft gels due to the decreased distance that drug molecules\nmust travel to reach the free surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 08:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Further studies suggested that\na portion of UMWDs should have experienced pretty long cooling delays, implying\nthat they are carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs.

Over the\ncourse of a transit, WASP-76b rotates by about 30 degree, changing the\nobservable part of the atmosphere and invoking variations in the appearance of\nits constituents. As recently reported, this results in time-variable effects\nin the neutral iron signal, which are amplified by its possible condensation on\nthe nightside. Here, we study the presence of molecular signals during a\ntransit of WASP-76b observed with the CARMENES spectrograph and compare the\ncontributions from this planet's morning and evening terminators. The results\nare somewhat puzzling, with formal detections of water vapor (5.5$\\sigma$) and\nhydrogen cyanide (5.2$\\sigma$) but at significantly different positions in the\nK$_p$-V$_{sys}$ diagram, with a blueshift of -14.3 $\\pm$ 2.6 km/s and a\nredshift of $+$20.8 $^{+7.8}_{-3.9}$ km/s respectively, and a higher K$_p$ than\nexpected. The H$_2$O signal also appears stronger later on in the transit, in\ncontrast to that of HCN, which seems stronger early on. We tentatively explain\nthis by silicate clouds forming and raining out on the nightside, partially\nremoving oxygen from the upper atmosphere. For C/O values between 0.7 and 1,\nthis leads to the formation of HCN at the morning limb. At the evening\nterminator, with the sequestered oxygen being returned to the gas phase due to\nevaporation, these C/O values lead to formation of H$_2$O instead of HCN. If\nconfirmed, these results indicate that individual molecules trace different\nparts of the atmosphere, as well as nightside condensation, allowing spatial\ncharacterization. As these results are based on a single transit, we advocate\nthat more data are needed to confirm them and further explore these scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 09:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The goal\nof this paper is to extend CAT and ACAT methods to systems of balance laws. To\ndo this, the source term is written as the derivative of its indefinite\nintegral that is formally treated as a flux function. The well-balanced\nproperty of the methods is discussed and a variant that allows in principle to\npreserve any stationary solution is presented. The resulting methods are then\napplied to a number of systems going from a linear scalar conservation law to\nthe 2D Euler equations with gravity, passing by the Burgers equations with\nsource term and the 1D shallow water equations: the order and well-balanced\nproperties are checked in several numerical tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 10:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

In contrast to the discrete\nsetting, our results reveal a remarkable difference between the two concepts of\nentropy in the realm of non-discrete groups: while the first quantity collapses\nto 0 in the non-discrete case, the second yields a well-behaved invariant for\namenable unimodular groups. Concerning the latter, we moreover study the\ncorresponding notion of topological pressure, prove a Goodwyn-type theorem, and\nestablish the equivalence with the uniform lattice approach (for locally\ncompact groups admitting a uniform lattice).

This makes treatment effect\nestimation from data with missingness a particularly tricky endeavour. A key\nreason for this is that standard assumptions on missingness are rendered\ninsufficient due to the presence of an additional variable, treatment, besides\nthe input (e.g. an individual) and the label (e.g. an outcome). The treatment\nvariable introduces additional complexity with respect to why some variables\nare missing that is not fully explored by previous work. In our work we\nintroduce mixed confounded missingness (MCM), a new missingness mechanism where\nsome missingness determines treatment selection and other missingness is\ndetermined by treatment selection. Given MCM, we show that naively imputing all\ndata leads to poor performing treatment effects models, as the act of\nimputation effectively removes information necessary to provide unbiased\nestimates. However, no imputation at all also leads to biased estimates, as\nmissingness determined by treatment introduces bias in covariates.

There is a class of binary post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB)\nstars that exhibit remarkable near-infrared (NIR) excess. Such stars are\nsurrounded by Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian disks, as well as extended outflows\ncomposed of gas escaping from the disk. This class can be subdivided into disk-\nand outflow-dominated sources, depending on whether it is the disk or the\noutflow that represents most of the nebular mass, respectively. The chemistry\nof this type of source has been practically unknown thus far. Methods. We\nfocused our observations on the 1.3, 2, 3 mm bands of the 30 m IRAM telescope\nand on the 7 and 13 mm bands of the 40 m Yebes telescope. Our observations add\nup around 600 hours of telescope time. Results. We present the first\nsingle-dish molecular survey of mm-wave lines in nebulae around binary post-AGB\nstars. We conclude that the molecular content is relatively low in nebulae\naround binary post-AGB stars, as their molecular lines and abundances are\nespecially weaker compared with AGB stars. This fact is very significant in\nthose sources where the Keplerian disk is the dominant component of the nebula.\nThe study of their chemistry allows us to classify nebulae around AC Her, the\nRed Rectangle, AI CMi, R Sct, and IRAS 20056+1834 as O-rich, while that of 89\nHer is probably C-rich. The calculated abundances of the detected species other\nthan CO are particularly low compared with AGB stars. The initial stellar mass\nderived from the 17O/18O ratio for the Red Rectangle and 89 Her is compatible\nwith the central total stellar mass derived from previous mm-wave\ninterferometric maps. The very low 12CO/13CO ratios found in binary post-AGB\nstars reveal a high 13CO abundance compared to AGB and other post-AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 12:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

However, other possible causes for substructure first need to be well\nunderstood. Here we studied the kinematics and the unusual morphology of the\nstellar stream Jhelum. Using a combination of ground-based photometry and Gaia\nEDR3 astrometry, we characterized the morphology of Jhelum. We combined this\nnew data with radial velocities from the literature to perform orbit\nintegrations of the stream in static Galactic potentials. We also carried out\nN-body simulations in the presence of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The new\ndata reveal a previously unreported tertiary component in the stream, as well\nas several gaps and a kink-like feature in its narrow component. We find that\nfor a range of realistic Galactic potentials, no single orbit is able to\nreproduce Jhelum's radial velocity data entirely. A generic property of the\norbital solutions is that they share a similar orbital plane to Sagittarius and\nthis leads to repeated encounters with the stream. Using N-body simulations\nthat include a massive Sagittarius, we explored its effect on Jhelum, and we\nshow that these encounters can qualitatively reproduce the narrow and broad\ncomponents in Jhelum, as well as create a tertiary component in some cases. We\nalso find evidence that such encounters can result in an apparent increase in\nthe velocity dispersion of the stream by a factor up to four due to overlapping\nnarrow and broad components. Our findings suggest that the Jhelum stream is\neven more complex than once thought; however, its morphology and kinematics can\ntentatively be explained via the interactions with Sagittarius.

Practitioners can typically\nenforce a desired invariance on the trained model through the choice of a\nnetwork architecture, e.g. using convolutions for translations, or using data\naugmentation. Yet, enforcing true invariance in the network can be difficult,\nand data invariances are not always known a piori. State-of-the-art methods for\nlearning data augmentation policies require held-out data and are based on\nbilevel optimization problems, which are complex to solve and often\ncomputationally demanding. In this work we investigate new ways of learning\ninvariances only from the training data. Using learnable augmentation layers\nbuilt directly in the network, we demonstrate that our method is very\nversatile.

Furthermore, the extracted\nfeatures frequently contain stochastically unavoidable errors, which degrades\nthe matching accuracy. In this paper, instead of using a non-trainable\nalgorithm, we propose a differentiable matching network that can be jointly\noptimized with the feature extraction procedure. Our network first constructs\ngraphs with edges connecting the points of each point cloud and then extracts\ndiscriminative edge features by using two main components: a shared set-encoder\nand an edge-selective cross-concatenation.

For practical applications of these quantum machine\nlearning methods, an important issue is to minimize the size of quantum\ncircuits. We present the simplest quantum circuit for constructing a\nkernel-based binary classifier. This is achieved by generalizing the\ninterference circuit to encode data labels in the relative phases of the\nquantum state and by introducing compact amplitude encoding, which encodes two\ntraining data vectors into one quantum register.

We examine how that\norder interacts with and induces shape modulations of cylindrical interfaces.\nWhile on spherical droplets $2n$ topological defects necessarily exist and can\ninduce icosahedral droplet shapes, the cylindrical topology is compatible with\na defect-free patterning. Nevertheless, once a modulation is introduced by a\nmechanism such as spontaneous curvature, nontrivial patterns of order,\nincluding ones with excess defects, emerge and have nonlinear effects on the\nshape of the tube. Examining the equilibrium energetics of the system\nanalytically and with a lattice-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, we\npredict low-temperature morphologies of modulated cylindrical interfaces\nhosting orientational order. A shape modulation induces a banded pattern of\nalternatingly isotropic and ordered interfacial material. Furthermore\ncylindrical systems can be divided into Type I, without defects, and Type II,\nwhich go through a spectrum of defect states with up to $4n$ excess defects.\nThe character of the curvature-induced shape transition from unmodulated to\nmodulated cylinders is continuous or discontinuous accordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 14:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 11:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

The\nVertex planarization problem is a special case of F-minor-free deletion for the\nfamily F = {K_5, K_{3,3}}. Whenever the family F contains at least one planar\ngraph, then F-minor-free deletion is known to admit a constant-factor\napproximation algorithm and a polynomial kernelization [Fomin, Lokshtanov,\nMisra, and Saurabh, FOCS'12]. The Vertex planarization problem is arguably the\nsimplest setting for which F does not contain a planar graph and the existence\nof a constant-factor approximation or a polynomial kernelization remains a\nmajor open problem.\n  In this work we show that Vertex planarization admits an algorithm which is a\ncombination of both approaches. Namely, we present a polynomial A-approximate\nkernelization, for some constant A > 1, based on the framework of lossy\nkernelization [Lokshtanov, Panolan, Ramanujan, and Saurabh, STOC'17]. Simply\nspeaking, when given a graph G and integer k, we show how to compute a graph G'\non poly(k) vertices so that any B-approximate solution to G' can be lifted to\nan (A*B)-approximate solution to G, as long as A*B*OPT(G) <= k. In order to\nachieve this, we develop a framework for sparsification of planar graphs which\napproximately preserves all separators and near-separators between subsets of\nthe given terminal set.\n  Our result yields an improvement over the state-of-art approximation\nalgorithms for Vertex planarization. The problem admits a polynomial-time\nO(n^eps)-approximation algorithm, for any eps > 0, and a quasi-polynomial-time\n(log n)^O(1) approximation algorithm, both randomized [Kawarabayashi and\nSidiropoulos, FOCS'17]. By pipelining these algorithms with our approximate\nkernelization, we improve the approximation factors to respectively O(OPT^eps)\nand (log OPT)^O(1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 15:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

Theoretically, we show how a PE/FM combination can lead to\nnon-volatility in pseudo-magnetization exhibiting ferroelectric-like behavior.\nThe pseudo-magnetization can be manipulated by extremely low voltages\nespecially when the FM is a low-barrier nanomagnet. Using a circuit model\nbenchmarked against experiments, we determine the switching energy, delay,\nswitching probability and retention time of the envisioned 1T/1C memory device\nin terms of magnetic and circuit parameters and discuss its thermal stability\nin terms of a key parameter called back-voltage vm which is an electrical\nmeasure of the strain-induced magnetic field.

The\ncorresponding car-following models, which describe how one vehicle follows\nanother vehicle in the traffic flow, form the cornerstone for microscopic\ntraffic simulation and intelligent vehicle development. One major motivation of\ncar-following models is to replicate human drivers' longitudinal driving\ntrajectories. To model the long-term dependency of future actions on historical\ndriving situations, we developed a long-sequence car-following trajectory\nprediction model based on the attention-based Transformer model. The model\nfollows a general format of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder takes\nhistorical speed and spacing data as inputs and forms a mixed representation of\nhistorical driving context using multi-head self-attention. The decoder takes\nthe future LV speed profile as input and outputs the predicted future FV speed\nprofile in a generative way (instead of an auto-regressive way, avoiding\ncompounding errors). Through cross-attention between encoder and decoder, the\ndecoder learns to build a connection between historical driving and future LV\nspeed, based on which a prediction of future FV speed can be obtained.

Yet preference heterogeneity implies that the\nmarginal effects on labor supply of welfare expansions and contractions may\ndiffer in different time periods with different populations and which sweep out\ndifferent portions of the distribution of preferences. A new examination of the\nheavily studied AFDC program uses variation in state-level administrative\nbarriers to entering the program in the late 1980s and early 1990s to estimate\nthe marginal labor supply effects of changes in program participation induced\nby that variation. The estimates are obtained from a theory-consistent reduced\nform model which allows for a nonparametric specification of how changes in\nwelfare program participation affect labor supply on the margin. Estimates\nusing a form of local instrumental variables show that the marginal treatment\neffects are quadratic, rising and then falling as participation rates rise\n(i.e., becoming more negative then less negative on hours of work). The average\nwork disincentive is not large but that masks some margins where effects are\nclose to zero and some which are sizable. Traditional IV which estimates a\nweighted average of marginal effects gives a misleading picture of marginal\nresponses. A counterfactual exercise which applies the estimates to three\nhistorical reform periods in 1967, 1981, and 1996 when the program tax rate was\nsignificantly altered shows that marginal labor supply responses differed in\neach period because of differences in the level of participation in the period\nand the composition of who was on the program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 15:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

However, in certain scenarios, people may\nnot want their data being used for training commercial models and thus studied\nhow to attack the learnability of deep learning models. Previous works on\nlearnability attack only consider the goal of preventing unauthorized\nexploitation on the specific dataset but not the process of restoring the\nlearnability for authorized cases. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces\nand investigates a new concept called \"learnability lock\" for controlling the\nmodel's learnability on a specific dataset with a special key. In particular,\nwe propose adversarial invertible transformation, that can be viewed as a\nmapping from image to image, to slightly modify data samples so that they\nbecome \"unlearnable\" by machine learning models with negligible loss of visual\nfeatures. Meanwhile, one can unlock the learnability of the dataset and train\nmodels normally using the corresponding key. The proposed learnability lock\nleverages class-wise perturbation that applies a universal transformation\nfunction on data samples of the same label. This ensures that the learnability\ncan be easily restored with a simple inverse transformation while remaining\ndifficult to be detected or reverse-engineered.

ChebNet, one of the early attempts, approximates the spectral graph\nconvolutions using Chebyshev polynomials. GCN simplifies ChebNet by utilizing\nonly the first two Chebyshev polynomials while still outperforming it on\nreal-world datasets. GPR-GNN and BernNet demonstrate that the Monomial and\nBernstein bases also outperform the Chebyshev basis in terms of learning the\nspectral graph convolutions.

Emerging strains are making pandemic management\nincreasingly challenging. There is an urge to collect epidemiological,\nclinical, and physiological data to make an informed decision on mitigation\nmeasures. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing provide\nsolutions for pandemic management through data collection and intelligent\ncomputation. While existing data-driven architectures attempt to automate\ndecision-making, they do not capture the multifaceted interaction among\ncomputational models, communication infrastructure, and the generated data. In\nthis paper, we perform a survey of the existing approaches for pandemic\nmanagement, including online data repositories and contact-tracing\napplications. We then envision a unified pandemic management architecture that\nleverages the IoT and edge computing to automate recommendations on vaccine\ndistribution, dynamic lockdown, mobility scheduling and pandemic prediction. We\nelucidate the flow of data among the layers of the architecture, namely, cloud,\nedge and end device layers. Moreover, we address the privacy implications,\nthreats, regulations, and existing solutions that may be adapted to optimize\nthe utility of health data with security guarantees. The paper ends with a\nlowdown on the limitations of the architecture and research directions to\nenhance its practicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 02:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Recent works on behavioral\ncloning show that simple imitation of expert observations is not sufficient to\nhandle complex driving scenarios. Besides, predictions that land outside\ndrivable areas can lead to potentially dangerous situations. This paper\nproposes a set of loss functions, namely Social loss and Road loss, which\naccount for modelling risky social interactions in path planning. These losses\nact as a repulsive scalar field that surrounds non-drivable areas. Predictions\nthat land near these regions incur in a higher training cost, which is\nminimized using backpropagation. This methodology provides additional\nenvironment feedback to the traditional supervised learning set up. We\nvalidated this approach on a large-scale urban driving dataset. The results\nshow the agent learns to imitate human driving while exhibiting better safety\nmetrics. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has positive effects on\ninference without the need to artificially generate unsafe driving examples.\nThe explanability study suggests that the benefits obtained are associated with\na higher relevance of non-drivable areas in the agent's decisions compared to\nclassical behavioral cloning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 10:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

In this paper\nwe study questions related to the computability of the bandwidth of computable\nbandlimited signals. To this end we employ the concept of Turing computability,\nwhich exactly describes what is theoretically feasible and can be computed on a\ndigital computer. Recently, it has been shown that there exist computable\nbandlimited signals with finite energy, the actual bandwidth of which is not a\ncomputable number, and hence cannot be computed on a digital computer. In this\nwork, we consider the most general class of band-limited signals, together with\ndifferent computable representations thereof. Among other things, our analysis\nincludes a characterization of the arithmetic complexity of the bandwidth of\nsuch signals and yields a negative answer to the question of whether it is at\nleast possible to compute non-trivial upper or lower bounds for the bandwidth\nof a bandlimited signal. Furthermore, we relate the problem of bandwidth\ncomputation to the theory of oracle machines. In particular, we consider\nhalting and totality oracles, which belong to the most frequently investigated\noracle machines in the theory of computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2022 02:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

The core idea\nbehind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter family of points (the\ncenterline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the\nCartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and\ntorsion of the curve are related to the relative rotation of neighboring\nframes. The relationship between the frame and the centerline is then enforced\nat the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the role of\nsection force). Well known frames like the Frenet-Serret are defined only using\nthe centerline, which demands higher-order smoothness for the centerline\napproximation. Decoupling the frame from the position vector of the base curve\nleads to a description of torsion and curvature that is independent of the\nposition information, thus allowing for simpler interpolations. This approach\nis then cast in the language of exterior calculus. In this framework, the\nstrain energy may be interpreted as a differential form leading to the natural\nforce-displacement (velocity) pairing. The four-field mixed variational\nprinciple we propose has frame, differential forms, and position vector as\ninput arguments. While the position vector is interpolated linearly, the frames\nare interpolated as piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Similarly,\nconsistent interpolation schemes are also adopted to obtain finite dimensional\napproximations for other differential forms aswell. Using these discrete\napproximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is\nthen numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to\nbenchmark problems, our numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of\nthe proposed method without numerical instabilities or locking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 19:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

Data of the Web\nof Science (WOS) core collection database are used to retrieve articles related\nto sensor technologies and cancer research over 1991-2021 period. We utilized\nGephi software version 0.9.2 to visualize the co-word networks of the\ninteraction between sensor technologies and cancers under study. Results show\nmain clusters of interaction per typology of cancer. Biosensor is the only type\nof sensor that plays an essential role in all types of cancer: breast cancer,\nlung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Electrochemical sensor is\napplied in all types of cancer under study except lung cancer. Electrochemical\nbiosensor is used in breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer research\nbut not colorectal cancer. Optical sensor can also be considered one of the\nsensor technologies that significantly is used in breast cancer, prostate\ncancer, and colorectal cancer. This study shows that this type of sensor is\napplied in more diversified approaches. Moreover, the oxygen sensor is mostly\nstudied in lung cancer and breast cancer due to the usage in breath analysis\nfor the treatment process. Finally, Cmos sensor is a technology used mainly in\nlung cancer and colorectal cancer.

These methods are entirely based on generating\ncounterfactuals for the given training and test set instances. Counterfactual\ninstances are commonly prepared by replacing sensitive identity terms, i.e.,\nthe identity terms present in the instance are replaced with other identity\nterms that fall under the same sensitive category. Therefore, the efficacy of\nthese methods depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of identity\npairs. In this paper, we offer a two-step data augmentation process where (1)\nthe former stage consists of a novel method for preparing a comprehensive list\nof identity pairs with word embeddings, and (2) the latter consists of\nleveraging prepared identity pairs list to enhance the training instances by\napplying three simple operations (namely identity pair replacement, identity\nterm blindness, and identity pair swap).
