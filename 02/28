Autonomous vehicles\nclearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360{\\deg}\npanoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic\ncameras, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize\nsatisfactorily to 360{\\deg} panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a\nnovel network framework--PanoFlow, to learn optical flow for panoramic images.\nTo overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in\npanoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA)\nmethod, which contains radial flow distortion (FDA-R) or equirectangular flow\ndistortion (FDA-E). We further look into the definition and properties of\ncyclic optical flow for panoramic videos, and hereby propose a Cyclic Flow\nEstimation (CFE) method by leveraging the cyclicity of spherical images to\ninfer 360{\\deg} optical flow and converting large displacement to relatively\nsmall displacement. PanoFlow is applicable to any existing flow estimation\nmethod and benefits from the progress of narrow-FoV flow estimation. In\naddition, we create and release a synthetic panoramic dataset FlowScape based\non CARLA to facilitate training and quantitative analysis. PanoFlow achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the public OmniFlowNet and the established\nFlowScape benchmarks. Our proposed approach reduces the End-Point-Error (EPE)\non FlowScape by 27.3%.

To achieve higher performance, recently storage system\ndesigners use DRAM-based buffers. The volatility of DRAM brings up the\npossibility of data loss, so a part of the main storage is conventionally used\nas the journal area to be able of recovering unflushed data pages in the case\nof power failure. Moreover, periodically flushing buffered data pages to the\nmain storage is a common mechanism to preserve a high level of reliability,\nwhich leads to an increase in storage write traffic. To address this\nshortcoming, recent studies offer a small NVM as the Persistent Journal Area\n(PJA) along with DRAM as an efficient approach, named NVM-Backed Buffer\n(NVB-Buffer). This approach aims to address DRAM vulnerability against power\nfailure while reducing storage write traffic. In this paper, we use the most\npromising technologies for PJA among the emerging technologies, which is\nSTT-MRAM to meet the requirements of PJA (high endurance, non-volatility, and\nDRAM-like latency). However, STT-MRAM faces major reliability challenges, i.e.\nRetention Failure, Read Disturbance, and Write Failure. In this paper, we first\nshow that retention failure is the dominant source of errors in NVB-Buffers as\nit suffers from long and unpredictable page idle intervals. Then, we propose a\nnovel NVB-Buffer management scheme, named, Cold Page Awakening (CoPA), which\npredictably reduces the idle time of PJA pages. To this aim, CoPA employs\nDistant Refreshing to periodically overwrite the vulnerable PJA page contents\nby using their replica in DRAM-based buffer. We compare CoPA with the\nstate-of-the-art schemes over several workloads based on physical journaling.\nOur evaluations show that employing CoPA leads to three orders of magnitude\nlower failure rate with negligible performance degradation (1.1%) and memory\noverhead (1.2%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 18:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Its validity relies\non the assumptions of exchangeability of the data, and symmetry of the given\nmodel fitting algorithm as a function of the data.

For example, if\nthe data distribution drifts over time, then the data points are no longer\nexchangeable; moreover, in such settings, we might want to use a nonsymmetric\nalgorithm that treats recent observations as more relevant. This paper\ngeneralizes conformal prediction to deal with both aspects: we employ weighted\nquantiles to introduce robustness against distribution drift, and design a new\nrandomization technique to allow for algorithms that do not treat data points\nsymmetrically. Our new methods are provably robust, with substantially less\nloss of coverage when exchangeability is violated due to distribution drift or\nother challenging features of real data, while also achieving the same coverage\nguarantees as existing conformal prediction methods if the data points are in\nfact exchangeable.

These measurements are typically performed using\ncross-dispersed echelle spectrographs. Unfortunately such spectrographs are\nlarge and expensive and their accurate calibration continues to be challenging.\nThe aim is to develop a different way to provide a calibration signal. A\ncommonly used way to introduce a calibration signal is to insert an iodine cell\nin the beam. Disadvantages of this include that the lines are narrow, do not\ncover the entire spectrum and that light is absorbed. Here I show that\ninserting a birefringent element or an imaging Michelson, combined with\nWollaston prisms eliminates these three shortcomings, while maintaining most of\nthe benefits of the iodine approach. The proposed designs can be made very\ncompact, thereby providing a convenient way of calibrating a spectrograph.\nSimilar to the iodine cell approach, the calibration signal travels with the\nstellar signal, thereby reducing the sensitivity to spectrograph stability. The\nimposed signal covers the entire visible range and any temperature drifts will\nbe consistent and describable by a single number. Based on experience with\nsimilar devices used, in a different configuration, by the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager, it is shown that the calibration device can be made stable at\nthe 0.1 m/s level, over a significant wavelength range, on short to medium time\nscales.

Traditional alkaline electrolysis systems use simple\nproportional-integral-differentiation (PID) controllers to maintain the stack\ntemperature near the rated value. However, in renewable-to-hydrogen scenarios,\nthe stack temperature is disturbed by load fluctuations, and the temperature\novershoot phenomenon occurs which can exceed the upper limit and harm the\nstack. This paper focuses on the thermal modelling and controller design of an\nalkaline electrolysis system under dynamic operating conditions. A\ncontrol-oriented thermal model is established in the form of a third-order\ntime-delay process, which is used for simulation and controller design. Based\non this model, we propose two novel controllers to reduce temperature\novershoot: one is a current feed-forward PID controller (PID-I), the other is a\nmodel predictive controller (MPC). Their performances are tested on a lab-scale\nsystem and the experimental results are satisfying: the temperature overshoot\nis reduced by 2.2 degree with the PID-I controller, and no obvious overshoot is\nobserved with the MPC controller. Furthermore, the thermal dynamic performance\nof an MW-scale alkaline electrolysis system is analyzed by simulation, which\nshows that the temperature overshoot phenomenon is more general in large\nsystems.

Previous work along\nthis line of research only focuses on one-shot games in which the defender\nlearns the attacker's behavior and then designs a corresponding strategy only\nonce. Our work, on the other hand, investigates the long-term impact of the\nattacker's manipulation in which current attack and defense choices of players\ndetermine the future learning and patrol planning of the defender. This paper\nhas three key contributions.

The\nability of such methods to generalize well has been attributed to the their\nimplicit bias towards large margin predictors, both asymptotically as well as\nin finite time. We give an additional unified explanation for this\ngeneralization and relate it to two simple properties of the optimization\nobjective, that we refer to as realizability and self-boundedness. We introduce\na general setting of unconstrained stochastic convex optimization with these\nproperties, and analyze generalization of gradient methods through the lens of\nalgorithmic stability. In this broader setting, we obtain sharp stability\nbounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent which apply even\nfor a very large number of gradient steps, and use them to derive general\ngeneralization bounds for these algorithms. Finally, as direct applications of\nthe general bounds, we return to the setting of linear classification with\nseparable data and establish several novel test loss and test accuracy bounds\nfor gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for a variety of loss\nfunctions with different tail decay rates.

Popularity bias refers to the problem that popular items\n(i.e., frequently rated items) are recommended frequently while less popular\nitems are recommended rarely or not at all. Researchers adopted two approaches\nto examining popularity bias: (i) from the users' perspective, by analyzing how\nfar a recommendation system deviates from user's expectations in receiving\npopular items, and (ii) by analyzing the amount of exposure that long-tail\nitems receive, measured by overall catalog coverage and novelty. In this paper,\nwe examine the first point of view in the book domain, although the findings\nmay be applied to other domains as well. To this end, we analyze the well-known\nBook-Crossing dataset and define three user groups based on their tendency\ntowards popular items (i.e., Niche, Diverse, Bestseller-focused). Further, we\nevaluate the performance of nine state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and\ntwo baselines (i.e., Random, MostPop) from both the accuracy (e.g., NDCG,\nPrecision, Recall) and popularity bias perspectives. Our results indicate that\nmost state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms suffer from popularity bias in\nthe book domain, and fail to meet users' expectations with Niche and Diverse\ntastes despite having a larger profile size. Conversely, Bestseller-focused\nusers are more likely to receive high-quality recommendations, both in terms of\nfairness and personalization. Furthermore, our study shows a tradeoff between\npersonalization and unfairness of popularity bias in recommendation algorithms\nfor users belonging to the Diverse and Bestseller groups, that is, algorithms\nwith high capability of personalization suffer from the unfairness of\npopularity bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 20:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

One such method is variationally enhanced sampling (VES),\nwhich is based on a variational principle where a bias potential in the space\nof some chosen slow degrees of freedom, or collective variables, is constructed\nby minimizing a convex functional. In practice, the bias potential is taken as\na linear expansion in some basis function set. So far, primarily basis\nfunctions delocalized in the collective variable space, like plane waves,\nChebyshev, or Legendre polynomials, have been used. However, there has not been\nan extensive study of how the convergence behavior is affected by the choice of\nthe basis functions. In particular, it remains an open question if localized\nbasis functions might perform better. In this work, we implement, tune, and\nvalidate Daubechies wavelets as basis functions for VES\\@. The wavelets\nconstruct orthogonal and localized bases that exhibit an attractive\nmultiresolution property. We evaluate the performance of wavelet and other\nbasis functions on various systems, going from model potentials to the calcium\ncarbonate association process in water. We observe that wavelets exhibit\nexcellent performance and much more robust convergence behavior than all other\nbasis functions, as well as better performance than metadynamics. In\nparticular, using wavelet bases yields far smaller fluctuations of the bias\npotential within individual runs and smaller differences between independent\nruns.

A\ncentury later, we can draw on cross-fertilizations from network and game theory\nand the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics to substantiate them.\nEpidemiological spreading is thereby revealed as a fundamentally heterogeneous\nand erratic process that shares certain properties with more unwieldy\nphenomena, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, traffic jams, and stock crashes.\nThey are all characterised by high tail risks that materialize very rarely but\nfatally. That they arise from bursts of unlikely chains of localized random\n\"superspreader\" events, by which micro-scale fluctuations and uncertainties may\nget heftily magnified, makes their accurate prediction and control\nintrinsically and notoriously hard. That epidemic disease spreading is moreover\nclosely intertwined with equally heterogeneous genetic drift and information\nfeedback adds new challenges -- and chances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 23:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 15:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

The interference phase is interpreted as\na combination of a quantized statistical phase and an Aharonov-Bohm phase,\nproportional to the device area and the charge of the anyons propagating along\nthe device edge. This interpretation faces two challenges. First, the edge\nstates have a finite width and hence the device area is ill-defined. Second,\nmultiple localized anyons may be present in states that overlap with the edge,\nand it may not be clear whether a second anyon traveling along the edge will go\ninside or outside the region with a localized anyon and therefore whether or\nnot it should pick up a statistical phase. We show how one may overcome both\nchallenges. In a case where only one chiral edge mode passes through the\nconstrictions defining the interferometer, as when electrons in a constriction\nare in a Laughlin state with $\\nu=1/(2n+1)$ or the integer state at $\\nu=1$, we\nshow that the interference phase can be directly related to the total electron\ncharge contained in the interferometer. This holds for arbitrary\nelectron-electron interactions and holds even if the bulk of the interferometer\nhas a higher electron density than the region of the constrictions. In contrast\nto the device area or to the number of anyons inside a propagating edge\nchannel, the total charge is well-defined. We examine, at the microscopic\nlevel, how the relation between charge and phase is maintained when there is a\nsoft confining potential and disorder near the edge of the interferometer, and\nwe discuss briefly the complications that can occur when multiple chiral modes\ncan pass through the constriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 23:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In fact, several\nhardware virtualization features such as Intel PML, SPP, CAT, and EPT which\ncurrently can only be used by the hypervisor also be beneficial for processes\nthat run inside the VM.

Therefore, antimicrobial surveillance is essential to predict\nantibiotic resistance trends and monitor the results of medical interventions.\nTo address this, we developed machine learning (ML) models (deep and\nconventional algorithms) to predict antimicrobial resistance using antibiotic\nsusceptibility testing (ABST) data collected from patients clinically diagnosed\nwith primary and secondary pyoderma over a period of one year.

One\nof the main challenges of HSI classification is the lack of reliable labelled\nsamples. Various semi-supervised and unsupervised classification methods are\nproposed to handle the low number of labelled samples. Chief among them are\ngraph convolution networks (GCN) and their variants. These approaches exploit\nthe graph structure for semi-supervised and unsupervised classification. While\nseveral of these methods implicitly construct edge-weights, to our knowledge,\nnot much work has been done to estimate the edge-weights explicitly. In this\narticle, we estimate the edge-weights explicitly and use them for the\ndownstream classification tasks - both semi-supervised and unsupervised. The\nproposed edge-weights are based on two key insights - (a) Ensembles reduce the\nvariance and (b) Classes in HSI datasets and feature similarity have only\none-sided implications. That is, while same classes would have similar\nfeatures, similar features do not necessarily imply the same classes.\nExploiting these, we estimate the edge-weights using an aggregate of ensembles\nof watersheds over subsamples of features. These edge weights are evaluated for\nboth semi-supervised and unsupervised classification tasks. The evaluation for\nsemi-supervised tasks uses Random-Walk based approach. For the unsupervised\ncase, we use a simple filter using a graph convolution network (GCN). In both\nthese cases, the proposed edge weights outperform the traditional approaches to\ncompute edge-weights - Euclidean distances and cosine similarities.\nFascinatingly, with the proposed edge-weights, the simplest GCN obtained\nresults comparable to the recent state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 01:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

However, the interaction between N and BPDs, and the\neffect of N on the electronic properties of BPDs are still ambiguous, which\nsignificantly hinder the understanding on the electron-transport mechanism of\n4H-SiC-based bipolar power devices.

First-principles calculations verify that BPDs create occupied defect\nstates above the valence band maximum (VBM) and unoccupied defect states under\nthe conduction-band minimum (CBM) of undoped 4H-SiC. The electron transfer from\nthe defect states of intrinsic defects and native impurities to the unoccupied\ndefect states of BPDs gives rise to the acceptor-like behavior of BPDs in\nundoped 4H-SiC. Defect formation energies indicate that N atoms can\nspontaneously decorate BPDs during the N doping of 4H-SiC. The binding between\nN and BPD is strong against decomposition. The accumulation of N dopants at the\ncore of BPDs results in the accumulation of donor-like states at the core of\nBPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC.

Dynamic Assurance of these systems requires designing runtime\nsafety components like Out-of-Distribution detectors and risk estimators, which\nrequire labeled data from different operating modes of the system that belong\nto scenes with adverse operating conditions, sensors, and actuator faults.\nCollecting real-world data of these scenes can be expensive and sometimes not\nfeasible. So, scenario description languages with samplers like random and grid\nsearch are available to generate synthetic data from simulators, replicating\nthese real-world scenes. However, we point out three limitations in using these\nconventional samplers. First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the\nfeedback of previous results in the sampling process.

An optimal query plan for such queries is crucial for being\nable to run these queries within acceptable time bounds. However, with queries\ninvolving many tables, finding the optimal join order becomes a bottleneck in\nquery optimization. Due to the exponential nature of join order optimization,\noptimizers resort to heuristic solutions after a threshold number of tables.\nOur objective is two fold: (a) reduce the optimization time for generating\noptimal plans; and (b) improve the quality of the heuristic solution. In this\npaper, we propose a new massively parallel algorithm, MPDP, that can\nefficiently prune the large search space (via a novel plan enumeration\ntechnique) while leveraging the massive parallelism offered by modern hardware\n(Eg: GPUs).

As a result, we are able to increase\nthe heuristic-fall-back limit from 12 relations to 25 relations with same time\nbudget in PostgreSQL. Also, in order to handle queries with even larger number\nof tables, we augment MPDP to a well known heuristic, IDP$_2$ (iterative DP\nversion 2) and a novel heuristic UnionDP. By systematically exploring a much\nlarger search space, these heuristics provides query plans that are up to 7\ntimes cheaper as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques while being faster\nto compute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 02:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 15:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

In the vision\ncommunity, prior work primarily focuses on learning object affordance with\ndense (e.g., at a per-pixel level) supervision. In stark contrast, we humans\nlearn the object affordance without dense labels. As such, the fundamental\nquestion to devise a computational model is: What is the natural way to learn\nthe object affordance from visual appearance and geometry with humanlike sparse\nsupervision? In this work, we present a new task of part-level affordance\ndiscovery (PartAfford): Given only the affordance labels per object, the\nmachine is tasked to (i) decompose 3D shapes into parts and (ii) discover how\neach part of the object corresponds to a certain affordance category. We\npropose a novel learning framework for PartAfford, which discovers part-level\nrepresentations by leveraging only the affordance set supervision and geometric\nprimitive regularization, without dense supervision.

The initial condition is\nchosen in the regime of beam parameters for which quasilinear theory should be\napplicable. Quasilinear diffusion is initially in good agreement with the\ndirect simulation but later underestimates the turbulent momentum flux. The\ndirect simulation corrects from quasilinear evolution by quenching the\ninstability in a finite time and producing a robust state of oscillation. Flux\nenhancement above quasilinear levels occurs as the phase space eddy turnover\ntime in the largest amplitude wavepackets becomes comparable to the transit\ntime of resonant phase fluid through wavepacket potentials. In this regime\neddies effectively turn over during wavepacket transit so that phase fluid\npredominantly disperses by eddy phase mixing rather than by randomly phased\nwaves. The enhanced turbulent flux of resonant phase fluid leads in turn,\nthrough energy conservation, to an increase in non-resonant turbulent flux and\nthus to an enhanced heating of the main thermal body above quasilinear\npredictions. These findings shed light on the kinetic turbulence fluctuation\nspectrum and support the theory that collisionless momentum diffusion beyond\nthe quasilinear approximation can be understood through the dynamics of phase\nspace eddies (or clumps and granulations).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 03:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Secondly, reasoning ability: a\nqualified knowledge source should not only provide a collection of facts, but\nsupport a symbolic reasoner.

As a first result, it establishes an exact\nrelation between observable phase changes and the deformation tensor along the\nfibre. This relation is non-linear, and it includes effects related to both\nlocal changes in fibre length and deformation-induced changes of the local\nspeed of light or refractive index. In seismic applications, where the norm of\nthe earthquake-induced deformation tensor is orders of magnitude smaller than\n1, a useful first-order relation can be derived. It simply connects phase\nchanges to an integral over in-line strain along the fibre times the local\nrefractive index. Under the assumption that spatial variations of the\nrefractive index are fast compared to the seismic wavelength, this permits a\ndirect synthesis of phase change measurements from distributed strain\nmeasurements, for instance, from Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). A more\ndetailed analysis of the first-order relation reveals that a perfectly straight\nfibre would produce zero phase change measurements, unless deformation was\nsufficiently widespread to affect the starting and end points of the fibre. If\nthis condition is not met, non-zero measurements can only result from curvature\nof the fibre or from a heterogeneous distribution of the refractive index.\nSegments of the fibre that are strongly curved generally make larger\ncontributions to the observed phase change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 06:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

One such challenge is to 'undo' the effect of\na specific subset of dataset used for training a model. This specific subset\nmay contain malicious or adversarial data injected by an attacker, which\naffects the model performance. Another reason may be the need for a service\nprovider to remove data pertaining to a specific user to respect the user's\nprivacy. In both cases, the problem is to 'unlearn' a specific subset of the\ntraining data from a trained model without incurring the costly procedure of\nretraining the whole model from scratch. Towards this goal, this paper presents\na Markov chain Monte Carlo-based machine unlearning (MCU) algorithm. MCU helps\nto effectively and efficiently unlearn a trained model from subsets of training\ndataset. Furthermore, we show that with MCU, we are able to explain the effect\nof a subset of a training dataset on the model prediction. Thus, MCU is useful\nfor examining subsets of data to identify the adversarial data to be removed.\nSimilarly, MCU can be used to erase the lineage of a user's personal data from\ntrained ML models, thus upholding a user's \"right to be forgotten\". We\nempirically evaluate the performance of our proposed MCU algorithm on\nreal-world phishing and diabetes datasets.

Compared\nwith a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but\ntheir data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of\ninterest. Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a\ncollaborative fault diagnosis model. However, the modeling efficiency is\nseriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a\ndifferent computing capability and amount of data. Moreover, for the safe and\nstable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling\nmust be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server. To\naddress these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning\n(ADFL) framework is proposed. Each PV station not only trains its local model\nbut also participates in collaborative fault diagnosis by exchanging model\nparameters to improve the generalization without losing accuracy.

They are usually learned on historical user\nbehavior data to infer user interest and predict future user behaviors (e.g.,\nclicks). In fact, the behaviors of heavy users with more historical behaviors\ncan usually provide richer clues than cold users in interest modeling and\nfuture behavior prediction. Big models may favor heavy users by learning more\nfrom their behavior patterns and bring unfairness to cold users. In this paper,\nwe study whether big recommendation models are fair to cold users. We\nempirically demonstrate that optimizing the overall performance of big\nrecommendation models may lead to unfairness to cold users in terms of\nperformance degradation. To solve this problem, we propose a BigFair method\nbased on self-distillation, which uses the model predictions on original user\ndata as a teacher to regularize predictions on augmented data with randomly\ndropped user behaviors, which can encourage the model to fairly capture\ninterest distributions of heavy and cold users.

Amongst the many solutions, network intrusion detection emerged as one\nof the most popular to analyze network traffic and detect ongoing intrusions\nbased on rules or by means of Machine Learners (MLs), which process such\ntraffic and learn a model to suspect intrusions. Supervised MLs are very\neffective in detecting known threats, but struggle in identifying zero-day\nattacks (unknown during learning phase), which instead can be detected through\nunsupervised MLs. Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers on the\ncombined use of both approaches for network intrusion detection. In this paper\nwe first expand the problem of zero-day attacks and motivate the need to\ncombine supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We propose the adoption of\nmeta-learning, in the form of a two-layer Stacker, to create a mixed approach\nthat detects both known and unknown threats. Then we implement and empirically\nevaluate our Stacker through an experimental campaign that allows i) debating\non meta-features crafted through unsupervised base-level learners, ii) electing\nthe most promising supervised meta-level classifiers, and iii) benchmarking\nclassification scores of the Stacker with respect to supervised and\nunsupervised classifiers. Last, we compare our solution with existing works\nfrom the recent literature. Overall, our Stacker reduces misclassifications\nwith respect to (un)supervised ML algorithms in all the 7 public datasets we\nconsidered, and outperforms existing studies in 6 out of those 7 datasets. In\nparticular, it turns out to be more effective in detecting zero-day attacks\nthan supervised algorithms, limiting their main weakness but still maintaining\nadequate capabilities in detecting known attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 08:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Specifically, delving the bottom of the\ncause of poor transferability, we arguably decompose and reconstruct the\nexisting model architecture into an effective model architecture, namely\nmulti-track model architecture (MMA). The adversarial examples crafted on the\nMMA can maximumly relieve the effect of model-specified features to it and\ntoward the vulnerable directions adopted by diverse architectures. Extensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that the transferability of adversarial\nexamples based on the MMA significantly surpass other state-of-the-art model\narchitectures by up to 40% with comparable overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 09:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

To this end, we firstly construct a Multimodal Sentiment Chat\nTranslation Dataset (MSCTD) containing 142,871 English-Chinese utterance pairs\nin 14,762 bilingual dialogues and 30,370 English-German utterance pairs in\n3,079 bilingual dialogues. Each utterance pair, corresponding to the visual\ncontext that reflects the current conversational scene, is annotated with a\nsentiment label. Then, we benchmark the task by establishing multiple baseline\nsystems that incorporate multimodal and sentiment features for MCT. Preliminary\nexperiments on four language directions (English-Chinese and English-German)\nverify the potential of contextual and multimodal information fusion and the\npositive impact of sentiment on the MCT task. Additionally, as a by-product of\nthe MSCTD, it also provides two new benchmarks on multimodal dialogue sentiment\nanalysis. Our work can facilitate research on both multimodal chat translation\nand multimodal dialogue sentiment analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 09:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In either case,\nsufficient temporal accuracy is essential.\n  The presented work investigates the temporal accuracy of BBI estimation from\nphotoplethysmographic signals. Within comprehensive numerical simulation, we\nsystematically assess the impact of sampling rate, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nand beat-to-beat shape variations on the root mean square error (RMSE) between\nreal and estimated BBI.\n  Our results show that at sampling rates beyond 14 Hz only small errors exist\nwhen interpolation is used. For example, the average RMSE is 3 ms for a\nsampling rate of 14 Hz and an SNR of 18 dB. Further increasing the sampling\nrate only results in marginal improvements, e.g. more than tripling the\nsampling rate to 50 Hz reduces the error by approx. 14%. The most important\nfinding relates to the SNR, which is shown to have a much stronger influence on\nthe error than the sampling rate. For example, increasing the SNR from 18 dB to\n24 dB at 14 Hz sampling rate reduced the error by almost 50% to 1.5 ms. Subtle\nbeat-to-beat shape variations, moreover, increase the error decisively by up to\n800%.\n  Our results are highly relevant in three regards: first, they partially\nexplain different results in the literature on minimum sampling rates.

Correlations may stem either from direct\ninteractions between the particles, from long-range exchange of photons, or by\nmeasuring single photons in a common mode. Yet, the genuine spatial spontaneous\nemission pattern of an atomic ensemble in an entangled quantum state has not\nbeen observed so far, due to the lack of ultra-fast cameras with high spatial\nresolution suited for recording single photons from single atoms.

We conclude that optical tweezers are a useful method for\ncontrolling interactions in trapped ion quantum simulators in the presence of\nmicromotion and imperfections in the tweezer alignment, but require intensity\nstabilization on the sub-percent level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 11:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results,\nfurther adoption of the models is hindered by: (1) inter-class indistinction,\nthe normal brain tissue resembles the lesion in appearance. (2) intra-class\ninconsistency, large variability exists between different areas of the lesion.\nTo solve these challenges in stroke segmentation, we propose a novel method,\nnamely Attention Guided Multiscale Recovery framework (AGMR-Net) in this paper.\nFirstly, a coarse-grained patch attention module in the encoding is adopted to\nget a patch-based coarse-grained attention map in a multi-stage explicitly\nsupervised way, enabling target spatial context saliency representation with a\npatch-based weighting technique that eliminates the effect of intra-class\ninconsistency. Secondly, to obtain a more detailed boundary partitioning to\nsolve the challenge of the inter-class indistinction, a newly designed\ncross-dimensional feature fusion module is used to capture global contextual\ninformation to further guide the selective aggregation of 2D and 3D features,\nwhich can compensate for the lack of boundary learning capability of 2D\nconvolution. Lastly, in the decoding stage, an innovative designed multi-scale\ndeconvolution upsampling instead of linear interpolation enhances the recovery\nof target space and boundary information.

Modern\ncomputational plasma codes, relying upon Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nmethods, allow for resolving the coronal features using solar surface\nmagnetograms as inputs.

The observation of\ndynamics in chiral molecules is crucial for the understanding and control of\nthe chiral activity of photo-excited states. One of the most promising\ntechniques for the study of photo-excited chiral systems is time-resolved\nphotoelectron circular dichroism (TR-PECD), which offers an intense and\nsensitive probe for vibronic and geometric molecular structure as well as\nelectronic structures, and their evolution on a femtosecond timescale. However,\nthe non-local character of the PECD effect, which is imprinted during the\nelectron scattering off the molecule, makes the interpretation of TR-PECD\nexperiments challenging. In this respect, core-photoionization is known to\nallow site- and chemical-sensitivity to photelectron spectroscopy. Here we\ndemonstrate that TR-PECD utilising core-level photoemission enables probing the\nchiral electronic structure and its relaxation dynamics with atomic site\nsensitivity. Following UV pumped excitation to a 3s Rydberg state, fenchone\nenantiomers (C 10 H 16 O) were probed on a femtosecond scale using circularly\npolarized soft X-ray light pulses provided by the free-electron laser FERMI. C\n1s binding energy shifts caused by the redistribution of valence electron\ndensity in this 3s-valence-Rydberg excitation allowed us to measure transient\nPECD chiral responses with an enhanced C-atom site-selectivity compared to that\nachievable in the ground state molecule.

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is one promising\nmitigation that is more and more widely deployed and prevents numerous\nexploits. CFI focuses purely on one security domain. That is, transitions\nbetween user space and kernel space are not protected by CFI. Furthermore, if\nuser space CFI is bypassed, the system and kernel interfaces remain\nunprotected, and an attacker can run arbitrary transitions.\n  In this paper, we introduce the concept of syscall-flow-integrity protection\n(SFIP) that complements the concept of CFI with integrity for user-kernel\ntransitions. Our proof-of-concept implementation relies on static analysis\nduring compilation to automatically extract possible syscall transitions. An\napplication can opt-in to SFIP by providing the extracted information to the\nkernel for runtime enforcement. The concept is built on three fully-automated\npillars: First, a syscall state machine, representing possible transitions\naccording to a syscall digraph model. Second, a syscall-origin mapping, which\nmaps syscalls to the locations at which they can occur. Third, an efficient\nenforcement of syscall-flow integrity in a modified Linux kernel. In our\nevaluation, we show that SFIP can be applied to large scale applications with\nminimal slowdowns. In a micro- and a macrobenchmark, it only introduces an\noverhead of 13.1% and 1.8%, respectively. In terms of security, we discuss and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in preventing control-flow-hijacking attacks in\nreal-world applications. Finally, to highlight the reduction in attack surface,\nwe perform an analysis of the state machines and syscall-origin mappings of\nseveral real-world applications. On average, SFIP decreases the number of\npossible transitions by 38.6% compared to seccomp and 90.9% when no protection\nis applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 12:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Relatively flexible markets have the ability to\nramp up (or down) power flows across interties without compromising their\nability to reliably meet internal demand. In this paper, a market mechanism to\nenable flexibility trading amongst market operators is introduced. In the\nproposed market mechanism, market operators exchange information regarding\noptimal terms of trade (nodal prices and flows) along interconnection lines at\nevery trading round. Equipped with this information, each market operator then\nindependently solves its own internal chance-constrained economic dispatch\nproblem and broadcasts the updated optimal terms of trade for flows across\nmarkets. We show the proposed decentralized market mechanism for flexibility\ntrading converges to a Nash equilibrium of the intraday market coupling game,\ni.e. a combination of internal market clearing solutions (one for each\nparticipating market) and flows and prices along interconnection lines so that\nno individual market operator has an incentive to modify its own internal\nsolution and/or the terms of trade along interties. For a specific class of\nchance constraints, we show that the limiting equilibrium outcome is efficient,\ni.e. it corresponds to the solution of the single market clearing problem for\nall participating markets.

The most popular\nimputation algorithm is arguably multiple imputations using chains of equations\n(MICE), which estimates missing values from linear conditioning on observed\nvalues. This paper proposes methods to improve both the imputation accuracy of\nMICE and the classification accuracy of imputed data by replacing MICE's linear\nconditioning with ensemble learning and deep neural networks (DNN). The\nimputation accuracy is further improved by characterizing individual samples\nwith cluster labels (CISCL) obtained from the training data. Our extensive\nanalyses involving six tabular data sets, up to 80% missingness, and three\nmissingness types (missing completely at random, missing at random, missing not\nat random) reveal that ensemble or deep learning within MICE is superior to the\nbaseline MICE (b-MICE), both of which are consistently outperformed by CISCL.\nResults show that CISCL plus b-MICE outperforms b-MICE for all percentages and\ntypes of missingness. Our proposed DNN based MICE and gradient boosting MICE\nplus CISCL (GB-MICE-CISCL) outperform seven other baseline imputation\nalgorithms in most experimental cases. The classification accuracy on the data\nimputed by GB-MICE is improved by proposed GB-MICE-CISCL imputed data across\nall missingness percentages. Results also reveal a shortcoming of the MICE\nframework at high missingness (>50%) and when the missing type is not random.\nThis paper provides a generalized approach to identifying the best imputation\nmodel for a data set with a missingness percentage and type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The aim\nof the study was a better understanding of interactions between hydrogen and\ncrystalline defects and especially vacancies. Experimental data demonstrate\nthat during natural ageing in hydrogen environment, the hardening response is\ndelayed. This is attributed to a slower recovery of excess vacancies linked to\na lower mobility. To confirm and quantify the influence of hydrogen on the\nvacancy migration energy, artificial ageing was carried out in conditions where\nthe vacancy concentration is constant. Hence, long-time annealing treatments\nwere carried out to investigate the influence of hydrogen on the coarsening of\nrod-shaped precipitates. Using transmission electron microscopy and atom probe\ntomography, it was demonstrated that the precipitate volume fraction and\ncomposition are unchanged under H2 atmosphere but the coarsening kinetic is\nsignificantly reduced. This leads to a delayed softening, in good agreement\nwith theoretical estimates. Thus, even a low concentration of hydrogen in solid\nsolution significantly affects the mobility of alloying elements in the\naluminium matrix. This is the result of hydrogen-vacancy interactions that lead\nto an increase of the vacancy migration energy. Based on classical coarsening\ntheories, it was possible to demonstrate that this increase is of about 5% for\na concentration of hydrogen close to the vacancy concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In the existing systems,\nultra-flat bands only emerge at very small twist angles less than a few\ndegrees, which poses challenge for experimental study and practical\napplications. Here, we propose a new design principle to achieve low-energy\nultra-flat bands with increased twist angles. The key condition is to have a 2D\nsemiconducting material with large energy difference of band edges controlled\nby stacking. We show that the interlayer interaction leads to defect-like\nstates under twisting, which forms a flat band in the semiconducting band gap\nwith dispersion strongly suppressed by the large energy barriers in the moire\nsuperlattice even for large twist angles. We explicitly demonstrate our idea in\nbilayer alpha-In2Se3 and bilayer InSe. For bilayer alpha-In2Se3, we show that a\ntwist angle -13.2 degree is sufficient to achieve the band flatness comparable\nto that of twist bilayer graphene at the magic angle -1.1 degree. In addition,\nthe appearance of ultra-flat bands here is not sensitive to the twist angle as\nin bilayer graphene, and it can be further controlled by external gate fields.\nOur finding provides a new route to achieve ultra-flat bands other than\nreducing the twist angles and paves the way towards engineering such flat bands\nin a large family of 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

We additionally surface an interesting\nphenomenon: a trade-off between the similarity and recognizability of the\nspell-corrected inks.

Geometric constraint solving can date back to the very first\nCAD prototype, Sketchpad, in the 1960s, but serious research studies were\ncarried out only after parametric CAD was introduced in the late 1980s. In the\nfollowing 30-year history of GCS research, two development stages may be\nidentified: (1) the first 15 years (late 1980s - mid 2000s) were primarily\ndevoted to geometric constraint decomposition for well-constrained systems or\nthose with only structural constraint dependencies; and (2) the second 15 years\n(late 2000s - now) have seen research efforts shifted towards classification\ncriteria and decomposition algorithms for general constraint systems (with and\nwithout non-structural constraint dependencies). Most existing reviews focused\non the first 15 years. The problem researched in the second 15 years is,\nhowever, equally important, considering that a manually specified constraint\nsystem usually contains under- and over-constrained parts, and that such parts\nmust be correctly detected and resolved before numerical solving can work. In\nthis regard, this review paper covers both stages and will discusses what has\nalready been made possible for handling general constraint systems, what\ndevelopments can be expected in the near future, and which areas remain\nproblematic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 03:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning (SCL) is\nregarded as a promising way to address this problem. However, the existing\nworks mainly rely on hand-crafted data annotation heuristics to generate\npositive training samples, which not only call for domain expertise and\nlaborious tuning, but are also prone to the following unfavorable cases: 1)\ntrivial positives, 2) coarse-grained positives, and 3) false positives. As a\nresult, the self-supervision's quality can be severely limited in reality. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework InfoCSE to address the above problems.\nInstead of relying on annotation heuristics defined by humans, it leverages the\nsentence representation model itself and realizes the following iterative\nself-supervision process: on one hand, the improvement of sentence\nrepresentation may contribute to the quality of data annotation; on the other\nhand, more effective data annotation helps to generate high-quality positive\nsamples, which will further improve the current sentence representation model.\nIn other words, the representation learning and data annotation become mutually\nreinforced, where a strong self-supervision effect can be derived.

The X-ray emission is complex, requiring both photoionized and\nshock-ionized gas. It originates from high ionization regions and is surrounded\nby cocoons of low ionization narrow line emission regions (LINERS). Bicone 3-6\nkeV continuum and 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha emission has been detected, contrary to the\nstandard AGN model expectation that would confine this hard emission to the\npc-size nuclear absorbing torus. Extended emission in the cross-cone direction,\nalso requires modifications to the AGN standard model.

The latter means that the game can be reduced to\nthe resolution of an auxiliary variational problem.\n  In the present work we study dynamic Cournot-Nash equilibria in their natural\ngenerality, namely going beyond the potential case. As a first result, we\nderive existence and uniqueness of equilibria under suitable assumptions.\nSecond, we study the convergence of the natural fixed-point iterations scheme\nin the quadratic case. Finally we illustrate the previously mentioned results\nin a toy model of optimal liquidation with price impact, which is a game of\nnon-potential kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Here, these challenges are\ndiscussed in the framework of Solar System observations, and transits of\nMercury in particular. Radiation pressure is important for alkali gas dynamics\nin close-orbiting exoplanets since the D lines are efficient at resonant\nscattering. When the star-planet velocity is >10km/s, eccentric exoplanets\nexperience more than an order of magnitude higher radiation pressures, aiding\natmospheric escape and producing a larger effective cross-section for absorbing\nstarlight at the phase of transit. The Doppler shift also aids in isolating the\nplanetary signature from the stellar photosphere's absorption. Only one\ntransiting exoplanet, HD 80606b, is presently thought to have both this\nrequisite Doppler shift and alkali absorption. Radiation pressure on a\nplanetary exosphere naturally produces blue-shifted absorption, but at levels\ninsufficient to account for the extreme Doppler shifts that have been inferred\nfrom potassium transit measurements of this system. In the absence of clear\nmechanisms to generate such a strong wind, it is described how this\ncharacteristic could arise from an exomoon-magnetosphere interaction, analogous\nto Io-Jupiter. At low contrasts presented here, follow-up transit spectra of HD\n80606b cannot rule out a potassium jet or atmospheric species with a broad\nabsorption structure. However, it is evident that line absorption within the\nimaging passbands fails to explain the narrow-band photometry that has been\nreported in-transit. New observations of energetic alkalis produced by the\nIo-Jupiter interaction are also presented, which illustrate that energetic\nsodium Doppler structure offers a more valuable marker for the presence of an\nexomoon than potassium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In the present study, I provide a prototype implementation of how\none might curb self-modifying code by introducing control mechanisms for code\nmodifications within specific regions and for specific transitions between code\nand data. I show that this is possible to achieve with the so-called allagmatic\nmethod - a framework to formalise, model, implement, and interpret complex\nsystems inspired by Gilbert Simondon's philosophy of individuation and Alfred\nNorth Whitehead's philosophy of organism. Thereby, the allagmatic method serves\nas guidance for self-modification based on concepts defined in a metaphysical\nframework. I conclude that the allagmatic method seems to be a suitable\nframework for control mechanisms in self-modifying code and that there are\nintriguing analogies between the presented control mechanisms and gene\nregulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 14:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In those studies on quantum foundations, the notion of\nuncertainty plays a primary role among several stunning features of quantum\ntheory. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate fundamental aspects of\nuncertainty. In particular, we address this problem focusing on convexity,\nwhich has an operational origin. We first try to reveal why in quantum theory\nsimilar bounds are often obtained for two types of uncertainty relations,\nnamely, preparation and measurement uncertainty relations. To do this, we\nconsider uncertainty relations in the most general framework of physics called\ngeneralized probabilistic theories (GPTs). It is proven that some geometric\nstructures of states connect those two types of uncertainty relations in GPTs\nin terms of several expressions such as entropic one. Our result implies what\nis essential for the close relation between those uncertainty relations. Then\nwe consider a broader expression of uncertainty in quantum theory called\nquantum incompatibility. Motivated by an operational intuition, we propose and\ninvestigate new quantifications of incompatibility which are related directly\nto the convexity of states. It is also shown that there can be observed a\nnotable phenomenon for those quantities even in the simplest incompatibility\nfor a pair of mutually unbiased qubit observables. Finally, we study\nthermodynamical entropy of mixing in quantum theory, which also can be seen as\na quantification of uncertainty. We consider its operationally natural\nextension to GPTs, and then try to characterize how specific the entropy in\nquantum theory is. It is shown that the operationally natural entropy is\nallowed to exist only in classical and quantum-like theories among a class of\nGPTs called regular polygon theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Nevertheless, we can ask for partial\nidentification, which usually boils down to finding upper and lower bounds of a\ncausal quantity of interest derived from all solutions compatible with the\nencoded structural assumptions. One appealing way to derive such bounds is by\ncasting it in terms of a constrained optimization method that searches over all\ncausal models compatible with evidence, as introduced in the classic work of\nBalke and Pearl (1994) for discrete data. Although by construction this\nguarantees tight bounds, it poses a formidable computational challenge. To cope\nwith this issue, alternatives include algorithms that are not guaranteed to be\ntight, or by introducing restrictions on the class of models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel alternative: inspired by ideas coming from belief\npropagation, we enforce compatibility between marginals of a causal model and\ndata, without constructing a global causal model. We call this collection of\nlocally consistent marginals the causal marginal polytope. As global\nindependence constraints disappear when considering small dimensional tractable\nmarginals, this also leads to a rethinking of how to elicit and express causal\nknowledge.

The underlying magnetic processes driving these\ncampfires are not understood. During the cruise phase of SO and at a distance\nof 0.523\\,AU from the Sun, the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on Solar\nOrbiter (SO/PHI) observed a quiet-Sun region jointly with SO/EUI, offering the\npossibility to investigate the surface magnetic field dynamics underlying\ncampfires at a spatial resolution of about 380~km.\n  In 71\\% of the 38 isolated events, campfires are confined between bipolar\nmagnetic features, which seem to exhibit signatures of magnetic flux\ncancellation. The flux cancellation occurs either between the two main\nfootpoints, or between one of the footpoints of the loop housing the campfire\nand a nearby opposite polarity patch. In one particularly clear-cut case, we\ndetected the emergence of a small-scale magnetic loop in the internetwork\nfollowed soon afterwards by a campfire brightening adjacent to the location of\nthe linear polarisation signal in the photosphere, that is to say near where\nthe apex of the emerging loop lays. The rest of the events were observed over\nsmall scattered magnetic features, which could not be identified as magnetic\nfootpoints of the campfire hosting loops. The majority of campfires could be\ndriven by magnetic reconnection triggered at the footpoints, similar to the\nphysical processes occurring in the burst-like EUV events discussed in the\nliterature. About a quarter of all analysed campfires, however, are not\nassociated to such magnetic activity in the photosphere, which implies that\nother heating mechanisms are energising these small-scale EUV brightenings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

These patient-specific\ncomputational forecasts have been regarded as a promising approach to\npersonalize the clinical management of cancer and derive optimal treatment\nplans for individual patients, which constitute timely and critical needs in\nclinical oncology. However, the computer simulation of the underlying\nspatiotemporal models can entail a prohibitive computational cost, which\nconstitutes a barrier to the successful development of clinically-actionable\ncomputational technologies for personalized tumor forecasting. To address this\nissue, here we propose to utilize Dynamic-Mode Decomposition (DMD) to construct\na low-dimensional representation of cancer models and accelerate their\nsimulation. DMD is an unsupervised machine learning method based on the\nsingular value decomposition that has proven useful in many applications as\nboth a predictive and a diagnostic tool. We show that DMD may be applied to\nFisher-Kolmogorov models, which constitute an established formulation to\nrepresent untreated solid tumor growth that can further accommodate other\nrelevant cancer phenomena. Our results show that a DMD implementation of this\nmodel over a clinically-relevant parameter space can yield impressive\npredictions, with short to medium-term errors remaining under 1% and long-term\nerrors remaining under 20%, despite very short training periods. We posit that\nthis data-driven approach has the potential to greatly reduce the computational\noverhead of personalized simulations of cancer models, thereby facilitating\ntumor forecasting, parameter identification, uncertainty quantification, and\ntreatment optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

In this paper, we aim to define and\nbenchmark two ReCDS tasks: Patient-to-Article Retrieval (ReCDS-PAR) and\nPatient-to-Patient Retrieval (ReCDS-PPR) using a novel dataset called\nPMC-Patients. Methods: We extract patient summaries from PubMed Central\narticles using simple heuristics and utilize the PubMed citation graph to\ndefine patient-article relevance and patient-patient similarity. We also\nimplement and evaluate several ReCDS systems on the PMC-Patients benchmarks,\nincluding sparse retrievers, dense retrievers, and nearest neighbor retrievers.\nWe conduct several case studies to show the clinical utility of PMC-Patients.\nResults: PMC-Patients contains 167k patient summaries with 3.1M patient-article\nrelevance annotations and 293k patient-patient similarity annotations, which is\nthe largest-scale resource for ReCDS and also one of the largest patient\ncollections. Human evaluation and analysis show that PMC-Patients is a diverse\ndataset with high-quality annotations.

This paper presents a method for SCM resource allocation\nand the relevant information recovery algorithms at the receiver. Our emphasis\nis on cyclic prefixed SCM, where highly flexible and efficient frequency domain\ndetection algorithms enable the operation of many simultaneous users in a\nmassive MIMO uplink scenario. The proposed resource allocation method allows\nthe number of users to exceed the number of antennas at the base station (BS).\nEach single carrier transmission is partitioned into $L$ interleaved streams,\nand each user is allocated a number of such streams. One major benefit of SCM\nis that each data symbol is spread over the entire bandwidth. As such, the\nreceiver performance is dictated by the average channel gain across the\ntransmission band rather than the channel gain at a given frequency bin or a\nsmall group of frequencies. In the proposed setup, each stream may be thought\nof as a resource block in SCM, analogous to resource blocks in OFDM. Hence, in\nthe context of this paper, the terms resource blocks and streams may be used\ninterchangeably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The distinguishing feature of these numerical\nintegrators is that they involve solutions to implicitly defined equations.\nLagrangian Monte Carlo (LMC) proposes to eliminate the fixed point iterations\nby transitioning from the Hamiltonian formalism to Lagrangian dynamics, wherein\na fully explicit integrator is available. This work makes several contributions\nregarding the numerical integrator used in LMC. First, it has been claimed in\nthe literature that the integrator is only first-order accurate for the\nLagrangian equations of motion; to the contrary, we show that the LMC\nintegrator enjoys second order accuracy. Second, the current conception of LMC\nrequires four determinant computations in every step in order to maintain\ndetailed balance; we propose a simple modification to the integration procedure\nin LMC in order to reduce the number of determinant computations from four to\ntwo while still retaining a fully explicit numerical integration scheme. Third,\nwe demonstrate that the LMC integrator enjoys a certain robustness to human\nerror that is not shared with the generalized leapfrog integrator, which can\ninvalidate detailed balance in the latter case. We discuss these contributions\nwithin the context of several benchmark Bayesian inference tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Although disentangling and understanding the correlations among\nspatial, temporal, and graph aspects have been a long-standing key topic in\nnetwork science, they typically rely on network processing hypothesized by\nhuman knowledge.

This approach provides pixel-wise uncertainty\nestimates and a marginal likelihood objective for hyperparameter optimisation.\nWe demonstrate the method on synthetic data and real-measured high-resolution\n2D $\\mu$CT data, and show that it provides superior calibration of uncertainty\nestimates relative to previous probabilistic formulations of the DIP. Our code\nis available at https://github.com/educating-dip/bayes_dip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:47:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 09:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

The groundtruth was extracted from foot IMU sensors. Fairly high\naccuracy of 99.73% and 93.89% was achieved by the CNN-BiGRU-Att model at the\ntolerance window of $\\pm$6TS ($\\pm$6ms) and $\\pm$1TS ($\\pm$1ms) respectively.\nAdvancing from the previous studies exploring gait event detection, the model\nshowed a great improvement in terms of its prediction error having an MAE of\n6.239ms and 5.24ms for HS and TO events respectively at the tolerance window of\n$\\pm$1TS. The results showed that the use of CNN-RNN hybrid models with\nAttention and Bidirectional mechanisms is promising for accurate gait event\ndetection using a single waist sensor. The study can contribute to reducing the\nburden of gait detection and increase its applicability in future wearable\ndevices that can be used for remote health monitoring (RHM) or diagnosis based\nthereon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 11:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

For Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) 21 cm power spectrum\nmeasurements, extreme levels of gridding resolution are required to reduce\nspectral contamination, as explored in other works. However, the role of the\nshape of the Fourier space spreading function, or kernel, also has consequences\nin reconstructed power spectra. We decompose the instrumental Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA) beam into a series of Gaussians and simulate the effects\nof finite kernel extents and differing shapes in gridding/degridding for\noptimal map making analyses. For the MWA, we find that the kernel must extend\nout to 0.001--0.0001% of the maximum value in order to measure the EoR using\nforeground avoidance. This requirement changes depending on beam shape, with\ncompact kernels requiring far smaller extents for similar contamination levels\nat the cost of less-optimal errors. However, simple calibration using pixelated\ndegridding results, regardless of shape of the kernel, cannot recover the EoR\ndue to catastrophic errors caused by the pixel resolution. Including an opaque\nhorizon with widefield beams also causes significant spectral contamination via\na beam--horizon interaction that creates an infinitely extended kernel in\nFourier space, which cannot be represented well. Thus, our results indicate\nthat simple calibration via degridded models and optimal map making for extreme\nwidefield instrumentation are not feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 05:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}
