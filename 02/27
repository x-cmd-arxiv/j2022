Moreover, it is promising that lots\nof networks can be deployed on wearable devices. An increasing number of\nmethods can be used to realize ECG signal classification for the sake of\narrhythmia detection. However, the existing neural networks proposed for\narrhythmia detection are not hardware-friendly enough due to a remarkable\nquantity of parameters resulting in memory and power consumption.\n  In this paper, we present a 1-D adaptive loss-aware quantization, achieving a\nhigh compression rate that reduces memory consumption by 23.36 times. In order\nto adapt to our compression method, we need a smaller and simpler network. We\npropose a 17 layer end-to-end neural network classifier to classify 17\ndifferent rhythm classes trained on the MIT-BIH dataset, realizing a\nclassification accuracy of 93.5%, which is higher than most existing methods.\nDue to the adaptive bitwidth method making important layers get more attention\nand offered a chance to prune useless parameters, the proposed quantization\nmethod avoids accuracy degradation. It even improves the accuracy rate, which\nis 95.84%, 2.34% higher than before. Our study achieves a 1-D convolutional\nneural network with high performance and low resources consumption, which is\nhardware-friendly and illustrates the possibility of deployment on wearable\ndevices to realize a real-time arrhythmia diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 14:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

This paper proposes a novel EEG-based emotion recognition\nmodel called the domain adversarial graph attention model (DAGAM). The basic\nidea is to generate a graph to model multichannel EEG signals using biological\ntopology. Graph theory can topologically describe and analyze relationships and\nmutual dependency between channels of EEG. Then, unlike other graph\nconvolutional networks, self-attention pooling is applied to benefit salient\nEEG feature extraction from the graph, which effectively improves the\nperformance. Finally, after graph pooling, the domain adversarial based on the\ngraph is employed to identify and handle EEG variation across subjects,\nefficiently reaching good generalizability. We conduct extensive evaluations on\ntwo benchmark datasets (SEED and SEED IV) and obtain state-of-the-art results\nin subject-independent emotion recognition.

The high performance of modern neural network-based MRC\nsystems depends on high-quality, large-scale, human-annotated training\ndatasets. In the biomedical domain, a crucial challenge in creating such\ndatasets is the requirement for domain knowledge, inducing the scarcity of\nlabeled data and the need for transfer learning from the labeled\ngeneral-purpose (source) domain to the biomedical (target) domain.

In particular, the KR field has an\ninteraction with a scalaron field (coming from higher curvature d.o.f) by a\nlinear coupling. The interaction energy density between the KR and the scalaron\ngrows faster than $a^{-6}$ during the contraction phase -- which has negligible\neffects at the distant past, however as the universe continues to contract,\nthis interaction energy density gradually grows and plays a significant role to\ntrigger a non-singular bounce at a minimum value of the scale factor. The\nbounce being symmetric and ekpyrotic, the energy density of the bouncing agent\nrapidly decreases after the bounce during the expanding phase of the universe,\nand consequently the standard Big-Bang cosmology gets recovered. In such\nekpyrotic bounce scenario, we find that the curvature perturbation gets a blue\ntilted spectrum over the large scale modes -- not consistent with the Planck\ndata. To circumvent this problem, we propose an extended scenario where the\nekpyrotic phase is preceded by a quasi-matter dominated pre-ekpyrotic phase,\nand re-investigate the perturbation power spectrum. As a result, the primordial\ncurvature perturbation, at scales that cross the horizon during the\npre-ekpyrotic stage, turns out to be nearly scale invariant that is indeed\nconsistent with the recent Planck data. The hallmark of the work is that\nalthough the Kalb-Ramond field has negligible footprints at present universe,\nit has considerable impacts during early stage of the universe, which in turn\nmakes the universe's evolution non-singular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 17:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 06:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Instead of tracking the state of individual lattice sites,\nthis approach describes the time evolution of the concentrations of different\ncluster types. It leads to an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential\nequations which must be closed by truncation using a so-called closure\ncondition. This condition approximates the concentrations of higher-order\nclusters in terms of the concentrations of lower-order ones. The pair\napproximation is the most common form of closure. Here, we consider its\ngeneralization, termed the \"optimal approximation\", which we calibrate using a\nrobust data-driven strategy. To fix attention, we focus on a recently proposed\nstructured lattice model for a nickel-based oxide, similar to that used as\ncathode material in modern commercial Li-ion batteries. The form of the\nobtained optimal approximation allows us to deduce a simple sparse closure\nmodel. In addition to being more accurate than the classical pair\napproximation, this ``sparse approximation'' is also physically interpretable\nwhich allows us to a posteriori refine the hypotheses underlying construction\nof this class of closure models. Moreover, the mean-cluster model closed with\nthis sparse approximation is linear and hence analytically solvable such that\nits parametrization is straightforward. On the other hand, parametrization of\nthe mean-cluster model closed with the pair approximation is shown to lead to\nan ill-posed inverse problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 20:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In order to achieve scalable PQC\nlearning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines\ninstead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to\nobtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the\nnumber of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of\npractical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that\ndue to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients\nobtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the\ntraining accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient\npruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then\nremove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than\nlarge ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive\nexperiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5\nclassification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate\nthat our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and\n4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings\nup to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning.

Accordingly,\nmany studies have investigated efficient and robust dynamic state estimation\n(DSE) methods in order to accurately compute the dynamic states of generation\nunits. Nonetheless, most of them forego the dynamic-algebraic nature of power\nnetworks and only consider their nonlinear dynamic representations. Motivated\nby the lack of DSE methods based on power network's differential-algebraic\nequations (DAEs), this paper develops a novel observer-based DSE framework in\norder to perform simultaneous estimation of the dynamic and algebraic states of\nmulti-machine power networks.

To\naddress this limitation, a dual neighborhood hypergraph neural network is\nproposed in this article, which combines the multiscale superpixel segmentation\nand hypergraph convolution to model and exploit the complex relationships.\nFirst, the bi-temporal image pairs are segmented under two scales and fed to a\npre-trained U-net to obtain node features by treating each object under the\nfine scale as a node. The dual neighborhood is then defined using the\nfather-child and adjacent relationships of the segmented objects to construct\nthe hypergraph, which permits models to represent the higher-order structured\ninformation far more complex than just pairwise relationships. The hypergraph\nconvolutions are conducted on the constructed hypergraph to propagate the label\ninformation from a small amount of labeled nodes to the other unlabeled ones by\nthe node-edge-node transform. Moreover, to alleviate the problem of imbalanced\nsample, the focal loss function is adopted to train the hypergraph neural\nnetwork.

It is proved that\nthe periodic curve can be uniquely determined by the near-field measurement\ndata corresponding to infinitely many incident plane waves with distinct\ndirections at a fixed frequency. Our proof is based on Schiffer's idea which\nconsists of two ingredients: i) the total fields for incident plane waves with\ndistinct directions are linearly independent, and ii) there exist only finitely\nmany linearly independent Dirichlet eigenfunctions in a bounded domain or in a\nclosed waveguide under additional assumptions on the waveguide boundary.

A critical\ndependence on the hadron's twist, $\\tau$, the number of hadron constituents, is\nfound for the onset of CT, with no significant effects from the nuclear medium.\nThis effect can explain the absence of proton CT in the present kinematic range\nof the JLab experiment.

The transient dynamics is investigated\nhere in a classic ecological model of a bistable tri-trophic food chain. All\nthe species in the food chain either coexist or undergoes a partial extinction\nwith the loss of predator after a transient time that depends upon the initial\ndensity of species populations. The distribution of transient time of\nextinction of the predator in response to initial states shows interesting\npattern of inhomogeneity and anisotropy in the basin of predator-fee state.\nPrecisely, the distribution shows a multimodal character when the initial\npoints are near the basin boundary, and unimodal at locations far from the\nborder. The distribution is also anisotropic in the sense that the number of\nmodes depends on the direction from the basin location. We define two new\nmetrics, viz., homogeneity index and local isotropic index to characterize the\ndistinctive features of the distribution.

Existing studies of machine unlearning mainly\nfocus on sample-wise unlearning, such that a learnt model will not expose\nuser's privacy at the sample level. Yet we argue that such ability of selective\nremoval should also be presented at the attribute level, especially for the\nattributes irrelevant to the main task, e.g., whether a person recognized in a\nface recognition system wears glasses or the age range of that person. Through\na comprehensive literature review, it is found that existing studies on\nattribute-related problems like fairness and de-biasing learning cannot address\nthe above concerns properly. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm of\nselectively removing input attributes from feature representations which we\nname `attribute unlearning'. In this paradigm, certain attributes will be\naccurately captured and detached from the learned feature representations at\nthe stage of training, according to their mutual information. The particular\nattributes will be progressively eliminated along with the training procedure\ntowards convergence, while the rest of attributes related to the main task are\npreserved for achieving competitive model performance. Considering the\ncomputational complexity during the training process, we not only give a\ntheoretically approximate training method, but also propose an acceleration\nscheme to speed up the training process. We validate our method by spanning\nseveral datasets and models and demonstrate that our design can preserve model\nfidelity and reach prevailing unlearning efficacy with high efficiency. The\nproposed unlearning paradigm builds a foundation for future machine unlearning\nsystem and will become an essential component of the latest privacy-related\nlegislation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 05:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 15:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

However, it is necessary for treatment to be coupled with real time\ntemperature monitoring in order to deliver sufficient thermal dosage to the\ntarget while sparing surrounding, healthy tissues.

Rather than having users report\ntheir location to a central operator, we present a protocol in which users\nparticipate in a decentralized and privacy-preserving computation to estimate\ntravel times for the roads in the network in a way that no individuals'\nlocation is ever observed by any other party.

This paper studies the interplay between (i) the\nunfairness of active users, (ii) the unfairness of popular items, and (iii) the\naccuracy (personalization) of recommendation as three angles of our study\ntriangle. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged levels to measure\nuser fairness based on their activity level. For item fairness, we divide items\ninto short-head, mid-tail, and long-tail groups and study the exposure of these\nitem groups into the top-k recommendation list of users. Experimental\nvalidation of eight different recommendation models commonly used for POI\nrecommendation (e.g., contextual, CF) on two publicly available POI\nrecommendation datasets, Gowalla and Yelp, indicate that most well-performing\nmodels suffer seriously from the unfairness of popularity bias (provider\nunfairness). Furthermore, our study shows that most recommendation models\ncannot satisfy both consumer and producer fairness, indicating a trade-off\nbetween these variables possibly due to natural biases in data. We choose the\nPOI recommendation as our test scenario; however, the insights should be\ntrivially extendable on other domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 08:02:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 09:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The approach is analysed\nfor different scenarios, based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak and\ndemographic data from Ukraine. From these results we extract network topology\nfeatures that need to be considered to effectively decrease the peak number of\ninfections. The CTMC simulation is implemented in python and integrated in a\ndashboard that can be used for interactive exploration and it is made openly\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 09:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Despite the problem has been widely studied, existing methods\nare prone to topological errors. In medical imaging, the topology of the\nstructure, such as the kidney or lung, is usually known. Preserving the\ntopology of the structure in the segmentation process is of utmost importance\nfor accurate image analysis. In this work, a novel learning-based segmentation\nmodel is proposed. A {\\it topology-preserving segmentation network (TPSN)} is\ntrained to give an accurate segmentation result of an input image that\npreserves the prescribed topology. TPSN is a deformation-based model that\nyields a deformation map through a UNet, which takes the medical image and a\ntemplate mask as inputs. The main idea is to deform a template mask describing\nthe prescribed topology by a diffeomorphism to segment the object in the image.\nThe topology of the shape in the template mask is well preserved under the\ndiffeomorphic map. The diffeomorphic property of the map is controlled by\nintroducing a regularization term related to the Jacobian in the loss function.\nAs such, a topology-preserving segmentation result can be guaranteed.\nFurthermore, a multi-scale TPSN is developed in this paper that incorporates\nmulti-level information of images to produce more precise segmentation results.\nTo evaluate our method, we applied the 2D TPSN on Ham10000 and 3D TPSN on\nKiTS21.

We\ndiscover that depending upon the time period and duty cycle of the ON-OFF\nintervals, the aging region shrinks drastically in the parameter space,\ntherefore promoting restoration of oscillatory dynamics from the aging. In the\ncase of symmetric discrete coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are equal), the\naging zone decreases significantly with the resumption of dynamism with an\nincreasing time period of the ON-OFF intervals. On the other hand, in the case\nof asymmetric coupling (where the ON-OFF intervals are not equal), we find that\nthe ratio of the ON and OFF intervals controls the aging dynamics: the aging\nstate is revoked more effectively if the interval of the OFF state is greater\nthan the ON state.

First, to address severe NRD, a\nnovel structural descriptor named the Steerable Filters of first- and\nsecond-Order Channels (SFOC) is constructed, which combines the first- and\nsecond-order gradient information by using the steerable filters with a\nmulti-scale strategy to depict more discriminative structure features of\nimages. Then, a fast similarity measure is established called Fast Normalized\nCross-Correlation (Fast-NCCSFOC), which employs the Fast Fourier Transform\ntechnique and the integral image to improve the matching efficiency.\nFurthermore, to achieve reliable registration performance, a coarse-to-fine\nmultimodal registration system is designed consisting of two pivotal modules.\nThe local coarse registration is first conducted by involving both detection of\ninterest points (IPs) and local geometric correction, which effectively\nutilizes the prior georeferencing information of RS images to address global\ngeometric distortions. In the fine registration stage, the proposed SFOC is\nused to resist significant NRD, and to detect control points between multimodal\nimages by a template matching scheme. The performance of the proposed matching\nmethod has been evaluated with many different kinds of multimodal RS images.\nThe results show its superior matching performance compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Rather, this phenomenon occurs before the transition to QT takes\nplace, namely in the area of the quasi-classical (here better quasi-quantum)\ntheory. This borderland between classical physics and QT can be reached within\nthe framework of our reconstruction by the replacement $p \\rightarrow M (q,\nt)$, where $p$ is the momentum variable of the particle and $M(q, t)$ is the\nmomentum field in configuration space. The occurrence of spin, and its special\nvalue $1/2$ , is a consequence of the fact that $M(q,t)$ must have exactly\nthree independent components $M_{k}(q,t)$ for a single particle because of the\nthree-dimensionality of space. In the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a \"particle\nwith spin zero\", the momentum field is usually represented as a gradient of a\nsingle function $S$. This implies dependencies between the components\n$M_{k}(q,t)$ for which no explanation exists. In reality, $M(q,t)$ needs to be\nrepresented by three functions, two of which are rotational degrees of freedom.\nThe latter are responsible for the existence of spin. All massive structureless\nparticles in nature must therefore be spin-one-half particles, simply because\nthey have to be described by $4$ real fields, one of which has the physical\nmeaning of a probability density, while the other three are required to\nrepresent the momentum field in three-dimensional space. We derive the\nPauli-Schr\\\"odinger equation, the correct value $g=2$ of the gyromagnetic\nratio, the classical limit of the Pauli-Schr\\\"odinger equation, and clarify\nsome other open questions in the borderland between classical physics and QT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 13:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

We recover events previously found\nby other authors in sectors 5 and 6 and find five new distinct aperiodic\ndipping events with asymmetric shapes resembling the expected profiles due to\nthe passage of a comet-like body across the star disk.

Their low temperatures ($<$10 K) allow the formation of thick\nicy dust mantles, which will be partially preserved in the future\nprotoplanetary disks, ultimately affecting the chemical composition of\nplanetary systems. Previous observations have shown that carbon- and\noxygen-bearing species, in particular CO, are heavily depleted in pre-stellar\ncores due to the efficient molecular freeze-out onto the surface of cold dust\ngrains. However, N-bearing species such as NH$_3$ and, in particular, its\ndeuterated isotopologues, appear to maintain high abundances where CO molecules\nare mainly in solid phase.

Resampling from\nthe received GMM contributes to a global map, which is used as the foundation\nfor consensus. Second, to improve flight safety, an active sensing system is\ndesigned to plan the observation angle of each UAV considering the unknown\nfield, overlap of the field of view (FOV), velocity direction and smoothness of\nyaw rotation, and this planning problem is solved by the distributed particle\nswarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm.

As an\nimportant component of MaaS, short-term passenger flow prediction for\nmulti-traffic modes has thus been brought into focus. It is a challenging\nproblem because the spatiotemporal features of multi-traffic modes are\ncritically complex. Moreover, the passenger flows of multi-traffic modes\ndifferentiate and fluctuate significantly. To solve these problems, this paper\nproposes a multitask learning-based model, called Res-Transformer, for\nshort-term inflow prediction of multi-traffic modes (subway, taxi, and bus).\nEach traffic mode is treated as a single task in the model. The Res-Transformer\nconsists of two parts: (1) several modified Transformer layers comprising the\nconv-Transformer layer and the multi-head attention mechanism, which helps to\nextract the spatial and temporal features of multi-traffic modes, (2) the\nstructure of residual network is utilized to obtain the correlations of\ndifferent traffic modes and prevent gradient vanishing, gradient explosion, and\noverfitting. The Res-Transformer model is evaluated on two large-scale\nreal-world datasets from Beijing, China. One is the region of a traffic hub and\nthe other is the region of a residential area. Experiments are conducted to\ncompare the performance of the proposed model with several baseline models.\nResults prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. This\npaper can give critical insights into the short-term inflow prediction for\nmulti-traffic modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 01:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 01:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

By focusing on a simple three-node motif, we predict that network\n\"redundancy\", in the form of a redundant vessel connecting two main\nflow-branches, together with differences in haemodynamic resistance in the\nbranches, can promote the emergence of oscillatory dynamics. We use existing\nmathematical descriptions for blood rheology and haematocrit splitting at\nvessel branch-points to construct our flow model; we combine numerical\nsimulations and stability analysis to study the dynamics of the three-node\nnetwork and its relation to the system's multiple steady-state solutions.\nWhile, for the case of equal inlet-pressure conditions, a \"trivial\" equilibrium\nsolution with no flow in the redundant vessel always exists, we find that it is\nnot stable when other, stable, steady-state attractors exist. In turn, these\n\"nontrivial\" steady-state solutions may undergo a Hopf bifurcation into an\noscillatory state. We use the branch diameter ratio, together with the inlet\nhaematocrit rate, to construct a two-parameter stability diagram that\ndelineates regimes in which such oscillatory dynamics exist. We show that flow\noscillations in this network geometry are only possible when the branch\ndiameters are sufficiently different to allow for a sufficiently large flow in\nthe redundant vessel, which acts as the driving force of the oscillations.\nThese microstructural properties, which were found to promote oscillatory\ndynamics, could be used to explore sources of flow instability in biological\nmicrovascular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2022 22:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

Next, I\ndiscuss how these and other cosmological observations can be well explained by\nmeans of the concordance model of cosmology, putting a particular emphasis on\nthe composition of the cosmic energy budget in terms of visible matter, dark\nmatter, and dark energy. This sets the stage for a short overview of the\nhistory of the Universe from the earliest moments of its existence all the way\nto the accelerated expansion at late times and beyond. Finally, I summarize the\ncurrent status of the field, including the challenges it is currently facing\nsuch as the Hubble tension, and conclude with an outlook onto the bright future\nthat awaits us in the coming years and decades.

Aerodynamic drag, particle inertia and\ndielectrophoretic (DEP) force due to externally applied electrostatic forces\ninfluence the behavior of micron sized particles significantly, in such\nsituations. In this work, we numerically study how a combination of these\nforces uniquely influences the behavior of uncharged or mildly charged airborne\nparticles, distinct from that with their individual influences. Uncharged\nparticle movements in a numerically fabricated well structured steady vortical\nflow between two curved electrode surfaces are analyzed. Vortical air\ncirculation towards and away from the electrode tip enhances and deteriorates\nelectrostatic particulate capture on the electrodes, termed as co and counter\ndirections with respect to the electrostatic force on particles respectively.\nParticles in counter vortices under an electric field reveals a rich variety of\nunique behaviors due to the interplay of drag, inertia and DEP forces.\nDistortion of the vortex structure due to convexity of electrode surfaces\nresults in an inverse inertial limit cycle trajectory trapping of particles;\nwith the airborne particles spatially segregated, trapping larger particles\nfurther inside the vortex than the smaller particles.Value of a dimensionless\nnumber $\\xi_v$, the ratio of DEP force and particle inertia, represents the\ncombination of the operating flow and electric field strengths. Inertial\ncut-off of particle capture in this configuration abruptly shift to DEP capture\nat a critical value of $\\xi_v\\approx 0.2$, as its value increases. Selective\ndeposition of particles within a closed range of size and density, emerges due\nto the interplay of vortex trapping, inertial expulsion and electrostatic\ncapture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 11:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}
