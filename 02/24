A central solution concept in fair\nallocation is competitive equilibrium: every individual is endowed with a\nbudget of faux currency, and the resulting competitive equilibrium is used to\nallocate. For the online fair allocation context, the PACE algorithm of Gao et\nal. [2021] leverages the dual averaging algorithm to approximate competitive\nequilibria. The authors show that, when items arrive i.i.d, the algorithm\nasymptotically achieves the fairness and efficiency guarantees of the offline\ncompetitive equilibrium allocation. However, real-world data is typically not\nstationary. One could instead model the data as adversarial, but this is often\ntoo pessimistic in practice. Motivated by this consideration, we study an\nonline fair allocation setting with nonstationary item arrivals. To address\nthis setting, we first develop new online learning results for the dual\naveraging algorithm under nonstationary input models. We show that the dual\naveraging iterates converge in mean square to both the underlying optimal\nsolution of the \"true\" stochastic optimization problem as well as the\n\"hindsight\" optimal solution of the finite-sum problem given by the sample\npath. Our results apply to several nonstationary input models: adversarial\ncorruption, ergodic input, and block-independent (including periodic) input.\nHere, the bound on the mean square error depends on a nonstationarity measure\nof the input. We recover the classical bound when the input data is i.i.d.

We then describe how marginal causal estimands in a target\npopulation can be identified under the assumption of transportability of\nrelative effect measures, when we are interested in the effectiveness of a new\nexperimental treatment in a target population where the only treatment in use\nis the control treatment evaluated in the trial. We extend these results to\nconsider cases where the control treatment evaluated in the trial is only one\nof the treatments in use in the target population, under an additional partial\nexchangeability assumption in the target population (i.e., a partial assumption\nof no unmeasured confounding in the target population). We also develop\nidentification results that allow for the covariates needed for\ntransportability of relative effect measures to be only a small subset of the\ncovariates needed to control confounding in the target population. Last, we\npropose estimators that can be easily implemented in standard statistical\nsoftware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 16:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

It is also proposed that the reservoirs in sedimentary strata\ncontain large amounts of high-pressure fluids, whose pressures can be released\nunder certain conditions; this release of pressure may be an important\ncomponent of the main earthquake energy. When a natural fault ruptures and\npenetrates a reservoir with a large area, the elastic energy produced by the\nrelease of pressure can reach the energy released by an earthquake of magnitude\n8.0. Artificial engineering activities can lead to small-scale fluid pressure\nrelease phenomena, such as blowouts during drilling and earthquakes induced by\nhydraulic fracturing. Much direct and indirect evidence, such as the\ncharacteristics of seismic waves in the time and frequency domains recorded\nduring the Wenchuan earthquake, explosion phenomena observed on the ground and\ncores obtained by scientific drilling, indicates the possibility of such energy\nrelease. We propose that seismicity can be divided into three stages: the\nmicrofracturing stage, in which there is fluid activity and can produce an\nelectrokinetic effect; the significant fracturing stage after the initial\nmovement; and the strong earthquake stage caused by fluid pressure release.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

Even though there are\nvalid reasons to assume a torsionless manifold that preserves the metric, it\nwas shown that dealing away with these assumptions the Levi-Civita condition\ncan be reproduced at the level of equations of motion of GR. It was not long\nbefore the equivalence of General Relativity between the two descriptions,\nknown as the Palatini or first-order formalism in which the connection is\nindependent of the metric, and the conventional metric or second-order\nformalism, was broken for more complicated actions involving higher-order\ncurvature invariants and/or nonminimal couplings between the gravitational and\nmatter sector. Nowadays these types of theories are prominent in modeling\ninflation where they have found major success. Since the paradigm of inflation\nis fused with the gravitational degrees of freedom and thus their\nparametrisation, it is interesting to understand how the predictions of these\nmodels differ between the two formulations. One of the outstanding models of\ninflation is the Starobinsky or quadratic gravity model. However in the\nPalatini formalism the scalar degree of freedom sourced by the $R^2$ term is\nnondynamical and is unable to drive an inflationary phase. In order for\ninflation to be realised in the first-order formalism the Starobinsky model has\nto be coupled with a fundamental scalar field that will assume the role of the\ninflaton. In this thesis we investigate different inflationary scenarios,\nstarting with previously ruled-out models, where we find that the $R^2$ term\nhas a significant role in flattening the Einstein-frame inflaton potential and\nthus giving the opportunity for these models to come in contact with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

The key question is how the\nstrength of the electron pairs changes near the QCP, and this can be verified\nby high-field experiments. However, such studies are limited mainly to\nsuperconductors with magnetic QCPs, and the possibility of unconventional\nmechanisms by which nonmagnetic QCP promotes strong pairing remains a\nnontrivial issue.

This is primarily due to the degeneracies which arise when optimizing\nover filters that maintain internal state.\n  In this paper, we provide a new perspective on this challenging problem based\non the notion of $\\textit{informativity}$, which intuitively requires that all\ncomponents of a filter's internal state are representative of the true state of\nthe underlying dynamical system. We show that informativity overcomes the\naforementioned degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a $\\textit{regularizer}$\nwhich explicitly enforces informativity, and establish that gradient descent on\nthis regularized objective - combined with a ``reconditioning step'' -\nconverges to the globally optimal cost a $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ rate. Our analysis\nrelies on several new results which may be of independent interest, including a\nnew framework for analyzing non-convex gradient descent via convex\nreformulation, and novel bounds on the solution to linear Lyapunov equations in\nterms of (our quantitative measure of) informativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 18:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 20:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

For example, binary classification of lung nodules resulted\nin an AUC of < 0.65 when there were no other co-occurring diseases, but when\nlung nodules co-occurred with emphysema, the performance reached AUC > 0.80. We\nhope this paper revealed the complexity of interpreting disease classification\nperformance in weakly supervised models and will encourage researchers to\nexamine the effect of co-occurring diseases on classification performance in\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 18:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

The planets subsequently migrate together as a resonant pair. In the\ncontext of circumbinary planets, the disc is truncated internally by the\nbinary. If there were only a single planet, then this inner disc edge would\nprovide a natural parking location. However, for two planets migrating together\nin resonance there will be a tension between the inner planet stopping at the\ndisc edge, and the outer planet continuing to be torqued inwards. In this paper\nwe study this effect, showing that the outcome is a function of the\nplanet-planet mass ratio. Smaller outer planets tend to be parked in a stable\nexterior 2:1 or 3:2 resonance with the inner planet, which itself remains near\nthe disc edge. Equal or larger mass outer planets tend to push the inner planet\npast the disc edge and too close to the binary, causing it to be ejected or\nsometimes flipped to an exterior orbit. Our simulations show that this process\nmay explain an observed dearth of small (< 3 Earth radii) circumbinary planets,\nsince small planets are frequently ejected or left on long-period orbits, for\nwhich transit detection is less likely.

However, given the faintness of distant galaxies in the optical and the NIR,\ndatasets are still limited and how the dust affects the emerging radiation of\ngalaxies at very high redshift is not yet fully understood. Using the ALPINE\nsurvey, our objective is to quantify the dust attenuation properties in\ngalaxies at z=4.4-5.5, and in particular the shape of their attenuation curve.\nUsing the CIGALE code, we model the stellar populations and their interaction\nwith the dust in order to measure some of the physical properties of a\nsubsample of 23 main-sequence ALPINE galaxies. We find that the attenuation\ncurves span a broad range of properties, from curves that are much steeper than\nthe SMC extinction curve, to shallower than the starburst attenuation curve.\nThe shape of the attenuation curves strongly depends on the V-band attenuation.\nGalaxies with the lowest attenuation also present the steepest curves. The\nsteepness of such curves is probably the consequence of the combination of the\nintrinsic physical properties of the dust, the relative distribution of stars\nand dust in the interstellar medium, and the differential reddening. The broad\nrange of attenuation curves found at z~5 shows that no single attenuation curve\nis appropriate for main sequence galaxies and that assuming a fixed curve can\nlead to large errors, for instance in the interpretation and use of the\nIRX-beta diagram, if SED modeling is not feasible. Great caution should be\nexercised when correcting high redshift galaxies for the presence of dust using\nthe UV slope beta as it can affect the estimation of both SFR and stellar mass\neven at low V-band attenuation due to the steepness of the attenuation curve.\nHowever, when SED modeling can be used, the impact of the choice of the\nattenuation curve on the SFR and the stellar mass is limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

These\nstructures are dominated by stars younger than a few hundred Myr and\ncollectively are about twice as extended as the old stellar component. These\nproperties are very unusual for dwarf galaxies in the nearby Universe and\ndifficult to explain by hydro-dynamical simulations. From the analysis of\narchival 21-cm observations, we find that the young stellar \"bar\" coincides\nwith an HI high-density region proposed by previous studies to be a purely\ngaseous bar; we furthermore confirm radial motions of a few km/s, compatible\nwith an inflow/outflow, and derive a steeply-rising rotation curve and high HI\nsurface density at the center, indicating a very concentrated mass\ndistribution. We propose that the peculiar properties of the stellar and\ngaseous components of NGC 3741 may be explained by a recent merger or ongoing\ngas accretion from the intergalactic medium, which caused gas inflows towards\nthe galaxy center and triggered star formation a few hundred Myr ago.

Some of Nature's symmetries are clearly\nvisible in morphology and physical structure, whereas others are hidden in the\nnetwork of interactions among system components. Just as visible symmetries and\nasymmetries contribute to the system's beauty, might hidden symmetries\ncontribute to the system's functional harmony? And if so, how? Here we\ndemonstrate that the interaction networks of biological systems from cell\nsignaling to cancer display a form of dynamical reflection symmetry that serves\nto expand their dynamical complexity. The expansion proceeds according to\nprecise rules regarding the lengths of dynamical cycles, made possible by a\npeculiar imbalance between excitation and inhibition. To probe the conditions\nunder which this reflection symmetry evolves, we use a multi-objective genetic\nalgorithm to produce networks with long dynamical cycles. We find that local\nstructural motifs that break the reflection symmetry are deleted in the\nevolutionary process, providing evidence for symmetry's causal role in\ndynamical complexity. Finally, we identify symmetries in real continuous-valued\nscRNA-seq data of gene expression in drug-resistant cancer cells.

We observe linear geometry for short-range interactions, treelike\ngeometry on a sparse coupling graph for long-range interactions, and an\nintermediate fast scrambling regime at the crossover point between the linear\nand treelike geometries. This transition in geometry is revealed in\ncalculations of the subsystem entanglement entropy and tripartite mutual\ninformation. We also study emergent lightcones that govern these effective\ngeometries by teleporting a single qubit of information from an input qubit to\nan output qubit. These tools help to analyze distinct geometries arising in\ndynamics and correlation spreading in quantum many-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 19:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 18:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

The distribution $S(X,t)$ of the displacements $X$ from the origin of\nthe walkers is computed at different times.

They are widely used in technology and fundamental\nresearch, in telecommunications, lasers and nonlinear optics, ultra-sensitive\nmeasurements in cavity optomechanics, and the study of light-matter\ninteractions in the context of cavity QED. The physics underlying their\noperation is determined by the constructive interference of electromagnetic\nwaves at specific frequencies, giving rise to the resonance spectrum. This\nmechanism causes the limitations and trade-offs of resonator design, such as\nthe difficulty of confining waves larger than the resonator and the fixed\nrelationship between free spectral range, modal linewidth, and the resonator's\nrefractive index and size. Here, we introduce a new class of optical\nresonators, generating resonances by designing the optical path through\ntransverse mode coupling in a cascaded process created by mode-converting\nmirrors. The generalized round-trip phase condition leads to resonator\ncharacteristics that are markedly different from Fabry-Perot resonators and can\nbe tailored over a wide range, such as the largest resonant wavelength, the\nfree spectral range, the linewidth, and the quality factor. We confirm the\nexistence of these modes experimentally in an integrated waveguide cavity with\nmode converters coupling two transverse modes into one supermode. The resonance\nsignature of the cascaded-mode resonator is a spectrum resulting from the\ncoherent superposition of the coupled transverse modes. We also demonstrate a\ntransverse mode-independent transmission through the resonator and show that\nits engineered spectral properties agree with theoretical predictions.\nCascaded-mode resonators introduce properties not found in traditional\nresonators and provide a mechanism to overcome the existing trade-offs in the\ndesign of resonators in various application areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 20:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

We suggest the problem runs deeper, transcending the specific\nincentives of any particular platform, and instead stems from a mistaken\nrevealed-preference assumption: To understand what users want, platforms look\nat what users do. Yet research has demonstrated, and personal experience\naffirms, that we often make choices in the moment that are inconsistent with\nwhat we actually want. In this work, we develop a model of media consumption\nwhere users have inconsistent preferences.

A key ingredient in our model is a\nformulation for how platforms determine what to show users: they optimize over\na large set of potential content (the content manifold) parametrized by\nunderlying features of the content. Whether improving engagement improves user\nwelfare depends on the direction of movement in the content manifold: for\ncertain directions of change, increasing engagement makes users less happy,\nwhile in other directions, increasing engagement makes users happier. We\ncharacterize the structure of content manifolds for which increasing engagement\nfails to increase user utility.

To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent\nmid-range link that moves the electrons between qubit registers has been\nsuggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here, we present a blueprint of\nsuch a $\\approx 10\\,\\mu$m long link, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is\nbased on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. To control\nthese sets, only a few voltage control lines are needed and the number of these\nsets and thus the number of required control signals is independent of the\nlength of this link. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin\nqubit shuttle: A qubit conveyor, i.e. a potential minimum that smoothly moves\nlaterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a\nseries of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former\napproach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device including\npotential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO$_2$ layer, as well as\ntypical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity in the conveyor\nshuttling mode, we discuss in detail motional narrowing, the interplay between\norbital and valley excitation and relaxation in presence of $g$-factors that\ndepend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from\nspin-hotspots. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9 \\% is feasible in\nSi/SiGe at a speed of $\\sim$10 m/s, if the average valley splitting and its\ninhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic\nfield $\\approx 20$ mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting is\nfavourable for reaching high fidelities of transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 21:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 12:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

However, it also raises privacy risks as speech contains\na wealth of personal data. Speaker anonymization aims to remove speaker\ninformation from a speech utterance while leaving its linguistic and prosodic\nattributes intact. State-of-the-art techniques operate by disentangling the\nspeaker information (represented via a speaker embedding) from these attributes\nand re-synthesizing speech based on the speaker embedding of another speaker.\nPrior research in the privacy community has shown that anonymization often\nprovides brittle privacy protection, even less so any provable guarantee. In\nthis work, we show that disentanglement is indeed not perfect: linguistic and\nprosodic attributes still contain speaker information. We remove speaker\ninformation from these attributes by introducing differentially private feature\nextractors based on an autoencoder and an automatic speech recognizer,\nrespectively, trained using noise layers. We plug these extractors in the\nstate-of-the-art anonymization pipeline and generate, for the first time,\nprivate speech utterances with a provable upper bound on the speaker\ninformation they contain. We evaluate empirically the privacy and utility\nresulting from our differentially private speaker anonymization approach on the\nLibriSpeech data set.

Existing techniques to do so are\nbased on the flow of training data influence through the model parameters. For\nlarge models in NLP applications, it is often computationally infeasible to\nstudy this flow through all model parameters, therefore techniques usually pick\nthe last layer of weights. However, we observe that since the activation\nconnected to the last layer of weights contains \"shared logic\", the data\ninfluenced calculated via the last layer weights prone to a ``cancellation\neffect'', where the data influence of different examples have large magnitude\nthat contradicts each other. The cancellation effect lowers the discriminative\npower of the influence score, and deleting influential examples according to\nthis measure often does not change the model's behavior by much. To mitigate\nthis, we propose a technique called TracIn-WE that modifies a method called\nTracIn to operate on the word embedding layer instead of the last layer, where\nthe cancellation effect is less severe. One potential concern is that influence\nbased on the word embedding layer may not encode sufficient high level\ninformation. However, we find that gradients (unlike embeddings) do not suffer\nfrom this, possibly because they chain through higher layers. We show that\nTracIn-WE significantly outperforms other data influence methods applied on the\nlast layer significantly on the case deletion evaluation on three language\nclassification tasks for different models. In addition, TracIn-WE can produce\nscores not just at the level of the overall training input, but also at the\nlevel of words within the training input, a further aid in debugging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 09:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 16:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

However, for most users, image editing tools are not easy\nto use since the tools require certain expertise in photo effects and have\ncomplex interfaces. Hence, users might need someone to help edit their images,\nbut having a personal dedicated human assistant for every user is impossible to\nscale. For that reason, an automated assistant system for image editing is\ndesirable. Additionally, users want more image sources for diverse image\nediting works, and integrating an image search functionality into the editing\ntool is a potential remedy for this demand. Thus, we propose a dataset of an\nautomated Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing (CAISE). To our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset that provides conversational image search\nand editing annotations, where the agent holds a grounded conversation with\nusers and helps them to search and edit images according to their requests. To\nbuild such a system, we first collect image search and editing conversations\nbetween pairs of annotators. The assistant-annotators are equipped with a\ncustomized image search and editing tool to address the requests from the\nuser-annotators. The functions that the assistant-annotators conduct with the\ntool are recorded as executable commands, allowing the trained system to be\nuseful for real-world application execution. We also introduce a\ngenerator-extractor baseline model for this task, which can adaptively select\nthe source of the next token (i.e., from the vocabulary or from textual/visual\ncontexts) for the executable command.

The secondary question, although perhaps now less fervently\ndebated, is the authenticity of the 'Double Heroides', placed by those who\naccept them as letters 16-21. I employ a variety of methods drawn from the\ndomain of computational stylometry to consider the poetics and the\nlexico-grammatical features of these elegiac poems in the broader context of a\ncorpus of 'shorter' (from 20 to 546 lines) elegiac works from five authors (266\npoems in all) comprising more or less all of the non-fragmentary classical\ncorpus.

Furthermore, by comparing the style of the letters with the 'early'\n(although there are complications in this label) works of the Amores and the\nlate works of the Ex Ponto, the evidence supports sequential composition --\nmeaning that the ES is correctly placed -- and, further, supports the growing\nconsensus that the double letters were composed significantly later, in exile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 02:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

These new parameters can be particularly useful to represent\nnon-Maxwellian distributions. The procedure is based on the fit of the I-V\nLangmuir curve with the $q$-Weibull distribution function, and is motivated by\nrecent works which use the $q$-exponential distribution function derived from\nTsallis statistics. We obtain the usual plasma parameters employing three\ntechniques: the numerical differentiation using Savitzky Golay (SG) filters,\nthe $q$-exponential distribution function, and the $q$-Weibull distribution\nfunction. We explain the limitations of the $q$-exponential function, where the\nexperimental data $V>V_p$ needs to be trimmed beforehand, and this results in a\nlower accuracy compared to the numerical differentiation with SG. To overcome\nthis difficulty, the $q$-Weibull function is introduced as a natural\ngeneralization to the $q$-exponential distribution, and it has greater\nflexibility in order to represent the concavity change around $V_p$. We apply\nthis procedure to analyze the measurements corresponding to a nitrogen $N_2$\ncold plasma obtained by using a single Langmuir probe located at different\nheights from the cathode. We show that the $q$ parameter has a very stable\nnumerical value with the height.

In this paper, we aim to forecast\nkey performance indicators for new campaigns given any certain criteria.\nInterpretable and accurate results could enable advertisers to manage and\noptimize their campaign criteria. There are several challenges for this very\ntask. First, platforms usually offer advertisers various criteria when they\nplan an advertising campaign, it is difficult to estimate campaign performance\nunifiedly because of the great difference among bidding types. Furthermore,\ncomplex strategies applied in bidding system bring great fluctuation on\ncampaign performance, making estimation accuracy an extremely tough problem. To\naddress above challenges, we propose a novel Campaign Performance Forecasting\nframework, which firstly reproduces campaign performance on historical logs\nunder various bidding types with a unified replay algorithm, in which essential\nauction processes like match and rank are replayed, ensuring the\ninterpretability on forecast results. Then, we innovatively introduce a\nmulti-task learning method to calibrate the deviation of estimation brought by\nhard-to-reproduce bidding strategies in replay. The method captures mixture\ncalibration patterns among related forecast indicators to map the estimated\nresults to the true ones, improving both accuracy and efficiency significantly.\nExperiment results on a dataset from Taobao.com demonstrate that the proposed\nframework significantly outperforms other baselines by a large margin, and an\nonline A/B test verifies its effectiveness in the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 03:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

From an evolutionary perspective, faces are\nintended to be remembered, mainly due to survival and personal relevance.\nHowever, all these faces do not have the equal opportunity to stick in our\nminds. It has been shown that memorability is an intrinsic feature of an image\nbut yet, it is largely unknown what attributes make an image more memorable. In\nthis work, we aimed to address this question by proposing a fast approach to\nmodify and control the memorability of face images. In our proposed method, we\nfirst found a hyperplane in the latent space of StyleGAN to separate high and\nlow memorable images. We then modified the image memorability (while\nmaintaining the identity and other facial features such as age, emotion, etc.)\nby moving in the positive or negative direction of this hyperplane normal\nvector. We further analyzed how different layers of the StyleGAN augmented\nlatent space contribute to face memorability. These analyses showed how each\nindividual face attribute makes an image more or less memorable. Most\nimportantly, we evaluated our proposed method for both real and synthesized\nface images. The proposed method successfully modifies and controls the\nmemorability of real human faces as well as unreal synthesized faces. Our\nproposed method can be employed in photograph editing applications for social\nmedia, learning aids, or advertisement purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 04:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

The motivation comes from two pain spots: 1) the lack of efficient and\nprincipled methods for designing and scaling ViTs; 2) the tremendous\ncomputational cost of training ViT that is much heavier than its convolution\ncounterpart. To tackle these issues, we propose As-ViT, an auto-scaling\nframework for ViTs without training, which automatically discovers and scales\nup ViTs in an efficient and principled manner. Specifically, we first design a\n\"seed\" ViT topology by leveraging a training-free search process. This\nextremely fast search is fulfilled by a comprehensive study of ViT's network\ncomplexity, yielding a strong Kendall-tau correlation with ground-truth\naccuracies. Second, starting from the \"seed\" topology, we automate the scaling\nrule for ViTs by growing widths/depths to different ViT layers. This results in\na series of architectures with different numbers of parameters in a single run.\nFinally, based on the observation that ViTs can tolerate coarse tokenization in\nearly training stages, we propose a progressive tokenization strategy to train\nViTs faster and cheaper. As a unified framework, As-ViT achieves strong\nperformance on classification (83.5% top1 on ImageNet-1k) and detection (52.7%\nmAP on COCO) without any manual crafting nor scaling of ViT architectures: the\nend-to-end model design and scaling process cost only 12 hours on one V100 GPU.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/AsViT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Feb 2022 21:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

Assuming recurrent\nsymmetric mutation and payoffs with expected values, variances, and covariances\nof the same small order, we derive a first-order approximation of the average\nabundance of cooperation in the selection-mutation equilibrium. We show that\nincreasing the variance of any payoff for defection or decreasing the variance\nof any payoff for cooperation increases the average abundance of cooperation.\nAs for the effect of the covariance between any payoff for cooperation and any\npayoff for defection, we show that it depends on the number of cooperators in\nthe group associated with these payoffs.

We make the best-case assumption of one embryo and\none stellar encounter per disc.

Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to\nthe non-differentiability of its activation function, which disables the\ntypically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs). Although the adoption of surrogate gradient (SG) formally\nallows for the back-propagation of losses, the discrete spiking mechanism\nactually differentiates the loss landscape of SNNs from that of ANNs, failing\nthe surrogate gradient methods to achieve comparable accuracy as for ANNs. In\nthis paper, we first analyze why the current direct training approach with\nsurrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability. Then we\nintroduce the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the\nloss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process\ncan converge into flatter minima with better generalizability.

And a quick algorithm is proposed to infer\nthe optimal interval of switching factor \\{beta}. Finally, the weight of each\nattribute is calculated using the optimal value \\{beta} and is integrated into\nNB classifier to improve the accuracy. The experimental results on 50 benchmark\ndatasets and a Flavia dataset show that ATFNB outperforms the basic NB and\nstate-of-the-art filter weighted NB models. In addition, the ATFNB framework\ncan improve the existing two-index NB model by introducing the adaptive\nswitching factor \\{beta}. Auxiliary experimental results demonstrate the\nimproved model significantly increases the accuracy compared to the original\nmodel without the adaptive switching factor \\{beta}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 08:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

These statistics are applied to the dark matter and baryonic gas\ndensity fields of the \\texttt{TNG100-1} simulation at redshifts of\n$z=3.0$-$0.0$, and to \\texttt{Illustris-1} and \\texttt{SIMBA} at $z=0$.

A noteworthy feature is that at $z=0.0$, the gas is less biased in\ndenser environments of $\\Delta \\gtrsim 10$ around $3 \\ h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, due\nto the gas reaccretion caused by the decreased AGN feedback strength at lower\nredshifts.

However, the key\nevidence for ion cyclotron resonance (i.e., the coherence between\nelectromagnetic fields and the ion phase space density) and the resulting\ndamping of ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) has not yet been directly observed.\nInvestigating the high-quality measurements of space plasmas by the\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites, we find that both the wave\nelectromagnetic field vectors and the bulk velocity of the disturbed ion\nvelocity distribution rotate around the background magnetic field. Moreover, we\nfind that the absolute gyro-phase angle difference between the center of the\nfluctuations in the ion velocity distribution functions and the wave electric\nfield vectors falls in the range of (0, 90) degrees, consistent with the\nongoing energy conversion from wave-fields to particles. By invoking plasma\nkinetic theory, we demonstrate that the field-particle correlation for the\ndamping ion cyclotron waves in our theoretical model matches well with our\nobservations. Furthermore, the wave electric field vectors ($\\delta\n\\mathbf{E'}_{\\mathrm {wave,\\perp}}$), the ion current density ($\\delta\n\\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm {i,\\perp}$) and the energy transfer rate ($\\delta\n\\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm {i,\\perp}\\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{E'}_{\\mathrm {wave,\\perp}}$)\nexhibit quasi-periodic oscillations, and the integrated work done by the\nelectromagnetic field on the ions are positive, indicates that ions are mainly\nenergized by the perpendicular component of the electric field via cyclotron\nresonance.

In\ntemperature we find a $\\sim2\\,\\mathrm{\\mu K}$ quadrupole difference that most\nlikely is caused by different gain modeling, while in polarization we find a\ndistinct $2.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu K}$ signal that has been previously called\npoorly-measured modes by the $\\mathit{WMAP}$ team. In the Cosmoglobe\nprocessing, this pattern arises from temperature-to-polarization leakage from\nthe coupling between the CMB Solar dipole, transmission imbalance, and\nsidelobes. No traces of this pattern are found in either the frequency map or\nTOD residual map, suggesting that the current processing has succeeded in\nmodelling these poorly measured modes within the assumed parametric model by\nusing $\\mathit{Planck}$ information to break the sky-synchronous degeneracies\ninherent in the $\\mathit{WMAP}$ scanning strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 09:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

To achieve this goal, one of the most promising approaches\nconsists of using large segmented primary mirror telescopes with coronagraphic\ninstruments. However, coronagraphs are highly sensitive to wavefront errors.\nThe segmentation itself is responsible for phasing errors and segment\nvibrations to be controlled at a subnanometric accuracy. We propose an\ninnovative method for a coronagraph design that allows a consequent relaxation\nof the segment phasing constraints for low segment-count mirrors and generates\nan instrument that is more robust to segment-level wavefront errors. It is\nbased on an optimization of the coronagraph that includes a segment-level\napodization. This is repeated over the pupil to match the segmentation\nredundancy and improves the contrast stability beyond the minimum separation\nset by the single-segment diffraction limit. We validate this method on a\nGMT-like pupil for two coronagraph types: apodized pupil Lyot coronagraphs\n(APLC) and apodizing phase plate coronagraphs (APP). For the APLC, redundant\napodization enables releasing the piston phasing constraints by a factor of 5\nto 20 compared to classical designs. For the APP, the contrast remains almost\nconstant up to 1 radian RMS of the phasing errors. We also show that redundant\napodizations increase the robustness of the coronagraph to segment tip-tilt\nerrors, as well as to missing segments. This method cannot be applied to\nhigher-segment count mirrors such as the ELT or the TMT, but it is particularly\nsuitable for low segment-count mirrors (fewer than 20 segments) such as the GMT\naperture.

Most existing methods either generate all human-object\npair candidates and infer their relationships by cropped local features\nsuccessively in a two-stage manner, or directly predict interaction points in a\none-stage procedure. However, the lack of spatial configurations or reasoning\nsteps of two- or one- stage methods respectively limits their performance in\nsuch complex scenes. To avoid this ambiguity, we propose a novel actor-centric\nframework. The main ideas are that when inferring interactions: 1) the\nnon-local features of the entire image guided by actor position are obtained to\nmodel the relationship between the actor and context, and then 2) we use an\nobject branch to generate pixel-wise interaction area prediction, where the\ninteraction area denotes the object central area. Moreover, we also use an\nactor branch to get interaction prediction of the actor and propose a novel\ncomposition strategy based on center-point indexing to generate the final HOI\nprediction. Thanks to the usage of the non-local features and the\npartly-coupled property of the human-objects composition strategy, our proposed\nframework can detect HOI more accurately especially for complex images.\nExtensive experimental results show that our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art on the challenging V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and is more\nrobust especially in multiple persons and/or objects scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 10:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Factor based methods to bound clique sizes\nare more accurate than structure based methods, but expensive since they\ninvolve inference of beliefs in a large number of candidate structure or region\ngraphs. We propose an alternative approach for approximate inference based on\nan incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) paradigm, which converts the\nBayesian network into a data structure containing a sequence of linked clique\ntree forests (SLCTF), with clique sizes bounded by a user-specified value. In\nthe incremental build stage of this approach, CTFs are constructed\nincrementally by adding variables to the CTFs as long as clique sizes are\nwithin the specified bound. Once the clique size constraint is reached, the CTs\nin the CTF are calibrated in the infer stage of IBIA. The resulting clique\nbeliefs are used in the approximate phase to get an approximate CTF with\nreduced clique sizes. The approximate CTF forms the starting point for the next\nCTF in the sequence. These steps are repeated until all variables are added to\na CTF in the sequence. We prove that our algorithm for incremental construction\nof clique trees always generates a valid CT and our approximation technique\npreserves the joint beliefs of the variables within a clique. Based on this, we\nshow that the SLCTF data structure can be used for efficient approximate\ninference of partition function and prior and posterior marginals.

Unfortunately, sheafification seems not to\npreserve an important realignment property enjoyed by the presheaf universes\nthat plays a critical role in models of univalent type theory as well as\nsynthetic Tait computability, a recent technique to establish syntactic\nproperties of type theories and programming languages.

Hence one has direct-style interpretations of\nMartin-L\\\"of type theory with cumulative universes into all Grothendieck topoi.\nA further implication is to extend the reach of recent synthetic methods in the\nsemantics of cubical type theory and the syntactic metatheory of type theory\nand programming languages to all Grothendieck topoi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 10:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 14:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

We thus see growing\ninterest in explainable predictive business process monitoring, which aims to\nincrease the interpretability of prediction models. Existing solutions focus on\ngiving factual explanations.While factual explanations can be helpful, humans\ntypically do not ask why a particular prediction was made, but rather why it\nwas made instead of another prediction, i.e., humans are interested in\ncounterfactual explanations. While research in explainable AI produced several\npromising techniques to generate counterfactual explanations, directly applying\nthem to predictive process monitoring may deliver unrealistic explanations,\nbecause they ignore the underlying process constraints.

Because of the high variety of\nthe possible scenarios, using only observed scenarios for the assessment is not\nsufficient. Therefore, methods for generating additional scenarios are\nnecessary.\n  Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a method to determine the\nparameters that describe the scenarios to a sufficient degree without relying\non strong assumptions on the parameters that characterize the scenarios.

In this\npaper, we analyse the detection results of the four top (among seven) teams and\nthe segmentation results of the five top teams (among 16). Our analyses\ndemonstrate that the top-ranking teams concentrated on accuracy (i.e., accuracy\n> 80% on overall Dice score on different validation sets) over real-time\nperformance required for clinical applicability. We further dissect the methods\nand provide an experiment-based hypothesis that reveals the need for improved\ngeneralisability to tackle diversity present in multi-centre datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 11:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Experiments are usually designed, provisioned,\nmanaged, and analyzed by diverse teams of specialists (e.g., researchers,\ntechnicians and engineers) and may require many resources (e.g. cloud\ninfrastructure, specialized equipment). Even though researchers strive to\ndocument experiments accurately, this process is often lacking, making it hard\nto reproduce them. Moreover, when it is necessary to create a similar\nexperiment, very often we end up \"reinventing the wheel\" as it is easier to\nstart from scratch than trying to reuse existing work, thus losing valuable\nembedded best practices and previous experiences. In behavioral studies this\nhas contributed to the reproducibility crisis. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose the \"Experiments as Code\" paradigm, where the whole experiment is not\nonly documented but additionally the automation code to provision, deploy,\nmanage, and analyze it is provided. To this end we define the Experiments as\nCode concept, provide a taxonomy for the components of a practical\nimplementation, and provide a proof of concept with a simple desktop VR\nexperiment that showcases the benefits of its \"as code\" representation, i.e.,\nreproducibility, auditability, debuggability, reusability, and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Therefore,\nreliable detection for low-altitude UAVs is an important issue. The strong\nground clutter makes the radar echoes from small UAVs submerged in noise,\nresulting in low radar detection reliability. A low-altitude UAV detection\nmethod based on deep contrastive learning is proposed to address the above\nproblems: Concretely, a low-altitude UAV radar echo model under low-altitude\nclutter interference is first established. Based on the echo components and the\nUAV Doppler domain identifiable mechanism, a time-frequency transformation\nmethod combining ZAM transform and morphological operations is used to suppress\nthe ambiguity problem under clutter. Then feature extraction and fusion method\nintroducing contrast learning is utilized to suppress non-target ground clutter\ninterference. Finally, a detector relying on semantic features is designed for\nthe reliable identification of low-altitude UAVs. The experiments carried out\non both real and simulated data confirm that the proposed method can\neffectively suppress ground clutter and reliably extract recognizable semantic\nfeatures of UAVs. The proposed method achieves lower false and missing alarms\ncompared with recent state-of-art solutions and improves the detection accuracy\nby more than 5% for the same signal-to-noise ratio, which effectively improves\nthe detection reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Dynamical perturbation methods are the\nmost widely used approaches for quantum many-body systems. While study of\nentanglement-based numerical methods are booming recently, the traditional\ndynamical perturbation methods have not benefited from study of quantum\nentanglement. In this work, we formulate an algebraic-dynamical theory (ADT) by\ncombining the power of quantum algebras and dynamical methods in which quantum\nentanglement naturally emerges as the organizing principle. We start by\nintroducing a complete operator basis set (COBS), with which an arbitrary\nstate, either pure or mixed, can be represented by the expectation values of\nCOBS. Then we establish a complete mapping from a given state to a complete set\nof dynamical correlation functions of the state through the Heisenberg- and\nSchwinger-Dyson-equations-of-motion (SDEOM). The completeness of COBS and the\nmapping ensures ADT to be a mathematically complete framework in principle.\nApplying ADT to many-body systems on lattices, we find that the quantum\nentanglement is represented by the cumulant structure of expectation values of\nthe many-body COBS. The cumulant structure of the state forms a hierarchy in\ncorrelations. More importantly, such static correlational hierarchy is\ninherited by the dynamical correlations and their SDEOM. We propose that the\ndynamical hierarchy is also carried into any perturbative calculation on that\nstate. We demonstrate the validity of such perturbation hierarchy with an\nexplicit example, in which we show that a single-particle-type perturbative\ncalculation fails while a many-body perturbation following the hierarchy\nsucceeds.

Finally, the volume fraction dependence of the viscosity at\na fixed PAAc and at two different temperatures, below and above the volume\nphase transition, shows a quantitative agreement with the structural relaxation\ntime measured through dynamic light scattering indicating that IPN microgels\nsoftness can be tuned with PAAc and temperature and that, depending on particle\nsoftness, two different routes are followed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

However, digital keys are limited to binary values and\neasily exploitable when stored in standard memories. In this paper, based on\nemerging technologies, we introduce pHGen, a potential-of-hydrogen (pH)-based\nkey generation mechanism that leverages chemical reactions in the form of a\npotential change in ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). The\nthreshold voltage of ISFETs is manipulated corresponding to a known pH buffer\nsolution (key) in which the transistors are immersed. To read the chemical\ninformation effectively via ISFETs, we designed a readout circuit for stable\noperation and detection of voltage thresholds. To demonstrate the applicability\nof the proposed key generation, we utilize pHGen for logic locking -- a\nhardware integrity protection scheme. The proposed key-generation method breaks\nthe limits of binary values and provides the first steps toward the utilization\nof multi-valued voltage thresholds of ISFETs controlled by chemical\ninformation. The pHGen approach is expected to be a turning point for using\nmore sophisticated bio-based analog keys for securing next-generation\nelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

One way to automatically\novercome this is to capture and exploit this variation explicitly. Here, we\npropose an approach that improves on our previous work in this area and explain\nhow it potentially can improve clinical acceptance of (semi-)automatic\nsegmentation methods. In contrast to a standard neural network that produces\none segmentation, we propose to use a multi-pathUnet network that produces\nmultiple segmentation variants, presumably corresponding to the variations that\nreside in the dataset. Different paths of the network are trained on disjoint\ndata subsets. Because a priori it may be unclear what variations exist in the\ndata, the subsets should be automatically determined. This is achieved by\nsearching for the best data partitioning with an evolutionary optimization\nalgorithm. Because each network path can become more specialized when trained\non a more homogeneous data subset, better segmentation quality can be achieved.\nIn practical usage, various automatically produced segmentations can be\npresented to a medical expert, from which the preferred segmentation can be\nselected. In experiments with a real clinical dataset of CT scans with prostate\nsegmentations, our approach provides an improvement of several percentage\npoints in terms of Dice and surface Dice coefficients compared to when all\nnetwork paths are trained on all training data.

One of its first features is that it allows a novel description of\nseparable and naturally full functors in terms of faithful and full functors,\nrespectively. To any semiseparable functor we attach an invariant, given by an\nidempotent natural transformation, which controls when the functor is separable\nand yields a characterization of separable functors in terms of (dual) Maschke\nand conservative functors. We prove that any semiseparable functor admits a\ncanonical factorization as a naturally full functor followed by a separable\nfunctor. Here the main tool is the construction of the coidentifier category\nattached to the associated idempotent natural transformation. Then we move our\nattention to the semiseparability of functors that have an adjoint. First we\nobtain a Rafael-type Theorem.

A crucial step in the numerical investigation of small-scale dynamos\nin the solar atmosphere consists of an accurate determination of the magnetic\nPrandtl number, Prm, stemming from radiative magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations.

The aims are to provide a reliable methodology for\nestimating the effective Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers, Re and Rem,\nand their ratio Prm=Rem/Re (the magnetic Prandlt number), that characterise MHD\nsimulations and to categorise small-scale dynamo simulations in terms of these\ndimensionless parameters. Methods. The methodology proposed for computing Re\nand Rem is based on the method of projection on proper elements and it relies\non a post-processing step carried out using higher order accurate numerical\noperators than the ones in the simulation code. A number of radiative MHD\nsimulations with different effective viscosities and plasma resistivities were\ncarried out with the CO5BOLD code, and the resulting growth rate of the\nmagnetic energy and saturated magnetic field strengths were characterised in\nterms of Re and Rem. Results. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a\nsolid estimate of the dissipation coefficients affecting the momentum and\ninduction equations of MHD simulation codes, and consequently also a reliable\nevaluation of the magnetic Prandtl number characterising the numerical results.\nAdditionally, it is found that small-scale dynamos are active and can amplify a\nsmall seed magnetic field up to significant values in CO5BOLD simulations with\na grid spacing smaller than h=12 km, even at Prm=0.65.

We conduct experiments to test the performance of the\nnetwork and compare our proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art\nmethods, including a recent LSTM-based domain adaptation network architecture.\nThe results show that the proposed temporal convolution-based network\narchitecture outperforms all benchmarks not only in accuracy but also in model\nsize and convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations typically exhibit\ncomplex spatio-temporal variations. Both the mean and the spatio-temporal\ndependence evolve with time due to seasonality, which makes the statistical\nanalysis of PM$_{2.5}$ challenging. In geostatistics, Gaussian process is a\npowerful tool for characterizing and predicting such spatio-temporal dynamics,\nfor which the specification of a spatio-temporal covariance function is the\nkey. While the extant literature offers a wide range of choices for flexible\nstationary spatio-temporal covariance models, the temporally evolving\nspatio-temporal dependence has received scant attention only. To this end, we\npropose a time-varying spatio-temporal covariance model for describing the\ntime-evolving spatio-temporal dependence in PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations. For\nestimation, we develop a composite likelihood-based procedure to handle large\nspatio-temporal datasets.The proposed model is shown to outperform\ntraditionally used models through simulation studies in terms of predictions.\nWe apply our model to analyze the PM$_{2.5}$ data in the state of Oregon, US.\nTherein, we show that the spatial scale and smoothness exhibit periodicity.

In practice, the asset\nowner and system supplier can make the upgrade decisions together, requiring a\ndecision support model that can be jointly used to optimize the total benefit\nfor both parties. Motivated by a real-life use case including an asset owner\nand a system supplier, we build a continuous-time model to optimize the upgrade\ndecisions of a system during the fixed lifetime of the asset. In our model, we\ncapture the key critical factors that drive the upgrade decisions: increasing\nfunctionality requirements due to evolving technology, age-dependent\nmaintenance costs, a predetermined overhaul plan of the asset, and the lifetime\nof the asset. A system upgrade is less costly if it is executed jointly with an\nasset overhaul. We first analyze the case with no additional cost of upgrading\noutside an overhaul. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal\nupgrade policy under various realistic assumptions that lead to different types\nof cost functions. We then use these results as a building block to\ncharacterize the optimal policy for a generalized cost function. When there is\na penalty for upgrading outside an overhaul moment, we propose a dynamic\nprogramming approach that efficiently determines the optimal upgrade policy by\nusing our analytical results. We also prove that as this penalty increases, the\noptimal policy can only change to one where the number of upgrades not jointly\nexecuted with overhauls is reduced. However, the optimal number of upgrades is\na non-increasing function of this penalty. Also surprisingly, more overhauls\nmay lead to a smaller number of upgrades under the optimal policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 16:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We evaluate them on both nonsense words and real words\n(making use of the NRC emotion intensity lexicon of 7493 words), across six\nemotion categories. The analysis of our data reveals that some phonetic\npatterns show clear differences between emotion intensities.

In the modelling experiments, a regressor\ntrained on real words from the NRC emotion intensity lexicon shows a higher\nperformance (r = 0.17) than regressors that aim at learning the emotion\nconnotation purely from nonsense words.

Moreover,\naspects of the PBH gravitational collapse process are studied in the presence\nof anisotropies. Specifically, we study PBHs produced from the preheating\ninstability in the context of single-field inflation. Interestingly, we find\nthat PBHs produced during preheating can potentially dominate the universe's\ncontent and drive reheating through their evaporation. Then, we focus on the\nscalar induced second-order stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)\ninduced from Poisson energy density fluctuations of ultralight PBHs. By taking\nthen into account gravitational wave backreaction effects we set\nmodel-independent constraints on the initial abundance of ultralight PBHs as a\nfunction of their mass. Afterwards, we study in a covariant way the anisotropic\nspherical gravitational collapse of PBHs during a radiation-dominated era in\nwhich one can compute the PBH formation threshold as a function of the\nanisotropy.

The size of single aperture cavities, bounded by the existence of\nhigher-order transverse modes, fundamentally limits the power emitted by\nsingle-mode lasers or the brightness of quantum light sources. The\nfree-spectral range of existing electromagnetic apertures goes to zero when the\nsize of the aperture increases, and the demonstration of scale-invariant\napertures or lasers has remained elusive. Here, we report open-Dirac\nelectromagnetic apertures that exploit a subtle cavity-mode-dependent scaling\nof losses in reciprocal space. For cavities with a quadratic dispersion, the\ncomplex frequencies of modes converge towards each other with the size of\ncavities, making cavities invariably multimode. Surprisingly, for a class of\ncavities with linear dispersion, we discover that, while the convergence of the\nreal parts of cavity modes towards each other is delayed (it still quickly goes\nto zero), the normalized complex free-spectral range converge towards a\nconstant governed by the loss rate of distinct Bloch bands. We show that this\nunconventional scaling of the complex frequency of cavity modes in open-Dirac\nelectromagnetic apertures guarantees single-mode operation of large cavities.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that single-mode lasing of such cavities is\nmaintained when the cavity is scale up in size. We name such sources Berkeley\nSurface Emitting Lasers (BerkSELs). We further show that the far-field emitted\nby the proposed single-mode BerkSELs corresponds to a topological singularity\nof charge two, in full agreement with our theory.

These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm\nfor Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise\nprobability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the\nCT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models\nto obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar\nwith Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower\nprobabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid.

It is important to establish to which\nextent physical fatigue contributes to the intra-person variability observed in\nthese biometric modalities and also to know whether the performance of\nrecognition methods is affected by fatigue.

Methods: Several signature and text\nrecognition methods are considered and applied to samples gathered after\ndifferent levels of induced fatigue, measured by metabolic and mechanical\nassessment and, also by subjective perception. The recognition methods are\nDynamic Time Warping and Multi Section Vector Quantization, for signatures, and\nAllographic Text-Dependent Recognition for text in capital letters. For each\nfatigue level, the identification and verification performance of these methods\nis measured. Results: Signature shows no statistically significant intra-user\nimpact, but text does.

For the period of 1994 to 2007, the\nmulti-model mean from CMIP6 yields a mean cumulative carbon uptake of 27.2\n+-2.2 Pg C, which is about 15% lower than the 32.0+-5.7 Pg C estimate derived\nfrom two sets of observations. Negative biases in the change in anthropogenic\ncarbon inventory exist in the northern North Atlantic and at mid-latitudes in\nthe southern hemisphere (30-60{\\deg}S). For the few models that provided\nsimulations of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), we demonstrate that regions with\nnegative anthropogenic DIC biases coincide with regions that have a negative\nbias in CFC concentrations. This relationship suggests that underestimates of\nanthropogenic carbon storage in some models originates, in part, from weak\ntransport between the surface and interior ocean. To examine the robustness of\nthis attribution across the full suite of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, we examined\nthe vertical temperature gradient between 200 and 1000m as a metric for\nstratification and exchange between the surface and deeper waters. On a global\nscale across different models and different MIPs we find a linear relationship\nbetween the bias of vertical temperature gradients and the bias in\nanthropogenic carbon uptake, consistent with the hypothesis that model biases\nin the ocean carbon sink are related to biases in surface-to-interior\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The existing simulation methods are either based\non convectional Fourier's law or limited to small system sizes, making it\ndifficult to accurately and efficiently study the cross-scale heat transfer. In\nthis paper, a hybrid phonon Monte Carlo-diffusion method that couples phonon\nMonte Carlo (MC) method with Fourier's law by dividing the computational domain\nis adopted to analyze thermal spreading resistance in ballistic-diffusive\nregime. Compared with phonon MC simulation, the junction temperature of the\nhybrid method has the same precision, while the time costs could be reduced up\nto 2 orders of magnitude at most. Furthermore, the simulation results indicate\nthat the heating scheme has a remarkable impact on phonon transport. The\nthermal resistance of the heat source (HS) scheme can be larger than that of\nthe heat flux (HF) scheme, which is opposite from the prediction of Fourier's\nlaw. In the HS scheme, the enhanced phonon-boundary scattering counteracts the\nbroadening of the heat source, leading to a stronger ballistic effect as the\nheat source thickness decreases.

Plenty of methods\nbased on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results\nin the past decades. Inspired by the success of Transformers, some methods\nattempt to tackle UDA problem by adopting pure transformer architectures, and\ninterpret the models by applying the long-range dependency strategy at image\npatch-level. However, the algorithmic complexity is high and the\ninterpretability seems weak. In this paper, we propose the Domain-Transformer\n(DoT) for UDA, which integrates the CNN-backbones and the core attention\nmechanism of Transformers from a new perspective. Specifically, a plug-and-play\ndomain-level attention mechanism is proposed to learn the sample correspondence\nbetween domains. This is significantly different from existing methods which\nonly capture the local interactions among image patches. Instead of explicitly\nmodeling the distribution discrepancy from either domain-level or class-level,\nDoT learns transferable features by achieving the local semantic consistency\nacross domains, where the domain-level attention and manifold regularization\nare explored. Then, DoT is free of pseudo-labels and explicit domain\ndiscrepancy optimization. Theoretically, DoT is connected with the optimal\ntransportation algorithm and statistical learning theory.

This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrative\nmulti-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managing\ninfrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.). The\nproposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,\noptimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to\nsubstantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirect\nunavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.\nThe proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical\nmodel that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure\nnetworks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and\ninfrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types of\nintervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types\nof interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a\nproposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions\nof different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally planned\nindependently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for central\ninterventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time\nmoment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of a\nmulti-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results show\na substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition, the\noptimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable\npatterns, which indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 16:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}
