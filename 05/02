Yet, most\nprevious approaches treat acoustic scene classification (ASC) and audio event\nclassification (AEC) as two independent tasks. A few studies on scene and event\njoint classification either use synthetic audio datasets that hardly match the\nreal world, or simply use the multi-task framework to perform two tasks at the\nsame time. Neither of these two ways makes full use of the implicit and\ninherent relation between fine-grained events and coarse-grained scenes. To\nthis end, this paper proposes a relation-guided ASC (RGASC) model to further\nexploit and coordinate the scene-event relation for the mutual benefit of scene\nand event recognition. The TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset (TUT2018) is\nannotated with pseudo labels of events by a simple and efficient audio-related\npre-trained model PANN, which is one of the state-of-the-art AEC models. Then,\na prior scene-event relation matrix is defined as the average probability of\nthe presence of each event type in each scene class. Finally, the two-tower\nRGASC model is jointly trained on the real-life dataset TUT2018 for both scene\nand event classification. The following results are achieved. 1) RGASC\neffectively coordinates the true information of coarse-grained scenes and the\npseudo information of fine-grained events. 2) The event embeddings learned from\npseudo labels under the guidance of prior scene-event relations help reduce the\nconfusion between similar acoustic scenes. 3) Compared with other\n(non-ensemble) methods, RGASC improves the scene classification accuracy on the\nreal-life dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 16:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Starting from the\nconfinement energy and the mode volume, we use finite-size scaling to find that\nratios of these quantities to certain powers yield the confinement\ndimensionality of each band. This classification has negligible additional\ncomputational costs compared to a band structure calculation and is valid for\nany type of wave in both quantum and classical regimes, and any dimension. In\nthe quantum case, we illustrate our method on electronic confinement in 2D\nhexagonal BN with a nitrogen vacancy, which confirms the previous results. In\nthe classical case, we study a three-dimensional photonic band gap cavity\nsuperlattice, where we identify novel acceptor-like behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 16:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

One of the\nmost important wave mode for such scattering is the electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC) mode. Within the quasi-linear diffusion framework, the\ncyclotron resonance of relativistic electrons with EMIC waves results in very\nfast electron precipitation to the atmosphere. However, wave intensities often\nexceed the threshold for nonlinear resonant interaction, and such intense EMIC\nwaves have been shown to transport electrons away from the loss cone due to the\nforce bunching effect. In this study we investigate if this transport can block\nelectron precipitation. We combine test particle simulations, low-altitude\nELFIN observations of EMIC-driven electron precipitation, and ground-based EMIC\nobservations. Comparing simulations and observations, we show that, despite of\nthe low pitch-angle electrons being transported away from the loss cone, the\nscattering at higher pitch angles results in the loss cone filling and electron\nprecipitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 17:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Traffic flows usually change\ndramatically in a short period, which prevents the current methods from\naccurately capturing the future trend and likely causes the over-fitting\nproblem, leading to unsatisfied accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based method that can forecast the short-term\ntraffic flow precisely and avoid local optimum problems during training.\nSpecifically, instead of using the non-stationary raw traffic data directly, we\nfirst decompose them into sub-components, where each one is less noisy than the\noriginal input. Afterward, Sample Entropy (SE) is employed to merge similar\ncomponents to reduce the computation cost. The merged features are fed into the\nLSTM, and we then introduce a spatiotemporal module to consider the neighboring\nrelationships in the recombined signals to avoid strong autocorrelation. During\ntraining, we utilize the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) to optimize the parameters\nof LSTM, which overcome the overfitting issue.

This challenge\nis tackled with persistent Laplacian, which is able to capture both the\ntopology and shape of data. Persistent Laplacian-based deep learning models are\ndeveloped to systematically evaluate variant infectivity. Our comparative\nanalysis of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1,\nBA.2, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5 unveils that Omicron BA.2.11,\nBA.2.12.1, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5 are more contagious than BA.2. In particular,\nBA.4 and BA.5 are about 36\\% more infectious than BA.2 and are projected to\nbecome new dominating variants by natural selection. Moreover, the proposed\nmodels outperform the state-of-the-art methods on three major benchmark\ndatasets for mutation-induced protein-protein binding free energy changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 18:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Fortunately, soft materials have potential to\nadapt to this disparity of the Gaussian curvatures. Modular Soft Robots\n(MSoRos) have promise of achieving dimensional change by exploiting their\ncontinuum and deformable nature. We present topology and morphology design of\nMSoRos capable of reconfiguring between spherical and planar configurations.\nOur approach is based in geometry, where a platonic solid determines the number\nof modules required for plane-to-sphere reconfiguration and the radius of the\nresulting sphere, e.g., four `tetrahedron-based' or six `cube-based' MSoRos are\nrequired for spherical reconfiguration.

The topology design is shown to be scale\ninvariant, i.e., scaling of base platonic solid is reflected linearly in\nspherical and planar topologies. The module-topology curve is optimized for the\nreconfiguration and locomotion ability using a metric that quantifies\nsphere-to-plane distortion.

Because\nmost studies have focused on MLMs in English, the bias of MLMs in other\nlanguages has rarely been investigated. Manual annotation of evaluation data\nfor languages other than English has been challenging due to the cost and\ndifficulty in recruiting annotators. Moreover, the existing bias evaluation\nmethods require the stereotypical sentence pairs consisting of the same context\nwith attribute words (e.g. He/She is a nurse). We propose Multilingual Bias\nEvaluation (MBE) score, to evaluate bias in various languages using only\nEnglish attribute word lists and parallel corpora between the target language\nand English without requiring manually annotated data. We evaluated MLMs in\neight languages using the MBE and confirmed that gender-related biases are\nencoded in MLMs for all those languages.

In this paper, we instead formulate the construction of the\nworst-case instance as an optimization problem, which directly finds the tight\nratio without needing to construct two bounds separately. Our analysis of this\ncomplex optimization problem involves identifying the structure in a new \"Type\nCoverage\" dual problem. It can be seen as akin to the celebrated Magician and\nOCRS problems, except more general in that it can also provide tight ratios\nrelative to the optimal offline allocation, whereas the earlier problems only\nconcerns the ex-ante relaxation of the offline problem. Through this analysis,\nour paper provides a unified framework that derives new prophet inequalities\nand recovers existing ones, including two important new results. First, we show\nthat the \"oblivious\" method of setting a static threshold due to Chawla et al.\n(2020), surprisingly, is best-possible among all static threshold algorithms,\nunder any number $k$ of units.

(2007), is tight;\nthis confirms for the first time a separation with the convergence rate of\nadaptive algorithms, which is $1-\\Theta(\\sqrt{1/k})$ due to Alaei (2014).\nSecond, turning to the IID setting, our framework allows us to numerically\nillustrate the tight guarantee (of adaptive algorithms) under any number $k$ of\nstarting units.

This effect could be\ndominant for all SNe Ia which have broad absorption features and early-time\nvelocities over 25,000 km/s.

WMFC is usually performed in an unsupervised\nmanner without the need of labeled ground truth data.

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework for WMFC, Deep Fiber Clustering (DFC), which solves the unsupervised\nclustering problem as a self-supervised learning task with a domain-specific\npretext task to predict pairwise fiber distances. This enables the fiber\nrepresentation learning to handle a known challenge in WMFC, i.e., the\nsensitivity of clustering results to the point ordering along fibers. We design\na novel network architecture that represents input fibers as point clouds and\nallows the incorporation of additional sources of input information from gray\nmatter parcellation. Thus DFC makes use of combined information about white\nmatter fiber geometry and gray matter anatomy to improve anatomical coherence\nof fiber clusters. In addition, DFC conducts outlier removal in a natural way\nby rejecting fibers with low cluster assignment probability. We evaluate DFC on\nthree independently acquired cohorts, including data from 220 individuals\nacross genders, ages (young and elderly adults), and different health\nconditions (healthy control and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders).

While\nfast mixing of random walks on hypergraphs has led to myriad breakthroughs\nthroughout theoretical computer science in the last five years, many other\nimportant applications (e.g. locally testable codes, 2-2 games) rely on the\nmore general non-simplicial structures. These works make it clear that the\nglobal expansion properties of posets depend strongly on their underlying\narchitecture (e.g. simplicial, cubical, linear algebraic), but the overall\nphenomenon remains poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the advantage\nof different architectures, highlighting how structural regularity controls the\nspectral decay and edge-expansion of corresponding random walks.\n  In particular, we show the spectra of walks on expanding posets (Dikstein,\nDinur, Filmus, Harsha RANDOM 2018) concentrate in strips around a small number\nof approximate eigenvalues controlled by the poset's regularity. This gives a\nsimple condition to identify architectures (e.g. the Grassmann) that exhibit\nfast (exponential) decay of eigenvalues, versus architectures like hypergraphs\nwith slow (linear) decay -- a crucial distinction in applications to hardness\nof approximation and agreement testing such as the recent proof of the 2-2\nGames Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018).

The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and\nimprovements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant\nhardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current\nhardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive\noptimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We\ndescribe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that\navoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which\nanalytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification\nof another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic\nquantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is\nwell-suited to current hardware.

An LER is a transient region composed of the\nfirst several coordination shells of a reference particle. In response to the\nexternal shear, particles within LER undergo nearly affine displacement before\nthe yielding of LER. The characteristic strain (gamma) and size (xi) of LER\nrespectively depend on the shear rate by gamma~sr^epsilon and xi~sr^(-nu).\nThree exponents, lambda, epsilon, and nu, are related by lambda=1-epsilon=4*nu.\nThis simple relation connects the nonlinear rheology to the elastic properties\nand the microscopic configurational distortion of the system.

Goal: To help security practitioners train\nuseful security classification models when few labeled training data and many\nunlabeled training data are available. Method: We propose an adaptive framework\ncalled Dapper, which optimizes 1) semi-supervised learning algorithms to assign\npseudo-labels to unlabeled data in a propagation paradigm and 2) the machine\nlearning classifier (i.e., random forest). When the dataset class is highly\nimbalanced, Dapper then adaptively integrates and optimizes a data oversampling\nmethod called SMOTE.

Result: We evaluate Dapper with\nthree security datasets, i.e., the Twitter spam dataset, the malware URLs\ndataset, and the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset.

Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building\nincreasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into\nconcepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning\nmodel sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, we formulate the\nSet of Sets to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental\nconditions.

Although this model of consensus\nis extensively studied, and is useful for most consensus based decentralized\napplications, it falls short of defining correct distributed systems which\nmandate participant credential based privileged visibility into the consensus\npayload, through the consensus protocol itself. We introduce a new paradigm for\ndistributed consensus, called functional blockchain consensus. Functional\nblockchain consensus allows each blockchain protocol participant to agree on\nsome distinct sub-information of the list of transactions, as a function of the\ncredentials of the participant in the blockchain system, instead of agreeing on\nthe entire list of transactions. We motivate two adversary models, one with a\nstandard crash-fault adversary and another with a novel rational-fault\nadversary, to compromise functional blockchain consensus. We then present two\nversions of a blockchain protocol called SightSteeple, that achieves functional\nblockchain consensus in the said fault models. SightSteeple relies on a novel\ncombination of standard blockchain consensus and functional encryption, among\nother primitives, to achieve its goals of correctness. Finally, we discuss\npractical uses of functional blockchain consensus based asymmetric distributed\nledgers, and motivate off-shoot constructions that can result from this new\nconsensus paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 06:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

To this end, a simple and efficient\nmulti-phase model is introduced by exploiting different density\nreinitialization strategies other than applying different formulations to\nimplement mass conservation to the light and heavy phases, respectively, to\nrealize the target of using same artificial speed of sound for the both.

As the near-surface ice properties change\nrapidly within the upper $\\mathcal{O}$(100m), a good understanding of the ice\nproperties is required to reconstruct the neutrino properties. In particular,\ncontinuous monitoring of the snow accumulation (which changes the depth of the\nantennas) and the index-of-refraction $n(z)$ profile are crucial for an\naccurate determination of the neutrino's direction and energy.

Additionally, as this technique is based on the measurement of\nthe signal propagation times we are not bound to the conversion of density to\nindex-of-refraction. We quantify the impact of these ice uncertainties on the\nreconstruction of the neutrino vertex, direction, and energy and find that the\ncalibration device measures the ice properties to sufficient precision to have\nnegligible influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 08:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

To further equip the machine\nwith the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is\nproposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to\nextract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains\na challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.\nAlso, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further\nfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch\ngraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce\ndifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical\nunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The\nlogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the\nsyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.\nSecondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each\ngraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two\nadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer\nlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text\nembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware\nself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the\nfeatures. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the\nlogical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental\nresults show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 08:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 06:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Most of\nthe methods focus on single persons, which estimate the poses in the\nperson-centric coordinates, i.e., the coordinates based on the center of the\ntarget person. Hence, these methods are inapplicable for multi-person 3D pose\nestimation, where the absolute coordinates (e.g., the camera coordinates) are\nrequired. Moreover, multi-person pose estimation is more challenging than\nsingle pose estimation, due to inter-person occlusion and close human\ninteractions. Existing top-down multi-person methods rely on human detection\n(i.e., top-down approach), and thus suffer from the detection errors and cannot\nproduce reliable pose estimation in multi-person scenes. Meanwhile, existing\nbottom-up methods that do not use human detection are not affected by detection\nerrors, but since they process all persons in a scene at once, they are prone\nto errors, particularly for persons in small scales. To address all these\nchallenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to\nexploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all\npersons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible\nerroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection\nbased normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling\nscale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and\nbottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses.

Most existing works exploit either\nspatial-domain features or residual-domain features, while neglecting that two\ntypes of features are mutually correlated. In this paper, we propose a guided\nresiduals network, namely GRnet, which fuses spatial-domain and residual-domain\nfeatures in a mutually reinforcing way, to expose face images generated by\nDeepfake.

However, due to the complicated learning mechanism, these methods may\nbring some unnecessary performance losses. In this work, we rethink the\nadvantages of gradient operator in exposing face forgery, and design two\nplug-and-play modules by combining gradient operator with CNNs, namely tensor\npre-processing (TP) and manipulation trace attention (MTA) module.\nSpecifically, TP module refines the feature tensor of each channel in the\nnetwork by gradient operator to highlight the manipulation traces and improve\nthe feature representation.

More specifically, we mathematically\nprove the conditions wherein the deviation of the resultant chance of obtaining\neach choice from the individual preference profile, which we call the loss,\nbecomes zero, meaning that all players' satisfaction is perfectly appreciated\nwhile avoiding decision conflicts. Furthermore, even in situations where\nzero-loss conflict-free joint decision-making is unachievable, we show how to\nderive joint decision-making that accomplishes the theoretical minimum loss\nwhile ensuring conflict-free choices. Numerical demonstrations are also shown\nwith several benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 10:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

We envision that an algorithm that combines the novelty\npreservation mechanisms in evolutionary algorithms with the power of GANs can\ndeliberately guide its creative process towards output that is both good and\nnovel. In this paper, we use recent advances in image generation based on\nsemantic prompts using OpenAI's CLIP model, interrupting the GAN's iterative\nprocess with short cycles of evolutionary divergent search.

This problem\nis motivated by physical realizations like soft matter under shear, where\ndiffusion of a walk is induced by resetting events of other walks. We first\nreformulate in the broader context of diffusion with stochastic resetting the\nso-called H\\'ebraud-Lequeux model for plasticity in dense soft matter, in which\ndiffusivity is proportional to the average resetting rate. Depending on\nparameter values, the response to a weak external field may be either linear or\nnon-linear with a non-zero average position for a vanishing applied field, and\nthe transition between these two regimes may be interpreted as a continuous\nphase transition. Extending the model by considering a general power-law\nrelation between diffusivity and average resetting rate, we notably find a\ndiscontinuous phase transition between a finite diffusivity and a vanishing\ndiffusivity in the small field limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 11:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

In CLIP, transformers are\nvital for modeling complex multi-modal relations. However, in the vision\ntransformer of CLIP, the essential visual tokenization process, which produces\ndiscrete visual token sequences, generates many homogeneous tokens due to the\nredundancy nature of consecutive and similar frames in videos. This\nsignificantly increases computation costs and hinders the deployment of video\nretrieval models in web applications. In this paper, to reduce the number of\nredundant video tokens, we design a multi-segment token clustering algorithm to\nfind the most representative tokens and drop the non-essential ones. As the\nframe redundancy occurs mostly in consecutive frames, we divide videos into\nmultiple segments and conduct segment-level clustering. Center tokens from each\nsegment are later concatenated into a new sequence, while their original\nspatial-temporal relations are well maintained. We instantiate two clustering\nalgorithms to efficiently find deterministic medoids and iteratively partition\ngroups in high dimensional space. Through this token clustering and center\nselection procedure, we successfully reduce computation costs by removing\nredundant visual tokens. This method further enhances segment-level semantic\nalignment between video and text representations, enforcing the spatio-temporal\ninteractions of tokens from within-segment frames. Our method, coined as\nCenterCLIP, surpasses existing state-of-the-art by a large margin on typical\ntext-video benchmarks, while reducing the training memory cost by 35\\% and\naccelerating the inference speed by 14\\% at the best case.

In\nthe existing work, each point in the cloud may inevitably be selected as the\nneighbors of multiple aggregation centers, as all centers will gather neighbor\nfeatures from the whole point cloud independently. Thus each point has to\nparticipate in the calculation repeatedly and generates redundant duplicates in\nthe memory, leading to intensive computation costs and memory consumption.\nMeanwhile, to pursue higher accuracy, previous methods often rely on a complex\nlocal aggregator to extract fine geometric representation, which further slows\ndown the classification pipeline. To address these issues, we propose a new\nlocal aggregator of linear complexity for point cloud classification, coined as\nAPP. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary container as an anchor to exchange\nfeatures between the source point and the aggregating center. Each source point\npushes its feature to only one auxiliary container, and each center point pulls\nfeatures from only one auxiliary container. This avoids the re-computation\nissue of each source point.

It is stated that consistency would\nbe attained if any subset of the true consideration set is used for estimation,\nbut McFadden (1978) shows that, in general, one needs to do a sampling\ncorrection that depends on the protocol used to draw the choice set. This note\nderives the sampling correction that is required when the choice set for\nestimation is built from past choices. Then, it formalizes the conditions under\nwhich such correction would fulfill the uniform condition property and can\ntherefore be ignored when building practical estimators, such as the ones\nanalyzed by Crawford et al. (2021).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 12:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Faced with these two types\nof domain shifts, i.e., the illumination and the inherent difference of the\ndatasets, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework via cross-domain\ncorrelation distillation, called CCDistill.

In\nthis work, we propose COSPLAY(COncept Set guided PersonaLized dialogue\ngeneration Across both partY personas) that considers both parties as a \"team\":\nexpressing self-persona while keeping curiosity toward the partner, leading\nresponses around mutual personas, and finding the common ground. Specifically,\nwe first represent self-persona, partner persona and mutual dialogue all in the\nconcept sets. Then, we propose the Concept Set framework with a suite of\nknowledge-enhanced operations to process them such as set algebras, set\nexpansion, and set distance. Based on these operations as medium, we train the\nmodel by utilizing 1) concepts of both party personas, 2) concept relationship\nbetween them, and 3) their relationship to the future dialogue.

In addition to guidelines and best practices, many industries\nalready have safety management systems (SMSs) designed to monitor and reinforce\ngood safety behaviors. The analytic capabilities to analyze the data acquired\nthrough such systems, however, are still lacking in terms of their ability to\nrobustly quantify risks posed by various occupational hazards. Moreover, best\npractices and modern SMSs are unable to account for dynamically evolving\nenvironments/behavioral characteristics commonly found in many industrial\nsettings. This article proposes a method to address these issues by enabling\ncontinuous and quantitative assessment of safety risks in a data-driven manner.\nThe backbone of our method is an intuitive hierarchical probabilistic model\nthat explains sparse and noisy safety data collected by a typical SMS. A fully\nBayesian approach is developed to calibrate this model from safety data in an\nonline fashion. Thereafter, the calibrated model holds necessary information\nthat serves to characterize risk posed by different safety hazards.\nAdditionally, the proposed model can be leveraged for automated decision\nmaking, for instance solving resource allocation problems -- targeted towards\nrisk mitigation -- that are often encountered in resource-constrained\nindustrial environments.

They enable\nthe identification of the associated spacetime region and the imposition of\nboundary conditions in a gauge-invariant manner. While recent proposals\nconsidered the finite region in isolation and sought the maximal symmetry\nalgebra compatible with that perspective, we regard it as a subregion embedded\nin a global spacetime and study the symmetries consistent with such an\nembedding. This clarifies that the frame, although appearing as \"new\" for the\nsubregion, is built out of the field content of the complement. Given a global\nvariational principle, this also permits us to invoke a systematic\npost-selection procedure, previously used in gauge theory [arXiv:2109.06184],\nto produce consistent dynamics for a subregion with timelike boundary.\nRequiring the subregion presymplectic structure to be conserved by the dynamics\nleads to an essentially unique prescription and unambiguous Hamiltonian\ncharges. Unlike other proposals, this has the advantage that all spacetime\ndiffeomorphisms acting on the subregion remain gauge and integrable, thus\ngenerating a first-class constraint algebra. By contrast, diffeomorphisms\nacting on the frame-dressed spacetime are physical, and those that are parallel\nto the boundary are integrable. Further restricting to ones preserving the\nboundary conditions yields an algebra of conserved charges. These record\nchanges in the relation between the region and its complement as measured by\nframe reorientations. Finally, we explain how the boundary conditions and\npresymplectic structure can be encoded into boundary actions.

Fully HE (FHE) removes this\nrestriction by introducing the bootstrapping operation, which refreshes the\ndata; however, FHE schemes are highly memory-bound. Bootstrapping, in\nparticular, requires loading GBs of evaluation keys and plaintexts from\noff-chip memory, which makes FHE acceleration fundamentally bottlenecked by the\noff-chip memory bandwidth.\n  In this paper, we propose ARK, an Accelerator for FHE with Runtime data\ngeneration and inter-operation Key reuse. ARK enables practical FHE workloads\nwith a novel algorithm-architecture co-design to accelerate bootstrapping. We\nfirst eliminate the off-chip memory bandwidth bottleneck through runtime data\ngeneration and inter-operation key reuse. This approach enables ARK to fully\nexploit on-chip memory by substantially reducing the size of the working set.\nOn top of such algorithmic enhancements, we build ARK microarchitecture that\nminimizes on-chip data movement through an efficient, alternating data\ndistribution policy based on the data access patterns and a streamlined\ndataflow organization of the tailored functional units -- including base\nconversion, number-theoretic transform, and automorphism units. Overall, our\nco-design effectively handles the heavy computation and data movement overheads\nof FHE, drastically reducing the cost of HE operations, including\nbootstrapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 14:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 02:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 01:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

In\nthis work, we introduce a revised taxonomy of user intent. We take the widely\nused differentiation between navigational, transactional and informational\nqueries as a starting point, and identify three different sub-classes for the\ninformational queries: instrumental, factual and abstain. The resulting\nclassification of user queries is more fine-grained, reaches a high level of\nconsistency between annotators, and can serve as the basis for an effective\nautomatic classification process. The newly introduced categories help\ndistinguish between types of queries that a retrieval system could act upon,\nfor example by prioritizing different types of results in the ranking.We have\nused a weak supervision approach based on Snorkel to annotate the ORCAS dataset\naccording to our new user intent taxonomy, utilising established heuristics and\nkeywords to construct rules for the prediction of the intent category. We then\npresent a series of experiments with a variety of machine learning models,\nusing the labels from the weak supervision stage as training data, but find\nthat the results produced by Snorkel are not outperformed by these competing\napproaches and can be considered state-of-the-art.

We\ndetect new signatures of reverberation lags in 8 sources, increasing the total\nsample from 3 to 11, and study the evolution of reverberation lag properties as\nthe sources evolve in outbursts. We find that in all of the 9 sources with more\nthan 1 reverberation lag detection, the reverberation lags become longer and\ndominate at lower Fourier frequencies during the hard-to-soft state transition.\nThis result shows that the evolution in reverberation lags is a global property\nof the state transitions of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, which is\nvaluable in constraining models of such state transitions. The reverberation\nlag evolution suggests that the corona is the base of a jet which vertically\nexpands and/or gets ejected during state transition. We also discover that in\nthe hard state, the reverberation lags get shorter, just as the QPOs move to\nhigher frequencies, but then in the state transition, while the QPOs continue\nto higher frequencies, the lags get longer.

For this, a novel conceptual and mathematical\nframework named \"Music Interpretation Analysis\" (MIA) is presented.

In this regard, we present Sparse Graph\nTracker (SGT), a novel online graph tracker using higher-order relational\nfeatures which are more discriminative by aggregating the features of\nneighboring detections and their relations.

The\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end dense passage retrieval systems normally deploy a\ndeep neural model followed by an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search\nmodule. The model generates embeddings of the corpus and queries, which are\nthen indexed and searched by the high-performance ANN module. With the\nincreasing data scale, the ANN module unavoidably becomes the bottleneck on\nefficiency. An alternative is the learned index, which achieves significantly\nhigh search efficiency by learning the data distribution and predicting the\ntarget data location. But most of the existing learned indexes are designed for\nlow dimensional data, which are not suitable for dense passage retrieval with\nhigh-dimensional dense embeddings. In this paper, we propose LIDER, an\nefficient high-dimensional Learned Index for large-scale DEnse passage\nRetrieval. LIDER has a clustering-based hierarchical architecture formed by two\nlayers of core models. As the basic unit of LIDER to index and search data, a\ncore model includes an adapted recursive model index (RMI) and a dimension\nreduction component which consists of an extended SortingKeys-LSH (SK-LSH) and\na key re-scaling module. The dimension reduction component reduces the\nhigh-dimensional dense embeddings into one-dimensional keys and sorts them in a\nspecific order, which are then used by the RMI to make fast prediction.\nExperiments show that LIDER has a higher search speed with high retrieval\nquality comparing to the state-of-the-art ANN indexes on passage retrieval\ntasks, e.g., on large-scale data it achieves 1.2x search speed and\nsignificantly higher retrieval quality than the fastest baseline in our\nevaluation.

In practice however, the number of arms can be very large resulting in\nlarge memory requirements for simultaneously processing them. In this paper we\nconsider a streaming setting where the arms are presented in a stream and the\nalgorithm uses limited memory to process these arms. Here, the goal is not only\nto minimize regret, but also to do so in minimal memory. Previous algorithms\nfor this problem operate in one of the two settings: they either use\n$\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$ passes over the stream (Rathod, 2021; Chaudhuri and\nKalyanakrishnan, 2020; Liau et al., 2018), or just a single pass (Maiti et al.,\n2021).\n  In this paper we study the trade-off between memory and regret when $B$\npasses over the stream are allowed, for any $B \\geq 1$, and establish tight\nregret upper and lower bounds for any $B$-pass algorithm. Our results uncover a\nsurprising *sharp transition phenomenon*: $O(1)$ memory is sufficient to\nachieve $\\widetilde\\Theta\\Big(T^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^{B+2}-2}}\\Big)$\nregret in $B$ passes, and increasing the memory to any quantity that is $o(K)$\nhas almost no impact on further reducing this regret, unless we use $\\Omega(K)$\nmemory. Our main technical contribution is our lower bound which requires the\nuse of information-theoretic techniques as well as ideas from round elimination\nto show that the *residual problem* remains challenging over subsequent passes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 15:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Higher\nEducation institutions strive to improve students' academic performance. Early\nintervention to at-risk students and a reasonable curriculum is vital for\nstudents' success. Prior research opted for deploying traditional machine\nlearning models to predict students' performance. In terms of curriculum\nsemantic analysis, after conducting a comprehensive systematic review regarding\nthe use of semantic technologies in the Computer Science curriculum, a major\nfinding of the study is that technologies used to measure similarity have\nlimitations in terms of accuracy and ambiguity in the representation of\nconcepts, courses, etc. To fill these gaps, in this study, three\nimplementations were developed, that is, to predict students' performance using\nmarks from the previous semester, to model a course representation in a\nsemantic way and compute the similarity, and to identify the prerequisite\nbetween two similar courses. Regarding performance prediction, we used the\ncombination of Genetic Algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset\nfrom a Brazilian university containing 248730 records. As for similarity\nmeasurement, we deployed BERT to encode the sentences and used cosine\nsimilarity to obtain the distance between courses. With respect to prerequisite\nidentification, TextRazor was applied to extract concepts from course\ndescription, followed by employing SemRefD to measure the degree of\nprerequisite between two concepts. The outcomes of this study can be summarized\nas: (i) a breakthrough result improves Manrique's work by 2.5% in terms of\naccuracy in dropout prediction; (ii) uncover the similarity between courses\nbased on course description; (iii) identify the prerequisite over three\ncompulsory courses of School of Computing at ANU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 06:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 01:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}

Recent\nadvancements in representation learning have been shown to greatly improve the\nperformance of molecular property prediction. However, due to limited labeled\ndata, supervised learning-based molecular representation algorithms can only\nsearch limited chemical space, which results in poor generalizability. In this\nwork, we proposed a self-supervised representation learning framework for\nlarge-scale unlabeled molecules. We developed a novel molecular graph\naugmentation strategy, referred to as attention-wise graph mask, to generate\nchallenging positive sample for contrastive learning. We adopted the graph\nattention network (GAT) as the molecular graph encoder, and leveraged the\nlearned attention scores as masking guidance to generate molecular augmentation\ngraphs. By minimization of the contrastive loss between original graph and\nmasked graph, our model can capture important molecular structure and\nhigher-order semantic information. Extensive experiments showed that our\nattention-wise graph mask contrastive learning exhibit state-of-the-art\nperformance in a couple of downstream molecular property prediction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 00:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In multi-objective optimisation problems, BO\naims to find a set of approximated Pareto optimal solutions. There are\ntypically two ways to build surrogates in multi-objective BO: One surrogate by\naggregating objective functions (by using a scalarising function, also called\nmono-surrogate approach) and multiple surrogates (for each objective function,\nalso called multi-surrogate approach). In both approaches, an acquisition\nfunction (AF) is used to guide the search process. Mono-surrogate has the\nadvantage that only one model is used, however, the approach has two major\nlimitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function and the\nobjective functions may not be similar. Secondly, the approach assumes that the\nscalarising function distribution is Gaussian, and thus a closed-form\nexpression of the AF can be used. In this work, we overcome these limitations\nby building a surrogate model for each objective function and show that the\nscalarising function distribution is not Gaussian. We approximate the\ndistribution using Generalised extreme value distribution. The results and\ncomparison with existing approaches on standard benchmark and real-world\noptimisation problems show the potential of the multi-surrogate approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 09:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}
