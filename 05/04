Each particle takes values in a countable state space and\nevolves according to a pure jump process whose jump intensities depend on only\nthe states (or histories) and marks of itself and particles and edges in its\nneighborhood. Under mild conditions, it is shown that if the sequence of\n(marked) interaction graphs converges locally in probability to a limit\n(marked) graph that satisfies a certain finite dissociability property, then\nthe corresponding sequence of empirical measures of the particle trajectories\nconverges weakly to the law of the marginal dynamics at the root vertex of the\nlimit graph. The proof of this limit relies on several results of independent\ninterest. First, such interacting particle systems are shown to be well-posed\non almost surely finitely dissociable graphs, which include graphs of maximal\nbounded degree and any Galton-Watson tree whose offspring distribution has a\nfinite first moment. A counterexample is provided to show that well-posedness\ncan fail for dynamics on graphs outside this class. Second, the dynamics on a\nlocally convergent sequence of graphs are shown to converge in the local weak\nsense to the dynamics on the limit graph when the latter is finitely\ndissociable.

However, cross-spectral face\nrecognition (i.e., VIS to IR) is very challenging due to the dramatic\ndifference between the visible light and IR imageries as well as the lack of\npaired training data. This paper proposes a framework of bidirectional\ncross-spectral conversion (BCSC-GAN) between the heterogeneous face images, and\ndesigns an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism based on information fusion\ntheory. The network reduces the cross-spectral recognition problem into an\nintra-spectral problem, and improves performance by fusing bidirectional\ninformation. Specifically, a face identity retaining module (IRM) is introduced\nwith the ability to preserve identity features, and a new composite loss\nfunction is designed to overcome the modal differences caused by different\nspectral characteristics. Two datasets of TINDERS and CASIA were tested, where\nperformance metrics of FID, recognition rate, equal error rate and normalized\ndistance were compared. Results show that our proposed network is superior than\nother state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed rule of Self\nAdaptive Weighted Fusion (SAWF) is better than the recognition results of the\nunfused case and other traditional fusion rules that are commonly used, which\nfurther justifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed\nbidirectional conversion approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 16:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

The\ndifference equations in the former variables were identified with the qKZ\nequations in [28]. The difference equations in the latter variables were\nidentified representation theoretically in [30] using an analog of the quantum\ndynamical Weyl group.\n  Once this representation theoretic description is known, there is an obvious\ngeneralization of these equations, which we refer to as exotic quantum\ndifference equations.

This study closes this\ngap by comparing these methods across three retrieval tasks associated with a\ndata set of German tweets (Linder, 2017), the Social Bias Inference Corpus\n(SBIC) (Sap et al., 2020), and the Reuters-21578 corpus (Lewis, 1997). Results\nshow that query expansion techniques and topic model-based classification rules\nin most studied settings tend to decrease rather than increase retrieval\nperformance. Active supervised learning, however, if applied on a not too small\nset of labeled training instances (e.g. 1,000 documents), reaches a\nsubstantially higher retrieval performance than keyword lists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 16:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Nowadays, 3D scanning\ntechnologies are being proposed for more reliable, human-independent\nmeasurements, yet the process of inspection and reporting remains laborious and\ntime consuming because data acquisition and validation are still carried out by\nthe engineer. For full automation of dent inspection, the acquired point cloud\ndata must be analysed via a reliable segmentation algorithm, releasing humans\nfrom the search and evaluation of damage. This paper reports on two\ndevelopments towards automated dent inspection. The first is a method to\ngenerate a synthetic dataset of dented surfaces to train a fully convolutional\nneural network. The training of machine learning algorithms needs a substantial\nvolume of dent data, which is not readily available. Dents are thus simulated\nin random positions and shapes, within criteria and definitions of a Boeing 737\nstructural repair manual.

Firstly, the pipeline generates a synthetic dataset\nfrom physics-based simulations with low discrepancy sequences, that allow to\nsufficiently represent the manufacturing parameters space. Secondly, the\ngenerated dataset is used to train deterministic ML models for the\nimplementation of a fast multi-objective optimization, to identify an optimal\nelectrode and the manufacturing parameters to adopt in order to fabricate it.\nLastly, this electrode was successfully fabricated experimentally, proving that\nour modeling pipeline prediction is physical-relevant.

Applications of gaze information\nrange from new interaction techniques exploiting eye patterns to\ngaze-contingent digital content creation. However, system latency is still a\nsignificant issue in many of these applications because it breaks the\nsynchronization between the current and measured gaze positions. Consequently,\nit may lead to unwanted visual artifacts and degradation of user experience. In\nthis work, we focus on foveated rendering applications where the quality of an\nimage is reduced towards the periphery for computational savings. In foveated\nrendering, the presence of latency leads to delayed updates to the rendered\nframe, making the quality degradation visible to the user. To address this\nissue and to combat system latency, recent work proposes to use saccade landing\nposition prediction to extrapolate the gaze information from delayed\neye-tracking samples. While the benefits of such a strategy have already been\ndemonstrated, the solutions range from simple and efficient ones, which make\nseveral assumptions about the saccadic eye movements, to more complex and\ncostly ones, which use machine learning techniques. Yet, it is unclear to what\nextent the prediction can benefit from accounting for additional factors. This\npaper presents a series of experiments investigating the importance of\ndifferent factors for saccades prediction in common virtual and augmented\nreality applications. In particular, we investigate the effects of saccade\norientation in 3D space and smooth pursuit eye-motion (SPEM) and how their\ninfluence compares to the variability across users.

Laboratory evidence suggested that solid O2 may either exist in a cold (<50\nK) subsurface layer of the icy surface of Ganymede, or it is in an atmospheric\nhaze of the moon. Alternatively, O2 is constantly replenished at the surface\nthrough ion irradiation of water-containing ices. A conclusive answer on the\nexistence of solid O2 on the surface of Ganymede is hampered by the lack of\ndetailed, extensive observational datasets. We present new ground-based,\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations of Ganymede's surface obtained at\nthe Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. These are combined with dedicated laboratory\nmeasurements of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) photoabsorption spectra of O2 ice,\nboth pure and mixed with other species of potential interest for the Galilean\nsatellites. Our study confirms that the two bands identified in the visible\nspectra of Ganymede's surface are due to the (1,0) and (0,0) transition bands\nof O2 ice. Oxygen-rich ice mixtures including water (H2O) and carbon dioxide\n(CO2) can reproduce observational reflectance data of the Ganymede's surface\nbetter than pure O2 ice in the temperature range 20-35 K. Solid H2O and CO2\nalso provide an environment where O2 ice can be trapped at higher temperatures\nthan its pure ice desorption under vacuum space conditions.

The combination of its observed brightness temperature and circular\npolarisation fraction suggests that the emission is generated via the\nelectron-cyclotron maser instability. Two distinct mechanisms have been\nproposed to power such emission from low-mass stars: either a sub-Alfv\\'enic\ninteraction between the stellar magnetic field and an orbiting planet, or\nreconnection at the edge of the stellar magnetosphere. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of both mechanisms, utilising the information about\nthe star's surrounding plasma environment obtained from modelling its stellar\nwind. Using this information, we show that a Neptune-sized exoplanet with a\nmagnetic field strength of 10-100 G orbiting at ~0.034 au can accurately\nreproduce the observed radio emission from the star, with corresponding orbital\nperiods of 7.4 days. Due to the stellar inclination, a planet in an equatorial\norbit is unlikely to transit the star. While such a planet could induce radial\nvelocity semi-amplitudes from 7 to 396 m s$^{-1}$, it is unlikely that this\nsignal could be detected with current techniques due to the activity of the\nhost star. The application of our planet-induced radio emission model here\nillustrates its exciting potential as a new tool for identifying planet-hosting\ncandidates from long-term radio monitoring.

In this\npaper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of different deep sequence\nmodels for anomalous traffic prediction.

Naively, one might therefore expect that only the less massive\nblack hole in merging binaries exhibits non-negligible spin.

To address this issue, we present an\nexperimental study of single-crystal and thin film samples of\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with $x\\ge0.25$. In particular, measurements of\nbulk susceptibility on LSCO crystals with $x=0.25$ indicate an onset of\ndiamagnetism at $T_{c1}=38.5$ K, with a sharp transition to a phase with full\nbulk shielding at $T_{c2}=18$ K, independent of field direction. Strikingly,\nthe in-plane resistivity only goes to zero at $T_{c2}$. Inelastic neutron\nscattering on $x=0.25$ crystals confirms the presence of low-energy\nincommensurate magnetic excitations with reduced strength compared to lower\ndoping levels. The ratio of the spin gap to $T_{c2}$ is anomalously large.

The\ntheoretical uncertainty is driven by the lack of knowledge about the electron\npressure and density. Thus we explore the electron pressure and density\ndistributions in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, and we\ndemonstrate that the cluster properties exhibit a strong dependence on the halo\nconcentration -- providing some of the first evidence of cluster assembly bias\nin the electron pressure and density.

The problem is formalized as a multi-round game in which\ntwo players, a filler (who assigns work to tasks) and an emptier (who schedules\ntasks) compete. The emptier's goal is to minimize backlog, which is the maximum\namount of outstanding work for any task.\n  Recently, Kuszmaul and Westover (ITCS, 2021) proposed the\n\\emph{variable-processor cup game}, which considers the same problem, except\nthat the amount of resources available to the players (i.e., the number $p$ of\nprocessors) fluctuates between rounds of the game. They showed that this\nseemingly small modification fundamentally changes the dynamics of the game:\nwhereas the optimal backlog in the fixed $p$-processor game is $\\Theta(\\log\nn)$, independent of $p$, the optimal backlog in the variable-processor game is\n$\\Theta(n)$. The latter result was only known to apply to games with\n\\emph{exponentially many} rounds, however, and it has remained an open question\nwhat the optimal tradeoff between time and backlog is for shorter games.\n  This paper establishes a tight trade-off curve between time and backlog in\nthe variable-processor cup game.

Here we generalize the contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE) to\navoid fermionic encoding of the wave function. In contrast to the variational\nquantum eigensolver, the CQE solves for a many-fermion stationary state by\nminimizing the contraction (projection) of the Schr\\\"odinger equation onto two\nfermions.

Turbulence is often invoked to offset\nradiative losses in cluster cores, both by direct dissipation and by enabling\nturbulent heat diffusion. However, in a stratified medium, buoyancy forces\noppose radial motions, making turbulence anisotropic. This can be quantified\nvia the Froude number ${\\rm Fr}$, which decreases inward in clusters as\nstratification increases. We exploit analogies with MHD turbulence to show that\nwave-turbulence interactions increase cascade times and reduces dissipation\nrates $\\epsilon \\propto {\\rm Fr}$. Equivalently, for a given energy\ninjection/dissipation rate $\\epsilon$, turbulent velocities $u$ must be higher\ncompared to Kolmogorov scalings. High resolution hydrodynamic simulations show\nexcellent agreement with the $\\epsilon \\propto {\\rm Fr}$ scaling, which sets in\nfor ${\\rm Fr} < 0.1$. We also compare previously predicted scalings for the\nturbulent diffusion coefficient $D \\propto {\\rm Fr}^2$ and find excellent\nagreement, for ${\\rm Fr} < 1$. However, we find a different normalization,\ncorresponding to stronger diffusive suppression by more than an order of\nmagnitude. Our results imply that turbulent diffusion is more heavily\nsuppressed by stratification, over a much wider radial range, than turbulent\ndissipation. Thus, the latter potentially dominates. Furthermore, this shift\nimplies significantly higher turbulent velocities required to offset cooling,\ncompared to previous models. These results are potentially relevant to\nturbulent metal diffusion (which is likewise suppressed), and to planetary\natmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 19:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Pressure balance scaling holds, consistent with studies of other\nastrospheres. Solar wind anisotropy does not have an appreciable effect on\nshock geometry. We find that supernova explosions at 50 pc (95 pc) lead to\nheliopause locations at 16 au (23 au) when the forward shock arrives. Thus, the\nouter solar system was directly exposed to the blast, but the inner planets --\nincluding the Earth -- were not. This finding reaffirms that the delivery of\nsupernova material to the Earth is not from the blast plasma itself, but likely\nis from supernova dust grains. After the arrival of the forward shock, the\nweakening supernova blast will lead to a gradual rebound of the heliosphere,\ntaking $\\sim100$s of kyr to expand beyond 100 au. Prospects for future work are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 19:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The asymmetry of line emission relative to the\ndisk major axis allows for a direct mapping of the emission height above the\nmidplane, and for optically-thick, spatially-resolved emission in LTE, the\nintensity is a measure of the local gas temperature. Our analysis of ALMA\narchival data yields CO emission surfaces, dynamically-constrained stellar host\nmasses, and disk atmosphere gas temperatures for the disks around: HD 142666,\nMY Lup, V4046 Sgr, HD 100546, GW Lup, WaOph 6, DoAr 25, Sz 91, CI Tau, and DM\nTau.

This sample nearly triples the number of disks with\nmapped emission surfaces and confirms the wide diversity in line emitting\nheights ($z/r\\approx0.1$ to ${\\gtrsim}0.5$) hinted at in previous studies. We\ncompute radial and vertical CO gas temperature distributions for each disk. A\nfew disks show local temperature dips or enhancements, some of which correspond\nto dust substructures or the proposed locations of embedded planets. Several\nemission surfaces also show vertical substructures, which all align with rings\nand gaps in the millimeter dust. Combining our sample with literature sources,\nwe find that CO line emitting heights weakly decline with stellar mass and gas\ntemperature, which, despite large scatter, is consistent with simple scaling\nrelations. We also observe a correlation between CO emission height and disk\nsize, which is due to the flared structure of disks. Overall, CO emission\nsurfaces trace ${\\approx}2$-$5\\times$ gas pressure scale heights (H$_{\\rm{g}}$)\nand could potentially be calibrated as empirical tracers of H$_{\\rm{g}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

This paper abstracts the radar's meta-cognition problem in\nterms of the spectra (eigenvalues) of the state and observation noise\ncovariance matrices, and embeds the algebraic Riccati equation into an\neconomics-based utility maximization setup.

Existing schemes coordinate transmissions\nacross peers to avoid sending redundant data, but they either incur a high\nlatency or are not robust against adversarial network nodes. We present\nStrokkur, a new transaction broadcasting mechanism that provides both low\nbandwidth overhead and low latency. The core idea behind Strokkur is to avoid\nexplicit coordination through randomized transaction coding. Rather than\nforward individual transactions. Strokkur nodes send out codewords -- XOR sums\nof multiple transactions selected at random. Since almost every codeword is\nuseful for the receiver to decode new transactions, Strokkur nodes do not\nrequire coordination, for example, to determine which transactions the receiver\nis missing. Strokkur's coding strategy builds on LT codes, a popular class of\nrateless erasure codes, and extends them to support multiple uncoordinated\nsenders with partially-overlapping continual streams of transaction data.\nStrokkur introduces mechanisms to cope with adversarial senders that may send\ncorrupt codewords, and a simple rate control algorithm that enables each node\nto independently determine an appropriate sending rate of codewords for each\npeer. Our implementation of Strokkur in Golang supports 647k transactions per\nsecond using only one CPU core. Our evaluation across a 19-node Internet\ndeployment and large-scale simulation show that Strokkur consumes 2--7.6x less\nbandwidth than the existing scheme in Bitcoin, and 9x lower latency that Shrec\nwhen only 4% of nodes are adversarial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 21:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

Our main contribution\nis a more advanced learning approach that enables real-world demonstrations,\nusing the Cassie robot, of closed-loop dynamic walking over moderately\ndifficult stepping-stone patterns. Our approach first uses reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in simulation to train a controller that maps footstep commands\nonto joint actions without any reference motion information. We then learn a\nmodel of that controller's capabilities, which enables prediction of feasible\nfootsteps given the robot's current dynamic state. The resulting controller and\nmodel are then integrated with a real-time overhead camera system for detecting\nstepping stone locations. For evaluation, we develop a benchmark set of\nstepping stone patterns, which are used to test performance in both simulation\nand the real world.

The continuum-kinetic model provides noise-free access\nto the full particle distribution function permitting a detailed investigation\nof the role of kinetic physics in hydrodynamic phenomena such as the RT\ninstability. For long mean-free-path, there is no RT instability growth, but as\ncollisionality increases, particles relax towards the Maxwellian velocity\ndistribution, and the kinetic simulations reproduce the fluid simulation\nresults. An important and novel contribution of this work is in the\nintermediate collisional cases that are not accessible with traditional fluid\nmodels and require kinetic modeling. Simulations of intermediate collisional\ncases show that the RT instability evolution is significantly altered compared\nto the highly collisional fluid-like cases. Specifically, the growth rate of\nthe intermediate collisionality RT instability is lower than the high\ncollisionality case while also producing a significantly more diffused\ninterface. The higher moments of the distribution function play a more\nsignificant role relative to inertial terms for intermediate collisionality\nduring the evolution of the RT instability interface.

While the majority of deaths and severe morbidity are due to P.\nfalciparum, P. vivax poses a greater challenge to eliminating malaria outside\nof Africa due to its ability to form latent liver stage parasites\n(hypnozoites), which can cause relapsing episodes within an individual patient.\nIn areas where P. falciparum and P. vivax are co-endemic, individuals can carry\nparasites of both species simultaneously. These mixed infections complicate\ndynamics in several ways; treatment of mixed infections will simultaneously\naffect both species, P. falciparum can mask the detection of P. vivax, and it\nhas been hypothesised that clearing P. falciparum may trigger a relapse of\ndormant P. vivax. When mixed infections are treated for only blood-stage\nparasites, patients are at risk of relapse infections due to P. vivax\nhypnozoites.\n  We present a stochastic mathematical model that captures interactions between\nP. falciparum and P. vivax, and incorporates both standard schizontocidal\ntreatment (which targets blood-stage parasites) and radical treatment (which\nadditionally targets liver-stage parasites). We apply this model to assess the\nimplications of different treatment coverage of radical cure for mixed and P.\nvivax infections and a so-called \"unified radical cure\" treatment strategy for\nP. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infections.

To\nrelax this assumption, in this work, we propose a label-agnostic unified\nfederated learning framework, named FedMix, for medical image segmentation\nbased on mixed image labels. In FedMix, each client updates the federated model\nby integrating and effectively making use of all available labeled data ranging\nfrom strong pixel-level labels, weak bounding box labels, to weakest\nimage-level class labels. Based on these local models, we further propose an\nadaptive weight assignment procedure across local clients, where each client\nlearns an aggregation weight during the global model update. Compared to the\nexisting methods, FedMix not only breaks through the constraint of a single\nlevel of image supervision, but also can dynamically adjust the aggregation\nweight of each local client, achieving rich yet discriminative feature\nrepresentations. To evaluate its effectiveness, experiments have been carried\nout on two challenging medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., breast tumor\nsegmentation and skin lesion segmentation. The results validate that our\nproposed FedMix outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 01:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

A typical example is\nunderwater acoustic communication for 6G mobile networks. The major challenges\nin such environments are extremely high-latency and high-error rate.

The goal of the proposed\nidea is to achieve approximate real-time image transmission without\nretransmission using CoAP over UDP. To this end, an image is divided into\nblocks, and value is assigned for each block based on the requirement. By the\nstochastic transmission of blocks, the reception probability is guaranteed\nwithout retransmission even when packets are lost in networks.

The\nelectrode configurations are also incorporated into VCMs without increasing the\nnumber of input channels; this enables the straightforward incorporation of the\nnon-parametric features of electrodes (e.g., thickness, shape, size, and\nposition) in the training and testing of the proposed emulator.

However, there are applications\nwhere image noise may be necessary to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the\nimage, such as court evidence and image forensics. This means that noise itself\nneeds to be coded, in addition to the clean image itself. In this paper, we\npresent a learning-based image compression framework where image denoising and\ncompression are performed jointly. The latent space of the image codec is\norganized in a scalable manner such that the clean image can be decoded from a\nsubset of the latent space (the base layer), while the noisy image is decoded\nfrom the full latent space at a higher rate. Using a subset of the latent space\nfor the denoised image allows denoising to be carried out at a lower rate.\nBesides providing a scalable representation of the noisy input image,\nperforming denoising jointly with compression makes intuitive sense because\nnoise is hard to compress; hence, compressibility is one of the criteria that\nmay help distinguish noise from the signal.

Developing practical algorithms that can\nestimate price elasticities robustly, especially when information about no\npurchases (losses) is not available, to drive such automated pricing systems is\na challenge faced by many industries. Based on the Poisson semi-parametric\napproach, we construct a flexible yet interpretable demand model where the\nprice related part is parametric while the remaining (nuisance) part of the\nmodel is non-parametric and can be modeled via sophisticated machine learning\n(ML) techniques. The estimation of price-sensitivity parameters of this model\nvia direct one-stage regression techniques may lead to biased estimates due to\nregularization. To address this concern, we propose a two-stage estimation\nmethodology which makes the estimation of the price-sensitivity parameters\nrobust to biases in the estimators of the nuisance parameters of the model. In\nthe first-stage we construct estimators of observed purchases and prices given\nthe feature vector using sophisticated ML estimators such as deep neural\nnetworks. Utilizing the estimators from the first-stage, in the second-stage we\nleverage a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the\nprice-sensitivity parameters. We test the performance of the proposed\nestimation schemes on simulated and real sales transaction data from the\nAirline industry. Our numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed two-stage\napproach reduces the estimation error in price-sensitivity parameters from 25\\%\nto 4\\% in realistic simulation settings. The two-stage estimation techniques\nproposed in this work allows practitioners to leverage modern ML techniques to\nrobustly estimate price-sensitivities while still maintaining interpretability\nand allowing ease of validation of its various constituent parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 03:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 22:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The model consists of an image branch and a pose branch, which\nrespectively generates the coarse-level logits facilitated by the unsupervised\ndomain adaptation and the 3D keypoints using the HRNet with SMPLify\noptimization. Then the outputs of these branches will be sent into the\nhierarchical pose recognition module to estimate the fine-level pose labels. We\nalso collect and label a new AIMS dataset, which contains 750 real and 4000\nsynthetic infants images with AIMS pose labels. Our experimental results show\nthat the proposed method can significantly align the distribution of synthetic\nand real-world datasets, thus achieving accurate performance on fine-grained\ninfant pose recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 04:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

Across the composition gradient in Sc < 0.35 range and\n140-260 nm thickness in combinatorial thin films of Al1-xScxN, the pure\nwurtzite phase exhibits a similar c/a ratio regardless of the Sc content, due\nto elastic interaction with neighboring crystals.

In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder\nlayers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half\nof decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the\nremaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal\nimage-text representations.

Specifically, several existing\nstudies have reported that many unsatisfactory behaviors are actually\noriginated from the faults residing in DL programs. Besides, locating faulty\nneurons is not actionable for developers, while locating the faulty statements\nin DL programs can provide developers with more useful information for\ndebugging. Though a few recent studies were proposed to pinpoint the faulty\nstatements in DL programs or the training settings (e.g. too large learning\nrate), they were mainly designed based on predefined rules, leading to many\nfalse alarms or false negatives, especially when the faults are beyond their\ncapabilities.\n  In view of these limitations, in this paper, we proposed DeepFD, a\nlearning-based fault diagnosis and localization framework which maps the fault\nlocalization task to a learning problem.

We\nused a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of an orthogonal pulsar\nmagnetosphere restricted to the plane perpendicular to the star spin axis. We\nevolved the solution for several tens of pulsar periods to gather a\nstatistically significant sample of synthetic pulse profiles. The formation of\nplasmoids leads to strong pulse-to-pulse variability in the form of multiple\nshort, bright subpulses, which appear only on the leading edge of each main\npulse.

An FA consists of a dielectric holder,\nin which a radiating liquid moves between pre-defined locations (called ports)\nthat serve as the transceiver's antennas. Due to the nature of liquids, FAs can\npractically take any size and shape, making them both flexible and\nreconfigurable. In this paper, we deal with the outage probability of FAs under\ngeneral fading channels, where a port is scheduled based on selection\ncombining. An analytical framework is provided for the performance with and\nwithout estimation errors, as a result of post-scheduling delays. We show that\nalthough FAs achieve maximum diversity, this cannot be realized in the presence\nof delays. Hence, a linear prediction scheme is proposed that overcomes delays\nand restores the lost diversity by predicting the next scheduled port.\nMoreover, we design space-time coded modulations that exploit the FA's\nsequential operation with space-time rotations and code diversity. The derived\nexpressions for the pairwise error probability and average word error rate give\nan accurate estimate of the performance. We illustrate that the proposed design\nattains maximum diversity, while keeping a low-complexity receiver, thereby\nconfirming the feasibility of FAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 09:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

Any attempt to resolve\nthis long-standing problem seems to be doomed, as the route to any direct\nempirical evidence (i.e., detecting gravitons) for shedding light on the\nquantum aspect of the gravity is far beyond the current capabilities. Recently,\nit has been discovered that gravitationally-induced entanglement, tailored in\nthe interferometric frameworks, can be used to witness the quantum nature of\nthe gravity. Even though these schemes offer promising tools for investigating\nquantum gravity, many fundamental and empirical aspects of the schemes are yet\nto be discovered. Considering the fact that, beside quantum entanglement,\nquantum uncertainty and complementarity principles are the two other\nfoundational aspects of quantum physics, the quantum nature of the gravity\nneeds to manifest all of these features. Here, we lay out an interferometric\nplatform for testing these three nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics in\nquantum gravity setting, which connects gravity and quantum physics in a\nbroader and deeper context. As we show in this work, all of these three\nfundamental features of quantum gravity can be framed and fully analyzed in an\ninterferometric scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 09:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

To answer\nthese questions, we create a new African news corpus covering 16 languages, of\nwhich eight languages are not part of any existing evaluation dataset.

However, based on a thorough comparison\nof representative RecogTrans and InstDisc methods, we observe the great\npotential of RecogTrans on both semantic-related and temporal-related\ndownstream tasks. Based on hard-label classification, existing RecogTrans\napproaches suffer from noisy supervision signals in pre-training. To mitigate\nthis problem, we developed TransRank, a unified framework for recognizing\nTransformations in a Ranking formulation. TransRank provides accurate\nsupervision signals by recognizing transformations relatively, consistently\noutperforming the classification-based formulation. Meanwhile, the unified\nframework can be instantiated with an arbitrary set of temporal or spatial\ntransformations, demonstrating good generality. With a ranking-based\nformulation and several empirical practices, we achieve competitive performance\non video retrieval and action recognition.

Currently, various works have been proposed to represent the complex\nsemantics of source code from different views, including plain text, Abstract\nSyntax Tree (AST), and several kinds of code graphs (e.g., Control/Data Flow\nGraph). However, most of them only consider a single view of source code\nindependently, ignoring the correspondences among different views. In this\npaper, we propose to integrate different views with the natural-language\ndescription of source code into a unified framework with Multi-View contrastive\nPre-training, and name our model as CODE-MVP. Specifically, we first extract\nmultiple code views using compiler tools, and learn the complementary\ninformation among them under a contrastive learning framework. Inspired by the\ntype checking in compilation, we also design a fine-grained type inference\nobjective in the pre-training. Experiments on three downstream tasks over five\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of CODE-MVP when compared with several\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

Identifying important keyphrase is the\ncentral component of the keyphrase extraction task, and its main challenge is\nhow to represent information comprehensively and discriminate importance\naccurately. In this paper, to address these issues, we design a new hyperbolic\nmatching model (HyperMatch) to represent phrases and documents in the same\nhyperbolic space and explicitly estimate the phrase-document relevance via the\nPoincar\\'e distance as the important score of each phrase. Specifically, to\ncapture the hierarchical syntactic and semantic structure information,\nHyperMatch takes advantage of the hidden representations in multiple layers of\nRoBERTa and integrates them as the word embeddings via an adaptive mixing\nlayer. Meanwhile, considering the hierarchical structure hidden in the\ndocument, HyperMatch embeds both phrases and documents in the same hyperbolic\nspace via a hyperbolic phrase encoder and a hyperbolic document encoder. This\nstrategy can further enhance the estimation of phrase-document relevance due to\nthe good properties of hyperbolic space. In this setting, the keyphrase\nextraction can be taken as a matching problem and effectively implemented by\nminimizing a hyperbolic margin-based triplet loss. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on six benchmarks and demonstrate that HyperMatch outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 13:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

We begin with a simple\ntwo-device problem where two devices deliver delay-constrained traffic to an\naccess point (AP) via a common unreliable collision channel. By assuming that\none device (called Device 1) adopts ALOHA, we aim to optimize the random access\nscheme of the other device (called Device 2). The most intriguing part of this\nproblem is that Device 2 does not know the information of Device 1 but needs to\nmaximize the system timely throughput. We first propose a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) formulation to derive a model-based upper bound so as to quantify\nthe performance gap of certain random access schemes.

It\nis, first because of the sensitivity to human shapes, second because of the\ncomplexity of human images caused by body shape and pose changes, and third\nbecause of the domain gap between realistic images and freehand sketches. In\nthis work, we present DeepPortraitDrawing, a deep generative framework for\nconverting roughly drawn sketches to realistic human body images. To encode\ncomplicated body shapes under various poses, we take a local-to-global\napproach. Locally, we employ semantic part auto-encoders to construct\npart-level shape spaces, which are useful for refining the geometry of an input\npre-segmented hand-drawn sketch. Globally, we employ a cascaded spatial\ntransformer network to refine the structure of body parts by adjusting their\nspatial locations and relative proportions. Finally, we use a global synthesis\nnetwork for the sketch-to-image translation task, and a face refinement network\nto enhance facial details.

Such\none-to-one assignment may not be optimal for the matching between the learned\nproposal boxes and ground truths. To address this problem, we propose dynamic\nlabel assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm to assign\nincreasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN.\nWe constrain the matching to be gradually looser in the sequential stages as\nthe later stage produces the refined proposals with improved precision.

Instead of using\nfunctions valued in representations, we can use functions valued in modules,\neg. we can use $S^1$-valued functions and $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued functions.\nFinally, everything we do works in both the smooth and holomorphic categories.\nThese generalizations allow us to derive results, including classical ones,\nthat could not be obtained with the usual van Est map, and they give a new\nmethod of computing cohomology. Part 3 of this thesis involves a proposal of a\ndefinition of Morita equivalences in the categories of Lie algebroids and\nLA-groupoids. What we find is that our proposed category of LA-groupoids\nunifies differentiable stacks, Lie algebroids and homotopy theory. In\nparticular, there are morphisms between Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids and we\nshow that such objects can be Morita equivalent. This gives another\ninterpretation of the van Est map. Using this category, we argue that a\nclassifying space for $G$ is just a space which is homotopy equivalent it. We\ndiscuss higher generalized morphisms (given by gerbes) and we conjecture the\nexistence of a smooth version of Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 15:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 17:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Among these discs, transition discs (TDs)\nare characterised by a wide cavity in the dust and gas distribution. Despite\nthis lack of material, many TDs strongly accrete onto their central star,\npossibly indicating that a mechanism is driving fast accretion in TDs cavities.\nThe presence of radially extended 'dead zones' in PPDs recently revived the\ninterest in magnetised disc winds (MDWs), where accretion is driven by a large\nmagnetic field. We propose that TDs could be subject to similar winds,\nexplaining their fast-accreting and long-lived cavities. We present the results\nof the first 2.5D global numerical simulations of TDs harbouring MDWs using the\nPLUTO code. We impose a cavity in the gas distribution and consider a power law\ndistribution for the large-scale magnetic field strength. We assume weakly\nionised discs subject to ambipolar diffusion, as expected in this range of\ndensities and temperatures. Our simulated TDs reach a steady state with an\ninner cavity and an outer 'standard' disc. The accretion rates remain\napproximately constant through the entire discs, reaching\n$10^{-7}~M_\\odot/\\text{yrs}^{-1}$ for typical surface density values. The MDW\nlaunched from the cavity is more magnetised with a much larger lever arm than\nthe MDW launched from the outer disc. The material in the cavity is accreted at\nsonic velocities, and the cavity itself is rotating at 70% of the Keplerian\nvelocity due to the efficient magnetic braking imposed by the MDW. Overall, our\ncavity matches the dynamical properties of an inner jet emitting disc (JED) and\nof magnetically arrested discs (MADs) in black hole physics. Finally, kinematic\ndiagnostics (wind speeds, orbital and accretion velocities) could disentangle\nclassical photo-evaporation from MDW models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 15:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

Therefore, a trust framework for SIoT must include\nobject-object interactions, the aspects of social relationships, credible\nrecommendations, etc., however, the existing literature has only focused on\nsome aspects of trust by primarily relying on the conventional approaches that\ngovern linear relationships between input and output. In this paper, an\nartificial neural network-based trust framework, Trust-SIoT, has been envisaged\nfor identifying the complex non-linear relationships between input and output\nin a bid to classify the trustworthy objects. Moreover, Trust-SIoT has been\ndesigned for capturing a number of key trust metrics as input, i.e., direct\ntrust by integrating both current and past interactions, reliability, and\nbenevolence of an object, credible recommendations, and the degree of\nrelationship by employing a knowledge graph embedding. Finally, we have\nperformed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Trust-SIoT\nvis-a-vis state-of-the-art heuristics on two real-world datasets.

The absence of stress labels is compensated for\nby leveraging a physics-motivated loss function based on the conservation of\nlinear momentum to guide the learning process. The constitutive model is based\non input-convex neural networks, which are capable of learning a function that\nis convex with respect to its inputs. By employing a specially designed neural\nnetwork architecture, multiple physical and thermodynamic constraints for\nhyperelastic constitutive laws, such as material frame indifference,\n(poly-)convexity, and stress-free reference configuration are automatically\nsatisfied. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately learn\nseveral hidden isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws -\nincluding e.g., Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce, Ogden, and Holzapfel models -\nwithout using stress data. For anisotropic hyperelasticity, the unknown\nanisotropic fiber directions are automatically discovered jointly with the\nconstitutive model.

In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize\nin Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the mechanisms of the\nelectrocardiogram. More than a century later, Einthoven's triangle is still at\nthe heart of ECG interpretation. It defines the axes of the ECG leads in the\nfrontal plane, that in turn, determines the axis of the cardiac electric\ndipole. The method is ubiquitously taught in lectures and applied in clinical\nsettings. But Einthoven did not provide a proof for choosing the equilateral\ntriangle.
