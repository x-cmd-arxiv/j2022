The star HIP 21152 is an accelerating\nstar as identified by the astrometry from the Gaia and Hipparcos satellites.

The\nplanner maintains a set of desirable outcomes for each realization of the\nuncertain parameter and seeks to maximize the probability that agents choose an\nacceptable outcome for the true parameter. We distinguish between stateless and\nstateful objectives. In the former, the set of desirable outcomes does not\nchange as a function of the risk parameter, whereas in the latter it does. For\nstateless objectives, we reduce the problem to maximizing the probability of\ninducing mean beliefs that lie in intervals computable from the set of\ndesirable outcomes.

The method blends information from different snapshots without\nthe need for time-resolved measurements on grounds of similarity of flow\nregions in different snapshots. The main hypothesis is that, with a\nsufficiently large ensemble of statistically-independent snapshots, the\nidentification of flow structures that are morphologically similar but\noccurring at different time instants is feasible. Measured individual vectors\nfrom different snapshots with similar flow organisation can thus be merged,\nresulting in an artificially increased particle concentration. This allows to\nrefine the interrogation region and, consequently, increase the spatial\nresolution. The measurement domain is split in subdomains. The similarity is\nenforced only on a local scale, i.e. morphologically-similar regions are sought\nonly among subdomains corresponding to the same flow region. The identification\nof locally-similar snapshots is based on unsupervised K-nearest neighbours\nsearch in a space of significant flow features. Such features are defined in\nterms of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, performed in subdomains on the\noriginal low-resolution data, obtained either with standard cross-correlation\nor with binning of Particle Tracking Velocimetry data with a relatively large\nbin size.

These effects are difficult\nto investigate, as a direct integration requires significant computational\ntime. In this paper, we apply a semi-analytic framework in conjunction with\nN-body integrations and predictive techniques to determine the relative\nhabitability for an Earth-like planet in a system with two giant companions\nover a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the\nintegrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a\nsingle Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location,\nspacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including\nconfigurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As\nlong as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the\nterrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the\nhabitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median\n($\\pm 1 \\sigma$) habitable planet has an eccentricity of 0.11 (+0.16, -0.08),\nthough it started circular. Low-mass, widely separated, and moderately\neccentric perturbing giants can accomplish this, an \"ultra-habitable\"\nconfiguration of companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 16:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 03:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Beside originating sub-band gap\nsignatures in optical spectra, optical excitons have also been predicted to\ncondensate, diffuse, recombine, relax. However, all these phenomena are rooted\non a theoretical definition of the excitonic state based on the following\nsimple picture: \"excitons\" are actual particles that both appear as peaks in\nthe linear absorption spectrum and also behave as well-defined quasiparticles.\nIn this paper we show, instead, that the electron-phonon interaction decomposes\nthe initial optical excitons into \\textit{elemental} excitons, the latter being\na different kind of bound electron-hole pairs lacking the effect caused by the\ninduced, classical, electric field.

In\nparticular, the existence of the mode known as the Free Core Nutation in the\nfluid core, is known to amplify the forced nutations in the near-diurnal\nretrograde frequency band (as measured in the planetary frame of reference).\nDue to their proximity in shape and frequency, this mode is sometimes equated\nwith the so-called Spin-Over Mode which denotes the free oscillation of a\nsteadily rotating ellipsoidal fluid core. Through a careful study of the freely\nrotating two-layer planetary model with a rigid mantle and an inviscid fluid\ncore, we show that the Spin-Over Mode frequency corresponds to that where the\nsum of the external and internal torques on the mantle are balanced, causing it\nto rotate steadily.

Therefore, in certain circumstances\nmobility measures may not describe the feasibility of the typical individual to\nchange their wealth ranking. To address this issue, we introduce mixing, a\nconcept from statistical physics, as a relevant phenomenon for quantifying the\nability of individuals to move across the whole wealth distribution. We display\nthe relationship between mixing and mobility by studying the relaxation time, a\nstatistical measure for the degree of mixing, in reallocating geometric\nBrownian motion (RGBM). RGBM is an established model of wealth in a growing and\nreallocating economy that distinguishes between a mixing and a non-mixing\nwealth dynamics regime. We show that measures of mixing are inherently\nconnected to the concept of economic mobility: while certain individuals can\nmove across the distribution when wealth is a non-mixing observable, only in\nthe mixing case every individual is able to move across the whole wealth\ndistribution. Then, there is also a direct equivalence between measures of\nmixing and the magnitude of the standard measures of economic mobility. On the\nother hand, the opposite is not true. Wealth dynamics, are however, best\nmodeled as non-mixing. Hence, measuring mobility using standard measures in a\nnon-mixing system may lead to misleading conclusions about the extent of\nmobility across the whole distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 17:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Therefore, automation through machine\nlearning (ML) classification is being increasingly proposed which would allow\nML models to learn the features of a heartbeat and detect abnormalities. The\nlack of interpretability hinders the application of Deep Learning in\nhealthcare.

This thesis builds Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers based on state-of-the-art\nmodels and compares their performance and interpretability to shallow\nclassifiers. Here, both global and local interpretability methods are exploited\nto understand the interaction between dependent and independent variables\nacross the entire dataset and to examine model decisions in each sample,\nrespectively. Partial Dependence Plots, Shapley Additive Explanations,\nPermutation Feature Importance, and Gradient Weighted Class Activation Maps\n(Grad-Cam) are the four interpretability techniques implemented on time-series\nML models classifying ECG rhythms.

These changes in cell shape may in turn affect the dynamics of\npattern-forming proteins, hence leading to an intricate feedback loop between\ncell shape and chemical dynamics. While several computational studies have\nexamined the resulting rich dynamics, the underlying mechanisms are not yet\nfully understood. To elucidate some of these mechanisms, we explore a\nconceptual model for cell polarity on a dynamic one-dimensional manifold. Using\nconcepts from differential geometry, we derive the equations governing\nmass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems on time-evolving manifolds.\nAnalyzing these equations mathematically, we show that dynamic shape changes of\nthe membrane can induce pattern-forming instabilities in parts of the membrane,\nwhich we refer to as regional instabilities. Deformations of the local membrane\ngeometry can also (regionally) suppress pattern formation and spatially shift\nalready existing patterns. We explain our findings by applying and generalizing\nthe local equilibria theory of mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems. This\nallows us to determine a simple onset criterion for geometry-induced\npattern-forming instabilities, which is linked to the phase-space structure of\nthe reaction-diffusion system. The feedback loop between membrane shape\ndeformations and reaction-diffusion dynamics then leads to a surprisingly rich\nphenomenology of patterns, including oscillations, traveling waves, and\nstanding waves that do not occur in systems with a fixed membrane shape. Our\nwork reveals that the local conformation of the membrane geometry acts as an\nimportant dynamical control parameter for pattern formation in mass-conserving\nreaction-diffusion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 17:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our method, we introduce PlasticineLab-M that extends the\nexisting differentiable physics benchmark PlasticineLab to seven new\nchallenging multi-stage soft-body manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults suggest that: 1) on multi-stage tasks that are infeasible for the\nvanilla differentiable physics solver, our approach discovers contact points\nthat efficiently guide the solver to completion; 2) on tasks where the vanilla\nsolver performs sub-optimally or near-optimally, our contact point discovery\nmethod performs better than or on par with the manipulation performance\nobtained with handcrafted contact points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 17:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Many previous works have shown impressive reconstruction\nresults on textured objects, but they still have difficulty in handling\nlow-textured planar regions, which are common in indoor scenes. An approach to\nsolving this issue is to incorporate planer constraints into the depth map\nestimation in multi-view stereo-based methods, but the per-view plane\nestimation and depth optimization lack both efficiency and multi-view\nconsistency. In this work, we show that the planar constraints can be\nconveniently integrated into the recent implicit neural representation-based\nreconstruction methods. Specifically, we use an MLP network to represent the\nsigned distance function as the scene geometry. Based on the Manhattan-world\nassumption, planar constraints are employed to regularize the geometry in floor\nand wall regions predicted by a 2D semantic segmentation network. To resolve\nthe inaccurate segmentation, we encode the semantics of 3D points with another\nMLP and design a novel loss that jointly optimizes the scene geometry and\nsemantics in 3D space.

Previous\nstudies on traffic accident hot spots have mostly adopted spatial statistics\nand Geographic Information Systems (GIS) where spatial point patterns are\ndiscovered based only on spatial dependence with no recognition of the temporal\ndependence of the events. A limitation arises from the fact that the results\nare either under or over-estimated because of the temporal aggregation of the\nevents to an absolute time point. Furthermore, the existing methods apart from\nthe Network Kernel Density Estimation (NETKDE), consider traffic accident\nevents as events randomly on a 2-D geographic space. However, traffic accident\nevents are network constrained events that happens majorly on the road network\nspace. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the connectivity of graph on a\nnetwork space approach that identifies accident high risk-locations based on\nspace-time-varying connectivity between traffic accident events and the road\nnetwork geometry. A simple but extensible traffic accident space time-varying\ngraph (STVG) model is developed and implemented for this study.

Our model for the torque density\nis based on existing fitting formulas, which we subsequently modify to prevent\npremature gap-opening. At higher planetary masses, we also apply torque\ndensities from hydrodynamic simulations directly to our 1D model. These torque\ndensities allow modelling the orbital evolution of an initially low-mass planet\nthat undergoes runaway-accretion to become a massive planet. The two-way\nexchange of angular momentum between disc and planet is included. This leads to\na self-consistent treatment of gap formation that only relies on directly\naccessible disc parameters.

During the resulting 0.7 d\nspin-orbit beat period, the light curve phased on the spin modulation\nalternates between being single- and double-humped. We explore two possible\nexplanations for this behavior: the accretion flow being diverted from one of\nthe poles for part of the beat cycle, or an eclipse of the emitting region\nresponsible for the second hump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

As a result, the surface temperature of the magma ocean\nmay range from 3000~K near the sub-stellar point down to 1500~K near the\nday-night terminator. We use simple models incorporating the thermodynamics and\ngeochemistry of partial melt to predict the physical and chemical properties of\nthe magma ocean as a function of the distance from the sub-stellar point. Our\ntwo principal findings are that 1) the dayside magma ocean is much deeper than\npreviously thought, probably extending down to the core-mantle boundary in some\nlocations, and 2) much of the dayside is only partially molten, leading to\ngradients in the surface chemistry of the magma ocean.

However, it is still unclear to what\nextent such approaches generalize in zero-shot conditions. The recent BEIR\nbenchmark provides partial answers to this question by comparing models on\ndatasets and tasks that differ from the training conditions. We aim to address\nthe same question by comparing models under more explicit distribution shifts.\nTo this end, we build three query-based distribution shifts within MS MARCO\n(query-semantic, query-intent, query-length), which are used to evaluate the\nthree main families of neural retrievers based on BERT: sparse, dense, and\nlate-interaction -- as well as a monoBERT re-ranker. We further analyse the\nperformance drops between the train and test query distributions. In\nparticular, we experiment with two generalization indicators: the first one\nbased on train/test query vocabulary overlap, and the second based on\nrepresentations of a trained bi-encoder. Intuitively, those indicators verify\nthat the further away the test set is from the train one, the worse the drop in\nperformance. We also show that models respond differently to the shifts --\ndense approaches being the most impacted. Overall, our study demonstrates that\nit is possible to design more controllable distribution shifts as a tool to\nbetter understand generalization of IR models. Finally, we release the MS MARCO\nquery subsets, which provide an additional resource to benchmark zero-shot\ntransfer in Information Retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 13:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

In this work, we\nassess the degree of contamination by intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8)\nexpected for z>6 galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on\n~176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8 in a ~0.7 deg2 area selected from the\nUltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and ~96,000 mock galaxies with 25.3$\\leq$H<27.0,\nwhich altogether cover the range of magnitudes to be probed in the Euclid Deep\nSurvey. We simulate Euclid and ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band\nphotometry, and fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to various\ncombinations of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates that identifying\nz>6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z>6 recovery of\n91(88)% for bright (faint) galaxies. For the UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the\npercentage of z=1-5.8 contaminants amongst apparent z>6 galaxies as observed\nwith Euclid alone is 18%, which is reduced to 4(13)% by including ultra-deep\nRubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint mock sample, the\ncontamination fraction with Euclid alone is considerably higher at 39%, and\nminimized to 7% when including ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like\nbright galaxies, we find that Euclid (I-Y)>2.8 and (Y-J)<1.4 colour criteria\ncan separate contaminants from true z>6 galaxies, although these are applicable\nto only 54% of the contaminants, as many have unconstrained (I-Y) colours. In\nthe most optimistic scenario, these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to\n1% whilst preserving 81% of the fiducial z>6 sample. For the faint mock sample,\ncolour cuts are infeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 17:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 12:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Strong-coupling polarons form when electronic charge carriers become\nself-trapped: bound within potential wells stabilized by carriers presence.\nDistinctively, exciting these bound carriers generates broad absorption bands.\nStrong-coupling polarons are slow and massive since moving them requires atomic\nmotion. Their transport differs qualitatively from that of conventional\nelectronic charge carriers. Large (strong-coupling) polarons move coherently\nwith mobilities that fall with rising temperature. These massive quasiparticles\nvery weak scatterings by phonons produce much lower room-temperature mobilities\nthan those permitted of conventional electronic charge carriers. Moreover, the\nlong scattering times associated with large polarons weak scattering relegates\ntheir principal ac (Drude) transport to below phonon frequencies. Small\n(strong-coupling) polarons move incoherently with even lower thermally assisted\nmobilities. Strikingly, a magnetic field often deflects small polarons in the\nopposite sense than it does conventional charge carriers, thereby producing\nanomalously signed Hall Effects. In exceptional circumstances charge carriers\nself-trap in pairs thereby forming large and small bipolarons. Some transport\nfeatures distinguish them from polarons. Interference between carrier-induced\natomic displacement patterns produce attractive interactions between\nlike-charged polarons and short-range repulsive interactions between oppositely\ncharged polarons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

It first detects\nconstituents of the extractions and then links them to build extractions. We\ntrain our system on compact extractions obtained by processing existing\nbenchmarks. Our experiments on CaRB and Wire57 datasets indicate that CompactIE\nfinds 1.5x-2x more compact extractions than previous systems, with high\nprecision, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in OpenIE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 22:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

The framework is based on reducing\nthe neural aspect to a prediction of a matrix for a single given point,\nconditioned on a global shape descriptor. The field of matrices is then\nprojected onto the tangent bundle of the given mesh, and used as candidate\njacobians for the predicted map.

FL allows the clients to participate\nin the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their\nlocal data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead,\nwhere the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central\nserver at each global training round. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has\nbeen recently proposed to alleviate the communication bottleneck where the\nmodel updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple-access channel.\nHowever, simple averaging of the model updates via AirComp makes the learning\nprocess vulnerable to random or intended modifications of the local model\nupdates of some Byzantine clients. In this paper, we propose a transmission and\naggregation framework to reduce the effect of such attacks while preserving the\nbenefits of AirComp for FL. For the proposed robust approach, the central\nserver divides the participating clients randomly into groups and allocates a\ntransmission time slot for each group. The updates of the different groups are\nthen aggregated using a robust aggregation technique. We extend our approach to\nhandle the case of non-i.i.d. local data, where a resampling step is added\nbefore robust aggregation.

Our goal in this paper is to\nresolve this issue.\n  We show that when a continuous family of semi-algebraic separating invariants\nis available, separation can be obtained by randomly selecting 2D+1 of these\ninvariants. We apply this methodology to obtain an efficient scheme for\ncomputing separating invariants for several classical group actions which have\nbeen studied in the invariant learning literature. Examples include matrix\nmultiplication actions on point clouds by permutations, rotations, and various\nother linear groups.\n  Often the requirement of invariant separation is relaxed and only generic\nseparation is required. In this case, we show that only D+1 invariants are\nrequired. More importantly, generic invariants are often significantly easier\nto compute, as we illustrate by discussing generic and full separation for\nweighted graphs. Finally we outline an approach for proving that separating\ninvariants can be constructed also when the random parameters have finite\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 22:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 21:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

It thus enables efficient geometry processing algorithms\nspecifically designed for convex shapes and has been widely used in game\nengines, physics simulations, and animation. While prior works can capture the\nglobal structure of input shapes, they may fail to preserve fine-grained\ndetails (e.g., filling a toaster's slots), which are critical for retaining the\nfunctionality of objects in interactive environments. In this paper, we propose\na novel method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches from three\nperspectives: (a) We introduce a novel collision-aware concavity metric that\nexamines the distance between a shape and its convex hull from both the\nboundary and the interior. The proposed concavity preserves collision\nconditions and is more robust to detect various approximation errors. (b) We\ndecompose shapes by directly cutting meshes with 3D planes. It ensures\ngenerated convex hulls are intersection-free and avoids voxelization errors.\n(c) Instead of using a one-step greedy strategy, we propose employing a\nmulti-step tree search to determine the cutting planes, which leads to a\nglobally better solution and avoids unnecessary cuttings. Through extensive\nevaluation on a large-scale articulated object dataset, we show that our method\ngenerates decompositions closer to the original shape with fewer components. It\nthus supports delicate and efficient object interaction in downstream\napplications.

This prompts a natural question: how to protect sensed\ndata even if all software on the device is compromised? Ideally, in order to\nachieve this, sensed data must be protected from its genesis, i.e., from the\ntime when a physical analog quantity is converted into its digital counterpart\nand becomes accessible to software.

This is further exacerbated by the fact that\nincreasing the number of parameters leads to larger degradation in utility with\nDP. In this work, we zoom in on the ImageNet dataset and demonstrate that,\nsimilar to the non-private case, pre-training over-parameterized models on a\nlarge public dataset can lead to substantial gains when the model is finetuned\nprivately.

We believe this is a prerequisite for\nthe provision of surgical feedback and modulation of surgeon performance in\npursuit of improved patient outcomes. To holistically quantify surgeries, we\npropose a unified deep learning framework, entitled Roboformer, which operates\nexclusively on videos recorded during surgery to independently achieve multiple\ntasks: surgical phase recognition (the what of surgery), gesture classification\nand skills assessment (the how of surgery). We validated our framework on four\nvideo-based datasets of two commonly-encountered types of steps (dissection and\nsuturing) within minimally-invasive robotic surgeries. We demonstrated that our\nframework can generalize well to unseen videos, surgeons, medical centres, and\nsurgical procedures. We also found that our framework, which naturally lends\nitself to explainable findings, identified relevant information when achieving\na particular task.

Such data may be represented by graphs,\nwhere nodes represent time-series, and edges directed causal influence scores\nbetween them. If the number of nodes exceeds the number of temporal\nobservations, conventional methods, such as standard Granger causality, are of\nlimited value, because estimating free parameters of time-series predictors\nlead to underdetermined problems. A typical example for this situation is\nfunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where the number of nodal\nobservations is large, usually ranging from $10^2$ to $10^5$ time-series, while\nthe number of temporal observations is low, usually less than $10^3$. Hence,\ninnovative approaches are required to address the challenges arising from such\ndata sets.

To tackle these issues, a gradient-sensitive alternate framework with\nvariable ansatz is proposed in this paper to enhance the performance of the\nVQE.

It applies to systems whose set of initial\nconfigurations is regular, and whose transition relation is captured by a\nlength-preserving transducer. To verify safety properties, regular model\nchecking iteratively computes automata recognizing increasingly larger regular\nsets of reachable configurations, and checks if they contain unsafe\nconfigurations. Since this procedure often does not terminate, acceleration,\nabstraction, and widening techniques have been developed to compute a regular\nsuperset of the set of reachable configurations.\n  In this paper we develop a complementary approach. Instead of approaching the\nset of reachable configurations from below, we start with the set of all\nconfigurations and compute increasingly smaller regular supersets of it. We use\nthat the set of reachable configurations is equal to the intersection of all\ninductive invariants of the system. Since the intersection is in general\nnon-regular, we introduce $b$-bounded invariants, defined as those\nrepresentable by CNF-formulas with at most $b$ clauses. We prove that, for\nevery $b \\geq 0$, the intersection of all $b$-bounded inductive invariants is\nregular, and show how to construct an automaton recognizing it. We study the\ncomplexity of deciding if this automaton accepts some unsafe configuration. We\nshow that the problem is in \\textsc{EXPSPACE} for every $b \\geq 0$, and\n\\textsc{PSPACE}-complete for $b=1$.

In the pre-implementation stage of the SD-AETO scheme, a service\ndeployment scheme is invoked to assist with task offloading considering each\nservice's popularity. The optimal service deployment scheme is obtained by\nusing the approximate deployment graph (AD-graph). Furthermore, a task\nscheduling and queue offloading design procedure is proposed to complete the\nSD-AETO scheme based on the task priority. The task priority is generated by\nthe corresponding service popularity and task offloading direction.

However, existing\ndiversity techniques are resource-inefficient due to orthogonal resource usage,\nor they have high-power consumption due to multiple antennas and RF-chains\nwhich present an insurmountable constraint for small devices. To address this,\nthis letter proposes a novel resource-efficient diversity technique called\npower-time channel diversity (PTCD). In PTCD, interleaved copies of the\nbaseband symbols are transmitted simultaneously with weighted power\ncoefficients. The PTCD provides a diversity order of the number of copies by\nimplementing successive interference canceler at the receiver. To achieve this\ndiversity, no additional resources are needed; hence, spectral efficient\ncommunication is guaranteed. Additionally, the power consumption at the\ntransceivers is limited since the PTCD requires only one RF-chain.

Firms are spread among sectors but may shift between\nsectors to improve their returns. They compete by producing differentiated\ngoods and reward their investors by paying dividends and through their stocks'\nvaluation. Investors invest in firms and move along sectors based on firms'\nexpected long-run returns.The field-formalism model derived from this framework\nallows for collective states to emerge. We show that the number of firms in\neach sector depends on the aggregate financial capital invested in the sector\nand its firms' expected long-term returns. Capital accumulation in each sector\ndepends both on short-term returns and expected long-term returns relative to\nneighbouring sectors.For each sector, three patterns of accumulation emerge. In\nthe first pattern, the dividend component of short-term returns is determinant\nfor sectors with small number of firms and low capital. In the second pattern,\nboth short and long-term returns in the sector drive intermediate-to-high\ncapital. In the third pattern, higher expectations of long-term returns drive\nmassive inputs of capital.Instability in capital accumulation may arise among\nand within sectors. We therefore widen our approach and study the dynamics of\nthe collective configurations, in particular interactions between average\ncapital and expected long-term returns, and show that overall stability\ncrucially depends on the expectations' formation process.Expectations that are\nhighly reactive to capital variations stabilize high capital configurations,\nand drive low-to-moderate capital sectors towards zero or a higher level of\ncapital, depending on their initial capital. Inversely, low-to moderate capital\nconfigurations are stabilized by expectations moderately reactive to capital\nvariations, and drive high capital sectors towards more moderate level of\ncapital equilibria.Eventually, the combination of expectations both highly\nsensitive to exogenous conditions and highly reactive to variations in capital\nimply that large fluctuations of capital in the system, at the possible expense\nof the real economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 09:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

Along our\nway, we study how Lipschitz maps carry the support of elements in free spaces\nand also we provide stronger conditions on $f$ which ensure that $\\widehat{f}$\nis injective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 09:17:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 07:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 14:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 14:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Modern wearables capture dynamic real-world data which could\nimprove fitness prediction. In this work, we design algorithms and models that\nconvert raw wearable sensor data into cardiorespiratory fitness estimates.

In such a setting, the\nperformance of a standard economic MPC scheme without terminal conditions can\ngenerally be far from optimal even with arbitrarily long prediction horizons.\nWhereas there are modified economic MPC schemes that guarantee optimal\nperformance, all of them are based on prior knowledge of the optimal period\nlength or of the optimal periodic orbit itself. In contrast to these\napproaches, we propose to achieve optimality by multiplying the stage cost by a\nlinear discount factor. This modification is not only easy to implement but\nalso independent of any system- or cost-specific properties, making the scheme\nrobust against online changes therein. Under standard dissipativity and\ncontrollability assumptions, we can prove that the resulting linearly\ndiscounted economic MPC without terminal conditions achieves optimal asymptotic\naverage performance up to an error that vanishes with growing prediction\nhorizons. Moreover, we can guarantee practical asymptotic stability of the\noptimal periodic orbit under the additional technical assumption that\ndissipativity holds with a continuous storage function.

Although numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches are\nproposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the\nindustry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the\nlimitation of the task-specific pre-trained DNNs. Among the prior-free stereo\nmatching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none GPU\nenvironment for MIS. This paper proposes the first CPU-level real-time\nprior-free stereo matching algorithm for general MIS tasks. We achieve an\naverage 17 Hz on 640*480 images with a single-core CPU (i5-9400) for surgical\nimages. Meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular ELAS.\nThe patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified\nstereo images. A coarse-to-fine Bayesian probability and a spatial Gaussian\nmixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different\nscales. An optional probability density function estimation algorithm was\nadopted to quantify the prediction variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated\nthe proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the\ntextureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-Lambertian\nreflectance and dark illumination. The estimated probability managed to balance\nthe confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. It has\nsimilar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline ELAS in MIS,\nwhile it is 4-5 times faster.

In this work, we leverage this intuition and opt for\nmaintaining an individual classifier for each subclass. Technically, we design\na multi-prototype classifier, each prototype serves as the classifier weights\nfor one subclass. To enable effective updating of multi-prototype classifier\nweights, we propose two constraints respectively for updating the prototypes\nw.r.t. all point features and for encouraging the learning of diverse\nprototypes. Experiments on weakly supervised 3D point cloud segmentation tasks\nvalidate the efficacy of proposed method in particular at low-label regime.

Although VQA in computer\nvision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still\nin its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially\nconsidered for the RSVQA task. 1) No object annotations are available in RSVQA\ndatasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region\nrepresentation; 2) There are questions with clearly different difficulty levels\nfor each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a\nrandom order may confuse the model and limit the performance. To address these\ntwo problems, in this paper, a multi-level visual feature learning method is\nproposed to jointly extract language-guided holistic and regional image\nfeatures. Besides, a self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL)-based VQA model is\ndeveloped to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. To be more\nspecific, a language-guided SPCL method with a soft weighting strategy is\nexplored in this work.

We examined this hypothesis and present 3D\nsimulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) performed with the {\\sc\nPencil Code}. We modeled the stellar dynamo for a solar-mass star with angular\nvelocities of 20 and 30 times solar. We included and varied the strength of the\ncentrifugal force and compared the results with reference simulations without\nthe centrifugal force and with a simulation in which its effect is enhanced.\nThe centrifugal force causes perturbations in the evolution of the numerical\nmodel, so that the outcome in the details becomes different as a result of\nnonlinear evolution. While the average density profile is unaffected by the\ncentrifugal force, a relative change in the density difference between high\nlatitudes and the equator of $\\sim10^{-4}$ is found. The power spectrum of the\nconvective velocity is found to be more sensitive to the angular velocity than\nto the strength of the centrifugal force. The quadrupole moment of the stars\nincludes a fluctuating and a time-independent component, which vary with the\nrotation rate. As very similar behavior is produced in absence of the\ncentrifugal force, we conclude that it is not the main ingredient for producing\nthe time-averaged and fluctuating quadrupole moment of the star. In a real\nphysical system, we thus expect contributions from both components, that is,\nfrom the time-dependent gravitational force from the variation in the\nquadrupole term and from the spin-orbit coupling that is due to the persistent\npart of the quadrupole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 12:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 11:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Phyllosilicate minerals,\nwhich are a class of natural and abundant LMs, have been recently considered as\na low-cost source of insulating nanomaterials. Within this family an almost\nbarely explored material emerges: phlogopite [KMg3(AlSi3)O10(OH)2]. Here we\ncarry out a high throughput characterization of this LM by employing several\nexperimental techniques, corroborating the major findings with first-principles\ncalculations. We show that monolayers (1L) and few-layers of this material are\nair and temperature stable, as well as easily obtained by the standard\nmechanical exfoliation technique, have an atomically flat surface, and lower\nbandgap than its bulk counterpart, an unusual trend in LMs. We also\nsystematically study the basic properties of ultrathin phlogopite and\ndemonstrate that natural phlogopite presents iron impurities in its crystal\nlattice, which decreases its bandgap from about 7 eV to 3.6 eV. Finally, we\ncombine phlogopite crystals with 1L-WS2 in ultrathin van der Waals\nheterostructures and present a photoluminescence study, revealing a significant\nenhancement on the 1L-WS2 optical quality (i.e., higher recombination\nefficiency through neutral excitons) similarly to that obtained on 1L-WS2/hBN\nheterostructures. Our proof-of-concept study shows that phlogopite should be\nregarded as a good and promising candidate for LM-based applications as a\nlow-cost layered nanomaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 12:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to directly\ncompare the impact of differentially private training on two different neural\nnetwork architectures, DenseNet121 and ResNet50.

Time\nseries of intensity images of a large sunspot in AR 10634 acquired with the\nSwedish Solar Telescope in the G band and red continuum are analysed. The two\nsimultaneous time series last six hours and five minutes. Horizontal motions of\npenumbral grains (PGs), structures in dark bodies of filaments, the outer\npenumbral border, and G-band bright points are measured in time slices that\ncover the whole width of the penumbra and the neighbouring granulation. The\nspatial and temporal resolutions are 90 km and 20.1 s, respectively. In the\ninner penumbra, PGs move toward the umbra (inwards) with a mean speed of -0.7\nkm s-1. The direction of motion changes from inwards to outwards at\napproximately 60% of the penumbral width and the mean speed increases gradually\nin the outer penumbra, approaching 0.5 km/s. This speed is also typical of an\nexpansion of the penumbra-granulation border during periods that typically last\none hour and are followed by a fast contraction. The majority of the G-band\nbright points moves away from the sunspot, with a typical speed of 0.6 km/s.\nHigh outward speeds, 3.6 km/s on average, are observed in dark bodies of\npenumbral filaments. According to the model of penumbral filaments, it is\nsuggested that the speeds detected in the dark bodies of filaments are\nassociated with the Evershed flow and that the opposite directions of PG\nmotions in the inner and outer penumbrae may be explained by the interaction of\nrising plasma in filament heads with a surrounding, differently inclined\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 12:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In this joint\ntheory and experimental work, we demonstrate that ultrafast helicity-dependent\nsoft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HXAS) allows access to spin-, time- and\nenergy specific state occupation after optical excitation.

We perform\nextensive simulations of LAAs using the Kundur two-area system (KTAS) power\nnetwork while employing the rare-event sampler. The results help us identify\nthe victim nodes from which the attacker can launch the most impactful attacks\nand provide insights into how the spatial distribution of LAAs triggers the\nactivation of ERs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 13:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

A VI involves finding $x^\\star \\in \\mathcal{X}$ such that\n$\\langle F(x), x - x^\\star\\rangle \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and we\nconsider the setting in which $F: \\mathbb{R}^d \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^d$ is smooth\nwith up to $(p-1)^{th}$-order derivatives. For $p = 2$, the cubic regularized\nNewton's method has been extended to VIs with a global rate of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-1})$. An improved rate of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2/3}\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ can be obtained via an alternative\nsecond-order method, but this method requires a nontrivial line-search\nprocedure as an inner loop. Similarly, high-order methods based on similar\nline-search procedures have been shown to achieve a rate of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)}\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon))$, but the inner loop requires\nfine-tuning of parameters and can be computationally complex.

Recently, SDSS J143016.05+230344.4 (J1430+2303) was reported to be a\nsupermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the final coalescence phase. It is\nprobably the first SMBHB coalescence event observable in human history. Radio\nobservations of J1430+2303 before and after coalescence will provide a unique\ndiagnosis of the energetics and environment of the SMBHB.\n  Aims. We explore the radio emission from the galactic nucleus region that is\nclosely related to the current X-ray and optical activities and helps to\nunderstand the state of black hole accretion and outflow before coalescence.\n  Methods. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method\nthat offers milli-arcsecond-level high resolution that can exclude the\ncontamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed J1430+2303\nwith the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array\nat 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022.\n  Results. A compact component is detected in all three VLBI images. It has a\nbrightness temperature of > 10^8 K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8\npc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent\nwith large opening-angle outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact\ncomponent might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60% of the emission is resolved by\nVLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities, the outer\nlayers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow\nline region.\n  Conclusions. Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts.\nOur observations provide pre-coalescence radio data that are an important\nreference for future comparative studies with the post-merger. In particular,\nfurther resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical features\nassociated with inspiralling binary black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 13:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Regular monitoring by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory\nbegan promptly, on August 9.9 (0.37 day after the optical peak), and continued\nuntil the source passed behind the Sun at the start of November, 86 days later.\nObservations then restarted on day 197, once RS Oph emerged from the Sun\nconstraint. This makes RS Oph the first Galactic recurrent nova to have been\nmonitored by Swift throughout two eruptions. Here we investigate the extensive\nX-ray datasets from 2006 and 2021, as well as the more limited data collected\nby EXOSAT in 1985. The hard X-rays arising from shock interactions between the\nnova ejecta and red giant wind are similar following the last two eruptions. In\ncontrast, the early super-soft source (SSS) in 2021 was both less variable and\nsignificantly fainter than in 2006. However, 0.3-1 keV light-curves from 2021\nreveal a 35 s quasi-periodic oscillation consistent in frequency with the 2006\ndata. The Swift X-ray spectra from 2021 are featureless, with the soft emission\ntypically being well parametrized by a simple blackbody, while the 2006 spectra\nshowed much stronger evidence for superimposed ionized absorption edges.\nConsidering the data after day 60 following each eruption, during the supersoft\nphase the 2021 spectra are hotter, with smaller effective radii and lower wind\nabsorption, leading to an apparently reduced bolometric luminosity. We explore\npossible explanations for the gross differences in observed SSS behaviour\nbetween the 2006 and 2021 outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 13:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

This development, called resource theory of asymmetry, is expected to\nhave a wide range of applications, from accurate time measurements to black\nhole physics. Despite its importance, the foundation of resource theory of\nasymmetry still has room for expansion. An important problem is in quantifying\nthe amount of resource. When the symmetry prescribed U(1), i.e., with a single\nconserved quantity, the quantum Fisher information is known as a resource\nmeasure that has suitable properties and a clear physical meaning related to\nquantum fluctuation of the conserved quantity. However, it is not clear what is\nthe resource measure with such suitable properties when a general symmetry\nprevails for which there are multiple conserved quantities. The purpose of this\npaper is to fill this gap. Specifically, we show that the quantum Fisher\ninformation matrix is a resource measure whenever a connected linear Lie group\ndescribes the symmetry. We also consider the physical meaning of this matrix\nand see which properties that the quantum Fisher information has when the\nsymmetry is described by $U(1)$ can be inherited by the quantum Fisher\ninformation matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 14:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

Score following is a challenging\ntask, especially when considering deviations in performance data from the score\nstemming from mistakes or expressive choices.\n  In this project, the extensive research present in the field is first\nexplored before two open-source evaluation testbenches for score following--one\nquantitative and the other qualitative--are introduced. A new way of obtaining\nquantitative testbench data is proposed, and the QualScofo dataset for\nqualitative benchmarking is introduced. Subsequently, three different score\nfollowers, each of a different class, are implemented. First, a beat-based\nfollower for an interactive conductor application--the TuneApp Conductor--is\ncreated to demonstrate an entertaining application of score following. Then, an\nApproximate String Matching (ASM) non-real-time follower is implemented to\ncomplement the quantitative testbench and provide more technical background\ndetails of score following. Finally, a Constant Q-Transform (CQT) Dynamic Time\nWarping (DTW) score follower robust against major challenges in score following\n(such as polyphonic music and performance deviations) is outlined and\nimplemented; it is shown that this CQT-based approach consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms a commonly used FFT-based approach in extracting\naudio features for score following.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 14:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

We find that\ncommunities that adopted post approvals tended to do so following sudden\nincreases in user activity (e.g., comments) and moderation (e.g., reported\nposts). This adoption of post approvals led to fewer but higher-quality posts.\nThough fewer posts were shared after adoption, not only did community members\nwrite more comments, use more reactions, and spend more time on the posts that\nwere shared, they also reported these posts less. Further, post approvals did\nnot significantly increase the average time leaders spent in the group, though\ngroups that enabled the setting tended to appoint more leaders. Last, the\nimpact of post approvals varied with both group size and how the setting was\nused, e.g.,, group size mediates whether leaders spent more or less time in the\ngroup following the adoption of the setting.

Traditionally, such programs are\nwritten in low-level machine-oriented programming languages like C or Assembly.\nWe present an alternative by introducing Synchron, an API that offers\nhigh-level abstractions to the programmer while supporting the low-level\ninfrastructure in an associated runtime system and one-time-effort drivers.\nEmbedded systems applications exhibit the general characteristics of being (i)\nconcurrent, (ii) I/O-bound and (iii) timing-aware. To address each of these\nconcerns, the Synchron API consists of three components: (1) a Concurrent ML\n(CML) inspired message-passing concurrency model, (2) a message-passing--based\nI/O interface that translates between low-level interrupt based and\nmemory-mapped peripherals, and (3) a timing operator, $syncT$, that marries\nCML's $sync$ operator with timing windows inspired from the TinyTimber kernel.\nWe implement the Synchron API as the bytecode instructions of a virtual machine\ncalled SynchronVM. SynchronVM hosts a Caml-inspired functional language as its\nfrontend language, and the backend of the VM supports the STM32F4 and NRF52\nmicrocontrollers, with RAM in the order of hundreds of kilobytes. We illustrate\nthe expressiveness of the Synchron API by showing examples of expressing state\nmachines commonly found in embedded systems.

This is currently done in the literature either using\nspecial-purpose radar sensors, or interrupting communications to transmit\ndedicated sensing waveforms, entailing high overhead and channel utilization.\nIn this work we present SPARCS, an integrated human sensing and communication\nsolution for mmWave systems. SPARCS is the first method that reconstructs high\nquality signatures of human movement from irregular and sparse CIR samples,\nsuch as the ones obtained during communication traffic patterns. To accomplish\nthis, we formulate the micro-Doppler extraction as a sparse recovery problem,\nwhich is critical to enable a smooth integration between communication and\nsensing. Moreover, if needed, our system can seamlessly inject short CIR\nestimation fields into the channel whenever communication traffic is absent or\ninsufficient for the micro-Doppler extraction. SPARCS effectively leverages the\nintrinsic sparsity of the mmWave channel, thus drastically reducing the sensing\noverhead with respect to available approaches. We implemented SPARCS on an IEEE\n802.11ay Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform working in the 60 GHz band,\ncollecting standard-compliant CIR traces matching the traffic patterns of real\nWiFi access points. Our results show that the micro-Doppler signatures obtained\nby SPARCS enable a typical downstream application such as human activity\nrecognition with more than 7 times lower overhead with respect to existing\nmethods, while achieving better recognition performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 14:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

However, it is difficult to detect it in observations. The\nidentification of galaxy or cluster properties correlated with the formation\ntime of the halo at fixed halo mass and the ability to select galaxy clusters\nfree from projection effects are the two most significant hurdles in the\nobservational detection of halo assembly bias. The latter, in particular, can\ncause a misleading detection of halo assembly bias by boosting the amplitude of\nlensing and clustering on large scales. This study uses twelve different\nproperties of central galaxies of SDSS redMaPPer clusters derived from\nspectroscopy to divide the clusters into sub-samples. We test the dependence of\nthe clustering amplitude on these properties at fixed richness. We first infer\nhalo mass and bias using weak lensing signals around the clusters using shapes\nof galaxies from the SDSS survey. We validate the bias difference between the\ntwo subsamples using cluster-galaxy cross-correlations. This methodology allows\nus to decouple the contamination due to the projection effects from the halo\nassembly bias signals. We do not find any significant evidence of a difference\nin the clustering amplitudes correlated with any of our explored properties.\nOur results indicate that central galaxy properties may not correlate\nsignificantly with the halo assembly histories at fixed richness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 15:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 06:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Aims: Our main goal is to search for methanol masers in the central\nmolecular zone (CMZ; inner 500 pc) of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253.\nMethods: Covering a frequency range between 84 and 373 GHz ($\\lambda$ = 3.6 to\n0.8 mm) at high angular (1.6\"$\\sim$27 pc) and spectral ($\\sim$8--9 km s$^{-1}$)\nresolution with the ALMA large program ALCHEMI, we have probed different\nregions across the CMZ of NGC 253. In order to look for methanol maser\ncandidates, we employed the rotation diagram method and a set of radiative\ntransfer models. Results: We detect for the first time masers above 84 GHz in\nNGC 253, covering an ample portion of the $J_{-1}\\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$\nline series (at 84, 132, 229, and 278 GHz) and the $J_{0}\\rightarrow(J-$\n1)$_{1}-A$ series (at 95, 146, and 198 GHz). This confirms the presence of the\nClass I maser line at 84 GHz, already reported but now being detected in more\nthan one location. For the $J_{-1}\\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, we\nobserve a lack of Class I maser candidates in the central star-forming disk.\nConclusions: The physical conditions for maser excitation in the\n$J_{-1}\\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series can be weak shocks and\ncloud-cloud collisions as suggested by shock tracers (SiO and HNCO) in\nbi-symmetric shock/active regions located in the outskirts of the CMZ. On the\nother hand, the presence of photodissociation regions due to a high\nstar-formation rate would be needed to explain the lack of Class I masers in\nthe very central regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 15:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

However, transportation planners often overlook transit\ninvestments in neighbourhoods with \"transit-captive\" populations because they\nare assumed to result in less mode-shifting, congestion relief, and\nenvironmental benefits, compared to investments that aim to attract choice\nriders in wealthier communities. In North American cities, while many\nlow-income households are already transit users, some also own and use private\nvehicles. It suggests that transit improvements in low-income communities could\nindeed result in more transit use and less car use. Accordingly, the main\nobjective of this article is to explore the statistical relationship between\ntransit use and transit accessibility as well as how this varies by household\nincome and vehicle ownership in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA).\nUsing stratified regression models, we find that low-income households with one\nor more cars per adult have the most elastic relationship between transit\naccessibility and transit use; they are more likely to be transit riders if\ntransit improves. However, we confirm that in auto-centric areas with poor\ntransit, the transit use of low-income households drops off sharply as car\nownership increases. On the other hand, a sensitivity analysis suggests more\nopportunities for increasing transit ridership among car-deficit households\nwhen transit is improved. These findings indicate that improving transit in\nlow-income inner suburbs, where most low-income car-owning households are\nliving, would align social with environmental planning goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 20:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Since brain networks derived from\nfunctional and structural MRI describe the brain topology from different\nperspectives, exploring a representation that combines these cross-modality\nbrain networks is non-trivial. Most current studies aim to extract a fused\nrepresentation of the two types of brain network by projecting the structural\nnetwork to the functional counterpart.

To meet users'\never-increasing demand, some other operators (e.g., Fon) have been developing\nanother crowdsourced WiFi network to combine many users' home WiFi access\npoints and provide enlarged WiFi coverage to them. While the 5G network\nexperiences negative network externality, the crowdsourced WiFi network helps\noffload traffic from 5G and its service coverage exhibits positive externality\nwith its subscription number. To our best knowledge, we are the first to\ninvestigate how these two heterogeneous networks of diverse network\nexternalities co-exist from an economic perspective.
