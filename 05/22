Deep neural networks can solve some of the most complex\npattern-recognition problems today, but come with the price of massive compute\nand memory requirements. This makes the problem of deploying such large-scale\nneural networks challenging in resource-constrained mobile edge computing\nplatforms, specifically in mission-critical domains like surveillance and\nhealthcare. To solve this, a promising solution is to split resource-hungry\nneural networks into lightweight disjoint smaller components for pipelined\ndistributed processing. At present, there are two main approaches to do this:\nsemantic and layer-wise splitting. The former partitions a neural network into\nparallel disjoint models that produce a part of the result, whereas the latter\npartitions into sequential models that produce intermediate results. However,\nthere is no intelligent algorithm that decides which splitting strategy to use\nand places such modular splits to edge nodes for optimal performance. To combat\nthis, this work proposes a novel AI-driven online policy, SplitPlace, that uses\nMulti-Armed-Bandits to intelligently decide between layer and semantic\nsplitting strategies based on the input task's service deadline demands.\nSplitPlace places such neural network split fragments on mobile edge devices\nusing decision-aware reinforcement learning for efficient and scalable\ncomputing. Moreover, SplitPlace fine-tunes its placement engine to adapt to\nvolatile environments. Our experiments on physical mobile-edge environments\nwith real-world workloads show that SplitPlace can significantly improve the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of average response time, deadline violation rate,\ninference accuracy, and total reward by up to 46, 69, 3 and 12 percent\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 16:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Despite great\nefforts invested in creation and maintenance, even the largest KGs are far from\ncomplete. Hence, KG completion (KGC) has become one of the most crucial tasks\nfor KG research. Recently, considerable literature in this space has centered\naround the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn powerful embeddings\nwhich leverage topological structures in the KGs. Specifically, dedicated\nefforts have been made to extend GNNs, which are commonly designed for simple\nhomogeneous and uni-relational graphs, to the KG context which has diverse and\nmulti-relational connections between entities, by designing more complex\naggregation schemes over neighboring nodes (crucial to GNN performance) to\nappropriately leverage multi-relational information. The success of these\nmethods is naturally attributed to the use of GNNs over simpler multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) models, owing to their additional aggregation functionality.\nIn this work, we find that surprisingly, simple MLP models are able to achieve\ncomparable performance to GNNs, suggesting that aggregation may not be as\ncrucial as previously believed.

Our method takes an\ninput agent with optional simple constraints such as leg parts that should not\nevolve or allowed ranges of changes. It uses physics-based simulation to\ndetermine its locomotion and finds a behavior policy for the input design,\nlater used as a baseline for comparison. The agent is then randomly modified\nwithin the allowed ranges creating a new generation of several hundred agents.\nThe generation is trained by transferring the previous policy, which\nsignificantly speeds up the training. The best-performing agents are selected,\nand a new generation is formed using their crossover and mutations. The next\ngenerations are then trained until satisfactory results are reached. We show a\nwide variety of evolved agents, and our results show that even with only 10% of\nchanges, the overall performance of the evolved agents improves 50%.

The resulting stable\n$E$-objects are (a) always subobjects of $E^{\\infty}$ and (b) extend adjacent\nfiltration quotients of the colimit filtration over corresponding adjacent\nfiltration quotients of the kernel filtration {\\em without} the need for lim-1\ncorrective terms.\n  The E-infinity extension theorems enable conclusions about the filtered\nlimit/colimit abutments even in cases where the spectral sequence is far from\nconverging in any traditional sense. We develop such results in the context of\n'comparing' the spectral sequences via the morphism that is induced by a\nmorphism of underlying exact couples.\n  We also contribute to 'reverse comparison' in a spectral sequence; that is\nusing information about the universal abutment(s) of the underlying exact\ncouple to extract information about one or more pages of the spectral sequence.\nThese results overlap with Zeeman's comparison theorems in a generalizing\nfashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 01:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

This so-called\n\"mass gap\" may be linked to the supernova explosion mechanisms that produce\nneutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). However, the existence of a few\nmass-gap compact objects, some of which have been confirmed to be BHs, poses a\nchallenge to the traditional theory of black hole formation. In this work we\ninvestigate the possible formation channel of BHs from accretion-induced\ncollapse (AIC) of NSs in X-ray binaries. In particular, we consider the\ninfluence of super-Eddington accretion of NSs. Recent observations of\nultraluminous X-ray pulsars suggest that their apparent luminosities may\nreflect the true accretion luminosities of the accreting NSs, even exceeding\nthe Eddington limit by a factor of $\\gtrsim 100$. Thus, NSs accreting at a\nsuper-Eddington accretion rate may rapidly grow into BHs in\nintermediate/low-mass X-ray binaries. Based on the super-Eddington accretion\ndisk models, we have investigated the evolution of NSs in intermediate/low-mass\nX-ray binaries by combining binary population synthesis and detailed stellar\nevolutionary calculations. We show that super-Eddington accretion plays a\ncritical role in mass growth of NSs, and the final masses of the descendant BHs\nare heavily dependent on the NS magnetic fields, the metallicity of the donor\nstar, and the bifurcation period of the binaries. AIC of NSs may account for\nsome of the observed mass-gap BHs like GRO J0422+32. We also present the\nparameter distributions of the potential mass-gap BHs in a Milky Way-like\ngalaxy, and point out that future space-based gravitational wave observations\nmay provide important test of or constraints on the formation of mass-gap BHs\nfrom the AIC channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 02:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

During their growth\nneurons extend two types of processes: axons and dendrites, which navigate to\nother neurons and form complex neuronal networks that transmit electrical\nsignals throughout the body. The basic process underlying the network formation\nis axonal growth, a process involving the extension of axons from the cell body\ntowards target neurons. During growth axons sense their environment, process\ninformation, and respond to external stimuli by adapting their growth dynamics.\nEnvironmental stimuli include intercellular interactions, biochemical cues, and\nthe mechanical and geometrical features of the growth substrate. Axonal\ndynamics is controlled both by deterministic components (tendency to grow in\ncertain preferred directions imparted by surface properties), and a random\ndeviation from these growth directions due to stochastic processes. Despite\nrecent impressive advances in our understanding of how neurons grow and form\nfunctional connections, a fully quantitative description of axonal dynamics is\nstill missing.

However, the \"strong\" direct link\n(DL) interference (DLI) is traditionally assumed to be harmful, and generally\ndrowns out the \"weak\" backscattered signals accordingly, thus deteriorating the\nperformance of BackCom. In contrast to the previous efforts to eliminate the\nDLI, in this paper, we exploit the constructive interference (CI), in which the\nDLI contributes to the backscattered signal. To be specific, our objective is\nto maximize the received signal power by jointly optimizing the receive\nbeamforming vectors and tag selection factors, which is, however, non-convex\nand difficult to solve due to constraints on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence. In order to solve this problem, we first decompose the original\nproblem, and then propose two algorithms to solve the sub-problem with\nbeamforming design via a change of variables and semi-definite programming\n(SDP) and a greedy algorithm to solve the sub-problem with tag selection. In\norder to gain insight into the CI, we consider a special case with the\nsingle-antenna reader to reveal the channel angle between the backscattering\nlink (BL) and the DL, in which the DLI will become constructive. Simulation\nresults show that significant performance gain can always be achieved in the\nproposed algorithms compared with the traditional algorithms without the DL in\nterms of the strength of the received signal.

In this study,\na mixed-type modal discontinuous Galerkin approach is developed for one- and\ntwo- dimensional NCRD systems, including linear, Gray-Scott, Brusselator,\nisothermal chemical, and Schnakenberg models to yield the spatiotemporal\npatterns. These models essentially represent a variety of complicated natural\nspatiotemporal patterns such as spots, spot replication, stripes, hexagons, and\nso on. In this approach, a mixed-type formulation is presented to address the\nsecond-order derivatives emerging in the diffusion terms. For spatial\ndiscretization, hierarchical modal basis functions premised on the orthogonal\nscaled Legendre polynomials are used. Moreover, a novel reaction term treatment\nis proposed for the NCRD systems, demonstrating an intrinsic feature of the new\nDG scheme and preventing erroneous solutions due to extremely nonlinear\nreaction terms. The proposed approach reduces the NCRD systems into a framework\nof ordinary differential equations in time, which are addressed by an explicit\nthird-order TVD Runge-Kutta algorithm.

In this\npaper, we present a numerical investigation of the propagation characteristics\nof ring Pearcey vortex beam (PVB) through turbulent atmosphere. The study\ndetails on both moderate as well as strong atmospheric turbulences. Modified\nVon Karman model has been relied on to model random phase screen. It has been\nobserved that in moderate turbulence ring PVB preserved its singularity while\nin strong turbulence, for shorter distance ring PVB preserves the singularity\nwhereas it is lost at larger distance. We found that on increasing the value of\ntopological charge (l) aperture averaged scintillation index (SI) increases. We\nhave calculated the aperture averaged scintillation index (SI) for different\ntruncation factor and noticed that ring PVB with truncation factor b=0.1\nperforms better in stronger turbulence while in moderate turbulence, the\naperture averaged SI is better for shorter distances and relatively larger\ntruncation factor. Further, we calculate the aperture averaged SI for spatially\nchirped ring PVB, and it has been found that aperture averaged SI improves\nlargely for negatively chirped ring PVB. Furthermore, the aperture averaged SI\nof ring PVB and ring Airy vortex beam (AVB) are compared, and it has been\nnoticed that in strong turbulence ring PVB exhibits better aperture averaged SI\ncompared to ring AVB beam. Additionally, we have calculated the beam wander for\nring PVB and ring AVB and found that ring PVB demonstrates better beam wander.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 08:04:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 03:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

However, in-clinic sleep assessments\nare often limited to vital signs (e.g. brain waves). Wearable sensors with\nembedded inertial measurement units have been used for sleep posture\nclassification; nonetheless, previous works consider only few (commonly four)\npostures, which are inadequate for advanced clinical assessments. Moreover,\nposture learning algorithms typically require longitudinal data collection to\nfunction reliably, and often operate on raw inertial sensor readings unfamiliar\nto clinicians. This paper proposes a new framework for sleep posture\nclassification based on a minimal set of joint angle measurements. The proposed\nframework is validated on a rich set of twelve postures in two experimental\npipelines: computer animation to obtain synthetic postural data, and human\nparticipant pilot study using custom-made miniature wearable sensors. Through\nfusing raw geo-inertial sensor measurements to compute a filtered estimate of\nrelative segment orientations across the wrist and ankle joints, the body\nposture can be characterised in a way comprehensible to medical experts. The\nproposed sleep posture learning framework offers plug-and-play posture\nclassification by capitalising on a novel kinematic data augmentation method\nthat requires only one training example per posture. Additionally, a new metric\ntogether with data visualisations are employed to extract meaningful insights\nfrom the postures dataset, demonstrate the added value of the data augmentation\nmethod, and explain the classification performance. The proposed framework\nattained promising overall accuracy as high as 100% on synthetic data and 92.7%\non real data, on par with state of the art data-hungry algorithms available in\nthe literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 09:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

By\nusing this set, and based on a DOA threshold region performance approximation,\nwe propose two antenna selection algorithms; a greedy algorithm and a\ndeep-learning-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is\nevaluated numerically. The results show a significant performance improvement\nover selected benchmark approaches in terms of DOA estimation in the threshold\nregion and computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 12:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

It is common to frame imitation learning as\na supervised learning problem in which one fits a function approximator to the\ninput-output mapping exhibited by the logged demonstrations (input observations\nto output actions). While the framing of imitation learning as a supervised\ninput-output learning problem allows for applicability in a wide variety of\nsettings, it is also an overly simplistic view of the problem in situations\nwhere the expert demonstrations provide much richer insight into expert\nbehavior. For example, applications such as path navigation, robot\nmanipulation, and strategy games acquire expert demonstrations via planning,\nsearch, or some other multi-step algorithm, revealing not just the output\naction to be imitated but also the procedure for how to determine this action.\nWhile these intermediate computations may use tools not available to the agent\nduring inference (e.g., environment simulators), they are nevertheless\ninformative as a way to explain an expert's mapping of state to actions. To\nproperly leverage expert procedure information without relying on the\nprivileged tools the expert may have used to perform the procedure, we propose\nprocedure cloning, which applies supervised sequence prediction to imitate the\nseries of expert computations. This way, procedure cloning learns not only what\nto do (i.e., the output action), but how and why to do it (i.e., the\nprocedure). Through empirical analysis on navigation, simulated robotic\nmanipulation, and game-playing environments, we show that imitating the\nintermediate computations of an expert's behavior enables procedure cloning to\nlearn policies exhibiting significant generalization to unseen environment\nconfigurations, including those configurations for which running the expert's\nprocedure directly is infeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 13:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

However, classical FL faces\nserious security and robustness problem, e.g., malicious clients can poison\nmodel updates and at the same time claim large quantities to amplify the impact\nof their model updates in the model aggregation. Existing defense methods for\nFL, while all handling malicious model updates, either treat all quantities\nbenign or simply ignore/truncate the quantities of all clients. The former is\nvulnerable to quantity-enhanced attack, while the latter leads to sub-optimal\nperformance since the local data on different clients is usually in\nsignificantly different sizes. In this paper, we propose a robust\nquantity-aware aggregation algorithm for federated learning, called FedRA, to\nperform the aggregation with awareness of local data quantities while being\nable to defend against quantity-enhanced attacks. More specifically, we propose\na method to filter malicious clients by jointly considering the uploaded model\nupdates and data quantities from different clients, and performing\nquantity-aware weighted averaging on model updates from remaining clients.\nMoreover, as the number of malicious clients participating in the federated\nlearning may dynamically change in different rounds, we also propose a\nmalicious client number estimator to predict how many suspicious clients should\nbe filtered in each round.

Engineers need to constantly adjust the object to meet\nrequirements at the design stage, where a highly efficient solver is needed.\nThe rise of machine learning-based partial differential equation solvers can\nmeet this need. These solvers can be classified into two categories:\napproximating the solution function (Physics-informed neural network) and\nlearning the solution operator (Neural operator). The recently proposed\nphysics-informed neural operator (PINO) gains advantages from both categories\nby embedding physics equations into the loss function of a neural operator.\nFollowing this state-of-art concept, we propose the physics-informed neural\noperator for coupled ODEs in multi-body dynamics (PINO-MBD), which learns the\nmapping between parameter spaces and solution spaces. Once PINO-MBD is trained,\nonly one forward pass of the network is required to obtain the solutions for a\nnew instance with different parameters. To handle the difficulty that coupled\nODEs contain multiple solutions (instead of only one in normal PDE problems),\ntwo new physics embedding methods are also proposed.
