A range of competing implementations have been proposed,\nrelying on either supervised or self-supervised learning. Self-supervised\napproaches, sometimes referred to as unsupervised, have been loosely based on\nauto-encoders, whereas supervised methods have, to date, been trained on\ngroundtruth labels. These two learning paradigms have been shown to have\ndistinct strengths. Notably, self-supervised approaches have offered lower-bias\nparameter estimates than their supervised alternatives. This result is\ncounterintuitive - incorporating prior knowledge with supervised labels should,\nin theory, lead to improved accuracy. In this work, we show that this apparent\nlimitation of supervised approaches stems from the naive choice of groundtruth\ntraining labels. By training on labels which are deliberately not groundtruth,\nwe show that the low-bias parameter estimation previously associated with\nself-supervised methods can be replicated - and improved on - within a\nsupervised learning framework. This approach sets the stage for a single,\nunifying, deep learning parameter estimation framework, based on supervised\nlearning, where trade-offs between bias and variance are made by careful\nadjustment of training label.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 16:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 18:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

And yet, surprisingly, our\nexperiments indicate that Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which use exactly this type of\nfunction approximator, are still able to achieve modest action generalization.\nOur main contribution is twofold: first, we propose a method of evaluating\naction generalization using expert knowledge of action similarity, and\nempirically confirm that action generalization leads to faster learning;\nsecond, we characterize the action-generalization gap (the difference in\nlearning performance between DQN and the expert) in different domains.

Due to\nits ill-posed nature, small noise may lead to large errors. Conventional HOG\nmay fail to produce meaningful directionality results in the presence of noise,\nwhich is common in medical radiographic imaging. We approach the directionality\nproblem from a novel perspective by the use of the optimal transport map of a\nlocal image patch to a uni-color patch of its mean. We decompose the transport\nmap into sub-work costs in different directions. We evaluated the ability of\nthe optimal transport to quantify tumor heterogeneity from brain MRI images of\npatients with glioblastoma multiforme from the TCIA. By considering the entropy\ndifference of the extracted local directionality within tumor regions, we found\nthat patients with higher entropy in their images, had statistically\nsignificant worse overall survival (p $=0.008$), which indicates that tumors\nexhibiting flows in many directions may be more malignant, perhaps reflecting\nhigh tumor histologic grade, a reflection of histologic disorganization. We\nalso explored the possibility of solving classical image processing problems\nsuch as smoothing and edge detection via optimal transport. By looking for a\n2-color patch with minimum transport distance to a local patch, we derive a\nnonlinear shock filter, which preserves edges. Moreover, we found that the\ncolor difference of the computed 2-color patch indicates whether there is a\nlarge change in color, i.e., an edge in the given patch. In summary, we expand\nthe usefulness of optimal transport as an image local analysis tool, to extract\nrobust measures of imaging tumor heterogeneity for outcomes prediction as well\nas image pre-processing. Because of its robust nature, we find it offers\nseveral advantages over the classical approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 16:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The first one is\nthe area-bandwidth trade-off of photodetectors (PDs) and the second one is the\ngain-FOV trade-off due to the use of optics. The combined effects of these two\ntrade-offs imply that the achievable data rate of an imaging optical receiver\nis limited by its FOV, i.e., a rate-FOV trade-off. To control the\narea-bandwidth trade-off, an array of small PDs can be used instead of a single\nPD. Moreover, in practice, a large-area lens is required to ensure sufficient\npower collection, which in turn limits the receiver FOV (i.e., gain-FOV\ntrade-off). We propose an imaging receiver design in the form of an array of\narrays. To achieve a reasonable receiver FOV, we use individual focusing lens\nfor each PD array rather than a single collection lens for the whole receiver.\nThe proposed array of arrays structure provides an effective method to control\nboth gain-FOV trade-off (via an array of lenses) and area-bandwidth trade-off\n(via arrays of PDs). We first derive a tractable analytical model for the SNR\nof an array of PDs where the maximum ratio combining has been employed. Then,\nwe extend the model for the proposed array of arrays structure and the accuracy\nof the analytical model is verified based on several Optic Studio-based\nsimulations. Next, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the\nachievable data rate of the imaging receiver subject to a minimum required FOV.\nThe optimization problem is solved for two commonly used modulation techniques,\nnamely, OOK and direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing with variable rate quadrature amplitude modulation.

Recently, upward-planar\nL-drawings have been studied for $st$-graphs, i.e., planar DAGs with a single\nsource $s$ and a single sink $t$ containing an edge directed from $s$ to $t$.\nIt is known that a plane $st$-graph, i.e., an embedded $st$-graph in which the\nedge $(s,t)$ is incident to the outer face, admits an upward-planar L-drawing\nif and only if it admits a bitonic $st$-ordering, which can be tested in linear\ntime.\n  We study upward-planar L-drawings of DAGs that are not necessarily\n$st$-graphs. On the combinatorial side, we show that a plane DAG admits an\nupward-planar L-drawing if and only if it is a subgraph of a plane $st$-graph\nadmitting a bitonic $st$-ordering. This allows us to show that not every tree\nwith a fixed bimodal embedding admits an upward-planar L-drawing.

The feedback controller is based on rate-based\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) that provides integral action for tracking. Two\noptions for the feedforward are considered one based on a look-up table that\nspecifies the feedforward as a function of engine speed and fuel injection\nrate, and another one based on a (non-rate-based) MPC that generates dynamic\nfeedforward trajectories.

To investigate the stability of clouds capable to form stars in\noutflows, we modeled CO and HCO+ ALMA data of the galaxy IC5063, in which\nblack-hole jets impact molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer code that\nself-consistently performs astrochemical and thermal balance calculations based\non the available gas heating sources, we found that mechanical heating and\ncosmic ray (CR) heating are fully capable of individually reproducing the data.\nIn our best-fit model, CRs provide about 1/3rd of the dense gas heating at the\nradio lobes, emphasizing the role of this often neglected mechanism in heating\nthe gas and potentially generating outflows.

Some jet-impacted clouds, nonetheless, near pathways that the\njet cleared have increased Pi and decreased Pe. They are likely to undergo\nevaporation of their outer layers. Part of the evaporated layers could mass\nload the outflow thanks to ram pressure from co-spatial ionized gas flows. The\nobserved pressure changes thus suggest that both star formation enhancement and\nsuppression could simultaneously occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 17:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

One core insight of\nour work is that the problem is closely related to the fundamental task of path\nenumeration in a weighted DAG.

When some species are more vulnerable, we ought to offer\nmore protection to these animals; unfortunately, existing combinatorial bandit\napproaches do not offer a way to prioritize important species. To bridge this\ngap, (1) We propose a novel combinatorial bandit objective that trades off\nbetween reward maximization and also accounts for prioritization over species,\nwhich we call ranked prioritization.

To do so, we examined the mediation of accountability in the\nexisting interactions between vulnerable users and a 'high-risk' AI system in a\nGlobal South setting. We report on a qualitative study with 29\nfinancially-stressed users of instant loan platforms in India.

The oceans consist of Fresnel reflecting surfaces with wind-ruffled\nwaves, foam and wave shadows, above natural blue seawater. Our results are\npresented as functions of wavelength (from 300 to 2500 nm with 1 nm resolution)\nand as functions of the planetary phase angle from 90 to 170 degrees. The ocean\nglint increases F, |Q| and P with increasing phase angle at non-absorbing\nwavelengths, and causes the spectra of F and |Q| for the various phase angles\nto intersect. In the near-infrared, Q is negative, i.e. the direction of\npolarization is perpendicular to the plane through the star, planet, and\nobserver. In the P-spectra, the glint leaves dips (instead of peaks) in gaseous\nabsorption bands. All those signatures are missing in the spectra of dry\nplanets. The dips in P, and the negative Q in the near-infrared, can be\nsearched for at a phase angle of 90 degrees, where the planet-star separation\nis largest.

A fair benchmark is important for\nthe further development of channel pruning.\n  Meanwhile, recent investigations reveal that the channel configurations\ndiscovered by pruning algorithms are at least as important as the pre-trained\nweights. This gives channel pruning a new role, namely searching the optimal\nchannel configuration. In this paper, we try to determine the channel\nconfiguration of the pruned models by random search. The proposed approach\nprovides a new way to compare different methods, namely how well they behave\ncompared with random pruning.

However, we still do not have strong observational\nconstraints on the relative importance of the different feedback mechanisms\n(e.g. radiation, ionised gas pressure, stellar winds) in driving HII region\nevolution and molecular cloud disruption. In this letter, we constrain the\nrelative importance of the various feedback mechanisms from young massive star\npopulations by resolving HII regions across the disk of the nearby star-forming\ngalaxy NGC 1672. We combine measurements of ionised gas nebular lines obtained\nby PHANGS-MUSE, with high-resolution imaging from the HST in both the\nnarrow-band H{\\alpha} and broad-band filters. We identify a sample of 40\nisolated, compact HII regions in the HST H{\\alpha} image, for which we measure\nthe sizes that were previously unresolved in seeing-limited ground-based\nobservations. Additionally, we identify the ionisation source(s) for each HII\nregion from catalogues produced as part of the PHANGS-HST survey. We find that\nthe HII regions investigated are mildly dominated by thermal or wind pressure,\nyet their elevation above the radiation pressure is within the expected\nuncertainty range. We see that radiation pressure provides a substantially\nhigher contribution to the total pressure than previously found in the\nliterature over similar size scales. In general, we find higher pressures\nwithin more compact HII regions, which is driven by the inherent size scaling\nrelations of each pressure term, albeit with significant scatter introduced by\nthe variation in the stellar population properties (e.g. luminosity, mass, age,\nmetallicity).

The main\nbarrier to progress is the low efficiency in rapidly and confidently\nidentifying which bursts are high redshift ($z > 5$) candidates before they\nfade, as this requires low-latency follow-up observations at near-infrared\nwavelengths (or longer) to determine a reliable photometric redshift estimate.\nSo far this task has been performed by instruments on the ground, but sky\nvisibility and weather constraints limit the number of GRB targets that can be\nobserved and the speed at which follow-up is possible. In this work we develop\na Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate an alternative approach based\non the use of a rapid-response near-infrared nano-satellite, capable of\nsimultaneous imaging in four bands from $0.8$ to $1.7\\mu$m (a mission concept\ncalled SkyHopper).

Sinai,\nErgodic theory (Springer-Verlag New York, 1982)], which maps any \"ergodic\"\ndynamical system to a cyclic permutation on a circle and arguably represents\nthe most elementary notion of ergodicity. This paper shows that cyclic\nergodicity generalizes to quantum dynamical systems, and this generalization is\nproposed here as the basic rigorous definition of quantum ergodicity. It\nimplies the ability to construct an orthonormal basis, where quantum dynamics\ntransports an initial basis vector to all other basis vectors one by one, while\nmaintaining a sufficiently large overlap between the time-evolved initial state\nand a given basis state. It is proven that the basis, maximizing the overlap\nover all cyclic permutations, is obtained via the discrete Fourier transform of\nthe energy eigenstates. This relates quantum cyclic ergodicity to level\nstatistics. We then show that the near-universal Wigner-Dyson level statistics\nimplies quantum cyclic ergodicity, but the reverse is not necessarily true. For\nthe latter, we study irrational flows on a 2D torus and prove that both the\nclassical and quantum flows are cyclic ergodic. However, the corresponding\nlevel statistics is neither Wigner-Dyson nor Poisson. Finally, we use the\ncyclic construction to motivate a quantum ergodic hierarchy of operators and\nargue that under the additional assumption of Poincare recurrences, cyclic\nergodicity is a necessary condition for such operators to satisfy the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

In this\npaper we question the necessity of a GAN for generation from a single video,\nand introduce a non-parametric baseline for a variety of generation and\nmanipulation tasks. We revive classical space-time patches-nearest-neighbors\napproaches and adapt them to a scalable unconditional generative model, without\nany learning. This simple baseline surprisingly outperforms single-video GANs\nin visual quality and realism (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations), and is disproportionately faster (runtime reduced from several\ndays to seconds). Our approach is easily scaled to Full-HD videos. We also use\nthe same framework to demonstrate video analogies and spatio-temporal\nretargeting. These observations show that classical approaches significantly\noutperform heavy deep learning machinery for these tasks. This sets a new\nbaseline for single-video generation and manipulation tasks, and no less\nimportant -- makes diverse generation from a single video practically possible\nfor the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 18:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

These effects manifest on the flow stability via the\nflow-thermodynamic interactions. Comprehensive understanding of stability flow\nphysics is of fundamental interest and important for developing predictive\ntools and closure models for integrated transition-to-turbulence computations.\nThe flow-thermodynamic interactions are examined using linear analysis and\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) in the following parameter regime: $0.5 \\leq\nM \\leq 8$; and, $0.5 \\leq Pr \\leq 1.3$. For adiabatic wall boundary condition,\nincreasing Prandtl number has a destabilizing effect. In this work, we\ncharacterize the behavior of production, pressure-strain correlation and\npressure-dilatation as functions of Mach and Prandtl numbers. First and second\ninstability modes exhibit similar stability trends but the underlying flow\nphysics is shown to be diametrically opposite. The Prandtl-number influence on\ninstability is explicated in terms of the base flow profile with respect to the\ndifferent perturbation mode shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 19:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

A TMD factorization approach to the\nphenomenology of semi-inclusive processes that includes evolution, higher\norders, and matching to larger transverse momentum, is ultimately necessary for\nreliably connecting with phenomenologically extracted nonperturbative\nstructures, especially when widely different scales are involved. In this\npaper, we will address some of the difficulties that arise when\nphenomenological techniques that were originally designed for very high energy\napplications are extended to studies of hadron structures, and we will solidify\nthe connection between standard high energy TMD implementations and the more\nintuitive, parton model based approaches to phenomenology that emphasize\nnonperturbative hadron structure.

To\ndefine feasible design spaces for each part's shape, \"maximal\" collision-free\npointsets can be computed using configuration space modeling techniques such as\nMinkowski operations and sweep/unsweep. For example, for a pair of parts\nundergoing a given relative motion, to make the problem well-posed, the\ngeometry of one part (chosen arbitrarily) must be fixed to compute the maximal\nshape of the other part by an unsweep operation. Making such arbitrary choices\nin a multi-component assembly can place unnecessary restrictions on the design\nspace. A broader family of collision-free pairs of parts can be explored, if\nfixing the geometry of a component is not required. In this paper, we formalize\nthis family of collision-free shapes and introduce a generic method for\ngenerating a broad subset of them. Our procedure, which is an extension of the\nunsweep, allows for co-generation of a pair of geometries which are modified\nincrementally and simultaneously to avoid collision. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and scalability of our procedure in both 2D and 3D by generating\na variety of collision-free shapes. Notably, we show that our approach can\nautomatically generate freeform cam and follower profiles, gear teeth, and\nscrew threads, starting from colliding blocks of materials, solely from a\nspecification of relative motion and without the use of any feature-informed\nheuristics. Moreover, our approach provides continuous measures of collision\nthat can be incorporated into standard gradient-descent design optimization,\nallowing for simultaneous collision-free and physics-informed co-design of\nmechanical parts for assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 20:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 01:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 00:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

However, current\napproaches to tackle this problem are mostly restricted to simple systems. In\nthis paper, we propose a new method to combine model-based safety with\nmodel-free reinforcement learning by explicitly finding a low-dimensional model\nof the system controlled by a RL policy and applying stability and safety\nguarantees on that simple model. We use a complex bipedal robot Cassie, which\nis a high dimensional nonlinear system with hybrid dynamics and underactuation,\nand its RL-based walking controller as an example.

We further\nexemplify that such linearity exists even when using different RL control\npolicies.

Furthermore, we illustrate that\nthe found linear model is able to provide guarantees by safety-critical optimal\ncontrol framework, e.g., Model Predictive Control with Control Barrier\nFunctions, on an example of autonomous navigation using Cassie while taking\nadvantage of the agility provided by the RL-based controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 22:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Commonly used theoretical\napproaches interrogate thermal properties from Gibbs/Helmholtz free energies,\nwhich require an accurate model of magnetic interactions. The present approach\navoids this requirement by instead calculating system pressure from thermally\ndisordered microstates that properly incorporate vibrational and spin\nsubsystems at each temperature as well as the coupling between these\nsubsystems. In place of a specific model for magnetic interactions, the\napproach integrates measurements of temperature dependent magnetization of the\nstudied material. We apply the approach to calculate phonon modes and to\ninvestigate the anomalously low thermal expansion of the classical Invar alloy,\nFe_0.65Ni_0.35. The calculated phonon dispersions for Invar are in excellent\nagreement with measured data. The Invar thermal expansion is shown to remain\nsmall between 50 K and room temperature, consistent with the experimentally\nobserved low thermal expansion value in this same temperature range. This\nanomalously small thermal expansion is directly connected to a small positive\ncontribution from lattice thermal disorder that is nearly canceled by a large\nnegative magnetic disorder contribution. By contrast, calculations for bcc Fe\nshow a much larger thermal expansion, consistent with experiment, which is\ndominated by a large contribution from lattice thermal disorder that is reduced\nonly slightly by a small negative contribution from that of magnetism. These\nfindings give insights into the unusual nature of magnetism and spin-lattice\ncoupling in Invar and Fe, and they support the presented new methodology as a\ncomplementary way to investigate thermal properties of magnetic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 22:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

The transition rates among states\nthat appear in the Markov model can be determined by computing the relative\nentropy of states and their mean first passage times. In this paper, we present\nan adaptive method to evaluate the configurational entropy and the mean first\npassage times for linear chain models with discontinuous potentials. The\napproach is based on event-driven dynamical sampling in a massively parallel\narchitecture. Using the fact that the transition rate matrix can be calculated\nfor any choice of interaction energies at any temperature, it is demonstrated\nhow each state's energy can be chosen such that the average time to transition\nbetween any two states is minimized. The methods are used to analyze the\noptimization of the folding process of two protein systems: the crambin\nprotein, and a model with frustration and misfolding. It is shown that the\nfolding pathways for both systems are comprised of two regimes: first, the\nrapid establishment of local bonds, followed by the subsequent formation of\nmore distant contacts. The state energies that lead to the most rapid folding\nencourage multiple pathways, and either penalize folding pathways through\nkinetic traps by raising the energies of trapping states, or establish an\nescape route from the trapping states by lowering free energy barriers to other\nstates that rapidly reach the native state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 23:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 15:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 17:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

Machine learning and artificial\nintelligence offer the promise of dramatically reducing the computational cost\nand time. This chapter reviews selected areas where AI/ML tools could have a\nmajor impact, provides an overview of the challenges, and discusses how new\nideas such as normalizing flows can speed up the generation of gauge\nconfigurations needed in lattice QCD calculations; the growth of ML in\nsurrogate models and pattern matching to reduce the cost of event generators\nand in the analysis of experimental data; and in the search for viable vacua in\nthe landscape of string theories.

Moreover, these methods\noften derive their universal model from a collection of backbones -- normally\none for each source domain -- where these backbones are constrained to have the\nsame architecture as the universal model.

VIKJ2318-3113 is\na recently discovered quasar at z = 6.44 that has not been imaged with VLBI\nbefore the current work. Here we present the first VLBI imaging results of this\nhigh-redshift quasar, with the aim of corroborating its high-resolution\nappearance with the physical model of the object. We carried out VLBI\nphase-referencing observations of VIKJ2318-3113 using the Very Long Baseline\nArray at two frequencies, 1.6 and 4.7 GHz, and obtained the first view at the\nradio structure on the milliarcsecond scale.

Men with low\ntestosterone levels (one SD below the mean level) showed a significant\nassociation between hypercholesterolemia and higher deep WMH volumes.\nHypertensive women showed higher WMH volumes than women without hypertension\nregardless of whether hormone replacement therapy was used. However, higher WMH\nvolumes, especially in the deep white matter regions, were found in women who\ndid not use hormone replacement therapy or use it for a shorter duration.\nConclusion: These findings highlighted the importance of considering hormonal\nrisk factors in the prevention and management of WMH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 04:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Especially, with the help of deep neural\nnetworks, great progress has been achieved. However, it remains less\ninvestigated on BIQA for night-time images (NTIs) which usually suffers from\ncomplicated authentic distortions such as reduced visibility, low contrast,\nadditive noises, and color distortions. These diverse authentic degradations\nparticularly challenges the design of effective deep neural network for blind\nNTI quality evaluation (NTIQE). In this paper, we propose a novel deep\ndecomposition and bilinear pooling network (DDB-Net) to better address this\nissue. The DDB-Net contains three modules, i.e., an image decomposition module,\na feature encoding module, and a bilinear pooling module. The image\ndecomposition module is inspired by the Retinex theory and involves decoupling\nthe input NTI into an illumination layer component responsible for illumination\ninformation and a reflection layer component responsible for content\ninformation. Then, the feature encoding module involves learning feature\nrepresentations of degradations that are rooted in the two decoupled components\nseparately. Finally, by modeling illumination-related and content-related\ndegradations as two-factor variations, the two feature sets are bilinearly\npooled together to form a unified representation for quality prediction. The\nsuperiority of the proposed DDB-Net has been well validated by extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets.

This\ngives rise to the problem of performance loss due to the mismatch between the\ntrue model and the assumed model. A robustness problem in this context is to\nshow that the error due to the mismatch between a true model and an assumed\nmodel decreases to zero as the assumed model approaches the true model. We\nstudy this problem when the state dynamics of the system are governed by\ncontrolled diffusion processes. In particular, we will discuss continuity and\nrobustness properties of infinite-horizon $\\alpha$-discounted/ergodic optimal\ncontrol problems for a general class of non-degenerate controlled diffusion\nprocesses, as well as for optimal control up to an exit time.

At\nthe interface, polar groups that have polar charges, are indispensable to be\nconsidered, which interact directly with other polar charges/external\ncharges/external electric fields. However, there is no report on the\ncorresponding magnetic properties on these polar groups. Clearly, such\nasymmetry, that is, only the interaction between the polar groups and charges,\nis out of bounds. Here we show that those molecules with considerable polar\ngroups, such as cellulose acetate (CA) and other cellulose derivatives with\ndifferent polar groups, can have strong magnetic response, indicating that they\nare strongly paramagnetic. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows\nthat the polarity greatly reduces the excitation energy from the state without\nnet spin (singlet) to the state with net spin (triplet), making the\nconsiderable existence of magnetic moments on the polar groups. We note that\nthe hydrophobic groups in these molecules have no magnetic moments, however,\nthey make the molecules aggregate to amply the magnetic effect of the magnetic\nmoments in the polar groups, so that these magnetic moments can induce the\nstrong paramagnetism. Our observations suggest a recovery of the symmetry with\ninextricable link between the electricity and magnetism at the interface.

The core of this task is\nto train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to\npredict credible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the\nprior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this\ntask. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective\npoint-to-box regressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level\nproposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation\nand thus can obtain a high recall rate. To better distinguish different\ninstances and improve precision, we propose instance-level proposal assignment\nto replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in the original R-CNN\nmethods. As naive instance-level assignment brings converging difficulty, we\npropose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware\nfeature enhancement and instance-aware parameter generation to overcome this\nissue. Comprehensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.

Herein we propose that the mobile devices are\nclustered into mobile small cells with one of the mobile devices acting as a\ngroup head with basic transceiver, coding and relaying functionalities. Group\nheads coordinate the transmissions from the mobile devices in the mobile small\ncell to the network's base stations. The objective function of the cooperative\nscheme is to minimize mobile devices' energy consumption subject to a certain\nbit error probability. The proposed network-coding based scheme has been\nevaluated by means of numerical simulations and compared to both a conventional\ndirect transmit scheme, with no cooperation groups, and a cooperative relaying\nscheme. Results show that, with network-coded cooperation, energy efficiency\nmay significantly increase provided the density of base stations and mobile\ndevices is below a certain value. Above this value none of the compared\ncooperation schemes may improve energy efficiency, but rather power consumption\nis reduced only when mobile devices transmit via base stations in their close\nproximity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 07:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Analogously to Hilbert's 17th problem in real algebraic\ngeometry, trace-positive nc polynomials are shown to be weakly sums of\nhermitian squares and commutators of regular nc rational functions. In two\nvariables, this result is strengthened further using a new sum-of-squares\ncertificate with concrete univariate denominators for nonnegative bivariate\npolynomials.\n  The trace positivity certificates in this paper are obtained by convex\nduality through solving the so-called unbounded tracial moment problem, which\narises from noncommutative integration theory and free probability.

At variance,\nfor the heavier system, Xenon on gold target only quasi-fission is evidenced.\nThe study of the events characterized by two fragments in the final channel\nshows that fission, related to fusion in the entrance channel, disappears\naround 20A MeV for both systems. At lower energies (8A, 12A and 15A MeV) for\nthe Sn target, an evolution with increasing energies towards an asymmetric\nfission mode is displayed in the fragment charge distributions. This trend can\nbe attributed to the increasing angular momentum as indicated by the\nout-of-plane angular distribution for light charged particles. The same effect\nis also observed in the case of the gold target at 15A MeV. However, for this\nheavier system, a strong memory of the entrance channel leading to\nquasi-fission is evidenced. A comparison with the Viola systematics, moreover,\nshows a deviation, greater for the heavier system than for $^{129}Xe+^{nat}Sn$\nsystem. A complete understanding of the above results would certainly require\nprecise model calculations at these energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 09:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

In the case of the Inert doublet model,\nthe mass region ($\\sim 60$-$80$ GeV) and the high mass region (heavier than $\n550 $ GeV) are allowed. This motivates us to explore a parameter range in the\nintermediate-mass region $M_{W}\\leq M_{DM}\\leq 550 $ GeV, which we do in a\nscotogenic extension of SM with a scalar doublet and scalar singlets. The dark\nmatter in our model is a mixture of singlet and doublet scalars. We constrain\nthe allowed parameter space of the model using Planck bound on present dark\nmatter relic abundance, neutrino mass, and the latest bound on spin-independent\nDM-nucleon scattering cross-section from XENON1T experiment. Our model may\nprovide a viable DM candidate in the new, previously unexplored mass range\n($200\\leq M_{DM}\\leq 550$ GeV), if this new window for the DM candidate mass is\ndetected in future experiments, along with explanation of Dirac mass of\nneutrinos, since so far there is no strong evidence in support of Majorana\nnature of neutrino mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 10:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 18:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

Understanding the dynamics of news information creation and\ndispersion is important to accurately ascribe credit to influential work and\nunderstand how societal narratives develop. These dynamics can be modelled\nthrough a combination of information-theoretic natural language processing and\nnetworks; and can be parameterised using large quantities of textual data.\nHowever, it is challenging to see \"the wood for the trees\", i.e., to detect\nsmall but important flows of information in a sea of noise. Here we develop new\ncomparative techniques to estimate temporal information flow between pairs of\ntext producers. Using both simulated and real text data we compare the\nreliability and sensitivity of methods for estimating textual information flow,\nshowing that a metric that normalises by local neighbourhood structure provides\na robust estimate of information flow in large networks. We apply this metric\nto a large corpus of news organisations on Twitter and demonstrate its\nusefulness in identifying influence within an information ecosystem, finding\nthat average information contribution to the network is not correlated with the\nnumber of followers or the number of tweets. This suggests that small local\norganisations and right-wing organisations which have lower average follower\ncounts still contribute significant information to the ecosystem. Further, the\nmethods are applied to smaller full-text datasets of specific news events\nacross news sites and Russian troll accounts on Twitter. The information flow\nestimation reveals and quantifies features of how these events develop and the\nrole of groups of trolls in setting disinformation narratives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 11:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

We exploit\nthis tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects\nfrom the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing\nthe RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks.\n  We demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories\nare vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting\noff-path downgrade attack.

Such turning rates can strongly source the adiabatic\nfluctuations, resulting in an enhanced scalar power spectrum with resonant\nfeatures and a large peak amplitude. If the growth of the scalar power spectrum\nat small scales is large enough, primordial black holes can be produced in\nabundance.

Our work provides insight into expected `typical'\nregions of univalence, comparisons between the tightness of bounds and the\ncorresponding exact values of certain quantities characterizing transport,\ntests of relations between diffusion and bounds that involve chaotic\npole-skipping, as well as tests of a condition that implies the conformal bound\non the speed of sound and a complementary condition that implies its violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 13:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 13:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

The quantum Hall effect is\njust one of many research endeavours that revolve around recent quantum\nphysical phenomena like composite fermions, charge density waves, and\ntopological properties [1-2]. New materials, like magnetically doped\ntopological insulators (MTIs), offer access to the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect, which in its ideal form, could become a future resistance standard\nneeding only a small permanent magnet to activate a quantized resistance value\n[3-5].

As the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber is large ($R_M > 10$), the plasma flow advects a magnetic field\nproportional to the current at the load.

The HP model has favorable interactions between adjacent, not\ndirectly bound hydrophobic residues. Here, we develop a novel spin\nrepresentation for lattice protein folding tailored for quantum annealing. With\na distributed encoding onto the lattice, it differs from earlier attempts to\nfold lattice proteins on quantum annealers, which were based upon chain growth\ntechniques. With our encoding, the Hamiltonian by design has the quadratic\nstructure required for calculations on an Ising-type annealer, without having\nto introduce any auxiliary spin variables.

The approach is robust to changes in the parameters\nrequired to constrain the spin system to chain-like configurations, and\nperforms very well in terms of solution quality. The results are evaluated\nagainst existing exact results for HP chains with up to $N=30$ beads with 100%\nhit rate, thereby also outperforming classical simulated annealing. In\naddition, the method allows us to recover the lowest known energies for $N=48$\nand $N=64$ HP chains, with similar hit rates.

For the quantum case,\nqsampling from Markov chains can be constructed as preparing quantum states\nwith amplitudes arbitrarily close to the square root of a stationary\ndistribution instead of classical sampling from a stationary distribution. In\nthis paper, a new qsampling algorithm for all reversible Markov chains is\nconstructed by discrete-time quantum walks and works without any limit compared\nwith existing results. In detail, we build a qsampling algorithm that not only\naccelerates non-regular graphs but also keeps the speed-up of existing quantum\nalgorithms for regular graphs. In non-regular graphs, the invocation of the\nquantum fast-forward algorithm accelerates existing state-of-the-art qsampling\nalgorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases, especially on\nsparse graphs. Compared to existing algorithms we reduce log n, where n is the\nnumber of graph vertices. In regular graphs, our result matches other quantum\nalgorithms, and our reliance on the gap of Markov chains achieves quadratic\nspeedup compared with classical cases. For both cases, we reduce the number of\nancilla qubits required compared to the existing results. In some widely used\ngraphs and a series of sparse graphs where stationary distributions are\ndifficult to reach quickly, our algorithm is the first algorithm to achieve\ncomplete quadratic acceleration (without log factor) over the classical case\nwithout any limit. To enlarge success probability amplitude amplification is\nintroduced. We construct a new reflection on stationary state with fewer\nancilla qubits and think it may have independent application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

In order to\nstudy how agents can be taught to query external knowledge via language, we\nfirst introduce two new environments: the grid-world-based Q-BabyAI and the\ntext-based Q-TextWorld. In addition to physical interactions, an agent can\nquery an external knowledge source specialized for these environments to gather\ninformation. Second, we propose the \"Asking for Knowledge\" (AFK) agent, which\nlearns to generate language commands to query for meaningful knowledge that\nhelps solve the tasks. AFK leverages a non-parametric memory, a pointer\nmechanism and an episodic exploration bonus to tackle (1) irrelevant\ninformation, (2) a large query language space, (3) delayed reward for making\nmeaningful queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFK agent\noutperforms recent baselines on the challenging Q-BabyAI and Q-TextWorld\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 16:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

While detecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly\nhelp with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in\ndrivers' negative emotions and high stress level, might better help with\nplanning interventions. While studies have provided significant insight into\ndetecting drivers' emotions and stress levels, not many studies focused on the\nreasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study,\nby using a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the\ndriving scene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between\nthe ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'\npsychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). Our\nresults indicate that different road objects might be associated with varying\nlevels of increase in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative\nfacial emotions detected through computer vision. Larger vehicles on the road,\nsuch as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest amount of increase in\ndrivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, shorter distances and\nhigher standard deviation in the distance to the lead vehicle are associated\nwith a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a possible\nincrease in stress level. Our finding indicates more positive emotions, lower\nfacial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of\ndriving, which often happens in highway environments. This research\ncollectively shows that driving at higher speeds happening in highways by\navoiding certain road objects might be a better fit for keeping drivers in a\ncalmer, more positive state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:30:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 02:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Examples include studies of racial\ndisparity in health and voting. Recently, Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding\n(BISG), which uses Bayes' rule to combine information from Census surname files\nwith the geocoding of an individual's residence, has emerged as a leading\nmethodology for this prediction task. Unfortunately, BISG suffers from two\nCensus data problems that contribute to unsatisfactory predictive performance\nfor minorities. First, the decennial Census often contains zero counts for\nminority racial groups in the Census blocks where some members of those groups\nreside. Second, because the Census surname files only include frequent names,\nmany surnames -- especially those of minorities -- are missing from the list.\nTo address the zero counts problem, we introduce a fully Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (fBISG) methodology that accounts for potential measurement\nerror in Census counts by extending the naive Bayesian inference of the BISG\nmethodology to full posterior inference.

To solve poverty\nissues, one needs to know how severe the issue is. The Multidimensional Poverty\nIndex (MPI) is a well-known approach that is used to measure a degree of\npoverty issues in a given area. To compute MPI, it requires information of MPI\nindicators, which are \\textbf{binary variables} collecting by surveys, that\nrepresent different aspects of poverty such as lacking of education, health,\nliving conditions, etc. Inferring impacts of MPI indicators on MPI index can be\nsolved by using traditional regression methods. However, it is not obvious that\nwhether solving one MPI indicator might resolve or cause more issues in other\nMPI indicators and there is no framework dedicating to infer empirical causal\nrelations among MPI indicators.\n  In this work, we propose a framework to infer causal relations on binary\nvariables in poverty surveys.

We design\nan iterative algorithm that depends solely on a trivially verifiable ex-post\ncondition and demand queries, and with appropriate decisions made by an\nauctioneer, always yields a welfare-maximizing and core-stable outcome.

As functions of proton and neutron number, both quantities\nshow regular patterns and, for nuclei away from magic numbers, they change very\nsmoothly from nucleus to nucleus. In this paper, we explain how the local shell\neffects are impacting the statistical correlations between quadrupole\ndeformations and charge radii in well-deformed even-even Er, Yb, and Hf\nisotopes. This implies, in turn, that sudden changes in correlations can be\nuseful indicators of underlying shell effects. Our theoretical analysis is\nperformed in the framework of self-consistent mean-field theory using\nquantified energy density functionals and density-dependent pairing forces. The\nstatistical analysis is carried out by means of the linear least-square\nregression. The local variations of nuclear quadrupole deformations and charge\nradii, explained in terms of occupations individual deformed Hartree-Fock\norbits, make and imprint on statistical correlations of computed observables.\nWhile the calculated deformations or charge radii are, in some cases,\ncorrelated with those of their even-even neighbors, the correlations seem to\ndeteriorate rapidly with particle number. The statistical correlations between\nnuclear deformations and charge radii of different nuclei are affected by the\nunderlying shell structure. Even for well deformed and superfluid nuclei for\nwhich these observables change smoothly, the correlation range usually does not\nexceed $\\Delta N=4$ and $\\Delta Z=4$, i.e., it is rather short. This result\nsuggests that the frequently made assumption of reduced statistical errors for\nthe differences between smoothly-varying observables cannot be generally\njustified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The exploration is focused on a relatively primitive mechanism for\nwhich there is a lot of evidence from various psycholinguistic experiments with\ninfants. The computation of \"abstract sameness relations\" is assumed to play an\nimportant role in human language acquisition and processing, especially in\nlearning more complex grammar rules. In order to investigate this mechanism in\nBERT and other pre-trained language models (PLMs), the experiment designs from\nstudies with infants were taken as the starting point. On this basis, we\ndesigned experimental settings in which each element from the original studies\nwas mapped to a component of language models.

CP is implemented on top of a polymorphic core language\nwith disjoint intersection types called Fi+. The semantics of Fi+ employs an\nelaboration to a target language and relies on a sophisticated proof technique\nto prove the coherence of the elaboration. Unfortunately, the proof technique\nis technically challenging and hard to scale to many common features, including\nrecursion or impredicative polymorphism. Thus, the original formulation of Fi+\ndoes not support the two later features, which creates a gap between theory and\npractice, since CP fundamentally relies on them.\n  This paper presents a new formulation of Fi+ based on a type-directed\noperational semantics (TDOS). The TDOS approach was recently proposed to model\nthe semantics of languages with disjoint intersection types (but without\npolymorphism). Our work shows that the TDOS approach can be extended to\nlanguages with disjoint polymorphism and model the full Fi+ calculus. Unlike\nthe elaboration semantics, which gives the semantics to Fi+ indirectly via a\ntarget language, the TDOS approach gives a semantics to Fi+ directly. With a\nTDOS, there is no need for a coherence proof. Instead, we can simply prove that\nthe semantics is deterministic. The proof of determinism only uses simple\nreasoning techniques, such as straightforward induction, and is able to handle\nproblematic features such as recursion and impredicative polymorphism. This\nremoves the gap between theory and practice and validates the original proofs\nof correctness for CP. We formalized the TDOS variant of the Fi+ calculus and\nall its proofs in the Coq proof assistant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to\nreconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected\nradio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits\nup the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly\ndifferent propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the\nneutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino\ndirection to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from\nfirst principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a\nfunction of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF\nwaveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during\npropagation into account. The model is available open-source through the\nNuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from\nthe ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time\ndelay measurements, improving the predictions significantly compared to\nprevious studies. Finally, the implications and opportunities for neutrino\ndetection are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

In this\nwork, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly\npredict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of\nsimulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of\nstability assessment without loss of accuracy.

Methods: We use the linear perturbation theory of the relativistic\nequations of motion, utilising a strict thermodynamic equilibrium model that\nrelates the radiation energy density to the plasma temperature. Results: It is\nshown that a wave mode corresponding to the postulated baryon acoustic waves\nexists with a phase velocity close to the speed of light, but the participation\nof the dark matter in this mode is very small.

In this paper, we adapt the online\nMondrian forest classification algorithm to work with memory constraints on\ndata streams. In particular, we design five out-of-memory strategies to update\nMondrian trees with new data points when the memory limit is reached. Moreover,\nwe design trimming mechanisms to make Mondrian trees more robust to concept\ndrifts under memory constraints. We evaluate our algorithms on a variety of\nreal and simulated datasets, and we conclude with recommendations on their use\nin different situations: the Extend Node strategy appears as the best\nout-of-memory strategy in all configurations, whereas different trimming\nmechanisms should be adopted depending on whether a concept drift is expected.\nAll our methods are implemented in the OrpailleCC open-source library and are\nready to be used on embedded systems and connected objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 15:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

The method utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) to\nconstruct a model for the flow map of the unknown system. Once an accurate DNN\napproximation of the flow map is constructed, it can be recursively executed to\nserve as an effective predictive model of the unknown system. In this paper, we\napply this framework to chaotic systems, in particular the well-known Lorenz 63\nand 96 systems, and critically examine the predictive performance of the\napproach. A distinct feature of chaotic systems is that even the smallest\nperturbations will lead to large (albeit bounded) deviations in the solution\ntrajectories. This makes long-term predictions of the method, or any data\ndriven methods, questionable, as the local model accuracy will eventually\ndegrade and lead to large pointwise errors. Here we employ several other\nqualitative and quantitative measures to determine whether the chaotic dynamics\nhave been learned. These include phase plots, histograms, autocorrelation,\ncorrelation dimension, approximate entropy, and Lyapunov exponent. Using these\nmeasures, we demonstrate that the flow map based DNN learning method is capable\nof accurately modeling chaotic systems, even when only a subset of the state\nvariables are available to the DNNs. For example, for the Lorenz 96 system with\n40 state variables, when data of only 3 variables are available, the method is\nable to learn an effective DNN model for the 3 variables and produce accurately\nthe chaotic behavior of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 00:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}
