In the first part of the thesis, we study the loop\namplitudes in self-dual Yang-Mills. We show that the four point one-loop\namplitude can be reduced to a computation of shifts, which strongly suggests a\ncase for an anomaly interpretation. We next propose a new formula for the\none-loop amplitudes at all multiplicity, in terms of the Berends-Giele currents\nconnected by an effective propagator. We prove the formula by observing that it\nreadily implies the correct collinear properties. To demonstrate the validity\nof our formula, we do an explicit computation at 3, 4 and 5 points and\nreproduce the known results. The region momenta variables play an important\nrole in our formula and thus it points to both the worldsheet and the momentum\ntwistor interpretations.

Our work attempts to fill this vacancy. Inspired by\ntask-oriented dialogue systems, we propose a novel empathetic response\ngeneration model with emotion-aware dialogue management. The emotion-aware\ndialogue management contains two parts: (1) Emotion state tracking maintains\nthe current emotion state of the user and (2) Empathetic dialogue policy\nselection predicts a target emotion and a user's intent based on the results of\nthe emotion state tracking. The predicted information is then used to guide the\ngeneration of responses. Experimental results show that dynamically managing\ndifferent information can help the model generate more empathetic responses\ncompared with several baselines under both automatic and human evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 16:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 03:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Some recent works show that, in\nlow-light conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust\nthan detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To\nimprove detection performance in low-light conditions, one can fine-tune the\ndetector to use raw image data or use a dedicated low-light neural pipeline\ntrained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the\nimage. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity\nand learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific\ncolor space.

Moreover, we propose to\ntrain our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector\nand avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather\noptimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference\nstage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive\nexperiments to compare our method to other low-light image restoration and\nenhancement methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that\nGenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors.

If in principle, the entire\nperturbative series is void of this issue, in practice the perturbative\ncorrections are known up to a certain order of accuracy and scale invariance is\nonly approximated leading to the so-called scheme and scale ambiguities.\nAccording to the conventional scale setting (CSS) this problem cannot be\navoided and the renormalization scale is set to the typical scale of a process\n$Q$, and errors are estimated by varying the scale over a range of two\n$[Q/2;2Q]$. This method is not void of ambiguities and leads to predictions\naffected by large theoretical errors.

In the classic setup, picking up at one\nextreme and pulling off results in a peeling force that is a decreasing\nfunction of the pickup angle. As one end is lifted, the detachment front\nretracts to meet the immobile tail. At the nanoscale, interesting situations\narise with the peeling of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) on gold, as realized,\ne.g., by atomic force microscopy. The nanosized system shows a constant-force\nsteady peeling regime, where the tip lifting h produces no retraction of the\nribbon detachment point, and just an advancement h of the free tail end. This\nis opposite to the classic case, where the detachment point retracts and the\ntail end stands still. Here we characterise, by analytical modeling and\nnumerical simulations, a third, experimentally relevant, setup where the\nnanoribbon, albeit structurally lubric, does not have a freely moving tail end,\nwhich is instead elastically tethered. Surprisingly, novel nontrivial scaling\nexponents appear that regulate the peeling evolution. As the detachment front\nretracts and the tethered tail is stretched, power laws of h characterize the\nshrinking of the adhered length the growth of peeling force and the peeling\nangle. These exponents precede the final total detachment as a critical point,\nwhere the entire ribbon eventually hangs suspended between the tip and\ntethering spring. These analytical predictions are confirmed by realistic MD\nsimulations, retaining the full atomistic description, also confirming their\nsurvival at finite experimental temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 19:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

The $0^+$ energy level of the carbon\nnucleus allows for resonant nuclear reactions, which act to greatly increase\nthe carbon yields compared to the non-resonant case. Many authors have argued\nthat small changes to the energy level of this resonance would lead to a\nsignificantly lower carbon abundance in the universe, and this sensitivity is\noften considered an example of fine-tuning. By considering spallation reactions\noccuring during the process of planet formation, this paper presents a partial\nsolution to this triple alpha fine-tuning problem. Young stellar objects\ngenerate substantial luminosities of particle radiation (cosmic rays) that can\ndrive nuclear reactions through spallation. If the standard triple alpha\nprocess is inoperative, stars tend to synthesize oxygen (and other alpha\nelements) rather than carbon. Cosmic rays can interact with oxygen nuclei to\nproduce carbon while planets are forming. The resulting carbon abundances are\nsignificant, but much smaller than those observed in our universe. However, for\na range of conditions -- as delineated herein -- spallation reactions can\nresult in carbon-to-oxygen ratios roughly comparable to those found on Earth\nand thereby obviate the triple alpha fine-tuning problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 21:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In some cases it is required to\nrepresent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to\npartition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to\neach bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure --\napplying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to\nquantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example,\nfor $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation\nimproves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.5 (0.1)$ bits/entry to\n$10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our\ncompander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to\n$10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data\n(word frequencies in books and DNA $k$-mer counts) and for synthetic randomly\ngenerated distributions. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality\ncriterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\\propto~\n\\mathrm{ArcSinh}(\\sqrt{(1/2) (K \\log K) x})$ achieves near-optimal performance,\nattaining a KL-quantization loss of $\\asymp 2^{-2b} \\log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter\nalphabet and $b\\to \\infty$. Interestingly, a similar minimax criterion for the\nquadratic loss on the hypercube shows optimality of the standard uniform\nquantizer.

In general, those approaches assume that the depth of\neach pixel follows a unimodal distribution. Boundary pixels usually follow a\nmulti-modal distribution as they represent different depths; Therefore, the\nassumption results in an erroneous depth prediction at the coarser level of the\ncost volume pyramid and can not be corrected in the refinement levels leading\nto wrong depth predictions. In contrast, we propose constructing the cost\nvolume by non-parametric depth distribution modeling to handle pixels with\nunimodal and multi-modal distributions. Our approach outputs multiple depth\nhypotheses at the coarser level to avoid errors in the early stage. As we\nperform local search around these multiple hypotheses in subsequent levels, our\napproach does not maintain the rigid depth spatial ordering and, therefore, we\nintroduce a sparse cost aggregation network to derive information within each\nvolume. We evaluate our approach extensively on two benchmark datasets: DTU and\nTanks & Temples.

As a result, RE still suffers from unintended\nentity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and\nrelations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that\ndo not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the\nentity mentions to prevent the RE models from overfitting entity mentions.\nHowever, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the\nsemantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CORE\n(Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that\nguides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without\nlosing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which\nmodels the dependencies between variables in RE models.

In situations where\nthe training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical\napproach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD\nperformance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a\nnon-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain,\nespecially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student\nframework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class\ndomain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework\nutilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this\nframework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide\ndiscriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are\ntrained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for\ngenuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity\nscore between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used\nto distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework\nunder one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and\nconducted extensive experiments.

It was believed that minutiae\ntemplates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint image,\nbut this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning\nhas resulted in alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the\nhope that they might offer better recognition accuracy as well as\nnon-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate whether deep\nfingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the\nminutiae templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to\nproduce a fingerprint image that could be matched to its source image, deep\ntemplates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks than minutiae templates.\nIn particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates yield a\nTAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a\nstate-of-the-art commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The\ncorresponding attack performance for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep\ntemplates using the same commercial matcher yields a TAR of less than 1% for\nboth type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images are\nmatched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for\ntype-I (type-II) attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous\nfingerprint template inversion studies is an evaluation of the black-box attack\nperformance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art fingerprint\nmatchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae\ntemplates are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack\nevaluations, while fingerprint images generated by deep templates are resistant\nto black-box evaluations and comparatively less susceptible to white-box\nevaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 07:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

In practice, it also\naffects their implementation where the simplest approach to overcome this is to\ncontinue to sample according to the original bandit algorithm, ignoring missing\noutcomes. We investigate the impact on performance of this approach to deal\nwith missing data for several bandit algorithms through an extensive simulation\nstudy assuming the rewards are missing at random. We focus on two-armed bandit\nalgorithms with binary outcomes in the context of patient allocation for\nclinical trials with relatively small sample sizes. However, our results apply\nto other applications of bandit algorithms where missing data is expected to\noccur. We assess the resulting operating characteristics, including the\nexpected reward. Different probabilities of missingness in both arms are\nconsidered. The key finding of our work is that when using the simplest\nstrategy of ignoring missing data, the impact on the expected performance of\nmulti-armed bandit strategies varies according to the way these strategies\nbalance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Algorithms that are geared\ntowards exploration continue to assign samples to the arm with more missing\nresponses (which being perceived as the arm with less observed information is\ndeemed more appealing by the algorithm than it would otherwise be). In\ncontrast, algorithms that are geared towards exploitation would rapidly assign\na high value to samples from the arms with a current high mean irrespective of\nthe level observations per arm. Furthermore, for algorithms focusing more on\nexploration, we illustrate that the problem of missing responses can be\nalleviated using a simple mean imputation approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 09:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 13:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Nevertheless,\nthe amount of public real-world text images has increased significantly lately,\nincluding a great deal of unlabeled data. Leveraging these resources requires\nsemi-supervised approaches; however, the few existing methods do not account\nfor vision-language multimodality structure and therefore suboptimal for\nstate-of-the-art multimodal architectures. To bridge this gap, we present\nsemi-supervised learning for multimodal text recognizers (SemiMTR) that\nleverages unlabeled data at each modality training phase. Notably, our method\nrefrains from extra training stages and maintains the current three-stage\nmultimodal training procedure. Our algorithm starts by pretraining the vision\nmodel through a single-stage training that unifies self-supervised learning\nwith supervised training. More specifically, we extend an existing visual\nrepresentation learning algorithm and propose the first contrastive-based\nmethod for scene text recognition. After pretraining the language model on a\ntext corpus, we fine-tune the entire network via a sequential, character-level,\nconsistency regularization between weakly and strongly augmented views of text\nimages. In a novel setup, consistency is enforced on each modality separately.\nExtensive experiments validate that our method outperforms the current training\nschemes and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text\nrecognition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 13:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

By\ntransferring knowledge learnt from a data-rich cuisine to a data-scarce\ncuisine, domain adaptation sheds light on this practical problem. Nevertheless,\nexisting works assume recipes in source and target domains are mostly\noriginated from the same cuisine and written in the same language. This paper\nstudies unsupervised domain adaptation for image-to-recipe retrieval, where\nrecipes in source and target domains are in different languages. Moreover, only\nrecipes are available for training in the target domain. A novel recipe mixup\nmethod is proposed to learn transferable embedding features between the two\ndomains. Specifically, recipe mixup produces mixed recipes to form an\nintermediate domain by discretely exchanging the section(s) between source and\ntarget recipes. To bridge the domain gap, recipe mixup loss is proposed to\nenforce the intermediate domain to locate in the shortest geodesic path between\nsource and target domains in the recipe embedding space. By using Recipe 1M\ndataset as source domain (English) and Vireo-FoodTransfer dataset as target\ndomain (Chinese), empirical experiments verify the effectiveness of recipe\nmixup for cross-lingual adaptation in the context of image-to-recipe retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 15:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

In this paper, our ConvMAE framework\ndemonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more\ndiscriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme. However,\ndirectly using the original masking strategy leads to the heavy computational\ncost and pretraining-finetuning discrepancy.

We study the impact of differential privacy on experiments\nand theoretically analyze the change in sample size required due to the\nGaussian mechanisms. Further, we provide an empirical method to improve the\naccuracy of private statistics with simple bootstrapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 17:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

While proponents of a well-functioning market\npredictors believe that it is difficult to accurately predict market prices but\nmany scholars disagree. Robust and accurate prediction systems will not only be\nhelpful to the businesses but also to the individuals in making their financial\ninvestments. This paper presents an LSTM model with two different input\napproaches for predicting the short-term stock prices of two Indian companies,\nReliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. Ten years of historic data (2012-2021) is\ntaken from the yahoo finance website to carry out analysis of proposed\napproaches. In the first approach, closing prices of two selected companies are\ndirectly applied on univariate LSTM model. For the approach second, technical\nindicators values are calculated from the closing prices and then collectively\napplied on Multivariate LSTM model. Short term market behaviour for upcoming\ndays is evaluated. Experimental outcomes revel that approach one is useful to\ndetermine the future trend but multivariate LSTM model with technical\nindicators found to be useful in accurately predicting the future price\nbehaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 07:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Several of the triplets are found to exhibit extraordinarily large spin\ncoherence times making them interesting for quantum information processing. The\ndependence of the spin coherence time on various factors, including the\nhyperfine coupling strength, the dipole-dipole coupling, and the nuclear\ng-factors, are systematically investigated. The analysis shows that the spin\ncoherence time is insensitive to the atomistic details of the defect center and\nrather is dictated by the nuclear spin properties of the host material.\nSymbolic regression is then used to derive a simple expression for spin\ncoherence time, which is validated on a test set of 55 doublet defects unseen\nby the regression model. The simple expression permits order-of-magnitude\nestimates of the spin coherence time without expensive first principles\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 07:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2022 21:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

However, significant performance degradation suffered by\ndeep learning models due to the inherent noise present in the analog\ncomputation can limit their use in mission-critical applications. Hence, there\nis a need to understand the impact of critical model hyperparameters choice on\nthe resulting model noise-resistant property. This need is critical as the\ninsight obtained can be used to design deep learning models that are robust to\nanalog noise. In this paper, the impact of the learning rate, a critical design\nchoice, on the noise-resistant property is investigated. The study is achieved\nby first training deep learning models using different learning rates.\nThereafter, the models are injected with analog noise and the noise-resistant\nproperty of the resulting models is examined by measuring the performance\ndegradation due to the analog noise. The results showed there exists a sweet\nspot of learning rate values that achieves a good balance between model\nprediction performance and model noise-resistant property. Furthermore, the\ntheoretical justification of the observed phenomenon is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 00:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Despite the promising performance of existing methods, most\nof their success comes from the privileged information of well-designed\ninput-output examples. However, providing such input-output examples is\nunrealistic because it requires the users to have the ability to describe the\nunderlying program with a few input-output examples under the training\ndistribution. In this work, we propose a query-based framework that trains a\nquery neural network to generate informative input-output examples\nautomatically and interactively from a large query space. The quality of the\nquery depends on the amount of the mutual information between the query and the\ncorresponding program, which can guide the optimization of the query framework.\nTo estimate the mutual information more accurately, we introduce the functional\nspace (F-space) which models the relevance between the input-output examples\nand the programs in a differentiable way. We evaluate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of the proposed query-based framework on the Karel task and the\nlist processing task. Experimental results show that the query-based framework\ncan generate informative input-output examples which achieve and even\noutperform well-designed input-output examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 13:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

To reduce the\noutage probability and improve the quality of service, existing researches\nusually rely on the assumption of both exact instantaneous channel state\ninformation (CSI) and environmental uncertainty. However, it is difficult to\nobtain perfect instantaneous CSI immediately under practical situations where\nchannel states change rapidly, and the uncertainty in communication\nenvironments may not be observed, which makes traditional methods not\napplicable. Therefore, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL) methods for\nsolutions, which do not need any prior knowledge of underlying channel or\nassumptions of environmental uncertainty. RL method is to learn from the\ninteraction with communication environment, optimize its action policy, and\nthen propose relay selection and power allocation schemes. We first analyse the\nrobustness of RL action policy by giving the lower bound of the worst-case\nperformance, when RL methods are applied to communication scenarios with\nenvironment uncertainty. Then, we propose a robust algorithm for outage\nprobability minimization based on RL. Simulation results reveal that compared\nwith traditional RL methods, our approach has better generalization ability and\ncan improve the worst-case performance by about 6% when evaluated in unseen\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 10:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}
