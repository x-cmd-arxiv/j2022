Existing DABP approaches mostly rely on model\ndistillation from the black-box predictor, \\emph{i.e.}, training the model with\nits noisy target-domain predictions, which however inevitably introduces the\nconfirmation bias accumulated from the prediction noises. To mitigate such\nbias, we propose a new method, named BETA, to incorporate knowledge\ndistillation and noisy label learning into one coherent framework. This is\nenabled by a new divide-to-adapt strategy. BETA divides the target domain into\nan easy-to-adapt subdomain with less noise and a hard-to-adapt subdomain. Then\nit deploys mutually-teaching twin networks to filter the predictor errors for\neach other and improve them progressively, from the easy to hard subdomains. As\nsuch, BETA effectively purifies the noisy labels and reduces error\naccumulation.

Although the mechanism of segregation of\nsingle light impurities, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in Si-based\nsystems is known, it is only in the presence of multiple segregations that the\ndistinctive structures of the various interstitial impurities emerge.

This\nlimitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating\nmore qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a\nquantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a\nresult, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC\npractical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in\nbenchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals.\nNonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot\nprovide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as\nan accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We\ndemonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis\ncan yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular\nHamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the\nimproved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational\nfrequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that\nthe results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we\nachieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the\nfull configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas\nthe computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our\nwork provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular\nHamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time\ndemonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are\npossible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 16:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

However, these models are\nvulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe\nsecurity threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of\ntraining data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but\ngives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most\nresearch in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks\non object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object\ndetection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive\napplications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object\ndetection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose\nfour kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation\nAttack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2)\nRegional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a\nsurrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a\nsingle trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the\ntarget class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the\ndetector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate\nmetrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform\nexperiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3\non different datasets. More crucially, we demonstrate that even fine-tuning on\nanother benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object\ndetection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector\nCleanse, an entropy-based run-time detection framework to identify poisoned\ntesting samples for any deployed object detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 18:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

When the seed set is 3 or larger Steiner\nminimal tree - min-weight acyclic connected subgraph (of the input graph) that\ncontains all the seed vertices - is an attractive generalization of shortest\nweighted paths. In general, computing a Steiner minimal tree is NP-hard, but\nseveral polynomial-time algorithms have been designed and proven to yield\nSteiner trees whose total weight is bounded within 2 times the Steiner minimal\ntree. In this paper, we present a parallel 2-approximation Steiner minimal tree\nalgorithm and its MPI-based distributed implementation. In place of distance\ncomputation between all pairs of seed vertices, an expensive phase in many\nalgorithms, our solution exploits Voronoi cell computation.

In this paper, we explore the\neffect of these dynamics in quantum generative modeling by introducing a model\nthat adds non-linear activations via a neural network structure onto the\nstandard Born Machine framework - the Quantum Neuron Born Machine (QNBM). To\nachieve this, we utilize a previously introduced Quantum Neuron subroutine,\nwhich is a repeat-until-success circuit with mid-circuit measurements and\nclassical control. After introducing the QNBM, we investigate how its\nperformance depends on network size, by training a 3-layer QNBM with 4 output\nneurons and various input and hidden layer sizes. We then compare our\nnon-linear QNBM to the linear Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We allocate\nsimilar time and memory resources to each model, such that the only major\ndifference is the qubit overhead required by the QNBM. With gradient-based\ntraining, we show that while both models can easily learn a trivial uniform\nprobability distribution, on a more challenging class of distributions, the\nQNBM achieves an almost 3x smaller error rate than a QCBM with a similar number\nof tunable parameters.

However, the large network\ncomplexity prohibits the usage of LIC on resource-limited embedded systems.\nNetwork quantization is an efficient way to reduce the network burden. This\npaper presents a quantized LIC (QLIC) by channel splitting. First, we explore\nthat the influence of quantization error to the reconstruction error is\ndifferent for various channels. Second, we split the channels whose\nquantization has larger influence to the reconstruction error. After the\nsplitting, the dynamic range of channels is reduced so that the quantization\nerror can be reduced. Finally, we prune several channels to keep the number of\noverall channels as origin. By using the proposal, in the case of 8-bit\nquantization for weight and activation of both main and hyper path, we can\nreduce the BD-rate by 0.61%-4.74% compared with the previous QLIC. Besides, we\ncan reach better coding gain compared with the state-of-the-art network\nquantization method when quantizing MS-SSIM models.

While there has been a variety of\nsuccessful demonstrations of these technologies, critical system failures have\nrepeatedly been reported. Even if rare, such system failures pose a serious\nbarrier to adoption without a rigorous risk assessment. This paper presents a\nframework for the systematic and rigorous risk verification of systems. We\nconsider a wide range of system specifications formulated in signal temporal\nlogic (STL) and model the system as a stochastic process, permitting\ndiscrete-time and continuous-time stochastic processes. We then define the STL\nrobustness risk as the risk of lacking robustness against failure. This\ndefinition is motivated as system failures are often caused by missing\nrobustness to modeling errors, system disturbances, and distribution shifts in\nthe underlying data generating process. Within the definition, we permit\ngeneral classes of risk measures and focus on tail risk measures such as the\nvalue-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk. While the STL robustness risk\nis in general hard to compute, we propose the approximate STL robustness risk\nas a more tractable notion that upper bounds the STL robustness risk. We show\nhow the approximate STL robustness risk can accurately be estimated from system\ntrajectory data. For discrete-time stochastic processes, we show under which\nconditions the approximate STL robustness risk can even be computed exactly. We\nillustrate our verification algorithm in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA\nand show how a least risky controller can be selected among four neural network\nlane keeping controllers for five meaningful system specifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 21:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 15:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Existing\nliterature, such as feature engineering and representation learning, is limited\nin achieving full automation (e.g., over heavy reliance on intensive labor and\nempirical experiences), explainable explicitness (e.g., traceable\nreconstruction process and explainable new features), and flexible optimal\n(e.g., optimal feature space reconstruction is not embedded into downstream\ntasks). Can we simultaneously address the automation, explicitness, and optimal\nchallenges in representation space reconstruction for a machine learning task?\nTo answer this question, we propose a group-wise reinforcement generation\nperspective. We reformulate representation space reconstruction into an\ninteractive process of nested feature generation and selection, where feature\ngeneration is to generate new meaningful and explicit features, and feature\nselection is to eliminate redundant features to control feature sizes. We\ndevelop a cascading reinforcement learning method that leverages three\ncascading Markov Decision Processes to learn optimal generation policies to\nautomate the selection of features and operations and the feature crossing. We\ndesign a group-wise generation strategy to cross a feature group, an operation,\nand another feature group to generate new features and find the strategy that\ncan enhance exploration efficiency and augment reward signals of cascading\nagents.

The temporal aspect\nof locality is extremely well studied and understood, but the spatial aspect\nmuch less so. We seek to gain an increased understanding of spatial locality by\ndefining and studying the Granularity-Change Caching Problem. This problem\nmodifies the traditional caching setup by grouping data items into blocks, such\nthat a cache can choose any subset of a block to load for the same cost as\nloading any individual item in the block.\n  We show that modeling such spatial locality significantly changes the caching\nproblem. This begins with a proof that Granularity-Change Caching is\nNP-Complete in the offline setting, even when all items have unit size and all\nblocks have unit load cost. In the online setting, we show a lower bound for\ncompetitive ratios of deterministic policies that is significantly worse than\ntraditional caching. Moreover, we present a deterministic replacement policy\ncalled Item-Block Layered Partitioning and show that it obtains a competitive\nratio close to that lower bound. Moreover, our bounds reveal a new issue\narising in the Granularity-Change Caching Problem where the choice of offline\ncache size affects the competitiveness of different online algorithms relative\nto one another. To deal with this issue, we extend a prior (temporal) locality\nmodel to account for spatial locality, and provide a general lower bound in\naddition to an upper bound for Item-Block Layered Partitioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 23:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Finding such good solutions is an important goal of learning systems in\ngeneral and neuronal circuits in particular. For systems operating with static\ninputs and outputs, a well known approach to the problem is the large margin\nmethods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). By maximizing the distance of\nthe data vectors from the decision surface, these solutions enjoy increased\nrobustness to noise and enhanced generalization abilities. Furthermore, the use\nof the kernel method enables SVMs to perform classification tasks that require\nnonlinear decision surfaces. However, for dynamical systems with event based\noutputs, such as spiking neural networks and other continuous time threshold\ncrossing systems, this optimality criterion is inapplicable due to the strong\ntemporal correlations in their input and output. We introduce a novel extension\nof the static SVMs - The Temporal Support Vector Machine (T-SVM). The T-SVM\nfinds a solution that maximizes a new construct - the dynamical margin. We show\nthat T-SVM and its kernel extensions generate robust synaptic weight vectors in\nspiking neurons and enable their learning of tasks that require nonlinear\nspatial integration of synaptic inputs.

To protect the\nsensitive features $S$ correlated with some useful data $X$, LIP restricts the\nlift, the ratio of the posterior belief to the prior on $S$ after and before\naccessing $X$. For each $x$, both maximum and minimum lift over sensitive\nfeatures are measures of the privacy risk of publishing this symbol and should\nbe restricted for the privacy-preserving purpose. Previous works enforce the\nsame bound for both max-lift and min-lift. However, empirical observations show\nthat the min-lift is usually much smaller than the max-lift. In this work, we\ngeneralize the LIP definition to consider the unequal values of max and min\nlift, i.e., considering different bounds for max-lift and min-lift. This new\ndefinition is applied to the watchdog privacy mechanism. We demonstrate that\nthe utility is enhanced under a given privacy constraint on local differential\nprivacy.

To ensure the well-balance, positivity-preserving, and\nhigh-order properties, a DG-interpolation scheme (with or without scaling\npositivity-preserving limiter) and special treatments pertaining to the Ripa\nmodel are employed in the transfer of both the flow variables and bottom\ntopography from the old mesh to the new one and in the TVB limiting process.\nMesh adaptivity is realized using an MMPDE moving mesh approach and a metric\ntensor based on an equilibrium variable and water depth.

Owing to privacy concerns\nand heavy data transmission, source-free UDA, exploiting the pre-trained source\nmodels instead of the raw source data for target learning, has been gaining\npopularity in recent years. Some works attempt to recover unseen source domains\nwith generative models, however introducing additional network parameters.\nOther works propose to fine-tune the source model by pseudo labels, while noisy\npseudo labels may misguide the decision boundary, leading to unsatisfied\nresults. To tackle these issues, we propose an effective method named\nProxy-based Mixup training with label refinery (ProxyMix). First of all, to\navoid additional parameters and explore the information in the source model,\nProxyMix defines the weights of the classifier as the class prototypes and then\nconstructs a class-balanced proxy source domain by the nearest neighbors of the\nprototypes to bridge the unseen source domain and the target domain. To improve\nthe reliability of pseudo labels, we further propose the frequency-weighted\naggregation strategy to generate soft pseudo labels for unlabeled target data.\nThe proposed strategy exploits the internal structure of target features, pulls\ntarget features to their semantic neighbors, and increases the weights of\nlow-frequency classes samples during gradient updating. With the proxy domain\nand the reliable pseudo labels, we employ two kinds of mixup regularization,\ni.e., inter- and intra-domain mixup, in our framework, to align the proxy and\nthe target domain, enforcing the consistency of predictions, thereby further\nmitigating the negative impacts of noisy labels.

Yet, as adherent raindrops are\ndiverse in sizes and appearances, the detection is challenging for both single\nimage and video. Moreover, unlike rain streaks, adherent raindrops tend to\ncover the same area in several frames. Addressing these problems, our method\nemploys a two-stage video-based raindrop removal method. The first stage is the\nsingle image module, which generates initial clean results. The second stage is\nthe multiple frame module, which further refines the initial results using\ntemporal constraints, namely, by utilizing multiple input frames in our process\nand applying temporal consistency between adjacent output frames. Our single\nimage module employs a raindrop removal network to generate initial raindrop\nremoval results, and create a mask representing the differences between the\ninput and initial output. Once the masks and initial results for consecutive\nframes are obtained, our multiple-frame module aligns the frames in both the\nimage and feature levels and then obtains the clean background. Our method\ninitially employs optical flow to align the frames, and then utilizes\ndeformable convolution layers further to achieve feature-level frame alignment.\nTo remove small raindrops and recover correct backgrounds, a target frame is\npredicted from adjacent frames.

In this paper, we introduce a learnable embedding dubbed receptive\ntoken to localize those pixels of interests (PoIs) in the feature map, with a\ndistillation mask generated via pixel-wise attention. Then the distillation\nwill be performed on the mask via pixel-wise reconstruction.

Recent debiasing\napproaches commonly use two components for debiasing, a biased model $f_B$ and\na debiased model $f_D$. $f_B$ is trained to focus on bias-aligned samples\n(i.e., overfitted to the bias) while $f_D$ is mainly trained with\nbias-conflicting samples by concentrating on samples which $f_B$ fails to\nlearn, leading $f_D$ to be less susceptible to the dataset bias.

Data augmentation (DA) tackles data\nscarcity by creating new labelled data from available ones. Different DA\nmethods have different mechanisms and therefore using their generated labelled\ndata for DNN training may help improving DNN's generalisation to different\ndegrees. Combining multiple DA methods, namely multi-DA, for DNN training,\nprovides a way to boost generalisation. Among existing multi-DA based DNN\ntraining methods, those relying on knowledge distillation (KD) have received\ngreat attention. They leverage knowledge transfer to utilise the labelled data\nsets created by multiple DA methods instead of directly combining them for\ntraining DNNs. However, existing KD-based methods can only utilise certain\ntypes of DA methods, incapable of utilising the advantages of arbitrary DA\nmethods. We propose a general multi-DA based DNN training framework capable to\nuse arbitrary DA methods. To train a DNN, our framework replicates a certain\nportion in the latter part of the DNN into multiple copies, leading to multiple\nDNNs with shared blocks in their former parts and independent blocks in their\nlatter parts. Each of these DNNs is associated with a unique DA and a newly\ndevised loss that allows comprehensively learning from the data generated by\nall DA methods and the outputs from all DNNs in an online and adaptive way. The\noverall loss, i.e., the sum of each DNN's loss, is used for training the DNN.\nEventually, one of the DNNs with the best validation performance is chosen for\ninference.

However, still, there\nare many complications in the training of PINNs and optimal interleaving of\nphysical models. Here, we introduced the concept of Physical Activation\nFunctions (PAFs). This concept offers that instead of using general activation\nfunctions (AFs) such as ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid for all the neurons, one can\nuse generic AFs that their mathematical expression is inherited from the\nphysical laws of the investigating phenomena. The formula of PAFs may be\ninspired by the terms in the analytical solution of the problem. We showed that\nthe PAFs can be inspired by any mathematical formula related to the\ninvestigating phenomena such as the initial or boundary conditions of the PDE\nsystem. We validated the advantages of PAFs for several PDEs including the\nharmonic oscillations, Burgers, Advection-Convection equation, and the\nheterogeneous diffusion equations. The main advantage of PAFs was in the more\nefficient constraining and interleaving of PINNs with the investigating\nphysical phenomena and their underlying mathematical models. This added\nconstraint significantly improved the predictions of PINNs for the testing data\nthat was out-of-training distribution. Furthermore, the application of PAFs\nreduced the size of the PINNs up to 75% in different cases. Also, the value of\nloss terms was reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in some cases which is\nnoteworthy for upgrading the training of the PINNs. The iterations required for\nfinding the optimum values were also significantly reduced. It is concluded\nthat using the PAFs helps in generating PINNs with less complexity and much\nmore validity for longer ranges of prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 11:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Each of\nthese processes is essential for human and ecosystem well-being. Predicting how\nthe water cycle responds to changes in vegetation cover remains a challenge.\nRecently, changes in plant transpiration across the Amazon basin were shown to\nbe associated disproportionately with changes in rainfall, suggesting that even\nsmall declines in transpiration (e.g., from deforestation) would lead to much\nlarger declines in rainfall. Here, constraining these results by the law of\nmass conservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere, forest\ntranspiration can control atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased\ntranspiration enhances atmospheric moisture import and resulting water yield.\nConversely, in a sufficiently dry atmosphere increased transpiration reduces\natmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. This previously unrecognized\ndichotomy can explain the otherwise mixed observations of how water yield\nresponds to re-greening, as we illustrate with examples from China's Loess\nPlateau. Our analysis indicates that any additional precipitation recycling by\nadditional vegetation increases precipitation but decreases local water yield\nand steady-state runoff. Therefore, in the drier regions and early stages of\necological restoration, the role of vegetation can be confined to precipitation\nrecycling, while once a wetter stage is achieved, additional vegetation\nenhances atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield.

To\nmitigate these costs, the processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm moves computation\ncloser to where the data resides, reducing (and in some cases eliminating) the\nneed to move data between memory and the processor. There are two main\napproaches to PIM: (1) processing-near-memory (PnM), where PIM logic is added\nto the same die as memory or to the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory; and (2)\nprocessing-using-memory (PuM), which uses the operational principles of memory\ncells to perform computation. Many works from academia and industry have shown\nthe benefits of PnM and PuM for a wide range of workloads from different\ndomains. However, fully adopting PIM in commercial systems is still very\nchallenging due to the lack of tools and system support for PIM architectures\nacross the computer architecture stack, which includes: (i) workload\ncharacterization methodologies and benchmark suites targeting PIM\narchitectures; (ii) frameworks that can facilitate the implementation of\ncomplex operations and algorithms using the underlying PIM primitives; (iii)\ncompiler support and compiler optimizations targeting PIM architectures; (iv)\noperating system support for PIM-aware virtual memory, memory management, data\nallocation, and data mapping; and (v) efficient data coherence and consistency\nmechanisms. Our goal in this work is to provide tools and system support for\nPnM and PuM architectures, aiming to ease the adoption of PIM in current and\nfuture systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 12:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 16:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

The approach is\napplied to the experimentally accessible binary mixtures $^{85}$Rb-$^{133}$Cs\nand $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb, which allow us to verify the effect of mass\ndifferences in the dynamics.

Unfortunately, this data\nmovement is a major bottleneck for system performance and energy consumption.\nOne promising execution paradigm that alleviates the data movement bottleneck\nin modern and emerging applications is processing-in-memory (PIM), where the\ncost of data movement to/from main memory is reduced by placing computation\ncapabilities close to memory.\n  Naively employing PIM to accelerate data-intensive workloads can lead to\nsub-optimal performance due to the many design constraints PIM substrates\nimpose. Therefore, many recent works co-design specialized PIM accelerators and\nalgorithms to improve performance and reduce the energy consumption of (i)\napplications from various application domains; and (ii) various computing\nenvironments, including cloud systems, mobile systems, and edge devices.\n  We showcase the benefits of co-designing algorithms and hardware in a way\nthat efficiently takes advantage of the PIM paradigm for two modern\ndata-intensive applications: (1) machine learning inference models for edge\ndevices and (2) hybrid transactional/analytical processing databases for cloud\nsystems. We follow a two-step approach in our system design. In the first step,\nwe extensively analyze the computation and memory access patterns of each\napplication to gain insights into its hardware/software requirements and major\nsources of performance and energy bottlenecks in processor-centric systems.

For\nthe future multi-domain physical network modeling with the characteristics of\ndynamics, heterogeneity, privacy, and real-time, the existing related works\nperform satisfactorily. Federated learning (FL) jointly optimizes the network\nby sharing parameters among multiple parties and is widely employed in disputes\nover data privacy and data silos. Aiming at the NV challenge of multi-domain\nphysical networks, this work is the first to propose using FL to model VNE, and\npresents a VNE architecture based on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL)\n(HFL-VNE). Specifically, combined with the distributed training paradigm of FL,\nwe deploy local servers in each physical domain, which can effectively focus on\nlocal features and reduce resource fragmentation. A global server is deployed\nto aggregate and share training parameters, which enhances local data privacy\nand significantly improves learning efficiency. Furthermore, we deploy the Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) model in each server to dynamically adjust and\noptimize the resource allocation of the multi-domain physical network. In\nDRL-assisted FL, HFL-VNE jointly optimizes decision-making through specific\nlocal and federated reward mechanisms and loss functions.

The medium-induced gluon radiation for a massive\nquark will be suppressed relative to that of a light quark due to the dead-cone\neffect. The development of new declustering techniques of jet evolution makes a\ndirect study of the dead-cone effect in the QCD medium possible for the first\ntime. In this work, we compute the emission angle distribution of the\ncharm-quark initiated splittings in $\\rm D^0$ meson tagged jet and that of the\nlight parton initiated splittings in inclusive jets in p+p and Pb+Pb at\n$5.02$~TeV by utilizing the declustering techniques of jet evolution. The heavy\nquark propagation and indued energy loss in the QCD medium are simulated with\nthe SHELL model based on the Langevin equation. When comparing the jet number\nnormalized emission angle distributions of the charm-quark initiated splittings\nand that of the light parton initiated splittings by directly taking their\nratios at the same energy intervals of the initial parton, one can find the\ncharm-quark initiated splittings will be suppressed at smaller emission angle\ncorresponding to the dead-cone effect.

Our results\nagree with known expressions for spin transfer and spin pumping in terms of\ntransverse (mixing) conductances when there are no fluctuations.

For a\nminimal auto-regressive (AR) learning model trained on this task, we identify\ntwo learning regimes corresponding to distinct phases in the stationary state\nof the SSOU process. These phases emerge from the interplay between two\ndifferent time scales that govern the sequence statistics. Moreover, we observe\nthat while increasing the memory of the AR model always improves performance,\nincreasing the non-Markovianity of the input sequences can improve or degrade\nperformance. Finally, our experiments with recurrent and convolutional neural\nnetworks show that our observations carry over to more complicated neural\nnetwork architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 14:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

One such attack that has garnered recent attention is\nthe adversarial backdoor attack, which has demonstrated the capability to\nperform targeted misclassification of specific examples. In particular,\nbackdoor attacks attempt to force a model to learn spurious relations between\nbackdoor trigger patterns and false labels. In response to this threat,\nnumerous defensive measures have been proposed; however, defenses against\nbackdoor attacks focus on backdoor pattern detection, which may be unreliable\nagainst novel or unexpected types of backdoor pattern designs. We introduce a\nnovel re-contextualization of the adversarial setting, where the presence of an\nadversary implicitly admits the existence of multiple database contributors.\nThen, under the mild assumption of contributor awareness, it becomes possible\nto exploit this knowledge to defend against backdoor attacks by destroying the\nfalse label associations. We propose a contributor-aware universal defensive\nframework for learning in the presence of multiple, potentially adversarial\ndata sources that utilizes semi-supervised ensembles and learning from crowds\nto filter the false labels produced by adversarial triggers. Importantly, this\ndefensive strategy is agnostic to backdoor pattern design, as it functions\nwithout needing -- or even attempting -- to perform either adversary\nidentification or backdoor pattern detection during either training or\ninference. Our empirical studies demonstrate the robustness of the proposed\nframework against adversarial backdoor attacks from multiple simultaneous\nadversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 20:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Recently, virtual adversarial training (VAT)\nattracts attention as it could further improve the generalization of DNNs in\nsemi-supervised learning. The driving force behind VAT is to prevent the models\nfrom overfitting data points by enforcing consistency between the inputs and\nthe perturbed inputs. This strategy could be helpful in learning from noisy\nlabels if it prevents neural models from learning noisy samples while\nencouraging the models to generalize clean samples. In this paper, we propose\ncontext-based virtual adversarial training (ConVAT) to prevent a text\nclassifier from overfitting to noisy labels. Unlike the previous works, the\nproposed method performs the adversarial training at the context level rather\nthan the inputs. It makes the classifier not only learn its label but also its\ncontextual neighbors, which alleviates the learning from noisy labels by\npreserving contextual semantics on each data point. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on four text classification datasets with two types of label\nnoises. Comprehensive experimental results clearly show that the proposed\nmethod works quite well even with extremely noisy settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 14:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Efficient and stealthy debuggers are especially\nrelevant for malware analysis. However, existing debugging platforms fail to\naddress a transparent, effective, and high-performance low-level debugger due\nto their detectable fingerprints, complexity, and implementation restrictions.\nIn this paper, we present HyperDbg, a new hypervisor-assisted debugger for\nhigh-performance and stealthy debugging of user and kernel applications. To\naccomplish this, HyperDbg relies on state-of-the-art hardware features\navailable in today's CPUs, such as VT-x and extended page tables. In contrast\nto other widely used existing debuggers, we design HyperDbg using a custom\nhypervisor, making it independent of OS functionality or API. We propose\nhardware-based instruction-level emulation and OS-level API hooking via\nextended page tables to increase the stealthiness. Our results of the dynamic\nanalysis of 10,853 malware samples show that HyperDbg's stealthiness allows\ndebugging on average 22% and 26% more samples than WinDbg and x64dbg,\nrespectively. Moreover, in contrast to existing debuggers, HyperDbg is not\ndetected by any of the 13 tested packers and protectors. We improve the\nperformance over other debuggers by deploying a VMX-compatible script engine,\neliminating unnecessary context switches. Our experiment on three concrete\ndebugging scenarios shows that compared to WinDbg as the only kernel debugger,\nHyperDbg performs step-in, conditional breaks, and syscall recording, 2.98x,\n1319x, and 2018x faster, respectively.
