We divide the single\npopulation into two stages of larval and adult structure. The model uses\nLogistic input, and the larvae are converted into adult bodies by constant\nratio. We only consider adulthood. The role of psychological effects makes the\ncontact between adult and environmental toxins a functional form, while the\ncontact between larvae and environmental toxins is linear.\n  For the deterministic model embodied as a nonlinear time-varying system, we\ndiscuss the asymptotic stability of the system by Lyapunov one-time\napproximation theory, and give a sufficient condition for stability to be\nestablished.\n  Considering that the contact rate between biological and environmental toxins\nin nature is not always constant, we make the contact rate interfere with white\nnoise, and then modify the contact rate into a stochastic process, thus\nestablishing a corresponding random single-population model. According to It\\^o\nformula and Lyapunov in the function method, we first prove the existence of\nglobally unique positive solutions for stochastic models under arbitrary\ninitial conditions, and then give sufficient conditions for weak average\nlong-term survival and random long-term survival for single populations in the\nexpected sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 16:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 06:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However, mergers can take place at significant offsets from their host\ngalaxies, with many occurring several kpc from star-forming regions. It is thus\nimportant to understand the physical mechanisms involved in transporting\nenriched material from merger sites in the galactic halo to the star-forming\ndisk. We investigate these processes, starting from an explosive injection\nevent and its interaction with the halo medium. We show that the total outflow\nmass in compact binary mergers is too low for the material to travel to the\ndisk in a ballistic fashion. Instead, the enriched ejecta is swept into a\nshell, which decelerates over $\\lesssim 10$ pc scales and becomes corrugated by\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The corrugated shell is denser than the\nambient medium, and breaks into clouds which sink toward the disk. These\nsinking clouds lose thermal energy through radiative cooling, and are also\nablated by shearing instabilities. We present a dynamical heuristic that models\nthese effects to predict the delay times for delivery to the disk. However, we\nfind that turbulent mass ablation is extremely efficient, and leads to the\ntotal fragmentation of sinking $\\textit{r}$-process clouds over $10-100$ pc\nscales. We thus predict that enriched material from halo injection events\nquickly assimilates into the gas medium of the halo, and that enriched mass\nflow to the disk could only be accomplished through turbulent diffusion or\nlarge-scale inflowing mass currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 16:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 01:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Without definitive proof that the reconstruction is unique, or\nat the very least, that most reconstructions lead to the assignment of the same\nidentity to the same respondent, claims of confirmed reidentification are\nhighly suspect and easily refuted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 19:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

In this work, we develop techniques that\nenable efficient NAS in a significantly larger design space. To accomplish\nthis, we propose to perform NAS in an abstract search space of program\nproperties. Our key insights are as follows: (1) the abstract search space is\nsignificantly smaller than the original search space, and (2) architectures\nwith similar program properties also have similar performance; thus, we can\nsearch more efficiently in the abstract search space. To enable this approach,\nwe also propose a novel efficient synthesis procedure, which accepts a set of\npromising program properties, and returns a satisfying neural architecture. We\nimplement our approach, $\\alpha$NAS, within an evolutionary framework, where\nthe mutations are guided by the program properties.

Such a property is of fundamental\nimportance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and yet, to date, there is no\nwidely agreed-upon formal treatment of CPS resiliency. We present an STL-based\nframework for reasoning about resiliency in CPS in which resiliency has a\nsyntactic characterization in the form of an STL-based Resiliency Specification\n(SRS). Given an arbitrary STL formula $\\varphi$, time bounds $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$, the SRS of $\\varphi$, $R_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\varphi)$, is the STL formula\n$\\neg\\varphi\\mathbf{U}_{[0,\\alpha]}\\mathbf{G}_{[0,\\beta)}\\varphi$, specifying\nthat recovery from a violation of $\\varphi$ occur within time $\\alpha$\n(recoverability), and subsequently that $\\varphi$ be maintained for duration\n$\\beta$ (durability). These $R$-expressions, which are atoms in our SRS logic,\ncan be combined using STL operators, allowing one to express composite\nresiliency specifications, e.g., multiple SRSs must hold simultaneously, or the\nsystem must eventually be resilient. We define a quantitative semantics for\nSRSs in the form of a Resilience Satisfaction Value (ReSV) function $r$ and\nprove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. STL's Boolean semantics. The\n$r$-value for $R_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\varphi)$ atoms is a singleton set containing a\npair quantifying recoverability and durability. The $r$-value for a composite\nSRS formula results in a set of non-dominated recoverability-durability pairs,\ngiven that the ReSVs of subformulas might not be directly comparable (e.g., one\nsubformula has superior durability but worse recoverability than another). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-dimensional quantitative\nsemantics for an STL-based logic.

This requires accurate recovery of the appearance, represented by\nalbedo, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. While significant progress has\nbeen made on estimating 3D facial geometry, albedo estimation has received less\nattention. The task is fundamentally ambiguous because the observed color is a\nfunction of albedo and lighting, both of which are unknown. We find that\ncurrent methods are biased towards light skin tones due to (1) strongly biased\npriors that prefer lighter pigmentation and (2) algorithmic solutions that\ndisregard the light/albedo ambiguity. To address this, we propose a new\nevaluation dataset (FAIR) and an algorithm (TRUST) to improve albedo estimation\nand, hence, fairness. Specifically, we create the first facial albedo\nevaluation benchmark where subjects are balanced in terms of skin color, and\nmeasure accuracy using the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) metric. We then\naddress the light/albedo ambiguity by building on a key observation: the image\nof the full scene -- as opposed to a cropped image of the face -- contains\nimportant information about lighting that can be used for disambiguation. TRUST\nregresses facial albedo by conditioning both on the face region and a global\nillumination signal obtained from the scene image.

In\nperceptual quality assessment, human feedback is typically collected as a\nsingle scalar quality score indicating preference of one distorted video over\nanother. In reality, some videos may be better in some parts but not in others.\nWe propose an approach to collecting finer-grained feedback by asking users to\nuse an interactive tool to directly optimize for perceptual quality given a\nfixed bitrate. To this end, we built a novel web-tool which allows users to\npaint these spatio-temporal importance maps over videos. The tool allows for\ninteractive successive refinement: we iteratively re-encode the original video\naccording to the painted importance maps, while maintaining the same bitrate,\nthus allowing the user to visually see the trade-off of assigning higher\nimportance to one spatio-temporal part of the video at the cost of others. We\nuse this tool to collect data in-the-wild (10 videos, 17 users) and utilize the\nobtained importance maps in the context of x264 coding to demonstrate that the\ntool can indeed be used to generate videos which, at the same bitrate, look\nperceptually better through a subjective study - and are 1.9 times more likely\nto be preferred by viewers.

The first\nissue is that tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify information\nscrambling properly via its negative value in closed system, whether it is\nstill suitable to indicate quantum scrambling in open quantum system. However\nwe find that negative TMI is not an suitable quantifier of information\nscrambling in open quantum system in some cases while negative tripartite\nlogarithmic negativity (TLN) is more appropriate.

We find that, in spite of the bipolar\ncharacter of the external field, the MFR eruption is sustained by two\nreconnection processes. The first, which we refer to as breakthrough\nreconnection, is analogous to breakout reconnection in quadrupolar\nconfigurations. It occurs at a quasi-separator inside a current layer that\nwraps around the erupting MFR and is caused by the photospheric line-tying\neffect. The second process is the classical flare reconnection, which develops\nat the second quasi-separator inside a vertical current layer that is formed\nbelow the erupting MFR. Both reconnection processes work in tandem with the\nmagnetic forces of the unstable MFR to propel it through the overlying ambient\nfield, and their interplay may also be relevant for the thermal processes\noccurring in the plasma of solar flares. The considered example suggests that\nour method will be beneficial for both the modeling of observed eruptive events\nand theoretical studies of eruptions in idealized magnetic configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 00:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 22:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 21:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

How\npolymer crowding influences the flow-induced alignment of suspended colloidal\nrods remains unclear when rods and polymers share similar length-scales. We\ntackle this problem by analyzing the alignment of colloidal rods suspended in\ncrowded polymer solutions, and comparing against the case where crowding is\nprovided by additional colloidal rods in a pure solvent. We find that the\npolymer dynamics govern the onset of shear-induced alignment of colloidal rods\nsuspended in polymer solutions, and the control parameter for the alignment of\nrods is the Weissenberg number, quantifying the elastic response of the polymer\nto an imposed flow. Moreover, we show that the increasing colloidal alignment\nwith the shear rate follows a universal trend that is independent of the\nsurrounding crowding environment. Our results indicate that colloidal rod\nalignment in polymer solutions can be predicted based on the critical shear\nrate at which polymer coils are deformed by the flow, aiding the synthesis and\ndesign of anisotropic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 01:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Our method takes as input a photo exemplar of\na real object and a 3D object with segmentation, and uses the exemplar to guide\nthe assignment of materials to the parts of the shape, so that the appearance\nof the resulting shape is as similar as possible to the exemplar. To accomplish\nthis goal, our method combines an image translation neural network with a\nmaterial assignment neural network. The image translation network translates\nthe color from the exemplar to a projection of the 3D shape and the part\nsegmentation from the projection to the exemplar. Then, the material prediction\nnetwork assigns materials from a collection of realistic materials to the\nprojected parts, based on the translated images and perceptual similarity of\nthe materials. One key idea of our method is to use the translation network to\nestablish a correspondence between the exemplar and shape projection, which\nallows us to transfer materials between objects with diverse structures.\nAnother key idea of our method is to use the two pairs of (color, segmentation)\nimages provided by the image translation to guide the material assignment,\nwhich enables us to ensure the consistency in the assignment.

For long-distance\ncommunication, the only viable approach is teleportation of quantum states,\nwhich requires a prior distribution of entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits.\nEstablishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to\nthe low probability of success of the underlying physical processes. To reduce\nEP generation latency, prior works have looked at selection of efficient\nentanglement-routing paths and simultaneous use of multiple such paths for EP\ngeneration. In this paper, we propose and investigate a complementary technique\nto reduce EP generation latency--to pre-distribute EPs over certain\n(pre-determined) pairs of network nodes; these pre-distributed EPs can then be\nused to generate EPs for the requested pairs, when needed, with lower\ngeneration latency. For such an pre-distribution approach to be most effective,\nwe need to address an optimization problem of selection of node-pairs where the\nEPs should be pre-distributed to minimize the generation latency of expected EP\nrequests, under a given cost constraint. In this paper, we appropriately\nformulate the above optimization problem and design two efficient algorithms,\none of which is a greedy approach based on an approximation algorithm for a\nspecial case. Via extensive evaluations over the NetSquid simulator, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and developed techniques; we show\nthat our developed algorithms outperform a naive approach by up to an order of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 04:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

We find that the mixing of lattice and continuum\ndimensions, together with population imbalance, has an extraordinary effect on\npairing and the superfluidity of atomic Fermi gases. In the balanced case, the\nsuperfluid ground state prevails the majority of the phase space. However, for\nrelatively small lattice hopping integral $t$ and large lattice constant $d$, a\npair density wave (PDW) emerges unexpectedly at intermediate coupling strength,\nand the nature of the in-plane and overall pairing changes from particle-like\nto hole-like in the BCS and unitary regimes, associated with an abnormal\nincrease in the Fermi volume with the pairing strength. In the imbalanced case,\nthe stable polarized superfluid phase shrinks to only a small portion of the\nentire phase space spanned by $t$, $d$, imbalance $p$ and interaction strength\n$U$, mainly in the bosonic regime of low $p$, moderately strong pairing, and\nrelatively large $t$ and small $d$.

The efficiency of the conversion of the\naccreting matter into radiation is found to be substantially higher for naked\nsingularities than that for black holes.

As\na result, applying non-specialized SRR models on remote sensing imagery results\nin artifacts and poor reconstructions. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes an architecture inspired by previous research work, introducing a\nnovel approach for forcing an SRR model to output realistic remote sensing\nimages: instead of relying on feature-space similarities as a perceptual loss,\nthe model considers pixel-level information inferred from the normalized\nDigital Surface Model (nDSM) of the image.

Their ability to boost a model's robustness depends on two\nfactors, viz-a-viz, the model architecture, and the type of augmentations.\nAugmentations are very specific to a dataset, and it is not imperative that all\nkinds of augmentation would necessarily produce a positive effect on a model's\nperformance.

Hence\nthere is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across\na variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture,\nconvolutions, and the number of parameters used. This paper evaluates the\neffect of parameters using 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions on\ndifferent augmentation techniques on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.\nStatistical Evidence shows that techniques such as Cutouts and Random\nhorizontal flip were consistent on both parametrically low and high\narchitectures. Depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed 3x3 convolutions\nat higher parameters due to their ability to create deeper networks.\nAugmentations resulted in bridging the accuracy gap between the 3x3 and\ndepth-wise separable convolutions, thus establishing their role in model\ngeneralization. At higher number augmentations did not produce a significant\nchange in performance. The synergistic effect of multiple augmentations at\nhigher parameters, with antagonistic effect at lower parameters, was also\nevaluated. The work proves that a delicate balance between architectural\nsupremacy and augmentations needs to be achieved to enhance a model's\nperformance in any given deep learning task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 06:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 11:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

We then learn a displacement map,\nconditioned on the smoothed surface and on the input image, which encodes the\nhigh-frequency details of the clothes and body.

Maintaining constraints in transfer has\nseveral downstream applications, including data augmentation and de-biasing. We\nintroduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style transfer by\nintroducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network\n(GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce\ncooperative losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and\nreduce the same loss. The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a\nclassification loss, aiming to regularize the latent space further and bring\nsimilar sentences across domains closer together.

The Relaxed Averaged Alternating Reflections (RAAR)\nalgorithm that is concluded with a number of Error Reduction (ER) iterations is\na popular choice. The RAAR-ER algorithm is usually employed for several\nhundreds of times starting with independent random guesses to obtain trial\nsolutions that are then averaged to obtain the phase retrieval transfer\nfunction (PRTF). In this paper, we examine the phase retrieval solution\nobtained using the RAAR-ER methodology from perspective of the complexity\nparameter that was introduced by us in recent works. We observe that a single\nrun of the RAAR-ER algorithm produces a solution with higher complexity\ncompared to what is expected based on the complexity parameter as manifested by\nspurious high frequency grainy artifacts in the solution that do not seem to go\naway completely even after a number of trial solutions are averaged.

Due\nto the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity\nranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples,\nraising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to\nguarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a\nsystematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC\nevaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC\nparadigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experimentation, we create\na relatively \"complete\" judgment set based on a sample from the popular\nFB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method.

Using these corrections to entropy, we derive the\nmodified Friedmann equations and explore the growth of perturbations in a flat\nuniverse filled with dark matter (DM) and cosmological constant. We employ the\nspherically symmetric collapse formalism and work in the linear regime for the\nperturbations. Interestingly enough, we find out that the profile of density\ncontrast quite differs from the standard cosmology in Tsallis and barrow\ncosmology. We observe that the growth rate of matter perturbations crucially\ndepend on the values of Tsallis and Barrow parameters. With increasing these\ncorrection parameters to the entropy, the total density contrast increases as\nwell. This implies that perturbations grow up faster in a universe with\nmodified entropy corrected Friedmann equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 09:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 14:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

Such a discussion is necessary for optimal system design,\nleveraging advanced data-processing capabilities to support decision-making\ninvolving humans, but it is also key to identifying the opportunities and risks\npresented by ever-increasing levels of machine autonomy. Within this context,\nwe focus on the following questions: (i) How does HCI currently look like for\nstate-of-the-art AutoML algorithms, especially during the stages of\ndevelopment, deployment, and maintenance? (ii) Do the expectations of HCI\nwithin AutoML frameworks vary for different types of users and stakeholders?\n(iii) How can HCI be managed so that AutoML solutions acquire human trust and\nbroad acceptance? (iv) As AutoML systems become more autonomous and capable of\nlearning from complex open-ended environments, will the fundamental nature of\nHCI evolve? To consider these questions, we project existing literature in HCI\ninto the space of AutoML; this connection has, to date, largely been\nunexplored. In so doing, we review topics including user-interface design,\nhuman-bias mitigation, and trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally,\nto rigorously gauge the future of HCI, we contemplate how AutoML may manifest\nin effectively open-ended environments. This discussion necessarily reviews\nprojected developmental pathways for AutoML, such as the incorporation of\nreasoning, although the focus remains on how and why HCI may occur in such a\nframework rather than on any implementational details. Ultimately, this review\nserves to identify key research directions aimed at better facilitating the\nroles and modes of human interactions with both current and future AutoML\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 09:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

This strategy compensates for the deterioration of the\nsolution due to compressed sensor candidates.

The proposed method can\nprovide better optimization results than those obtained by the original\ngroup-greedy method when a similar computational cost is spent as for the\noriginal group-greedy method.

To obtain fine-grained visual features,we present\ncontrastive learning supervised by click through data to fine-tune the visual\nencoder. To reduce sample selection bias, firstly we train the visual encoder\noffline by leveraging both unbiased self-supervision and click supervision\nsignals. Secondly, we incorporate a debiasing network in the online CTR\npredictor to adjust the visual features by contrasting high impression items\nwith selected items with lower impressions.We deploy the framework in the\nvisual sponsor search system at Alibaba.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN)\ncan be useful for processing tactile information, but the information from\nmulti-fingered hands needs an arbitrary pre-processing, as CNNs require a\nrectangularly shaped input, which may lead to unstable results.

Many marketing studies have shown that the price factor\nsignificantly influences users' behaviors and the purchase decisions of users\nare determined by both price and interest preferences simultaneously.

This mechanism has proven useful in a\nvariety of settings, and most recently in timed systems.\n  In the timed setting, the so-called fixed timed window parity objectives have\nbeen studied. A fixed timed window parity objective is defined with respect to\nsome time bound and requires that, at all times, we witness a time frame, i.e.,\na window, of size less than the fixed bound in which the smallest priority is\neven. In this work, we focus on the bounded timed window parity objective. Such\nan objective is satisfied if there exists some bound for which the fixed\nobjective is satisfied. The satisfaction of bounded objectives is robust to\nmodeling choices such as constants appearing in constraints, unlike fixed\nobjectives, for which the choice of constants may affect the satisfaction for a\ngiven bound.\n  We show that verification of bounded timed window objectives in timed\nautomata can be performed in polynomial space, and that timed games with these\nobjectives can be solved in exponential time, even for multi-objective\nextensions.

In some cases, training data is sparse or lacks of sufficient\nannotation, a fact that especially applies to highly specialized production\nenvironments. Data augmentation represents a common strategy to extend the\ndataset. Still, it only varies the image within a narrow range. In this\narticle, a novel strategy is proposed to augment small image datasets. The\napproach is applied to surface monitoring of carbon fibers, a specific industry\nuse case. We apply two different methods to create binary labels: a\nproblem-tailored trigonometric function and a WGAN model.

Immersion cooling is one such alternative. In this\npaper, we quantitatively examine and compare air cooling and immersion cooling\nsolutions. The examined characteristics include power usage efficiency (PUE),\ncomputing and power density, cost, and maintenance overheads. A direct\ncomparison shows a reduction of about 50% in energy consumption and a reduction\nof about two-thirds of the occupied space, by using immersion cooling. In\naddition, the higher heat capacity of used liquids in immersion cooling\ncompared to air allows for much higher rack power densities. Moreover,\nimmersion cooling requires less capital and operational expenditures. However,\nchallenging maintenance procedures together with the increased number of IT\nfailures are the main downsides. By selecting immersion cooling, cloud\nproviders must trade-off the decrease in energy and cost and the increase in\npower density with its higher maintenance and reliability concerns. Finally, we\nargue that retrofitting an air-cooled data center with immersion cooling will\nresult in high costs and is generally not recommended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 13:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

The steep stratification in stellar interiors\nsuggests that the radial extent of such simulations can affect the convection\ndynamics, the IGWs in the stably stratified radiative zone, and the depth of\nthe overshooting layer.

Researchers have studied\ntextual, visual, and audio content, but typically in isolation. Yet, harmful\ncontent often combines multiple modalities, as in the case of memes, which are\nof particular interest due to their viral nature. With this in mind, here we\noffer a comprehensive survey with a focus on harmful memes.

One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really\nstudied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack\nof suitable datasets.

Thanks to the development\nof embedded processors and the gradual optimization of deep neural networks,\nSiamese trackers receive extensive research and realize preliminary\ncombinations with UAVs. However, due to the UAV's limited onboard computational\nresources and the complex real-world circumstances, aerial tracking with\nSiamese networks still faces severe obstacles in many aspects.

To date, there has not been any direct observation of such\nsustained and persistent HXRs from the quiescent Sun. However, Hannah et al. in\n2010 constrained the quiet Sun HXR emission using almost 12 days of quiescent\nsolar-off-pointing observations by RHESSI.

During FOXSI-3's\nflight, the Sun exhibited a fairly quiet configuration, displaying only one\naged non-flaring active region. Using the entire $\\sim$6.5 minutes of FOXSI-3\ndata, we constrained the quiet Sun emission in HXRs. We found $2\\sigma$ upper\nlimits in the order of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$\nkeV$^{-1}$ for the 5-10 keV energy range. FOXSI-3's upper limit is consistent\nwith what was reported by Hannah et al., 2010, but FOXSI-3 achieved this result\nusing $\\sim$1/2640 less time than RHESSI. A possible future spacecraft using\nFOXSI's concept would allow enough observation time to constrain the current\nHXR quiet Sun limits further or perhaps even make direct detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 13:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The framework consists\nof a segmentation network (SN), a virtual sensor network (VSN), and a\ncontroller network (CN). Concretely, the VSN is trained to measure the pose of\nthe unseen shape from a segmented image. After that, given the shape-agnostic\npose measurement, the CN is trained to achieve generic peg-in-hole. Finally,\nwhen applying to real unseen holes, we only have to fine-tune the SN required\nby the simulated VSN+CN.

The assumption of static\nenvironments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case\nfor most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the\nobjects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene\ncontext by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation\nresults are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the\nquality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present\na robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex\nand highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object\nfeature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice\nto the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our\nbaseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering\nand visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of\nsegmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur.\nThorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify\ndynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the\nproposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a\nprocessing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical\napplications.

This model is widely accepted as\nproviding the adequate framework for formalizing the synthesis question for\nreactive systems. This important application motivates the question of strategy\ncomplexity: which valuations (or payoff functions) admit optimal positional\nstrategies (without memory)? Valuations for which both players have optimal\npositional strategies have been characterized by Gimbert and Zielonka for\nfinite graphs and by Colcombet and Niwi\\'nski for infinite graphs. However, for\nreactive synthesis, existence of optimal positional strategies for the opponent\n(which models an antagonistic environment) is irrelevant. Despite this fact,\nnot much is known about valuations for which the protagonist admits optimal\npositional strategies, regardless of the opponent. In this work, we\ncharacterize valuations which admit such strategies over infinite game graphs.\nOur characterization uses the vocabulary of universal graphs, which has also\nproved useful in understanding recent breakthrough results regarding the\ncomplexity of parity games. More precisely, we show that a valuation admitting\nuniversal graphs which are monotone and well-ordered is positional over all\ngame graphs, and -- more surprisingly -- that the converse is also true for\nvaluations admitting neutral colors.

Ridepooling services in particular can\ndecrease land consumption and increase transportation efficiency by increasing\nthe average vehicle occupancy. Nevertheless, because ridepooling services\nrequire a sufficient user base for pooling to take effect, their performance\ncan suffer if multiple operators offer such a service and must split the\ndemand. This study presents a simulation framework for evaluating the impact of\ncompetition and cooperation among multiple ridepooling providers. Two different\nkinds of interaction via a broker platform are compared with the base cases of\na single monopolistic operator and two independent operators with divided\ndemand. In the first, the broker presents trip offers from all operators to\ncustomers (similar to a mobility-as-a-service platform), who can then freely\nchoose an operator. In the second, a regulated broker platform can manipulate\noperator offers with the goal of shifting the customer-operator assignment from\na user equilibrium towards a system optimum. To model adoptions of the service\ndesign depending on the different interaction scenario, a game setting is\nintroduced. Within alternating turns between operators, operators can adapt\nparameters of their service (fleet size and objective function) to maximize\nprofit. Results for a case study based on Manhattan taxi data, show that\noperators generate the highest profit in the broker setting while operating the\nlargest fleet. Additionally, pooling efficiency can nearly be maintained\ncompared to a single operator. With the resulting increased service rate, the\nregulated competition benefits not only operators (profit) and cities\n(increased pooling efficiency), but also customers. Contrarily, when users can\ndecide freely, the lowest pooling efficiency and operator profit is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 14:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Although deep learning-based models have\nbeen proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen sites is\ndifficult due to not only the large inter-site discrepancy among different\nscanners, imaging protocols, and populations, but also the variations in stroke\nlesion shape, size, and location. To tackle this issue, we introduce a\nself-adaptive normalization network, termed SAN-Net, to achieve adaptive\ngeneralization on unseen sites for stroke lesion segmentation. Motivated by\ntraditional z-score normalization and dynamic network, we devise a masked\nadaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize inter-site discrepancies,\nwhich standardizes input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated\nstyle by dynamically learning affine parameters from the input; \\ie, MAIN can\naffinely transform the intensity values. Then, we leverage a gradient reversal\nlayer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant representation with a\nsite classifier, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction\nwith MAIN. Finally, inspired by the ``pseudosymmetry'' of the human brain, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective data augmentation technique, termed\nsymmetry-inspired data augmentation (SIDA), that can be embedded within SAN-Net\nto double the sample size while halving memory consumption. Experimental\nresults on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS)\nv1.2 dataset, which includes MR images from 9 different sites, demonstrate that\nunder the ``leave-one-site-out'' setting, the proposed SAN-Net outperforms\nrecently published methods in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative\ncomparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 14:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 05:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Event data, which are binary and sparse in space and\ntime, are therefore the ideal input for spiking neural networks.

To address this\nissue, we took advantage of the latest advancements in matter of spike\nbackpropagation - surrogate gradient learning, parametric LIF, SpikingJelly\nframework - and of our new \\textit{voxel cube} event encoding to train 4\ndifferent SNNs based on popular deep learning networks: SqueezeNet, VGG,\nMobileNet, and DenseNet.

In a previous study, we used an interval timing\nproduction task and discovered an updating strategy in which the agent adjusted\nthe behavioral and neuronal noise for exploration. In the experiment, human\nsubjects proactively generated a series of timed motor outputs. We found that\nthe sequential motor timing varied at two temporal scales: long-term\ncorrelation around the target interval due to memory drifts and short-term\nadjustments of timing variability according to feedback. We have previously\ndescribed these features of timing variability with an augmented Gaussian\nprocess, termed reward sensitive Gaussian process (RSGP). Here we provide a\nmechanistic model and simulate the process by borrowing the architecture of\nrecurrent neural networks. While recurrent connection provided the long-term\nserial correlation in motor timing, to facilitate reward-driven short-term\nvariations, we introduced reward-dependent variability in the network\nconnectivity, inspired by the stochastic nature of synaptic transmission in the\nbrain.

The adaptation step involves\ngenerating an adaptation strategy and applying it to the running system\nwhenever an anomaly arises. In this paper, we argue that, rather than\ngenerating individual adaptation strategies, the goal should be to adapt the\nlogic / code of the running system in such a way that the system itself would\nlearn how to steer clear of future anomalies, without triggering\nself-adaptation too frequently.

While one of the most important (and\nobvious) controlling parameters in such a system is the neck-to-particle size\nratio, the role of the liquid driving method is not so obvious. On the one\nhand, wide-spread volume-controlled systems result in pressure and local liquid\nvelocity increases upon eventual clogs. On the other hand, pressure-controlled\nsystems result in a decrease of the flow through the constriction when a clog\nis developed. The root of the question therefore lies on the role of\ninterparticle liquid flow and hydrodynamic forces on both the formation and\nstability of an arch blocking the particle transport through a constriction. In\nthis work, we experimentally analyse a suspension of non-cohesive particles in\nchannels undergoing intermittent regimes, in which they are most sensitive to\nparametric changes.

The forward pass, i.e., converting CAD data to computational\nmeshes, is well understood and established. However, the same does not hold for\nthe inverse direction, i.e., CAD reconstruction of deformed geometries\nresulting, e.g., from shape optimization. The few reconstruction methods\nreported mainly rely on spline fitting, in particular methods that rely on\ncreating new splines simililar to shape reconstruction from 3D imaging. In\ncontrast, this paper studies a novel approach that reuses the CAD data given in\nthe initial design. We show that this concept leads to precise shape\nreconstructions while also preserving the initial notion of features defined\nduring design. Furthermore, reusing the initial CAD representation reduces the\nshape reconstruction problem to a shape modification problem. We study this\nunique feature and show that it enables the reconstruction of CAD data from\ncomputational meshes by composing each spline in the initial CAD data with a\nsingle, global deformation spline.

This paper combines an\nagent-based network model and a compartmental susceptible-infectious-removed\nmodel (SIR) to explain how socioeconomic inequalities affect the dynamics of\ndisease spreading. Specifically, we focus on two aspects of structural\ninequalities: wealth inequality and social segregation. Our computational model\ndemonstrates that under high income inequality, the infection gap widens\nbetween the low-income and high-income groups, and also the overall infected\ncases increase.

Furthermore, we explain the second peak of the infectious cases during a\npandemic as a result of a false sense of safety and loosening the quarantine,\namong the higher SES individuals. These findings send a strong message to\npolicymakers; confinement measures must be accompanied by substantial financial\nassistance to those from lower-income groups so that the people regardless of\ntheir socioeconomic status can afford to stay in.

Therefore, multi-session-based recommendation(MSBR) is a solution for\nthe problem. Compared with the previous MSBR models, we have made three\nimprovements in this paper. First, the previous work choose to use all the\nhistory sessions of the user and/or of his similar users. When the user's\ncurrent interest changes greatly from the past, most of these sessions can only\nhave negative impacts. Therefore, we select a large number of randomly chosen\nsessions from the dataset as candidate sessions to avoid over depending on\nhistory data. Then we only choose to use the most similar sessions to get the\nmost useful information while reduce the noise caused by dissimilar sessions.\nSecond, in real-world datasets, short sessions account for a large proportion.\nThe RNN often used in previous work is not suitable to process short sessions,\nbecause RNN only focuses on the sequential relationship, which we find is not\nthe only relationship between items in short sessions. So, we designed a more\nsuitable method named GAFE based on attention to process short sessions. Third,\nAlthough there are few long sessions, they can not be ignored. Not like\nprevious models, which simply process long sessions in the same way as short\nsessions, we propose LSIS, which can split the interest of long sessions, to\nmake better use of long sessions. Finally, to help recommendations, we also\nhave considered users' long-term interests captured by a multi-layer GRU.\nConsidering the four points above, we built the model ENIREC.

Evidence for parent body\nalteration includes rims with mobile elements (S or Fe) on the SiC grain and\none silicate grain. Other features characteristic of secondary processing in\nthe interstellar medium, the solar nebula, and/or on parent bodies, were not\nobserved or are better explained by processes operating in circumstellar\nenvelopes. In general, there was very little overprinting of primary features\nof the presolar grains by secondary processes (e.g., ion irradiation,\ngrain-grain collisions, thermal metamorphism, aqueous alteration). This finding\nunderlines the need for additional TEM studies of presolar grains located in\nthe primitive matrix regions of Semarkona, to address gaps in our knowledge of\npresolar grain populations accreted to ordinary chondrites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 15:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

We use high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\ndigital imagery along with textural features derived from HST imagery, band\nratios derived from HST imagery, and distance layers. Textural features are\ntypically used in remote sensing studies and are useful for identifying\npatterns within digital imagery. We run ML classification models with different\ncombinations of HST digital imagery, textural features, band ratios, and\ndistance layers to determine the most useful information for galaxy component\nclassification. Textural features and distance layers are most useful for\ngalaxy component identification, with the SVM and RF models performing the\nbest. The MLC model performs worse overall but has comparable performance to\nSVM and RF in some circumstances. Overall, the models are best at classifying\nthe most spectrally unique galaxy components including the galaxy center, outer\ndisc, and celestial background. The most confusion occurs between the young\nstellar population, old stellar population, and dust lanes.

Recent works have focused on partial differential equation\n(PDE) models, particularly reaction-diffusion models, able to describe the\nprogression of an epidemic in both space and time. These studies have shown\ngenerally promising results in describing and predicting COVID-19 progression.\nHowever, people often travel long distances in short periods of time, leading\nto nonlocal transmission of the disease. Such contagion dynamics are not\nwell-represented by diffusion alone. In contrast, ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) models may easily account for this behavior by considering\ndisparate regions as nodes in a network, with the edges defining nonlocal\ntransmission. In this work, we attempt to combine these modeling paradigms via\nthe introduction of a network structure within a reaction-diffusion PDE system.\nThis is achieved through the definition of a population-transfer operator,\nwhich couples disjoint and potentially distant geographic regions, facilitating\nnonlocal population movement between them. We provide analytical results\ndemonstrating that this operator does not disrupt the physical consistency or\nmathematical well-posedness of the system, and verify these results through\nnumerical experiments.

Therefore, it turns out that the thermoEMF\nof powder-based TEM with a higher scattering index can be even greater than the\nthermoEMF of a single-crystal material with a low scattering index.
