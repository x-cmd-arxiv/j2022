We propose an approach to analyze\nimpurity dynamics based on the matrix-product state (MPS) representation of the\nFeynman-Vernon influence functional (IF). The efficiency of such a MPS\nrepresentation rests on the moderate value of the temporal entanglement (TE)\nentropy of the IF, viewed as a fictitious \"wave function\" in the time domain.\nWe obtain explicit expressions of this wave function for a family of\none-dimensional reservoirs, and analyze the scaling of TE with the evolution\ntime for different reservoir's initial states. While for initial states with\nshort-range correlations we find temporal area-law scaling, Fermi-sea-type\ninitial states yield logarithmic scaling with time, closely related to the\nreal-space entanglement scaling in critical 1d systems. Furthermore, we\ndescribe an efficient algorithm for converting the explicit form of the\nreservoirs' IF to MPS form. Once the IF is encoded by a MPS, arbitrary temporal\ncorrelation functions of the interacting impurity can be efficiently computed,\nirrespective of its internal structure.

However, based\non different data resources, this non-motorized mode of transportation was\nstill negatively affected by the pandemic (i.e., relative reduction in\nridership). This study has two objectives: 1) to investigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the numbers and duration of trips conducted through a\nbike-sharing system -- the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC, USA; and 2) to\nexplore whether land use and household income in the nation's capital influence\nthe spatial variation of ridership during the pandemic. Towards realizing these\nobjectives, this research looks at the relationship between bike sharing and\nCOVID-19 transmission as a two-directional relationship rather than a\none-directional causal relationship. Accordingly, this study models i) the\nimpact of COVID-19 infection numbers and rates on the use of the Capital\nBikeshare system and ii) the risk of COVID-19 transmission among individual\nbike-sharing users. In other words, we examine i) the cyclist's behavior as a\nfunction of the COVID-19 transmission evolution in an urban environment and ii)\nthe possible relationship between the bike share usage and the COVID-19\ntransmission through adopting a probabilistic contagion model. The findings\nshow the risk of using a bike-sharing system during the pandemic and whether\nbike sharing remains a healthier alternative mode of transportation in terms of\ninfection risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 16:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

The mismatch between the values of the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ obtained from direct distance ladder measurements and from the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) is the most statistically significant, but\nthe amplitude of the matter fluctuations is also regarded as a serious concern,\nleading to the investigation of a plethora of models. We first show that the\ncombination of several recent measurements from local probes leads to a tight\nconstraint on the present-day matter density $\\Omega_M$ as well as on the\namplitude of the matter fluctuations, both acceptably consistent with the\nvalues inferred from the CMB. Secondly, we show that the data on cosmic\nchronometers allow to derive an accurate value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ for\n$\\Lambda$CDM models: $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.34$ km/s/Mpc. This implies that, within\n$\\Lambda$CDM, some determinations of $H_0$ are biased. Considering a bias on\nthe Hubble constant as a nuisance parameter within $\\Lambda$CDM, we examine\nsuch a $\\Lambda$CDM$+ H_0$ bias model on the same statistical grounds as\nalternative cosmological models. We show that the former statistically\nsupersede most existing extended models proposed up to now. In a third step, we\nshow that the value of $\\Omega_M$ we obtained, combined with $H_0$ from SH0ES,\nleads to an accurate measurement of $\\omega_M$, providing an additional\nlow-redshift test for cosmological models. From this test, most extensions seem\nto be confronted with a new tension, whereas the $\\Lambda$CDM with $H_0 \\sim 67\n$ has none. We conclude that a standard $\\Lambda$CDM model with an unknown bias\nin the Cepheids distance calibration represents a model that reaches a\nremarkable agreement, statistically better than previously proposed extensions\nwith $H_0 \\sim 73 $ for which such a comparison can be performed.

Then, a joint\nactive and passive beamforming optimization problem is formulated for\nminimizing the long-term transmission power consumption, subject to the coupled\nphase-shift constraint and the minimum data rate constraint. Despite the\ncoupled nature of the phase-shift model, the formulated problem is solved by\ninvoking a hybrid continuous and discrete phase-shift control policy. Inspired\nby this observation, a pair of hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,\nnamely the hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (hybrid DDPG) algorithm\nand the joint DDPG & deep-Q network (DDPG-DQN) based algorithm are proposed.\nThe hybrid DDPG algorithm controls the associated high-dimensional continuous\nand discrete actions by relying on the hybrid action mapping.

Moreover, most of the existing approaches require the instantaneous\nchannel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected.\nTo tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent\nradio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\n(MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal\nstrength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains.

Gradient clipping is usually employed to address this\nissue in the single machine setting, but exploring this technique in the\ndistributed setting is still in its infancy: it remains mysterious whether the\ngradient clipping scheme can take advantage of multiple machines to enjoy\nparallel speedup. The main technical difficulty lies in dealing with nonconvex\nloss function, non-Lipschitz continuous gradient, and skipping communication\nrounds simultaneously. In this paper, we explore a relaxed-smoothness\nassumption of the loss landscape which LSTM was shown to satisfy in previous\nworks, and design a communication-efficient gradient clipping algorithm.

As the collisional coupling between neutral and charged\nparticles decreases in the upper part of the chromosphere, the hydrodynamical\ntimescales may become comparable to the collisional timescale, and a two-fluid\nmodel is needed. In this paper we describe the implementation and validation of\na two-fluid model which simultaneously evolves charges and neutrals, coupled by\ncollisions. The two-fluid equations are implemented in the fully open-source\nMPI-AMRVAC code. In the photosphere and the lower part of the solar atmosphere,\nwhere collisions between charged and neutral particles are very frequent, an\nexplicit time-marching would be too restrictive, since for stability the\ntimestep needs to be proportional to the inverse of the collision frequency.\nThis is overcome by evaluating the collisional terms implicitly using an\nexplicit-implicit (IMEX) scheme. The cases presented cover very different\ncollisional regimes and our results are fully consistent with related\nliterature findings. If collisional time and length scales are smaller than the\nhydrodynamical scales usually considered in the solar chromosphere, density\nstructures seen in the neutral and charged fluids are similar, with the effect\nof elastic collisions between charges and neutrals being similar to\ndiffusivity. Otherwise, density structures are different and the decoupling in\nvelocity between the two species increases. The use of IMEX schemes efficiently\navoids the small timestep constraints of fully explicit implementations in\nstrongly collisional regimes.

In this paper, we propose a protocol to\nlearn the latent micro-variables of an ABM from data. The first step of our\nprotocol is to reduce an ABM to a probabilistic model, characterized by a\ncomputationally tractable likelihood. This reduction follows two general design\nprinciples: balance of stochasticity and data availability, and replacement of\nunobservable discrete choices with differentiable approximations. Then, our\nprotocol proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the latent variables via a\ngradient-based expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate our protocol\nby applying it to an ABM of the housing market, in which agents with different\nincomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods.

A ResNet-based rotational-invariant neural network\nwas employed to classify the transient candidates. As a result, the system\nenables auto-generation of transients and their light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 17:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Existing\nmethods are restricted in learning the controllable functions under the\nsupervision of known degradation types and levels. They usually suffer from a\nsevere performance drop when the real degradation is different from their\nassumptions. Such a limitation is due to the complexity of real-world\ndegradations, which can not provide explicit supervision to the interactive\nmodulation during training. However, how to realize the interactive modulation\nin real-world super-resolution has not yet been studied. In this work, we\npresent a Metric Learning based Interactive Modulation for Real-World\nSuper-Resolution (MM-RealSR). Specifically, we propose an unsupervised\ndegradation estimation strategy to estimate the degradation level in real-world\nscenarios. Instead of using known degradation levels as explicit supervision to\nthe interactive mechanism, we propose a metric learning strategy to map the\nunquantifiable degradation levels in real-world scenarios to a metric space,\nwhich is trained in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, we introduce an anchor\npoint strategy in the metric learning process to normalize the distribution of\nmetric space.

Most objects are opaque in the optical\nand infrared regimes and can limit dramatically the field of view (FoV).\nCurrent approaches to see around occlusions exploit the multireflection\npropagation of signals from neighboring surfaces either in the microwave or the\noptical bands. Using lower frequency signals anatomical information is limited\nand images suffer from clutter while optical systems encounter diffuse\nscattering from most surfaces and suffer from path loss, thus limiting the\nimaging distance. In this work, we show that terahertz (THz) waves can be used\nto extend visibility to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) while combining the advantages\nof both spectra. The material properties and roughness of most building\nsurfaces allow for a unique combination of both diffuse and strong specular\nscattering. As a result, most building surfaces behave as lossy mirrors that\nenable propagation paths between a THz camera and the NLoS scenes. We propose a\nmirror folding algorithm that tracks the multireflection propagation of THz\nwaves to 1) correct the image from cluttering and 2) see around occlusions\nwithout a priori knowledge of the scene geometry and material properties. To\nvalidate the feasibility of the proposed NLoS imaging approach, we carried out\na numerical analysis and developed two THz imaging systems to demonstrate\nreal-world NLoS imaging experiments in sub-THz bands (270-300 GHz). The results\nshow the capability of THz radar imaging systems to recover both the geometry\nand pose of LoS and NLoS objects with centimeter-scale resolution in various\nmultipath propagation scenarios. THz NLoS imaging can operate in low visibility\nconditions (e.g., night, strong ambient light, smoke) and uses computationally\ninexpensive image reconstruction algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 17:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

It usually takes\nan order of magnitude more time than training their counterpart image models,\nleading to long research cycles. Existing VSR methods typically train models\nwith fixed spatial and temporal sizes from beginning to end. The fixed sizes\nare usually set to large values for good performance, resulting to slow\ntraining. However, is such a rigid training strategy necessary for VSR? In this\nwork, we show that it is possible to gradually train video models from small to\nlarge spatial/temporal sizes, i.e., in an easy-to-hard manner. In particular,\nthe whole training is divided into several stages and the earlier stage has\nsmaller training spatial shape. Inside each stage, the temporal size also\nvaries from short to long while the spatial size remains unchanged. Training is\naccelerated by such a multigrid training strategy, as most of computation is\nperformed on smaller spatial and shorter temporal shapes.

We demonstrate how some\nrecent proposals for both simulation-based and data-based calibrations inherit\nproperties of the sample used for training, which can result in biases for\ndownstream analyses. In the case of simulation-based calibration, we argue that\nour recently proposed Gaussian Ansatz approach can avoid some of the pitfalls\nof prior dependence, whereas prior-independent data-based calibration remains\nan open problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 22:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

(2022),\nhas been shown to generalize the close-wide and inner-outer caustic\ndegeneracies into a unified regime of magnification degeneracy in the\ninterpretation of 2-body planetary microlensing observations. While the\ninner-outer degeneracy expects the source trajectory to pass equidistant to the\nplanetary caustics of the degenerate lens configurations, the offset degeneracy\nstates that the same mathematical expression applies to any combination of the\nclose, wide, and resonant caustic topologies, where the projected star-planet\nseparations differ by an offset ($s_{\\rm A}\\neq s_{\\rm B}$) that depends on\nwhere the source trajectory crosses the star-planet axis. An important\nimplication is that the $s_{\\rm A}=1/s_{\\rm B}$ solution of the close-wide\ndegeneracy never strictly manifests in observations except when the source\ncrosses a singular point near the primary. Nevertheless, the offset degeneracy\nwas proposed upon numerical calculations, and no theoretical justification was\ngiven. Here, we provide a theoretical treatment of the offset degeneracy, which\ndemonstrates its nature as a mathematical degeneracy. From first principles, we\nshow that the offset degeneracy formalism is exact to zeroth-order in the mass\nratio ($q$) for two cases: when the source crosses the lens-axis inside of\ncaustics, and for $(s_{\\rm A}-s_{\\rm B})^6\\ll1$ when crossing outside of\ncaustics. The extent to which the offset degeneracy persists in oblique source\ntrajectories is explored numerically.

Here, we introduce a method to identify Bell tests requiring low\n$\\eta_{\\rm{crit}}$ and relatively low dimension $d$ of the local quantum\nsystems. The method has two steps. First, we show a family of bipartite Bell\ninequalities for which, for correlations produced by maximally entangled\nstates, $\\eta_{\\rm{crit}}$ can be upper bounded by a function of some\ninvariants of graphs, and use it to identify correlations that require small\n$\\eta_{\\rm{crit}}$.

The second step is based on the observation\nthat, using the initial state and measurement settings identified in the first\nstep, we can construct Bell inequalities with smaller $\\eta_{\\rm{crit}}$ and\nbetter noise robustness. For that, we use a modified version of Gilbert's\nalgorithm that takes advantage of the automorphisms of the graphs used in the\nfirst step. We illustrate its power by explicitly developing an example in\nwhich $\\eta_{\\rm{crit}}$ is $12.38\\%$ lower and the required visibility is\n$14.62\\%$ lower than the upper bounds obtained in the first step. The tools\npresented here may allow for developing high-dimensional loophole-free Bell\ntests and loophole-free Bell nonlocality over long distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 18:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 21:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 11:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Also, we take into account\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers and the evolution of the galaxy properties from the\nformation to the merger of the binary compact object. We find that the merger\nrate density changes dramatically depending on the choice of the star-forming\ngalaxy main sequence, especially in the case of binary black holes (BBHs) and\nblack hole neutron star systems (BHNSs). The slope of the merger rate density\nof BBHs and BHNSs is steeper if we assume the MZR with respect to the FMR,\nbecause the latter predicts a shallower decrease of metallicity with redshift.\nIn contrast, binary neutron stars (BNSs) are only mildly affected by both the\ngalaxy main sequence and metallicity relation. Overall, BBHs and BHNSs tend to\nform in low-mass metal-poor galaxies and merge in high-mass metal-rich\ngalaxies, while BNSs form and merge in massive galaxies. We predict that\npassive galaxies host at least ~5-10%, ~15-25%, and ~15-35% of all BNS, BHNS\nand BBH mergers in the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 09:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Specifically we will consider the $p_T^n$ recombination scheme, as\nwell as the $n\\to \\infty$ limit, known as the winner-take-all scheme.

The necessity of high accuracy of analyzing C.T. scan\nimages of the lung is considered as one of the crucial challenges in detecting\nand classifying lung cancer. A new long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based deep\nfusion structure, is introduced, where, the texture features computed from lung\nnodules through new volumetric grey-level-co-occurrence-matrices (GLCM)\ncomputations are applied to classify the nodules into: benign, malignant and\nambiguous.

Some of the gravitational-wave events observed by the\nLIGO-Virgo Collaboration have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in the\nmerger, allowing us to probe the relaxation of the remnant black hole to its\nfinal, stationary state - the so-called black-hole ringdown, which is\ncharacterized by a set of quasinormal modes. Can we use the ringdown to\nconstrain deviations from general relativity, as predicted by several of its\ncontenders? Here, we address this question by using an inspiral-merger-ringdown\nwaveform model in the effective-one-body formalism, augmented with a\nparametrization of the ringdown based on an expansion in the final black hole's\nspin. We give a prescription on how to include in this waveform model, the\nquasinormal mode frequencies calculated on a theory-by-theory basis. In\nparticular, we focus on theories that modify general relativity by higher-order\ncurvature corrections, namely, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB), dynamical\nChern-Simons (dCS) theories, and cubic- and quartic-order\neffective-field-theories (EFT) of general relativity. We use this parametrized\nwaveform model to measure the ringdown properties of the two loudest ringdown\nsignals observed so far, GW150914 and GW200129.

Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW)\nradars have shown great promise in meeting these needs. However, contemporary\ntechniques for non-contact vital signs monitoring (NCVSM) via FMCW radars, are\nbased on simplistic models, and present difficulties coping with noisy\nenvironments containing multiple objects. In this work, we develop an extended\nmodel of FMCW radar signals in a noisy setting containing multiple people and\nclutter. By utilizing the sparse nature of the modeled signals in conjunction\nwith human-typical cardiopulmonary features, we can accurately localize humans\nand reliably monitor their vital signs, using only a single channel and a\nsingle-input-single-output setup. To this end, we first show that spatial\nsparsity allows for both accurate detection of multiple people and\ncomputationally efficient extraction of their Doppler samples, using a joint\nsparse recovery approach. Given the extracted samples, we develop a method\nnamed Vital Signs based Dictionary Recovery (VSDR), which uses a\ndictionary-based approach to search for the desired rates of respiration and\nheartbeat over high-resolution grids corresponding to normal cardiopulmonary\nactivity. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated through\nexamples that combine the proposed model with real data of $30$ monitored\nindividuals. We demonstrate accurate human localization in a clutter-rich\nscenario that includes both static and vibrating objects, and show that our\nVSDR approach outperforms existing techniques, based on several statistical\nmetrics. The findings support the widespread use of FMCW radars with the\nproposed algorithms in healthcare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 20:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Holographic applications open a path for\nconversation and collaboration between the theory-driven, high energy culture\nof string theory and fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics, which in\ncontrast place great emphasis on the empirical evidence that experiment\nprovides. This paper takes a look at holography's history, from its roots in\nstring theory to its present-day applications that are challenging the cultural\nidentity of the field. I will focus on two of these applications: holographic\nQCD and holographic superconductivity, highlighting some of the (often\nincompatible) historical influences, motives, and epistemic values at play, as\nwell as the subcultural shifts that help the collaborations work. The extent to\nwhich holographic research -- arguably string theory's most successful and\nprolific area -- must change its subcultural identity in order to function in\nfields outside of string theory reflects its changing nature and the field's\nuncertain future. Does string theory lose its identity in the low-energy\napplications that holography provides?

I find that the answers to these questions are\ndynamic, interconnected, and highly dependent on string theory's relationship\nwith its field of application. In some cases, holography can maintain the goals\nand values it inherited from string theory. In others, it instead adopts the\ngoals and values of the field in which it is applied.

A key property of volume-conserving active nematic model\nsystems is chaotic self-mixing characterized by motile topological defects.\nHowever, for active nematics driven by growth rather than motility, less is\nunderstood about mixing and defect motion. Mixing could affect evolutionary\noutcomes in bacterial colonies by counteracting the tendency to spatially\nsegregate into monoclonal sectors, which reduces the local genetic diversity\nand confines competition between subpopulations to the boundaries between\nneighboring sectors. To examine whether growth-driven active nematic physics\ncould influence this genetic demixing process, we conduct agent-based\nsimulations of growing, dividing, and sterically repelling rod-like bacteria of\nvarious aspect ratios, and we analyze colony morphology using tools from both\nsoft matter physics and population genetics.

It is generally the result of such inadequate CT modeling that\nanalytical methods are sensitive to artifacts and noise. Then, to address this\nproblem, several algebraic reconstruction techniques utilizing iterative models\nare suggested. The high computational cost of these methods restricts their\napplication. In this paper, we propose the utilization of the Scale Space Radon\nTransform (SSRT), recognized for its good behavior in the scale space where,\nthe detector width is already considered into the SSRT design and is controlled\nby the Gaussian kernel standard deviation. After depicting the basic properties\nand the inversion of SSRT, the FBP algorithm is used in two different ways to\nreconstruct the image from the SSRT sinogram: (1) Deconv-Rad-FBP: Deconvolve\nSSRT to estimate RT and apply FBP or (2) SSRT-FBP: Modify FBP such that RT\nspectrum used in FBP is replaced by SSRT, expressed in the frequency domain.\nComparison of image reconstruction using SSRT and RT are performed on\nShepp-Logan head and anthropomorphic abdominal phantoms by using, as quality\nmeasures, PSNR and SSIM. The first findings show that the SSRT-based image\nreconstruction quality is better than the one based on RT where, the SSRT-FBP\nmethod reveals to be the most accurate, especially, when the number of\nprojections is reduced, making it more appropriate for applications requiring\nlow-dose radiation such as medical X-ray CT. While SSRT-FBP and RT-FBP\nalgorithm have utmost the same execution time, the former is much faster than\nDeconv-Rad-FBP.

Faced with similar challenges in dealing with\nan increasingly diversified audience, the museum sector has seen changes in\ntheory and practice, particularly in the areas of representation and\nmeaning-making. While rarity and grandeur used to be at the centre stage of the\nearly museum practices, folk life and museums' relationships with the diverse\ncommunities they serve become a widely integrated part of the contemporary\npractices. These changes address issues of diversity and accessibility in order\nto offer more socially inclusive services. Drawing on these changes and\nreflecting back on the AI world, we argue that the museum experience provides\nuseful lessons for building AI with socially inclusive approaches, especially\nin situations in which both a collection and access to it will need to be\ncurated or filtered, as frequently happens in search engines, recommender\nsystems and digital libraries.

By not claiming to be\nneutral but practising cultural humility, the chances of addressing potential\nbiases can be increased. (2) There should be room for situational\ninterpretation beyond the stages of data collection and machine learning.\nBefore applying models and predictions, the contexts in which relevant parties\nexist should be taken into account.

The ability to accurately predict how long\naccidents will last can provide significant benefits to both end-users in their\nroute choice and traffic operation managers in handling of non-recurrent\ntraffic congestion. This paper presents a novel bi-level machine learning\nframework enhanced with outlier removal and intra-extra joint optimisation for\npredicting the incident duration on three heterogeneous data sets collected for\nboth arterial roads and motorways from Sydney, Australia and San-Francisco,\nU.S.A. Firstly, we use incident data logs to develop a binary classification\nprediction approach, which allows us to classify traffic incidents as\nshort-term or long-term. We find the optimal threshold between short-term\nversus long-term traffic incident duration, targeting both class balance and\nprediction performance while also comparing the binary versus multi-class\nclassification approaches.

In\nthis work, we show most of this redundant compute is unnecessary because we can\nreduce memory consumption sufficiently without it.

Although various compressive sensing (CS) algorithms\nhave been developed to solve this problem by exploiting inherent channel\nsparsity and sparsity structures, practical effects, such as power leakage and\nbeam squint, can still make the real channel features deviate from the assumed\nmodels and result in performance degradation. Also, the high complexity of CS\nalgorithms caused by a large number of iterations hinders their applications in\npractice. To tackle these issues, we develop a deep learning (DL)-based channel\nestimation approach where the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is\nunfolded into a deep neural network (DNN).

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical constrained\nstochastic shortest path problem (HC-SSP) that meets those two crucial\nrequirements in a single framework. Although HC-SSP provides a useful framework\nto model such planning requirements in many real-world applications, the\nresulting problem has high complexity and makes it difficult to find an optimal\nsolution fast which prevents user from applying it to real-time and\nrisk-sensitive applications. To address this problem, we present an algorithm\nthat iteratively allocates cost budget to lower level planning problems based\non branch-and-bound scheme to find a feasible solution fast and incrementally\nupdate the incumbent solution.

Through high-throughput sequencing technologies and\nwell-established analytical pipelines, relative abundance data of operational\ntaxonomic units and their associated taxonomic structures are routinely\nproduced. Since such data can be extremely sparse and high dimensional, there\nis often a genuine need for dimension reduction to facilitate data\nvisualization and downstream statistical analysis. We propose Principal\nAmalgamation Analysis (PAA), a novel amalgamation-based and taxonomy-guided\ndimension reduction paradigm for microbiome data. Our approach aims to\naggregate the compositions into a smaller number of principal compositions,\nguided by the available taxonomic structure, by minimizing a properly measured\nloss of information. The choice of the loss function is flexible and can be\nbased on familiar diversity indices for preserving either within-sample or\nbetween-sample diversity in the data.

As a result, the\nstarburstiness of jellyfish galaxies with strong RPS signatures clearly\nexhibits positive correlations with cluster velocity dispersion, ICM density,\nand strength of ram pressure.

However, its momentum factor is classical, and the\nconvergence of its iterates has not been proven. In this work, introducing some\nadditional hyperparameters $(a, b)$, we propose another accelerated proximal\ngradient method with a general momentum factor, which is new even for the\nsingle-objective cases. We show that our proposed method also has a global\nconvergence rate of $O(1/k^2)$ for any $(a,b)$, and further that the generated\nsequence of iterates converges to a weak Pareto solution when $a$ is positive,\nan essential property for the finite-time manifold identification. Moreover, we\nreport numerical results with various $(a,b)$, showing that some of these\nchoices give better results than the classical momentum factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 04:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Here we present the creation and release\nof an open-source multi-timescale micromagnetic code combining three key\nsolvers: Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert; Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch; Kinetic Monte Carlo.\nThis code, called MARS (Models of Advanced Recording Systems), is capable of\naccurately simulating the magnetisation dynamics in large and structurally\ncomplex single- and multi-layered granular systems. The short timescale\nsimulations are achieved for systems far from and close to the Curie point via\nthe implemented Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch solvers\nrespectively. This enables read/write simulations for general perpendicular\nmagnetic recording and also state of the art heat assisted magnetic recording\n(HAMR). The long timescale behaviour is simulated via the Kinetic Monte Carlo\nsolver, enabling investigations into signal-to-noise ratio and data longevity.\nThe combination of these solvers opens up the possibility of multi-timescale\nsimulations within a single software package. For example the entire HAMR\nprocess from initial data writing and data read back to long term data storage\nis possible via a single simulation using MARS. The use of atomistic\nparameterisation for the material input of MARS enables highly accurate\nmaterial descriptions which provide a bridge between atomistic simulation and\nreal world experimentation. Thus MARS is capable of performing simulations for\nall aspects of recording media research and development. This ranges from\nmaterial characterisation and optimisation to system design and implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 04:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Plaque formation is orchestrated by macrophages that are\nrecruited to the artery wall to consume and remove blood-derived lipids, such\nas low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Ineffective lipid removal, due to macrophage\ndeath and other factors, leads to the accumulation of lipid-loaded macrophages\nand formation of a necrotic core. Experimental observations suggest that\nmacrophage functionality varies with the extent of lipid loading. However,\nlittle is known about the resultant influence on plaque fate. Extending work by\nFord et al. (2019) and Chambers et al. (2022), we develop a plaque model in\nwhich macrophages are classified by their ingested lipid content and behave in\na lipid-dependent manner. The model, a system of partial-integro differential\nequations, considers several macrophage behaviours. These include: recruitment\nto the artery wall; proliferation and apoptosis; ingestion of LDL, apoptotic\ncells and necrotic lipid; emigration from the artery wall; and necrosis of\napoptotic cells. Here, we consider apoptosis, emigration and proliferation to\nbe lipid-dependent. We model lipid-dependence in these behaviours with\nexperimentally-informed functions of the internalised lipid load. Our results\ndemonstrate that lipid-dependent macrophage behaviour can substantially alter\nplaque fate by changing both the total quantity of lipid in the plaque and the\ndistribution of lipid between the live cells, dead cells and necrotic core. For\nlipid-dependent apoptosis and lipid-dependent emigration simulations, we find\nsignificant differences in outcomes for cases that ultimately converge on the\nsame net rate of apoptosis or emigration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 06:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

We detect two transverse oscillations in\nshort loops with lengths of 4.5 Mm and 11 Mm. The shorter loop displays an\noscillation with a 14 s period and the longer a 30 s period. Despite the high\nresolution, no definitive identification as propagating or standing waves is\npossible. The velocity amplitudes are found to be equal to 72 km/s and 125\nkm/s, respectively, for the shorter and longer loop. Based on that, we also\nestimated the values of the energy flux contained in the loops - the energy\nflux of the 14 s oscillation is 1.9 kW m^-2 and of the 30 s oscillation it is\n6.5 kW m^-2 . While these oscillations have been observed in the Quiet Sun,\ntheir energy fluxes are of the same order as the energy input required to heat\nthe active solar corona. Numerical simulations were performed in order to\nreproduce the observed oscillations. The correspondence of the numerical\nresults to the observations provide support to the energy content estimates for\nthe observations. Such high energy densities have not yet been observed in\ndecayless coronal waves, and this is promising for coronal heating models based\non wave damping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 07:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In this way, our method can directly gain accurate text boundaries and\nabandon complex post-processing to improve efficiency. Specifically, our method\nmainly consists of a feature extraction backbone, a boundary proposal module,\nand an iteratively optimized boundary transformer module. The boundary proposal\nmodule consisting of multi-layer dilated convolutions will compute important\nprior information (including classification map, distance field, and direction\nfield) for generating coarse boundary proposals while guiding the boundary\ntransformer's optimization. The boundary transformer module adopts an\nencoder-decoder structure, in which the encoder is constructed by multi-layer\ntransformer blocks with residual connection while the decoder is a simple\nmulti-layer perceptron network (MLP). Under the guidance of prior information,\nthe boundary transformer module will gradually refine the coarse boundary\nproposals via iterative boundary deformation. Furthermore, we propose a novel\nboundary energy loss (BEL) which introduces an energy minimization constraint\nand an energy monotonically decreasing constraint to further optimize and\nstabilize the learning of boundary refinement.

Our RDARP extends the DARP by (1) minimizing a\nweighted sum of travel cost and disease-transmission risk exposure for onboard\npassengers and (2) introducing a maximum cumulative exposure risk constraint\nfor each vehicle to ensure a trip with lower external exposure. Both extensions\nrequire that the risk exposure of each onboard passenger is propagated in a\nminimized fashion while satisfying other existing constraints of the DARP. To\nfully describe the RDARP, we first provide a three-index arc-based formulation\nand reformulate the RDARP into an equivalent min-max trip-based formulation,\nwhich is solved by an exact Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm.

If the first curve is convolved by a Laplace function, the\ncorresponding numbers are phase range of $\\approx 0.0274$, mean difference of\n$-1.23 \\pm 1.30$ and $\\chi^2$ of $0.76$. These phase ranges are much smaller\nthan those over which the reflection symmetry has been perceived. Therefore the\nonly way the two edges can have a mirror relation over a substantial phase\nrange is if one invokes a broad and faint emission component of amplitude\n$\\approx 100$ photons/sec and width $\\approx 0.1$ in phase, centered at phase\n$\\approx 0.1$ beyond the second peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 08:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We regard\nthe Filippov convexification of these systems and a transformation into dynamic\ncomplementarity systems introduced by Stewart. FESD is based on solving of\nnonlinear complementarity problems and able to automatically detect the\nnonsmooth events in time. If standard Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are naively\napplied to a nonsmooth ODE, the accuracy is at best of order one. In FESD, we\nlet the integrator step-size to be a degree of freedom. Additional\ncomplementarity conditions, that we call cross complementarities, enable exact\nswitch detection, hence FESD is able to recover the high order accuracy which\nthe RK methods enjoy for smooth ODE. Additional conditions called step\nequilibration allow the step-size to change only when switches occur and thus\navoid spurious degrees of freedom. Convergence results for the FESD method are\nderived, local uniqueness of the solution and convergence of numerical\nsensitivities are proven. The efficacy of FESD in demonstrated on several\nsimulation and optimal control examples.

A frequency-dependent damping\nof slow waves in various coronal plasma structures remains an open question, as\ntraditional wave damping theories fail to match observations.

For nodes with sparse\nconnectivity, it is difficult to obtain enough information through a single GNN\nlayer as not only there are only few nodes directly connected to them but also\ncan not propagate the high-order neighbor information.

We examine\nhow remote sensing of currents is achieved in practice by analyzing the wave\nspectrum, as may be measured for example by X-band radar. A set of consecutive\nbackscatter images recorded as a function of time is Fourier-transformed to\nproduce the spectrum, which gives information concerning the propagation of\nwaves whose dispersion is altered by currents. X-band radar images measure the\nwave field over multiple square kilometers, and analyzing various spatial\nsubsets of the images allows a map of the spatial variation of the currents to\nbe reconstructed. Several algorithms for obtaining empirical dispersion\nrelations from the measured spectrum and extracting the currents are reviewed:\nthe least squares and iterative least squares method, the normalized scalar\nproduct method, and the polar current shell method. We go on to describe how\nthe same methods and algorithms can be extended to also allowing the\ndepth-dependence of the current to be determined.

The model is representative among many 3D\nsubwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of\nelectromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We\ndevelop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon\na combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide\nmode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field\nover the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which\nare used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By\nperforming rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance\nconditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the\ncomplex plane.

In that context, algorithmic\ncontributions for graph mining are not spared by the problem of fairness and\npresent some specific challenges related to the intrinsic nature of graphs: (1)\ngraph data is non-IID, and this assumption may invalidate many existing studies\nin fair machine learning, (2) suited metric definitions to assess the different\ntypes of fairness with relational data and (3) algorithmic challenge on the\ndifficulty of finding a good trade-off between model accuracy and fairness.\nThis survey is the first one dedicated to fairness for relational data.

Here we develop a quantum\nversion of the paradox, wherein a (semiclassical) wave packet evolves through a\nregion containing a wormhole time machine. This is accomplished by mapping all\nrelevant paths on to a quantum circuit, in which the distinction of the various\npaths is facilitated by representing the billiard particle with a clock state.\nFor this model, we find that Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) provides\nself-consistent solutions in the form of a mixed state composed of terms which\nrepresent every possible configuration of the particle's evolution through the\ncircuit. In the equivalent circuit picture (ECP), this reduces to a binomial\ndistribution in the number of loops of time machine. The postselected\nteleportation prescription (P-CTCs) on the other hand predicts a pure-state\nsolution in which the loop counts have binomial coefficient weights. We then\ndiscuss the model in the continuum limit, with a particular focus on the\nvarious methods one may employ in order to guarantee convergence in the average\nnumber of clock evolutions.

In particular, past work has shown that such time\ndelays can shrink the Turing space, thereby inhibiting patterns from forming\nacross large ranges of parameters. Such delays can also increase the time taken\nfor pattern formation even when Turing instabilities occur. Here we consider\nreaction-diffusion models incorporating fixed or distributed time delays,\nmodelling the underlying stochastic nature of gene expression dynamics, and\nanalyze these through a systematic linear instability analysis and numerical\nsimulations for several sets of different reaction kinetics. We find that even\ncomplicated distribution kernels (skewed Gaussian probability density\nfunctions) have little impact on the reaction-diffusion dynamics compared to\nfixed delays with the same mean delay. We show that the location of the delay\nterms in the model can lead to changes in the size of the Turing space\n(increasing or decreasing) as the mean time delay, $\\tau$, is increased. We\nshow that the time to pattern formation from a perturbation of the homogeneous\nsteady state scales linearly with $\\tau$, and conjecture that this is a general\nimpact of time delay on reaction-diffusion dynamics, independent of the form of\nthe kinetics or location of the delayed terms. Finally we show that while\ninitial and boundary conditions can influence these dynamics, particularly the\ntime-to-pattern, the effects of delay appear robust under variations of initial\nand boundary data. Overall our results help clarify the role of gene expression\ntime delays in reaction-diffusion patterning, and suggest clear directions for\nfurther work in studying more realistic models of pattern formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 11:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

One of the most complex detection\nchallenges is that of partial occlusion, where a target object is only\npartially available to the sensor due to obstruction by another foreground\nobject. A number of current pedestrian detection benchmarks provide annotation\nfor partial occlusion to assess algorithm performance in these scenarios,\nhowever each benchmark varies greatly in their definition of the occurrence and\nseverity of occlusion. In addition, current occlusion level annotation methods\ncontain a high degree of subjectivity by the human annotator.

This task of\ninspection is laborious, slow, and often requires complex access. Recently,\ndeep learning based algorithms have revealed promise and performance in the\nautomatic detection of corrosion. However, to date, research regarding the\nsegmentation of images for automated corrosion detection has been limited, due\nto the lack of availability of per-pixel labelled data sets which are required\nfor model training. Herein, a novel deep learning approach (termed RustSEG) is\npresented, that can accurately segment images for automated corrosion\ndetection, without the requirement of per-pixel labelled data sets for\ntraining. The RustSEG method will first, using deep learning techniques,\ndetermine if corrosion is present in an image (i.e. a classification task), and\nthen if corrosion is present, the model will examine what pixels in the\noriginal image contributed to that classification decision. Finally, the method\ncan refine its predictions into a pixel-level segmentation mask. In ideal\ncases, the method is able to generate precise masks of corrosion in images,\ndemonstrating that the automated segmentation of corrosion without per-pixel\ntraining data is possible, addressing a significant hurdle in automated\ninfrastructure inspection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 11:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

During OLKMC simulations, our method guarantees to\nelide the maximum number of redundant saddle-point searches in symmetrically\nequivalent local-environments. Hence, we are able to study the\ntrapping/detrapping of hydrogen from up to five-vacancy clusters and\nsimultaneously the effect hydrogen has on the diffusivity of these clusters.\nThese processes occur at vastly different timescales at room temperature in\nbody-centred cubic iron.

A disadvantage of such formats is\nthat an application may spend a significant amount of processing time just on\nunselectively parsing all data. To relax this issue, the concept of raw\nfiltering is proposed with the idea to remove data from a stream prior to the\ncostly parsing stage. However, as accurate filtering of raw data is often only\npossible after the data has been parsed, raw filters are designed to be\napproximate in the sense of allowing false-positives in order to be implemented\nefficiently.\n  Contrary to previously proposed CPU-based raw filtering techniques that are\nrestricted to string matching, we present FPGA-based primitives for filtering\nstrings, numbers and also number ranges. In addition, a primitive respecting\nthe basic structure of JSON data is proposed that can be used to further\nincrease the accuracy of introduced raw filters.\n  The proposed raw filter primitives are designed to allow for their\ncomposition according to a given filter expression of a query. Thus, complex\nraw filters can be created for FPGAs which enable a drastical decrease in the\namount of generated false-positives, particularly for IoT workload.\n  As there exists a trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption, we\nevaluate primitives as well as composed raw filters using different queries\nfrom the RiotBench benchmark. Our results show that up to 94.3% of the raw data\ncan be filtered without producing any observed false-positives using only a few\nhundred LUTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 13:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

To read (and write) data DNA storage\nexploits technology that has been developed over decades to sequence naturally\noccurring DNA in the life sciences. To achieve higher accuracy for previously\nunseen, biological DNA, sequencing relies on extending and training deep\nmachine learning models known as basecallers. This growth in model complexity\nrequires substantial resources, both computational and data sets. It also\neliminates the possibility of a compact read head for DNA as a storage medium.\n  We argue that we need to depart from blindly using sequencing models from the\nlife sciences for DNA data storage. The difference is striking: for life\nscience applications we have no control over the DNA, however, in the case of\nDNA data storage, we control how it is written, as well as the particular write\nhead.

Proactive robots are able to act on their own initiative in an\nanticipatory way to benefit humans. In this work, we investigate two ways to\nmake robots proactive. One way is to recognize humans' intentions and to act to\nfulfill them, like opening the door that you are about to cross. The other way\nis to reason about possible future threats or opportunities and to act to\nprevent or to foster them, like recommending you to take an umbrella since rain\nhas been forecasted. In this paper, we present approaches to realize these two\ntypes of proactive behavior. We then present an integrated system that can\ngenerate proactive robot behavior by reasoning on both factors: intentions and\npredictions. We illustrate our system on a sample use case including a domestic\nrobot and a human. We first run this use case with the two separate proactive\nsystems, intention-based and prediction-based, and then run it with our\nintegrated system. The results show that the integrated system is able to take\ninto account a broader variety of aspects that are needed for proactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 13:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

In contrast to\ncommon NAS search spaces, we designed a novel neural architecture search space\ncovering various state-of-the-art architectures, allowing for an efficient\nmacro-search over different DL approaches. To efficiently search in such a\nlarge configuration space, we use Bayesian optimization with multi-fidelity\noptimization. We empirically study several different budget types enabling\nefficient multi-fidelity optimization on different forecasting datasets.\nFurthermore, we compared our resulting system, dubbed \\system, against several\nestablished baselines and show that it significantly outperforms all of them\nacross several datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 08:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 08:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

CFEs have gained\nconsiderable traction as a psychologically grounded solution for explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI). Recent innovations introduce the notion of\ncomputational plausibility for automatically generated CFEs, enhancing their\nrobustness by exclusively creating plausible explanations. However, practical\nbenefits of such a constraint on user experience and behavior is yet unclear.\nIn this study, we evaluate objective and subjective usability of\ncomputationally plausible CFEs in an iterative learning design targeting novice\nusers. We rely on a novel, game-like experimental design, revolving around an\nabstract scenario. Our results show that novice users actually benefit less\nfrom receiving computationally plausible rather than closest CFEs that produce\nminimal changes leading to the desired outcome. Responses in a post-game survey\nreveal no differences in terms of subjective user experience between both\ngroups. Following the view of psychological plausibility as comparative\nsimilarity, this may be explained by the fact that users in the closest\ncondition experience their CFEs as more psychologically plausible than the\ncomputationally plausible counterpart. In sum, our work highlights a\nlittle-considered divergence of definitions of computational plausibility and\npsychological plausibility, critically confirming the need to incorporate human\nbehavior, preferences and mental models already at the design stages of XAI\napproaches.

When a variable reveals its value, the gambler needs to decide\nirrevocably whether or not to accept it. The goal is to maximize the\ncompetitive ratio between the expected gain of the gambler and that of the\nmaximum variable. It is shown by Correa et al. that when the distribution is\nunknown or only $o(n)$ uniform samples from the distribution are given, the\nbest an algorithm can do is $1/e$-competitive. In contrast, when the\ndistribution is known or $\\Omega(n)$ uniform samples are given, the optimal\ncompetitive ratio 0.7451 can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a new model\nin which the algorithm has access to an oracle that answers quantile queries\nabout the distribution, and study the extent to which we can use a small number\nof queries to achieve good competitive ratios. Naturally, by making queries to\nthe oracle, one can implement the threshold-based blind strategies that use the\nanswers from the queries as thresholds to accept variables. Our first\ncontribution is to prove that the competitive ratio improves gracefully with\nthe number of thresholds. Particularly with two thresholds our algorithm\nachieves a competitive ratio of 0.6786. Our second contribution, surprisingly,\nshows that with a single query, we can do strictly better than with a single\nthreshold. The algorithm sets a threshold in the first phase by making a single\nquery and uses the maximum realization from the first phase as the threshold\nfor the second phase. It can be viewed as a natural combination of the\nsingle-threshold algorithm and the algorithm for the secretary problem. By\nproperly choosing the quantile to query and the break-point between the two\nphases, we achieve a competitive ratio of 0.6718.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Recently, it has even been observed that large but\nfrozen pre-trained language models (PLMs) with prompt learning outperform\nsmaller but fine-tuned models. However, as with many recent NLP trends, the\nperformance of even the largest PLMs such as GPT-3 do not perform well on\nspecialized domains (e.g. medical text), and the common practice to achieve\nState of the Art (SoTA) results still consists of pre-training and fine-tuning\nthe PLMs on downstream tasks. The reliance on fine-tuning large PLMs is\nproblematic in clinical settings where data is often held in non-GPU\nenvironments, and more resource efficient methods of training specialized\ndomain models is crucial. We investigated the viability of prompt learning on\nclinically meaningful decision tasks and directly compared with more\ntraditional fine-tuning methods. Results are partially in line with the prompt\nlearning literature, with prompt learning able to match or improve on\ntraditional fine-tuning with substantially fewer trainable parameters and\nrequiring less training data. We argue that prompt learning therefore provides\nlower computational resource costs applicable to clinical settings, that can\nserve as an alternative to fine-tuning ever increasing in size PLMs.\nComplementary code to reproduce experiments presented in this work can be found\nat: https://github.com/NtaylorOX/Public_Clinical_Prompt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Availability of high-precision data requires a\ncritical reassessment of any assumptions that may impact the accuracy of\nconstraints. The standard formalism for constraining DM-baryon scattering\npre-recombination is based on assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity\ndistribution for DM. This assumption is not always justified and does not allow\nfor probing DM self-interactions in addition to its interactions with baryons.\nLifting the MB assumption requires solving the full collisional Boltzmann\nequation (CBE), which is highly non-trivial. Earlier work proposed a more\ntractable Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation to the CBE, but its accuracy\nremained unknown. In this work, we numerically solve the exact CBE for the\nfirst time, in a homogeneous expanding background. We consider DM-baryon\nscattering cross-sections that are positive power-laws of relative velocity. We\nderive analytical expressions for the collision operator in the case of\nisotropic differential scattering cross-sections. We then solve the background\nCBE numerically and use our solution for the DM velocity distribution to\ncompute the DM-baryon heat-exchange rate, which we compare against those\nobtained with the MB assumption and FP approximation. Over a broad range of\nDM-to-baryon mass ratios, we find that the FP approximation leads to a maximum\nerror of 17%, significantly better than the up to 160% error introduced by the\nMB assumption. While our results strictly apply only to the background\nevolution, the accuracy of the FP approximation is likely to carry over to\nperturbations. This motivates its implementation into cosmological Boltzmann\ncodes, where it can supersede the much less accurate MB assumption, and allow\nfor a more general exploration of DM interactions with baryons and with itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 17:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Recent approaches have successfully\namalgamated the traditional modular architecture of an autonomous driving stack\ncomprising perception, prediction, and planning in an end-to-end trainable\nsystem. Such a system calls for a shared latent space embedding with\ninterpretable intermediate trainable projected representation. One such\nsuccessfully deployed representation is the Bird's-Eye View(BEV) representation\nof the scene in ego-frame. However, a fundamental assumption for an undistorted\nBEV is the local coplanarity of the world around the ego-vehicle. This\nassumption is highly restrictive, as roads, in general, do have gradients. The\nresulting distortions make path planning inefficient and incorrect. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose Neural Manifold Representation (NMR), a\nrepresentation for the task of autonomous driving that learns to infer\nsemantics and predict way-points on a manifold over a finite horizon, centered\non the ego-vehicle. We do this using an iterative attention mechanism applied\non a latent high dimensional embedding of surround monocular images and partial\nego-vehicle state. This representation helps generate motion and behavior plans\nconsistent with and cognizant of the surface geometry. We propose a sampling\nalgorithm based on edge-adaptive coverage loss of BEV occupancy grid and\nassociated guidance flow field to generate the surface manifold while incurring\nminimal computational overhead. We aim to test the efficacy of our approach on\nCARLA and SYNTHIA-SF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 14:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The dynamical mass ejection is investigated in\nthree-dimensional simulations. The post-merger mass ejection is investigated in\ntwo-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with viscosity using the\nthree-dimensional post-merger systems as the initial conditions. We show that\nthe typical neutron-richness of the dynamical ejecta is higher for the merger\nof more asymmetric binaries; hence, heavier $r$-process nuclei are dominantly\nsynthesized. The post-merger ejecta are shown to have only a mild\nneutron-richness, which results in the production of lighter $r$-process\nnuclei, irrespective of binary mass ratios. Because of the larger disk mass,\nthe post-merger ejecta mass is larger for more asymmetric binary mergers. Thus,\nthe post-merger ejecta can compensate for the underproduced lighter $r$-process\nnuclei for asymmetric merger cases. As a result, by summing up both ejecta\ncomponents, the solar residual $r$-process pattern is reproduced within the\naverage deviation of a factor of three, irrespective of the binary mass ratio.\nOur result also indicates that the (about a factor of a few) light-to-heavy\nabundance scatter observed in $r$-process-enhanced stars can be attributed to\nvariation in the binary mass ratio and total mass.

Computational\nand memory requirements are particularly burdensome for three-dimensional\ndynamic imaging applications requiring high resolution in both space and time.\nExploiting redundancies in the object's spatiotemporal features is key to\naddressing both challenges. This contribution investigates neural fields, or\nimplicit neural representations, to model the sought-after dynamic object.\nNeural fields are a particular class of neural networks that represent the\ndynamic object as a continuous function of space and time, thus avoiding the\nburden of storing a full resolution image at each time frame. Neural field\nrepresentation thus reduces the image reconstruction problem to estimating the\nnetwork parameters via a nonlinear optimization problem (training). Once\ntrained, the neural field can be evaluated at arbitrary locations in space and\ntime, allowing for high-resolution rendering of the object. Key advantages of\nthe proposed approach are that neural fields automatically learn and exploit\nredundancies in the sought-after object to both regularize the reconstruction\nand significantly reduce memory storage requirements. The feasibility of the\nproposed framework is illustrated with an application to dynamic image\nreconstruction from severely undersampled circular Radon transform data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 15:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The present work takes the recent progress of A/V ASR one step further\nand considers the scenario where multiple people are simultaneously on screen\n(multi-person A/V ASR). We propose a fully differentiable A/V ASR model that is\nable to handle multiple face tracks in a video. Instead of relying on two\nseparate models for speaker face selection and audio-visual ASR on a single\nface track, we introduce an attention layer to the ASR encoder that is able to\nsoft-select the appropriate face video track. Experiments carried out on an A/V\nsystem trained on over 30k hours of YouTube videos illustrate that the proposed\napproach can automatically select the proper face tracks with minor WER\ndegradation compared to an oracle selection of the speaking face while still\nshowing benefits of employing the visual signal instead of the audio alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 15:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

For this purpose, the algorithm\nuses a repeating structure that analyzes the known irregular contour\ncoordinates to approximate the physical domain contour by mesh segments. To\nthis end, the algorithm calculates the slope of the line defined by the known\npoint of the irregular contours and the neighboring vertices.

The\ncontour is evaluated through three geometries, the difference between the areas\ndelimited by the given contour and the approximate contour, the number of nodes\nand the number of internal points.

The problem of protein structure prediction is about\npredicting the native conformation of a protein, while its sequence of amino\nacids is known. Regarding processing limitations of current computer systems,\nall-atom simulations for proteins are typically unpractical; several reduced\nmodels of proteins have been proposed. Additionally, due to intrinsic hardness\nof calculations even in reduced models, many computational methods mainly based\non artificial intelligence have been proposed to solve the problem. Agent-based\nmodeling is a relatively new method for modeling systems composed of\ninteracting items. In this paper we proposed a new approach for protein\nstructure prediction by using agent-based modeling (ABM) in two dimensional\nhydrophobic-hydrophilic model. We broke the whole process of protein structure\nprediction into two steps: the first step, which was introduced in our previous\npaper, is about biasing the linear sequence to gain a primary energy, and the\nnext step, which will be explained in this paper, is about using ABM with a\npredefined set of rules, to find the best conformation in the least possible\namount of time and steps. This method was implemented in NETLOGO. We have\ntested this algorithm on several benchmark sequences ranging from 20 to 50-mers\nin two dimensional Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic lattice models. Comparing to the\nresult of the other algorithms, our method is capable of finding the best known\nconformations in a significantly shorter time. A major problem in PSP\nsimulation is that as the sequence length increases the time consumed to\npredict a valid structure will exponentially increase. In contrast, by using\nMAS2HP the effect of increase in sequence length on spent time has changed from\nexponentially to linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 05:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 00:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 00:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 23:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

To enhance the feature representation ability, in this paper, a GCN\nmodel with contrastive learning is proposed to explore the supervision signals\ncontained in both spectral information and spatial relations, which is termed\nContrastive Graph Convolutional Network (ConGCN), for HSI classification.\nFirst, in order to mine sufficient supervision signals from spectral\ninformation, a semi-supervised contrastive loss function is utilized to\nmaximize the agreement between different views of the same node or the nodes\nfrom the same land cover category. Second, to extract the precious yet implicit\nspatial relations in HSI, a graph generative loss function is leveraged to\nexplore supplementary supervision signals contained in the graph topology. In\naddition, an adaptive graph augmentation technique is designed to flexibly\nincorporate the spectral-spatial priors of HSI, which helps facilitate the\nsubsequent contrastive representation learning. The extensive experimental\nresults on four typical benchmark datasets firmly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed ConGCN in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 12:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Here\nwe present an updated computational model for simulating smoldering combustion\nin cellulose and hemicellulose mixtures. We used this model to examine changes\nin smoldering propagation speed and peak temperatures with varying fuel\ncomposition and density. For a given fuel composition, increases in density\ndecrease the propagation speed and increase mean peak temperature; for a given\ndensity, increases in hemicellulose content increase both propagation speed and\npeak temperature. We also examined the role of natural fuel expansion with the\naddition of water. Without expansion, addition of moisture content reduces the\npropagation speed primarily due to increasing (wet) fuel density. However, with\nfuel expansion similar to that observed in peat, the propagation speed\nincreases due to the overall drop in fuel density. Finally, we studied the\ninfluence of fuel composition on critical moisture content of ignition and\nextinction: mixtures dominated by hemicellulose have 10% higher critical\nmoisture content due to the increase in peak temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 22:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}
