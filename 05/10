If $G\\subset U^{\\mathbb C}$ is closed and compatible,\nthere is a corresponding gradient map $\\mu_\\mathfrak{p} : X\\longrightarrow\n\\mathfrak{p}$, where $\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak k \\oplus \\mathfrak p$ is a Cartan\ndecomposition of the Lie algebra of $G$.

For such actions, one can characterize stability,\nsemistability and polystability of a point by a numerical criteria using a\n$G$-equivariant function associated with a gradient map, called maximal weight\nfunction.

By introducing a generic model of\nelectrons coupled to an inelastic medium of phonons, we demonstrate that an\nelectron avalanche can occur in the bulk limit of such insulators at\narbitrarily small electric field. The quantum avalanche arises by the\ngeneration of a ladder of in-gap states, created by a multi-phonon emission\nprocess. Hot-phonons in the avalanche trigger a premature and partial collapse\nof the correlated gap. The details of the phonon spectrum dictate two-stage\nversus single-stage mechanisms which we associate with CDW and Mott resistive\ntransitions, respectively. The electron and phonon temperatures, as well as the\ntemperature dependence of the threshold fields, point to the quantum nature of\nthis nonequilibrium phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 16:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

We quantify the lift induced on the wing\nby these different vortices, and also estimate their influence within different\nregions of the flow-field around the wing and in the wake. By varying the\naspect-ratio and angle-of-attack of the wing, we show that for most cases, the\nspanwise oriented vorticity contributes less to the total lift than cross-span\noriented vortices. Furthermore, the spanwise vorticity in the near wake is\ncapable of producing net negative lift on the wing and this is explained by\nseparating and quantifying the influence of vortex cores and regions of strain\nin the wake.

When the\nintegration domain of the potential is irregular and is discretized by an\nunstructured mesh, the function spaces of near field and self-interactions are\nnon-compact, and, thus, their computations cannot be easily accelerated. In\nthis paper, we propose three novel and complementary techniques for\naccelerating the evaluation of potentials over unstructured meshes. Firstly, we\nrigorously characterize the geometry of the near field, and show that this\nanalysis can be used to eliminate all the unnecessary near field interaction\ncomputations. Secondly, as the near field can be made arbitrarily small by\nincreasing the order of the far field quadrature rule, the expensive near field\ninteraction computation can be efficiently offloaded onto the FMM-based far\nfield interaction computation, which leverages the computational efficiency of\nhighly optimized parallel FMM libraries. Finally, we show that a separate\ninterpolation mesh that is staggered to the quadrature mesh dramatically\nreduces the cost of constructing the interpolants. Besides these contributions,\nwe present a robust and extensible framework for the evaluation and\ninterpolation of 2-D volume potentials over complicated geometries.

The phenomenon is driven by the\npervaporation of the liquid present in the channel through the surrounding\nmedium. The penetration is intermittent, jerky, and characterised by a\nstop-and-go dynamics as the bubble escapes the constriction. We demonstrate\nthat this sequence of arrest and jump of the bubble is due to an\nelastocapillary coupling between the air-liquid interface and the elastic\nmedium. When the interface enters the constriction, its curvature strongly\nincreases, leading to a depression within the liquid-filled channel which\ndrives a compression of the channel. As the interface is forced to leave the\nconstriction at a given threshold, due to the ongoing loss of liquid content by\npervaporation, the pressure is suddenly released, which gives rise to a rapid\npropagation of the air bubbles away from the constriction and a restoration of\nthe rest shape of the channel. Combining macroscopic observations and confocal\nimaging, we present a comprehensive experimental study of this phenomenon. In\nparticular, the effect of the channel geometry on the time of arrest in the\nconstriction and the jump length is investigated. Our novel microfluidic design\nsucceeds in mimicking the role of inter-vessel pits in plants, which\ntransiently stop the propagation of air embolism during long and severe\ndroughts.

The current status quo of relying on manufacturers' cloud services to\nprocess this data is especially problematic since users cede control once their\ndata leaves their home. Multiple recent incidents further call into question if\nvendors can indeed be trusted with users' data. At the same time, users desire\ncompelling features supported by IoT devices and ML-based cloud inferences\nwhich compels them to subscribe to manufacturer-managed cloud services. An\nalternative to use a local in-home hub requires substantial hardware\ninvestment, management, and scalability limitations. This paper proposes\nSelf-Serviced IoT (SSIoT), a clean-slate approach of using a hybrid hub-cloud\nsetup to enable privacy-aware computation offload for IoT applications.\nUniquely, SSIoT enables opportunistic computation offload to public cloud\nproviders while still ensuring that the end-user retains complete end-to-end\ncontrol of their private data reducing the trust required from public cloud\nproviders. We show that SSIoT can leverage emerging function-as-a-service\ncomputation (e.g. AWS Lambda) to make these offloads cost-efficient, scalable\nand high performance as long as key limitations of being stateless, limited\nresources, and security isolation can be addressed. We build an end-to-end\nprototype of SSIoT and evaluate it using several micro-benchmarks and example\napplications representing real-world IoT use cases. Our results show that SSIoT\nis highly scalable, as compared to local-only approaches which struggle with as\nlittle as 2-4 apps in parallel. We also show that SSIoT is cost-efficient\n(operating a smart doorbell for $10 a year) at the cost of minimal additional\nlatency as compared to a local-only hub, even with a hardware ML accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 16:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Inspired by the\nobservation that a backdoored DNN tends to form a new cluster in its feature\nspaces for poisoned data, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage backdoor\ndefense method, named MCLDef, based on Model-Contrastive Learning (MCL). In the\nfirst stage, our approach performs trigger inversion based on trigger\nsynthesis, where the resultant trigger can be used to generate poisoned data.\nIn the second stage, under the guidance of MCL and our defined positive and\nnegative pairs, MCLDef can purify the backdoored model by pulling the feature\nrepresentations of poisoned data towards those of their clean data\ncounterparts. Due to the shrunken cluster of poisoned data, the backdoor formed\nby end-to-end supervised learning is eliminated.

Investigating the\nsolar cycle variation observationally in more detail can give us clues about\nhow to resolve the controversies. We investigate the solar cycle variation of\nthe most magnetically quiet regions and their surface gravity oscillation\n($f$-) mode integrated energy ($E_f$). We use 12 years of HMI data and apply a\nstringent selection criteria, based on spatial and temporal quietness, to avoid\nany influence of active regions (ARs). We develop an automated high-throughput\npipeline to go through all available magnetogram data and to compute $E_f$ for\nthe selected quiet regions. We observe a clear solar cycle dependence of the\nmagnetic field strength in the most quiet regions containing several\nsupergranular cells. For patch sizes smaller than a supergranular cell, no\nsignificant cycle dependence is detected. The $E_f$ at the supergranular scale\nis not constant over time. During the late ascending phase of Cycle 24 (SC24,\n2011-2012), it is roughly constant, but starts diminishing in 2013, as the\nmaximum of SC24 is approached. This trend continues until mid-2017, when hints\nof strengthening at higher southern latitudes are seen. Slow strengthening\ncontinues, stronger at higher latitudes than at the equatorial regions, but\n$E_f$ never returns back to the values seen in 2011-2012. Also, the\nstrengthening trend continues past the solar minimum, to the years when SC25 is\nalready clearly ascending. Hence the $E_f$ behavior is not in phase with the\nsolar cycle. The anticorrelation of $E_f$ with the solar cycle in gross terms\nis expected, but the phase shift of several years indicates a connection to the\npoloidal large-scale magnetic field component rather than the toroidal one.\nCalibrating AR signals with the QS $E_f$ does not reveal significant\nenhancement of the $f$-mode prior to AR emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 16:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

So\nit is natural to ask whether graphs excluding the basic treewidth obstructions\nas induced subgraphs have bounded treewidth. Sintiari and Trotignon answered\nthis question in the negative. Their counterexamples, the so-called \"layered\nwheels,\" contain wheels, where a wheel consists of a hole (i.e., an induced\ncycle of length at least four) along with a vertex with at least three\nneighbors in the hole. This leads one to ask whether graphs excluding wheels\nand the basic treewidth obstructions as induced subgraphs have bounded\ntreewidth.

However, when facing complex\nconfiguration spaces, cluttered with obstacles, roboticists typically fall back\nto sampling-based planners that struggle in very high dimensions and with\ncontinuous differential constraints. Indeed, obstacles are the source of many\ntextbook examples of problematic nonconvexities in the trajectory-optimization\nproblem. Here we show that convex optimization can, in fact, be used to\nreliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we consider planning\nproblems with collision-avoidance constraints, as well as cost penalties and\nhard constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the\ntrajectory. Combining the properties of B\\'ezier curves with a\nrecently-proposed framework for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets\n(GCS), we formulate the planning problem as a compact mixed-integer\noptimization. In stark contrast with existing mixed-integer planners, the\nconvex relaxation of our programs is very tight, and a cheap rounding of its\nsolution is typically sufficient to design globally-optimal trajectories. This\nreduces the mixed-integer program back to a simple convex optimization, and\nautomatically provides optimality bounds for the planned trajectories. We name\nthe proposed planner GCS, after its underlying optimization framework. We\ndemonstrate GCS in simulation on a variety of robotic platforms, including a\nquadrotor flying through buildings and a dual-arm manipulator (with fourteen\ndegrees of freedom) moving in a confined space. Using numerical experiments on\na seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator, we show that GCS can outperform\nwidely-used sampling-based planners by finding higher-quality trajectories in\nless time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 17:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

AWS SDKs provide access to AWS services through API\nendpoints. However, incorrect use of these APIs can lead to code defects,\ncrashes, performance issues, and other problems.\n  This paper presents automated static analysis rules, developed in the context\nof a commercial service for detection of code defects and security\nvulnerabilities, to identify deviations from AWS best practices in Python\napplications that use the AWS SDK. Such applications use the AWS SDK for\nPython, called \"Boto3\", to access AWS cloud services. However, precise static\nanalysis of Python applications that use cloud SDKs requires robust type\ninference for inferring the types of cloud service clients. The dynamic style\nof Boto3 APIs poses unique challenges for type resolution, as does the\ninterprocedural style in which service clients are used in practice. In support\nof our best-practices goal, we present a layered strategy for type inference\nthat combines multiple type-resolution and tracking strategies in a staged\nmanner. From our experiments across >3,000 popular Python GitHub repos that\nmake use of the AWS SDK, our layered type inference system achieves 85%\nprecision and 100% recall in inferring Boto3 clients in Python client code.\n  Additionally, we present a representative sample of eight AWS best-practice\nrules that detect a wide range of issues including pagination, polling, and\nbatch operations.

Most FER methodologies utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\nthat are powerful tools when it comes to data analysis. However, despite their\npower, these networks are prone to overfitting, as they often tend to memorize\nthe training data. What is more, there are not currently a lot of in-the-wild\n(i.e. in unconstrained environment) large databases for FER. To alleviate this\nissue, a number of data augmentation techniques have been proposed. Data\naugmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying\nconstrained transformations on the original data. One such technique, which has\npositively contributed to various classification tasks, is Mixup. According to\nthis, a DNN is trained on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their\ncorresponding labels.

However, we argue that a good similarity model should\nconsider the semantic discrepancies with caution to better deal with ambiguous\nimages for more robust training. To achieve this, we propose to represent an\nimage using not only a semantic embedding but also an accompanying uncertainty\nembedding, which describes the semantic characteristics and ambiguity of an\nimage, respectively. We further propose an introspective similarity metric to\nmake similarity judgments between images considering both their semantic\ndifferences and ambiguities. Our framework attains state-of-the-art performance\non the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets\nfor image retrieval. We further evaluate our framework for image classification\non the ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, which shows that\nequipping existing data mixing methods with the proposed introspective metric\nconsistently achieves better results (e.g., +0.44 for CutMix on ImageNet-1K).\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wangck20/IDML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 17:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

The analysis is carried out in a\nhigh-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds.

For UVES\nto provide similar spectral resolution (R>100 000; 0.3'' slit) and the broad\nwavelength coverage of ESPRESSO, the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) supplied by\nESO estimates 8 hrs of exposure time spread over two settings; requiring double\nthe time investment than that of ESPRESSO's HR42 mode whilst not properly\nsampling the UVES spectral resolution element. Thus ESPRESSO's HR42 mode offers\nnearly triple the resolving power of UVES (0.8'' slit to match typical ambient\nconditions at Paranal) and provides more accurate characterization of quasar\nabsorption features for an equivalent exposure time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 18:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Consequently, little is known empirically about the expected\nrisk-premia of CAT bonds. The primary contribution of this paper is to present\na unified Bayesian CAT bond pricing framework based on uncertainty\nquantification of catastrophes and interest rates. Our framework allows for\ncomplex beliefs about catastrophe risks to capture the distinct and common\npatterns in catastrophe occurrences, and when combined with stochastic interest\nrates, yields a unified asset pricing approach with informative expected risk\npremia.

The human visual system does not need every pixel\nto be rendered at a uniformly high quality.

More specifically the stochastic model SALT (stochastic\nadvection by Lie transport) is constructed by introducing stochastic transport\ninto the material loop in Kelvin's circulation theorem.

The remarkable property of\nLA-SALT is that the evolution of its higher moments are governed by linear\ndeterministic equations.

The use of Pearson's r has\nbeen strongly discouraged in nonlinear scenarios. Recent research shows that\nthis opinion is myth and Pearson's r should not be ruled out a priori for\nmeasuring nonlinear monotonic relationships. We find that Pearson's r does have\npotential to measure nonlinear dependence as long as the relationships are\nmonotonic, it just underestimates them. We derive a new inequality which is\ntighter than the famous Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, leverage it to adjust the\nunderestimation, and propose a new correlation statistic, i.e., rearrangement\ncorrelation. The rearrangement correlation is able to capture arbitrary\nmonotonic relationships, both linear and nonlinear ones. It reverts to\nPearson's r in linear scenarios, and to Spearman's rho when calculated on\nranks. Investigations on simulated and real-life scenarios show that the\nrearrangement correlation is more accurate in measuring nonlinear monotonic\ndependence, and more powerful in testing nonlinear monotonic dependence than\nclassical correlation statistics, and other recently proposed measures.

The DM mass\ndeficit is interpreted as the existence of a DM density core rather than the\ncuspy structure predicted by the standard cosmological model. A recent study\nproposed that a galaxy merger, in which the smaller satellite galaxy is\nsignificantly compacted by dissipative contraction of the galactic gas, can\nheat the centre of the host galaxy and help make a large DM core. By using an\n$N$-body simulation, we find that a large amount of DM mass is imported to the\ncentre by the merging satellite, making this scenario an unlikely solution for\nthe DM mass deficit. In this work, we consider giant baryonic clumps in high\nredshift galaxies as alternative heating source for creating the baryon\ndominated galaxies with a DM core. Due to dynamical friction, the orbit of\nclumps decays in a few Gyr and the baryons condensate at the galactic centre.\nAs a back-reaction, the halo centre is heated up and the density cusp is\nflattened out. The combination of the baryon condensation and core formation\nmakes the galaxy baryon dominated in the central 2-5 kpc, comparable to the\neffective radius of the observed galaxies. Thus, the dynamical heating by giant\nbaryonic clumps is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed dearth of DM\nin high redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 21:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In this work, we study the dynamics and the convergence properties of\nSGD equipped with new variants of the stochastic Polyak stepsize and provide\nsolutions to both drawbacks of the original SPS.

Identification of factors which\ncontribute to the occurrence of runway overruns can help mitigate the risk and\nprevent such accidents. Methods such as physics-based and statistical-based\nmodels were proposed in the past to estimate runway overrun probabilities.\nHowever, they are either costly or require experts' knowledge. We propose a\nstatistical approach to quantify the risk probability of an aircraft to exceed\na threshold at the speed of 80 knots given a set of influencing factors.

We identify 41 flights with\nan estimated risk probability > 0.001 for a chosen threshold and rank the\neffects of each influencing factor for these flights. Also, the complex\ndependency patterns between some influencing factors for the 41 flights are\nshown to be non symmetric. The D-vine regression approach, compared to\nphysics-based and statistical-based approaches, has an analytical solution, is\nnot simulation based and can be used to estimate very small or large\nprobabilities efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 22:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Then, we perform speech synthesis at the receiver,\nwhich dedicates to re-generate the speech signals by feeding the recognized\ntext and the speaker information into a neural network module. To enable the\nDeepSC-ST adaptive to dynamic channel environments, we identify a robust model\nto cope with different channel conditions.

One popular type of stream analytics is the recurrent neural network\n(RNN) deep learning model based time series or sequence data prediction and\nforecasting. Different from traditional analytics that assumes data are\navailable ahead of time and will not change, stream analytics deals with data\nthat are being generated continuously and data trend/distribution could change\n(a.k.a. concept drift), which will cause prediction/forecasting accuracy to\ndrop over time. One other challenge is to find the best resource provisioning\nfor stream analytics to achieve good overall latency. In this paper, we study\nhow to best leverage edge and cloud resources to achieve better accuracy and\nlatency for stream analytics using a type of RNN model called long short-term\nmemory (LSTM). We propose a novel edge-cloud integrated framework for hybrid\nstream analytics that supports low latency inference on the edge and high\ncapacity training on the cloud. To achieve flexible deployment, we study\ndifferent approaches of deploying our hybrid learning framework including\nedge-centric, cloud-centric and edge-cloud integrated. Further, our hybrid\nlearning framework can dynamically combine inference results from an LSTM model\npre-trained based on historical data and another LSTM model re-trained\nperiodically based on the most recent data. Using real-world and simulated\nstream datasets, our experiments show the proposed edge-cloud deployment is the\nbest among all three deployment types in terms of latency. For accuracy, the\nexperiments show our dynamic learning approach performs the best among all\nlearning approaches for all three concept drift scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 01:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 21:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 13:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Yet, how this behavioral\nmultimodality affects the evolution of cooperation remains largely unknown.\nHere we build a toy model to address this issue by considering a population\nwith bimodal response behaviors, or specifically, with the Fermi and\nTit-for-tat updating rules. While the former rule tends to imitate the\nstrategies of those neighbors who are doing well, the latter repeats what their\nneighbors did to them. In a structural mixing implementation, where the\nupdating rule is fixed for each individual, we find that a moderate mode\nmixture unexpectedly boosts the overall cooperation level of the population.\nThe boost is even more pronounced in the probabilistic mixing, where each\nindividual randomly chooses one of the two modes at each step, and full\ncooperation is seen in a wide range. These findings are robust to the\nunderlying topology of the population. Our mean-field treatment reveals that\nthe cooperation prevalence within the players with the Fermi rule linearly\nincreases with the fraction of TFT players and explains the non-monotonic\ndependence in the structural mixing. Our study shows that the diversity in\nresponse behaviors may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in\nrealistic contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 03:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 02:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

A\nconsortium blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple\norganizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across\nmultiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the\nvalue of introducing consortium blockchains. Decentralized system operations\nhave recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of consortium\nblockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which\nindividual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command\nexecution of configuration change of channels (Fabric's sub-networks) and\nupgrade of chaincodes (Fabric's smart contracts), can be partially executed in\na decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include the\npreceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the\noperational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations,\nafter which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure\nrelies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient decentralized operations\nworkflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose a\ndecentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations\nSmart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart\ncontract. Furthermore, we design and implement OpsSC for blockchain network\noperations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x.

At the same time, it is important to be able to modify such\nassociations when they are maladaptive, for instance in treating anxiety and\ntrauma-related disorders. Standard extinction procedures can reduce fear\ntemporarily, but with sufficient delay or with reminders of the aversive\nexperience, fear often returns. The latent-cause inference framework explains\nthe return of fear by presuming that animals learn a rich model of the\nenvironment, in which the standard extinction procedure triggers the inference\nof a new latent cause, preventing the unlearning of the original aversive\nassociations. This computational framework had previously inspired an\nalternative extinction paradigm -- gradual extinction -- which indeed was shown\nto be more effective in reducing the return of fear. However, the original\nframework was not sufficient to explain the pattern of results seen in the\nexperiments. Here, we propose a formal model to explain the effectiveness of\ngradual extinction in reducing spontaneous recovery and reinstatement effects,\nin contrast to the ineffectiveness of standard extinction and a gradual reverse\ncontrol procedure. We demonstrate through quantitative simulation that our\nmodel can explain qualitative behavioral differences across different\nextinction procedures as seen in the empirical study.

Insect pollination\nmonitoring and management are therefore essential for improving crop production\nand food security. Computer vision facilitated pollinator monitoring can\nintensify data collection over what is feasible using manual approaches. The\nnew data it generates may provide a detailed understanding of insect\ndistributions and facilitate fine-grained analysis sufficient to predict their\npollination efficacy and underpin precision pollination. Current computer\nvision facilitated insect tracking in complex outdoor environments is\nrestricted in spatial coverage and often constrained to a single insect\nspecies. This limits its relevance to agriculture. Therefore, in this article\nwe introduce a novel system to facilitate markerless data capture for insect\ncounting, insect motion tracking, behaviour analysis and pollination prediction\nacross large agricultural areas. Our system is comprised of edge computing\nmulti-point video recording, offline automated multispecies insect counting,\ntracking and behavioural analysis. We implement and test our system on a\ncommercial berry farm to demonstrate its capabilities. Our system successfully\ntracked four insect varieties, at nine monitoring stations within polytunnels,\nobtaining an F-score above 0.8 for each variety. The system enabled calculation\nof key metrics to assess the relative pollination impact of each insect\nvariety. With this technological advancement, detailed, ongoing data collection\nfor precision pollination becomes achievable. This is important to inform\ngrowers and apiarists managing crop pollination, as it allows data-driven\ndecisions to be made to improve food production and food security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 05:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 13:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

To achieve\ncoherent combining, the radios can exchange preambles with the destination for\nfrequency synchronization and signal phase adjustment. At the destination,\ncoherent combining leads to a beamforming (BF) gain. The BF gain can extend the\ncommunication range by countering the path loss that increases with the\ndistance from the destination. While ideally the maximum range can be trivially\ncalculated from the BF gain, in reality, the BF gain depends on the distance\nbecause, at a larger distance, lower SNR of the exchanged preambles causes\nhigher synchronization and phase estimation errors, which in turn degrades the\nBF gain. In this paper, considering the BF gain degradation for a\ndestination-led BF protocol, we calculate the maximum communication range to\nrealize a desired post-BF SNR by analyzing the relation between the pre-BF SNR\nand the BF gain. We show that increasing the preamble lengths or increasing the\ndestination power can significantly increase the maximum range while just\nincreasing the number of radios gives diminishing range extension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 05:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

The effective action of the conformal\nanomaly of light or massless quantum fields has significant effects on\nmacroscopic scales, due to associated light cone singularities that are not\ncaptured by an expansion in local curvature invariants. A compact local form\nfor the WZ effective action of the conformal anomaly and stress tensor is\ngiven, requiring the introduction of a new light scalar field, which it is\nargued should be included in the low energy effective action for gravity. The\nscalar conformalon couples to the conformal part of the spacetime metric and\nallows the effective value of the vacuum energy, described as a condensate of a\n4-form abelian gauge field strength F=dA, to change in space and time. This is\nachieved by the identification of the torsion dependent part of the\nChern-Simons 3-form of the Euler class with the gauge potential A, which enters\nthe effective action of the conformal anomaly as a J.A interaction analogous to\nelectromagnetism. The conserved 3-current J describes the worldtube of\n2-surfaces that separate regions of differing vacuum energy. The resulting EFT\nthus replaces the fixed constant Lambda of classical gravity, and its\napparently unnaturally large sensitivity to UV physics, with a dynamical\ncondensate whose ground state value in empty flat space is Lambda = 0\nidentically. By allowing Lambda to vary rapidly near the 2-surface of a black\nhole horizon, the proposed EFT of dynamical vacuum energy provides an effective\nLagrangian for gravitational condensate stars, as the final state of complete\ngravitational collapse consistent with quantum theory.

This is achieved by merging the need for two separate fleets into\na single one by combining the services. To evaluate the potential of such a\nmobility-on-demand service, this paper uses an agent-based simulation framework\nand integrates three heuristic parcel assignment strategies into a ride-pooling\nfleet control algorithm. Two integration scenarios (moderate and full) are set\nup. While in both scenarios passengers and parcels share rides in one vehicle,\nin the moderate scenario no stops for parcel pick-up and delivery are allowed\nduring a passenger ride to decrease customer inconvenience. Using real-world\ndemand data for a case study of Munich, Germany, the two integration scenarios\ntogether with the three assignment strategies are compared to the status quo,\nwhich uses two separate vehicle fleets for passenger and logistics transport.\nThe results indicate that the integration of logistics services into a\nride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacities\nwithout deteriorating passenger transport.

Denoising based on a burst of multiple frames generally\noutperforms single frame denoising but with the larger compututional cost. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient yet effective burst denoising system. We\nadopt a three-stage design: noise prior integration, multi-frame alignment and\nmulti-frame denoising. First, we integrate noise prior by pre-processing raw\nsignals into a variance-stabilization space, which allows using a small-scale\nnetwork to achieve competitive performance. Second, we observe that it is\nessential to adopt an explicit alignment for burst denoising, but it is not\nnecessary to integrate a learning-based method to perform multi-frame\nalignment. Instead, we resort to a conventional and efficient alignment method\nand combine it with our multi-frame denoising network. At last, we propose a\ndenoising strategy that processes multiple frames sequentially. Sequential\ndenoising avoids filtering a large number of frames by decomposing multiple\nframes denoising into several efficient sub-network denoising. As for each\nsub-network, we propose an efficient multi-frequency denoising network to\nremove noise of different frequencies.

While\nrecent self-supervised learning methods have achieved good performances with\nevaluation set on the same domain as the training set, they will have an\nundesirable performance decrease when tested on a different domain. Therefore,\nthe self-supervised learning from multiple domains task is proposed to learn\ndomain-invariant features that are not only suitable for evaluation on the same\ndomain as the training set but also can be generalized to unseen domains.

They are very\nappealing at first sight because implementing vanilla versions of PINNs based\non strong residual forms is easy, and neural networks offer very high\napproximation capabilities. However, when the PDE solutions are low regular, an\nexpert insight is required to build deep learning formulations that do not\nincur in variational crimes. Optimization solvers are also significantly\nchallenged, and can potentially spoil the final quality of the approximated\nsolution due to the convergence to bad local minima, and bad generalization\ncapabilities. In this paper, we present an exhaustive numerical study of the\nmerits and limitations of these schemes when solutions exhibit low-regularity,\nand compare performance with respect to more benign cases when solutions are\nvery smooth. As a support for our study, we consider singularly perturbed\nconvection-diffusion problems where the regularity of solutions typically\ndegrades as certain multiscale parameters go to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 10:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Currently,\nlines of research in neuromorphic engineering are trying to develop hardware\nthat mimics the functioning of the brain to acquire these superior\ncapabilities. One of the areas still under development is the design of\nbio-inspired memories, where the hippocampus plays an important role. This\nregion of the brain acts as a short-term memory with the ability to store\nassociations of information from different sensory streams in the brain and\nrecall them later. This is possible thanks to the recurrent collateral network\narchitecture that constitutes CA3, the main sub-region of the hippocampus.

Various rearrangements like reversals, transpositions,\ntranslocations, fissions, fusions, and combinations and different variations\nhave been studied extensively by computational biologists and computer\nscientists over the past four decades. From a mathematical point of view, a\ngenome is represented by a permutation. The genome rearrangement problem is\ninterpreted as a problem that transforms one permutation into another in a\nminimum number of moves under certain constraints depending on the chosen\nrearrangements. Finding the minimum number of moves is equivalent to sorting\nthe permutation with the given rearrangement. A transposition is an operation\non a permutation that moves a sublist of a permutation to a different position\nin the same permutation. A \\emph{Prefix Transposition}, as the name suggests,\nis a transposition that moves a sublist which is a prefix of the permutation.\n  In this thesis, we study prefix transpositions on permutations and present a\nbetter upper bound for sorting permutations with prefix transpositions. A\ngreedy algorithm called the \\emph{generalised sequence length algorithm} is\ndefined as an extension of the sequence length algorithm where suitable\nalternate moves are also considered. This algorithm is used to sequentially\nimprove the upper bound to $n-\\log_{3.3} n$ and $n-\\log_3 n$. In the latter\npart of the thesis, we defined the concept of a \\emph{block}.

Decision-makers often aim to take decisions based\non some ground-truth target that is assumed or expected to be unbiased, i.e.,\nequally distributed across socially salient groups. In many practical settings,\nthe ground-truth cannot be directly observed, and instead, we have to rely on a\nbiased proxy measure of the ground-truth, i.e., biased labels, in the data. In\naddition, data is often selectively labeled, i.e., even the biased labels are\nonly observed for a small fraction of the data that received a positive\ndecision. To overcome label and selection biases, recent work proposes to learn\nstochastic, exploring decision policies via i) online training of new policies\nat each time-step and ii) enforcing fairness as a constraint on performance.\nHowever, the existing approach uses only labeled data, disregarding a large\namount of unlabeled data, and thereby suffers from high instability and\nvariance in the learned decision policies at different times.

Using simulated and real data recorded from a seven degree-of-freedom\nrobotic manipulator, we illustrate how using stochastic variational inference\nwith deep kernel models increases compliance in the computed torque controller,\nand retains tracking accuracy. We empirically show how our model outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods with prediction uncertainty for online inverse\ndynamics model learning, and solidify its adaptation and generalisation\ncapabilities across different setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 10:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

The\nobservation of their emitted gravitational waves will offer stringent tests on\ngeneral theory of relativity, and provide a wealth of information about the\ndense environment in galactic centers. To unlock such potential, it is\nnecessary to correctly characterize EMRI signals. However, resonances are a\nphenomena that occurs in EMRI systems and can impact parameter inference, and\ntherefore the science outcome, if not properly modeled. Here, we explore how to\nmodel resonances and develop an efficient implementation. Our previous work has\ndemonstrated that tidal resonances induced by the tidal field of a nearby\nastrophysical object alters the orbital evolution, leading to a significant\ndephasing across observable parameter space. Here, we extensively explore a\nmore generic model for the tidal perturber with additional resonance\ncombinations, to study the dependence of resonance strength on the intrinsic\norbital and tidal parameters. To analyze the resonant signals, accurate\ntemplates that correctly incorporate the effects of the tidal field are\nrequired. The evolution through resonances is obtained using a step function,\nwhose amplitude is calculated using an analytic interpolation of the resonance\njumps. We benchmark this procedure by comparing our approximate method to a\nnumerical evolution. We find that there is no significant error caused by this\nsimplified prescription, as far as the astronomically reasonable range in the\nparameter space is concerned. Further, we use Fisher matrices to study both the\nmeasurement precision of parameters and the systematic bias due to inaccurate\nmodeling. Modeling of self-force resonances can also be carried out using the\nimplementation presented in this study, which will be crucial for EMRI waveform\nmodeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 11:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

One of the\nmost complex outstanding challenges is that of partial occlusion where a target\nobject is only partially available to the sensor due to obstruction by another\nforeground object. A number of leading pedestrian detection benchmarks provide\nannotation for partial occlusion, however each benchmark varies greatly in\ntheir definition of the occurrence and severity of occlusion. Recent research\ndemonstrates that a high degree of subjectivity is used to classify occlusion\nlevel in these cases and occlusion is typically categorized into 2 to 3 broad\ncategories such as partially and heavily occluded. This can lead to inaccurate\nor inconsistent reporting of pedestrian detection model performance depending\non which benchmark is used. This research introduces a novel, objective\nbenchmark for partially occluded pedestrian detection to facilitate the\nobjective characterization of pedestrian detection models. Characterization is\ncarried out on seven popular pedestrian detection models for a range of\nocclusion levels from 0-99%. Results demonstrate that pedestrian detection\nperformance degrades, and the number of false negative detections increase as\npedestrian occlusion level increases.

In addition to the\nwell-known characteristics in the state of polarization, such as the rainbow\ndetermined by the real part of the refractive index, the behavior of the\nunderlying imaginary part of the refractive index causes an increase or\ndecrease in the degree of polarization and a change of sign in the polarization\nat a characteristic wavelength. In contrast to Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgFeSiO$_4$,\nclouds composed of SiO, MnS, Na$_2$S, or ZnS produce a rapidly decreasing\ndegree of polarization with increasing wavelength in the context of an\nexoplanetary atmosphere.

The resulting net polarization is mainly positive for cloud\ncompositions with large imaginary parts of the refractive index, such as Fe,\nFeS, and FeO.

This paper mainly focuses on the super connectedness of direct product\nof graphs and cycles.\n  The connectivity of $G$, denoted by $\\kappa(G)$, is the size of a minimum\nvertex set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G-S$ is not connected or has only one\nvertex. The graph $G$ is said to be super connected, simply super-$\\kappa$, if\nevery minimum vertex cut is the neighborhood of a vertex with minimum degree.\nThe direct product of two graphs $G$ and $H$, denoted by $G\\times H$, is the\ngraph with vertex set $V(G \\times H) = V (G)\\times V (H)$ and edge set $E(G\n\\times H) = \\{(u_{1} ,v_{1} )(u_{2} ,v_{2} )|\\ u_{1}u_{2} \\in E(G), v_{1}v_{2}\n\\in E(H)\\}$.

In particular, a\nsubstantial amount of nerve fiber reconstructions (streamlines) in tractograms\nproduced by state-of-the-art tractography methods are anatomically implausible.\nTo address this problem, tractogram filtering methods have been developed to\nremove faulty connections in a postprocessing step.

Generalized planning\n(GP) is usually addressed as a combinatorial search in a given space of\nalgorithmic solutions, where candidate solutions are evaluated w.r.t.~the\ninstances they solve. This type of solution evaluation ignores any sub-goal\ninformation that is not explicit in the representation of the planning\ninstances, causing plateaus in the space of candidate generalized plans.\nFurthermore, node expansion in GP is a run-time bottleneck since it requires\nevaluating every child node over the entire batch of classical planning\ninstances in a GP problem. In this paper we define a landmark counting\nheuristic for GP (that considers sub-goal information that is not explicitly\nrepresented in the planning instances), and a novel heuristic search algorithm\nfor GP (that we call PGP) and that progressively processes subsets of the\nplanning instances of a GP problem.

We refer to such inhomogeneous\ndifferential forms as polyforms. The construction proceeds by choosing a\ncomplex structure J on R^(2n). Spinors are then polyforms on one of the two\ntotally-isotropic subspaces C^n that arise as eigenspaces of J. There is a\nsimilar description in the split signature case Cl(n,n), with differential\nforms now being those on R^n. In this case the model is constructed by choosing\na paracomplex structure I on R^(n,n), and spinors are polyforms on one of the\ntotally null eigenspaces R^n of I. The main purpose of the paper is to describe\nthe geometry of an analogous construction in the case of a general Clifford\nalgebra Cl(r,s), r+s=2m. We show that in general a creation/annihilation\noperator model is in correspondence with a new type of geometric structure on\nR^(r,s), which provides a splitting R^(r,s)=R^(2k,2l) plus R^(n,n) and endows\nthe first factor with a complex structure and the second factor with a\nparacomplex structure. We refer to such geometric structure as a mixed\nstructure. It can be described as a complex linear combination K=I+i J of a\nparacomplex and a complex structure such that K^2=Id and K K^* is a product\nstructure. In turn, the mixed structure is in correspondence with a pair of\npure spinors whose null subspaces are the eigenspaces of K. The conclusion is\nthen that there is in general not one, but several possible\ncreation/annihilation operator models for a given Clifford algebra. The number\nof models is the number of different types of pure spinors (distinguished by\nthe real index, see the main text) that exists in a given signature. To\nillustrate this geometry, we explicitly describe all the arising models for\nCl(r,s) with r >= s, r+s = 2m <= 6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 13:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

The initial semantics of LPODs, although simple and\nquite intuitive, is not purely model-theoretic. A consequence of this is that\ncertain properties of programs appear non-trivial to formalize in purely\nlogical terms. An example of this state of affairs is the characterization of\nthe notion of strong equivalence for LPODs. Although the results of Faber et\nal. (2008) are accurately developed, they fall short of characterizing strong\nequivalence of LPODs as logical equivalence in some specific logic.

VR remote communication applications offer a\ngreater sense of co-presence and mutual sensing of emotions between remote\nusers. Previous research on these applications has shown that realistic point\ncloud user reconstructions offer better immersion and communication as compared\nto synthetic user avatars. However, photorealistic point clouds require a large\nvolume of data per frame and are challenging to transmit over bandwidth-limited\nnetworks. Recent research has demonstrated significant improvements to\nperceived quality by optimizing the usage of bandwidth based on the position\nand orientation of the user's viewport with user-adaptive streaming.

We perform\na subjective evaluation with 33 users to compare the different streaming\nconditions with a neck exercise training task. As a baseline, we use\nuncompressed streaming requiring ca. 300Mbps and our solution achieves similar\nvisual quality with tiled adaptive streaming at 14Mbps.

Current methods consider the\nsame convolution operations for both shadow and non-shadow regions while\nignoring the large gap between the color mappings for the shadow region and the\nnon-shadow region, leading to poor quality of reconstructed images and a heavy\ncomputation burden. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel\nplug-and-play Shadow-Aware Dynamic Convolution (SADC) module to decouple the\ninterdependence between the shadow region and the non-shadow region. Inspired\nby the fact that the color mapping of the non-shadow region is easier to learn,\nour SADC processes the non-shadow region with a lightweight convolution module\nin a computationally cheap manner and recovers the shadow region with a more\ncomplicated convolution module to ensure the quality of image reconstruction.\nGiven that the non-shadow region often contains more background color\ninformation, we further develop a novel intra-convolution distillation loss to\nstrengthen the information flow from the non-shadow region to the shadow\nregion.

But charts do more than summarize data or reproduce\ntables; they afford interactive data exploration at varying levels of\ngranularity -- from fine-grained datum-by-datum reading to skimming and\nsurfacing high-level trends. In response to the lack of comparable non-visual\naffordances, we present a set of rich screen reader experiences for accessible\ndata visualization and exploration. Through an iterative co-design process, we\nidentify three key design dimensions for expressive screen reader\naccessibility: structure, or how chart entities should be organized for a\nscreen reader to traverse; navigation, or the structural, spatial, and targeted\noperations a user might perform to step through the structure; and,\ndescription, or the semantic content, composition, and verbosity of the screen\nreader's narration. We operationalize these dimensions to prototype\nscreen-reader-accessible visualizations that cover a diverse range of chart\ntypes and combinations of our design dimensions. We evaluate a subset of these\nprototypes in a mixed-methods study with 13 blind and low vision readers. Our\nfindings demonstrate that these designs help users conceptualize data\nspatially, selectively attend to data of interest at different levels of\ngranularity, and experience control and agency over their data analysis\nprocess.

This effect causes a narrow\n(subnatural-width) resonance in the light wave intensity transmitted through a\nvapor cell. Usually, GSHE-based sensors operate in the\nspin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime. However, this regime requires a\nrelatively high temperature of vapors (150 C or higher), leading to a\nrelatively large heat release and power consumption of the sensor head.\nBesides, without applying special measures, SERF regime significantly limits a\ndynamic range of measurements. Here, we study a pump-probe scheme involving a\nsingle elliptically polarized wave and a polarimetric detection technique. The\nwave is in resonance with two adjacent optical transitions in the cesium D1\nline (894.6 nm) owing to their overlapping in presence of a buffer gas (Ne, 130\nTorr). Using a small (0.1 cm$^3$) glass vapor cell, we demonstrate a\npossibility of observing subnatural-width resonances with a high\ncontrast-to-width ratio (up to 45 %/mG) under a low-temperature (60 C) regime\nof operation thanks to a strong light-induced circular dichroism. Basing on a\n$\\Lambda$ scheme of atomic energy levels, we obtain explicit analytical\nexpressions for the line shape. The model reveals a linewidth narrowing effect\ndue to openness of the scheme. This result is unusual for magneto-optical\natomic spectroscopy because the openness is commonly considered as a\nundesirable effect, degrading the resonance characteristics. We estimate a\nsensitivity of 1.8 pT/$\\surd$Hz with a 60 fT/$\\surd$Hz sensitivity in the\nphoton-shot-noise limit.

We study several properties of pointwise\nmaximal leakage, e.g., how it composes over multiple outcomes, how it is\naffected by pre- and post-processing, etc. Furthermore, we propose to view\nprivacy leakage as a random variable which, in turn, allows us to regard\nprivacy guarantees as requirements imposed on different statistical properties\nof the privacy leakage random variable. We define several privacy guarantees\nand study how they behave under pre-processing, post-processing and\ncomposition.

In this paper, the\nproblem of efficiently evaluating the error performance of linear block codes\nover an additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN) channel is\nconsidered. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is a widely used but inefficient\nperformance evaluation method, especially in the low error probability regime.\nAs a variance-reduction technique, importance sampling (IS) can significantly\nreduce the sample size needed for reliable estimation based on a well-designed\nIS distribution.

Drones are\nequipped with cameras, and the video feed from these cameras is often required\nas part of routine navigation, be it for semi autonomous or fully-autonomous\ndrones. Footage of ground-based citizens may be captured in this video feed,\nthereby leading to privacy concerns.\n  This paper presents Privadome, a system that implements the vision of a\nvirtual privacy dome centered around the citizen. Privadome is designed to be\nintegrated with city-scale regulatory authorities that oversee delivery drone\noperations and realizes this vision through two components, PD-MPC and PD-ROS.\nPD-MPC allows citizens equipped with a mobile device to identify drones that\nhave captured their footage. It uses secure two-party computation to achieve\nthis goal without compromising the privacy of the citizen's location.\n  PD-ROS allows the citizen to communicate with such drones and obtain an audit\ntrail showing how the drone uses their footage and determine if\nprivacy-preserving steps are taken to sanitize the footage. An experimental\nevaluation of Privadome using our prototype implementations of PD-MPC and\nPD-ROS shows that the system scales to near-term city-scale delivery drone\ndeployments (hundreds of drones). We show that with PD-MPC the mobile data\nusage on the citizen's mobile device is comparable to that of routine\nactivities on the device, such as streaming videos. We also show that the\nworkflow of PD-ROS consumes a modest amount of additional CPU resources and\npower on our experimental platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 15:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Propagation through biological media is\nvery lossy, and previous work has shown that these losses can be separated into\nthree parts: the losses incurred by the propagating fields, the reflections at\nmedia interfaces, and the coupling of the reactive near field and the lossy\nbody. The first two are unavoidable, but a clever antenna design can minimize\nthe near-field losses. A good physical understanding of this particular loss\nphenomenon is thus very desirable. Unfortunately, previous work does not take\nthe implantation depth into account and is thus valid only for deep implants.\nIn this contribution, we propose approximate expressions to the near field\nlosses of antennas implanted in biological hosts considering the encapsulation\nsize, the frequency, the characteristics of the host medium, and the\nimplantation depth. They are obtained using a spherical wave expansion, and are\nuseful for realistic implantation scenarios.

For this purpose, a virtual model has\nbeen designed and built from a proposed classroom in a school of the city of\nTehran. Accordingly, two educational scenarios, presented in reality and the\nvirtual model respectively, were conducted on a statistical sample of 20\nstudents within the range of 20 to 25 years of age. Within the mentioned\nsample, the first group of 10 students were taught safety measures in a\ntraditional classroom. The second group of 10 students participated in a\nvirtual classroom.

Furthermore, two self-reporting tests of\nDepression, anxiety, stress test (DASS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were\nassigned to the second group to evaluate the effect of foresight under two\ndifferent scenarios.

In freehand US examinations,\nsonographers often navigate a US probe to visualize standard examination planes\nwith rich diagnostic information. However, reproducibility and stability of the\nresulting images often suffer from intra- and inter-operator variation.\nReinforcement learning (RL), as an interaction-based learning method, has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in visual navigating tasks; however, RL is\nlimited in terms of generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a\nsimulation-based RL framework for real-world navigation of US probes towards\nthe standard longitudinal views of vessels. A UNet is used to provide binary\nmasks from US images; thereby, the RL agent trained on simulated binary vessel\nimages can be applied in real scenarios without further training. To accurately\ncharacterize actual states, a multi-modality state representation structure is\nintroduced to facilitate the understanding of environments. Moreover,\nconsidering the characteristics of vessels, a novel standard view recognition\napproach based on the minimum bounding rectangle is proposed to terminate the\nsearching process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the\ntrained policy is validated virtually on 3D volumes of a volunteer's in-vivo\ncarotid artery, and physically on custom-designed gel phantoms using robotic\nUS. The results demonstrate that proposed approach can effectively and\naccurately navigate the probe towards the longitudinal view of vessels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 09:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Three types exist:\nMillikan-Lauritsen (ML), Fowler-Nordheim (FN) and Murphy-Good (MG) plots. In\nSPME methodology, ML and FN plots are slightly curved but a MG plot is nearly\nstraight. 1956 MG FE theory is better physics than 1928 FN theory, so we expect\nMG plots to be more precise than ML or FN plots.

Thus, four different data-input forms exist.\nOver-simplified models of system behaviour are widely assumed. Whether simple\nuse of a data-analysis plot is a valid interpretation method is often\nneglected. Published FE studies seem to contain a high incidence of spurious\nvalues for \"field enhancement factor\". A procedure (the \"Orthodoxy Test\")\ndescribed in 2013 allows a validity check: around 40 % of a small sample of\nresults were spuriously high.

It was later extended\nto a Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) formulation in [Taverniers et al., Journal of\nComputational Physics, 390, 2019] using a Gaussian distribution of a cloud's\ninfluence over a mesh-based, velocity field solution. SPARSE corrects the\ncloud's trace to second order by combining a Taylor series expansion of the\ndrag coefficient and Nusselt number correction factors around the mean relative\nvelocity of a cloud of particles with a Reynolds decomposition of the particle\nequations to obtain a governing system for the first two statistical moments of\nthe cloud's position, velocity and temperature. Here, we close the thus far\nunclosed SPARSE formulation by determining the velocity field in the vicinity\nof the mean cloud location using a truncated Taylor series velocity\nrepresentation and by combining that with averaging. The resulting tracer is\npredictive.

Several features of this result require more detailed description,\nto be given in the text. The equality is significant and unexpected. So is the\nstatement that the equality is independent of the rate of change from state A\nto state B. A few years ago, I had presented three papers in which the\ncontraction of the description from full phase space to coordinate space only\nwas made. This was motivated by the large difference in time scales for momenta\nrelaxation and coordinate relaxation. The Jarzynski equality (JE) will be shown\nhere to be correct only in the limit of slow processes. The proposed example is\nfor a macromolecular harmonic oscillator with a Hooke's spring constant, k,\nthat during the time interval linearly changes from k1 to k2.

By utilizing an experimental methodology in\nthe form of a randomized control trial with a 2x2 factorial design involving\n132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human\ninformation-sharing behavior are analyzed.
