Inverse US methods were developed to reconstruct the media's\nspeed-of-sound (SoS) based on a linear acoustic model. However, the wave\npropagation in medical US is governed by nonlinear acoustics, which introduces\nmore complex behaviors neglected in the linear model. In this work we propose a\nnonlinear waveform inversion (NWI) approach for quantitative US, that considers\na nonlinear acoustics model to simultaneously reconstruct multiple material\nproperties, including the medium's SoS, density, attenuation, and nonlinearity\nparameter. We thus broaden current inverse US approaches, such as the full\nwaveform inversion (FWI) algorithm, by considering nonlinear media, and\nadditional physical parameters.

An EV has two major components, which\nmake it different from traditional vehicles, first is its environment friendly\nnature because of being electric, and second is the interconnection ability of\nthese vehicles because of modern information and communication technologies\n(ICTs). Both of these features are playing a key role in the development of\nEVs, and both academia and industry personals are working towards development\nof modern protocols for EV networks. All these interactions, whether from\nenergy perspective or from communication perspective, both are generating a\ntremendous amount of data every day. In order to get most out of this data\ncollected from EVs, research works have highlighted the use of machine/deep\nlearning techniques for various EV applications. This interaction is quite\nfruitful, but it also comes with a critical concern of privacy leakage during\ncollection, storage, and training of vehicular data. Therefore, alongside\ndeveloping machine/deep learning techniques for EVs, it is also critical to\nensure that they are resilient to private information leakage and attacks. In\nthis paper, we begin with the discussion about essential background on EVs and\nprivacy preservation techniques, followed by a brief overview of privacy\npreservation in EVs using machine learning techniques. Particularly, we also\nfocus on an in-depth review of the integration of privacy techniques in EVs and\nhighlighted different application scenarios in EVs. Alongside this, we provide\na a very detailed survey of current works on privacy preserving machine/deep\nlearning techniques used for modern EVs. Finally, we present the certain\nresearch issues, critical challenges, and future directions of research for\nresearchers working in privacy preservation in EVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 16:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Current routing algorithms tend to keep a routing\nrequest waiting until all of the resources on its path are available. In this\npaper, we introduce a new way of managing entanglement resources in an\nopportunistic fashion: a request can move forward along its path as soon as\npossible (even if some resources on its path are not ready). We show that this\nopportunistic approach is fundamentally better than conventional approaches.

Using\nknown valid paths to solve an individual planning query takes less\ncomputational effort than finding a completely new solution. This allows\nmultiquery algorithms, such as PRM*, to outperform single-query algorithms,\nsuch as RRT*, on many problems but their relative performance depends on how\nmuch information is reused.

At moderate\ndensities, a fundamental basis for the determination of the granular\nhydrodynamics is provided by the Enskog kinetic equation conveniently adapted\nto account for inelastic collisions. A surprising result (compared to its\nmolecular gas counterpart) for granular mixtures is the failure of the energy\nequipartition, even in homogeneous states. This means that the partial\ntemperatures $T_i$ (measuring the mean kinetic energy of each species) are\ndifferent to the (total) granular temperature $T$. The goal of this paper is to\nprovide an overview on the effect of different partial temperatures on the\ntransport properties of the mixture. Our analysis addresses first the impact of\nenergy nonequipartition on transport which is only due to the inelastic\ncharacter of collisions. This effect (which is absent for elastic collisions)\nis shown to be significant in important problems in granular mixtures such as\nthermal diffusion segregation. Then, an independent source of energy\nnonequipartition due to the existence of a divergence of the flow velocity is\nstudied. This effect (which was already analyzed in several pioneering works on\ndense hard-sphere molecular mixtures) affects to the bulk viscosity\ncoefficient.

We have performed a parameter study of systems with different precession\nangles, orbital periods or separations, and different magnetic field strengths.\nWe find that these kinds of nozzles lead to curved jet propagation which is\ndetermined by the main parameters that define the jet nozzle. We find C-shaped\njets from orbiting nozzles and S-shaped jets from precessing nozzles. Over long\ntime and long distances, the initially curved jet motion bores a broad channel\ninto the ambient gas that is filled with high-speed jet material which lateral\nmotion is damped, however. A strong (longitudinal) magnetic field can damp the\njet curvature that is enforced by either precession of orbital motion of the\njet sources.

We conduct the FILM attack on several\nlarge-scale datasets and show that it can successfully reconstruct single\nsentences with high fidelity for large batch sizes and even multiple sentences\nif applied iteratively. We evaluate three defense methods: gradient pruning,\nDPSGD, and a simple approach to freeze word embeddings that we propose. We show\nthat both gradient pruning and DPSGD lead to a significant drop in utility.\nHowever, if we fine-tune a public pre-trained LM on private text without\nupdating word embeddings, it can effectively defend the attack with minimal\ndata utility loss. Together, we hope that our results can encourage the\ncommunity to rethink the privacy concerns of LM training and its standard\npractices in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 17:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

To solve the challenge of powering and\ncommunication in a brain implant with low end-end channel loss, we present\nBi-Phasic Quasistatic Brain Communication (BP-QBC), achieving < 60dB worst-case\nend-to-end channel loss at a channel length of 55mm, by avoiding the\ntransduction losses during field-modality conversion.

In this context, the recent discovery of coexisting\nsuperconductivity and ferroelectricity in lightly doped and ultra clean\nSrTiO$_3$ opens new opportunities. Indeed, a promising route to engineer\ntopological superconductivity is the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling\nand inversion-symmetry breaking.

These cones manifest themselves as Majorana arcs states\nappearing on surfaces and tetragonal domain walls. Rotating the magnetic field\nwith respect to the direction of the ferroelectric moment tilts the\nMajorana-Weyl cones, eventually driving them into the type-II state with\nBogoliubov Fermi surfaces.

We\nexplore the possibility that the GeV excess is inverse Compton emission due to\nthe interaction of a long-lived, low-power jet with an external source of\nphotons.

Manual\ncompliance checking is tedious and error-prone, and amending flaws discovered\nonly at construction time causes huge additional costs and delays. Several\ntools can check BIM models for conformance with rules/guidelines. For example,\nSingapore's CORENET e-Submission System checks fire safety. But since the\ncurrent BIM exchange format only contains basic information of building\nobjects, a separate, ad-hoc model pre-processing is required to determine,\ne.g., evacuation routes.

Federated learning (FL) is a\npromising solution that enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning among\ndifferent institutions, but it generally suffers from performance deterioration\ndue to heterogeneous data distributions and a lack of quality labeled data. In\nthis paper, we present a robust and label-efficient self-supervised FL\nframework for medical image analysis. Our method introduces a novel\nTransformer-based self-supervised pre-training paradigm that pre-trains models\ndirectly on decentralized target task datasets using masked image modeling, to\nfacilitate more robust representation learning on heterogeneous data and\neffective knowledge transfer to downstream models. Extensive empirical results\non simulated and real-world medical imaging non-IID federated datasets show\nthat masked image modeling with Transformers significantly improves the\nrobustness of models against various degrees of data heterogeneity.

Based on the\nasymptotic distributions for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson\nsubsampling, we derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the\nvariance functions of the subsampling estimators. These subsampling\nprobabilities further reveal the similarities and differences between\nsubsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. The theoretical\ncharacterizations and comparisons on the two subsampling procedures provide\nguidance to select a more appropriate subsampling approach in practice.\nFurthermore, practically implementable algorithms are proposed based on the\noptimal structural results, which are evaluated through both theoretical and\nempirical analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

In particular,\nDL has a notorious problem of lacking robustness. Despite recent efforts made\nin detecting Adversarial Examples (AEs) via state-of-the-art attacking and\ntesting methods, they are normally input distribution agnostic and/or disregard\nthe perception quality of AEs. Consequently, the detected AEs are irrelevant\ninputs in the application context or unnatural/unrealistic that can be easily\nnoticed by humans. This may lead to a limited effect on improving the DL\nmodel's dependability, as the testing budget is likely to be wasted on\ndetecting AEs that are encountered very rarely in its real-life operations. In\nthis paper, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that\nconsiders both the input distribution and the perceptual quality of inputs. The\ntwo considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, at the\nfeature level, the input data distribution is extracted and approximated by\ndata compression techniques and probability density estimators. Such quantified\nfeature level distribution, together with indicators that are highly correlated\nwith local robustness, are considered in selecting test seeds. Given a test\nseed, we then develop a two-step genetic algorithm for local test case\ngeneration at the pixel level, in which two fitness functions work\nalternatively to control the quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive\nexperiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical\ndistributions at feature and pixel levels is superior to state-of-the-arts that\neither disregard any input distribution or only consider a single\n(non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only the quality of detected\nAEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

Thus, there is a need for\naccurate, low-cost, and easy-to-use biomarkers that could be used to detect AD\nin its early stages. Potentially, electroencephalogram (EEG) based biomarkers\ncan play a vital role in early diagnosis of AD as they can fulfill these needs.\nThis is a cross-sectional study that aims to demonstrate the usefulness of EEG\ncomplexity measures in early AD diagnosis.

Since\na Bayesian network can be encoded as a literal-weighted CNF formula $\\varphi$,\nwe study Boolean MPE, a more general problem that requests a model $\\tau$ of\n$\\varphi$ with the highest weight, where the weight of $\\tau$ is the product of\nweights of literals satisfied by $\\tau$. It is known that Boolean MPE can be\nsolved via reduction to (weighted partial) MaxSAT. Recent work proposed DPMC, a\ndynamic-programming model counter that leverages graph-decomposition techniques\nto construct project-join trees. A project-join tree is an execution plan that\nspecifies how to conjoin clauses and project out variables. We build on DPMC\nand introduce DPO, a dynamic-programming optimizer that exactly solves Boolean\nMPE. By using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to represent pseudo-Boolean\n(PB) functions, DPO is able to handle disjunctive clauses as well as XOR\nclauses. (Cardinality constraints and PB constraints may also be compactly\nrepresented by ADDs, so one can further extend DPO's support for hybrid\ninputs.)

As such, there is much interest in\nestablishing when the algorithm may possess a \"linear\" $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\ndimension-free iteration complexity comparable to projected gradient descent.\n  In this paper, we provide a general technique for establishing domain\nspecific and easy-to-estimate lower bounds for Frank-Wolfe and its variants\nusing the metric entropy of the domain. Most notably, we show that a\ndimension-free linear upper bound must fail not only in the worst case, but in\nthe \\emph{average case}: for a Gaussian or spherical random polytope in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\mathrm{poly}(d)$ vertices, Frank-Wolfe requires up to\n$\\tilde\\Omega(d)$ iterations to achieve a $O(1/d)$ error bound, with high\nprobability. We also establish this phenomenon for the nuclear norm ball.\n  The link with metric entropy also has interesting positive implications for\nconditional gradient algorithms in statistics, such as gradient boosting and\nmatching pursuit.

Thus, a localization via the\ngamma-ray emission seems to be the best chance to mitigate this problem. Here\nwe propose to equip some of the second generation Galileo satellites with\ndedicated GRB detectors. This saves costs for launches and satellites for a\ndedicated GRB network, the large orbital radius is beneficial for\ntriangulation, and perfect positional and timing accuracy come for free. We\npresent simulations of the triangulation accuracy, demonstrating that short\nGRBs as faint as GRB 170817A can be localized to 1 degree radius (1 sigma).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 21:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

To increase the plausibility of this\nassumption, a natural idea is to match treated and control units prior to a DiD\nanalysis. In this paper, we characterize the bias of matching prior to a DiD\nanalysis under a linear structural model. Our framework allows for both\nobserved and unobserved confounders that have time varying effects. Given this\nframework, we find that matching on baseline covariates reduces the bias\nassociated with these covariates, when compared to the original DiD estimator.\nWe further find that additionally matching on the pre-treatment outcomes has\nboth cost and benefit. First, it mitigates the bias associated with unobserved\nconfounders, since matching on pre-treatment outcomes partially balances these\nunobserved confounders. This reduction is proportional to the reliability of\nthe outcome, a measure of how coupled the outcomes are with these latent\ncovariates. On the other hand, we find that matching on the pre-treatment\noutcome undermines the second \"difference\" in a DiD estimate by forcing the\ntreated and control group's pre-treatment outcomes to be equal. This injects\nbias into the final estimate, analogous to the case when parallel trends holds.\nWe extend our bias results to multivariate confounders with multiple\npre-treatment periods and find similar results. Finally, we provide heuristic\nguidelines to practitioners on whether to match prior to their DiD analysis,\nalong with a method for roughly estimating the reduction in bias. We illustrate\nour guidelines by reanalyzing a recent empirical study that used matching prior\nto a DiD analysis to explore the impact of principal turnover on student\nachievement.

Typical artificial\nsystems are not equipped with comparable regulatory features. Here, we\nintroduce an artificial neural network that incorporates homeostatic features.\nIts own computing substrate is placed in a needful and vulnerable relation to\nthe very objects over which it computes. For example, artificial neurons\nperforming classification of MNIST digits or Fashion-MNIST articles of clothing\nmay receive excitatory or inhibitory effects, which alter their own learning\nrate as a direct result of perceiving and classifying the digits. In this\nscenario, accurate recognition is desirable to the agent itself because it\nguides decisions to regulate its vulnerable internal states and functionality.\nCounterintuitively, the addition of vulnerability to a learner does not\nnecessarily impair its performance. On the contrary, self-regulation in\nresponse to vulnerability confers benefits under certain conditions. We show\nthat homeostatic design confers increased adaptability under concept shift, in\nwhich the relationships between labels and data change over time, and that the\ngreatest advantages are obtained under the highest rates of shift. This\nnecessitates the rapid un-learning of past associations and the re-learning of\nnew ones. We also demonstrate the superior abilities of homeostatic learners in\nenvironments with dynamically changing rates of concept shift.

This article provides a\ncritical discussion on applying the Kutta condition in unsteady flows, and\nintroduces an improved method of doing so in unsteady thin-aerofoil theory.\nSpecifically, the shed wake at any discrete time step is represented by a\ncontinuous distribution of vorticity derived from the exact Wagner solution\nrather than by a point vortex or regularized vortex blob.

At the onset of reconnection, the electron temperature starts\nto increase and a strong parallel temperature anisotropy develops. This\nsuggests that in strong turbulence electron-scale coherent structures may play\na significant role for electron heating, as impulsive and localized phenomena\nsuch as magnetic reconnection may transfer energy from the electromagnetic\nfields to particles more efficiently than damping mechanisms related to\ninteractions with wave-like fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 00:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Here, we introduce the k-textures\nalgorithm which provides self-supervised segmentation of a 4-band image\n(RGB-NIR) for a $k$ number of classes. An example of its application on high\nresolution Planet satellite imagery is given. Our algorithm shows that discrete\nsearch is feasible using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gradient\ndescent. The model detects $k$ hard clustering classes represented in the model\nas $k$ discrete binary masks and their associated $k$ independently generated\ntextures, that combined are a simulation of the original image. The similarity\nloss is the mean squared error between the features of the original and the\nsimulated image, both extracted from the penultimate convolutional block of\nKeras 'imagenet' pretrained VGG-16 model and a custom feature extractor made\nwith Planet data. The main advances of the k-textures model are: first, the $k$\ndiscrete binary masks are obtained inside the model using gradient descent. The\nmodel allows for the generation of discrete binary masks using a novel method\nusing a hard sigmoid activation function. Second, it provides hard clustering\nclasses -- each pixels has only one class. Finally, in comparison to k-means,\nwhere each pixel is considered independently, here, contextual information is\nalso considered and each class is not associated only to similar values in the\ncolor channels but also to a texture. Our approach is designed to ease the\nproduction of training samples for satellite image segmentation and the\nk-textures architecture could be adapted to support different number of bands\nand for more complex tasks, such as object self-segmentation.

We propose a neural network-based\nSpatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) to\naddress the above challenges for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose\nan interactive dynamic graph convolution structure, which divides the sequences\nat intervals and synchronously captures the traffic data's spatial-temporal\ndependence through an interactive learning strategy. The interactive learning\nstrategy makes STIDGCN effective for long-term prediction. We also propose a\nnovel dynamic graph convolution module to capture the dynamically changing\ncorrelations in the traffic network, consisting of a graph generator and fusion\ngraph convolution. The dynamic graph convolution module can use the input\ntraffic data and pre-defined graph structure to generate a graph structure. It\nis then fused with the defined adaptive adjacency matrix to generate a dynamic\nadjacency matrix, which fills the pre-defined graph structure and simulates the\ngeneration of dynamic associations between nodes in the road network. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 01:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 00:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 08:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 13:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 08:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Such an approach is tailored to the intrinsic feature of the\nspace-based gravitational wave detection, namely, the distances between\nspacecraft are governed by the orbit dynamics and thus can not be held\nconstant. Among different implementations, the geometric TDI was introduced as\na method of exhaustion to evaluate the second-generation TDI combinations.

Passenger vehicles equipped\nwith a wide array of sensors (e.g., cameras, front-facing radars, LiDARs, and\nIMUs) capable of continuous perception of the environment are becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. These sensors provide a stream of high-dimensional,\ntemporally correlated data that is essential for reliable autonomous driving.\nAn autonomous driving system should effectively use the information collected\nfrom the various sensors in order to form an abstract description of the world\nand maintain situational awareness. Deep learning models, such as autoencoders,\ncan be used for that purpose, as they can learn compact latent representations\nfrom a stream of incoming data. However, most autoencoder models process the\ndata independently, without assuming any temporal interdependencies. Thus,\nthere is a need for deep learning models that explicitly consider the temporal\ndependence of the data in their architecture. This work proposes CARNet, a\nCombined dynAmic autoencodeR NETwork architecture that utilizes an autoencoder\ncombined with a recurrent neural network to learn the current latent\nrepresentation and, in addition, also predict future latent representations in\nthe context of autonomous driving.

However, when the\ndetector trajectory is generated by a combination of the linear accelerated\nmotion and a component of the four-velocity $w=dy/d\\tau$, we find quite unlike\nthe previous results that, for the non-relativistic case $(w\\ll1)$, the\nacceleration could degrade the quantum Fisher information, while the\nfour-velocity component will suppress the degradation of the quantum Fisher\ninformation, and thus could enhance the precision of parameters estimation.\nFurthermore, in the case for ultra-relativistic velocities\n$(w\\rightarrow\\infty)$, although the detector still interacts with the\nenvironment, it behaves as if it were a closed system as a consequence of\nrelativity correction associated to the velocity, and the quantum Fisher\ninformation in this case can be shield from the effect of the external\nenvironment, and thus from the relativistic motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 05:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

We study both fast and slowly\nrotating black holes and address our simulations to active galaxy (AGN) centers\nand gamma ray burst (GRB) engines. The structured jets are postulated to\naccount for emission properties of high energy sources across the mass scale,\nlaunched from stellar mass black holes in GRBs and from supermassive black\nholes in AGNs. Their active cores contain magnetized accretion disks and\nrotation of the Kerr black hole provides a mechanism for jet launching. This\nprocess works most effectively if the mode of accretion is magnetically\narrested (MAD). In this mode, the modulation of jets launched from the engine\nis related to internal instabilities in the accretion flow that operate on\nsmallest time and spatial scales. As these scales are related to the\nlight-crossing time and the black hole gravitational radius, the universal\nmodel of jet-disk connection is expected to scale with the black hole mass. We\ninvestigate the jet-disk connection by means of 3D GR MHD simulations of the\nMAD accretion in Kerr metric. We quantify the variability of the disk by means\nof a Fourier analysis. We found that the evolution is governed by the physical\nparameters of the engine such as the black hole spin and disk size as well as\nits magnetization, and we applied our scenarios to typical types of sources in\nAGN and GRB classes.

It can also be applied to GRBs,\nas it gives the variability pattern roughly consistent with observations.\nHowever, in some cases, strong magnetic fields may lead to jet quenching, and\nthis effect is found to be important mainly for GRB jets.

Many prior\nexperimental and numerical studies show that this phenomenon results in a\nchaotic flow field inside a microdevice, thereby facilitating the mixing of two\nfluids if they are Newtonian in behaviour. However, the present numerical study\nshows that this chaotic convection arising due to the electrokinetic\ninstability can be suppressed if the fluids are viscoelastic instead of\nNewtonian ones. In particular, we observe that as the Weissenberg number (ratio\nof the elastic to that of the viscous forces) gradually increases and the\npolymer viscosity ratio (ratio of the solvent viscosity to that of the\nzero-shear rate viscosity of the polymeric solution) gradually decreases, the\nchaotic fluctuation inside a T microfluidic junction decreases within the\npresent range of conditions encompassed in this study. We demonstrate that this\nsuppression of the chaotic motion occurs due to the formation of a strand of\nhigh elastic stresses at the interface of the two fluids. We further show that\nthis suppression of the chaotic fluctuation (particularly the span-wise one)\ninhibits the mixing of two viscoelastic fluids. Therefore, one needs to be\ncautious when the EKI phenomenon is planned to use to mix such viscoelastic\nfluids. Our observations are in line with that seen in limited experimental\nstudies conducted for these kinds of viscoelastic fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 06:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

To envisage a chip-size\nfree-electron laser as a powerful research tool, we study in this paper\nachievable laser radiation from a single electron and an array of single\nelectrons atop a nano-grating dielectric waveguide. In our study, thanks to the\nstrong coupling between the electron and the guided wave in a structure with\ndistributed feedback, a single 50-keV electron generates 1.5-um laser-like\nradiation at the Bragg resonance of a 31-um long silicon grating with a 400-nm\nthickness and 310-nm period.

The thermal\nbehavior of the heat sink is originally estimated using a high-fidelity\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, which renders numerical\noptimization too computationally demanding. To enable optimization studies, we\nsubstitute the CFD simulation model with an inexpensive polynomial surrogate\nmodel that approximates the relation between the device's design features and a\nrelevant thermal quantity of interest. The surrogate model of choice is a\ndata-driven polynomial chaos expansion (DD-PCE), which learns the\naforementioned relation by means of polynomial regression. Advantages of the\nDD-PCE include its applicability in small-data regimes and its easily adaptable\nmodel structure. To address the issue of model-form uncertainty and model\nrobustness in view of limited training and test data, ensembles of DD-PCEs are\ngenerated based on data re-shuffling. Then, using the full ensemble of\nsurrogate models, the surrogate-based predictions are accompanied by\nuncertainty metrics such as mean value and variance. Once trained and tested in\nterms of accuracy and robustness, the ensemble of DD-PCE surrogates replaces\nthe high-fidelity simulation model in optimization algorithms aiming to\nidentify heat sink designs that optimize the thermal behavior of the IGBT under\ngeometrical and operational constraints. Optimized heat sink designs are\nobtained for a computational cost much smaller than utilizing the original\nmodel in the optimization procedure. Due to ensemble modeling, the optimization\nresults can also be assessed in terms of uncertainty and robustness.\nComparisons against alternative surrogate modeling techniques illustrate why\nthe DD-PCE should be preferred in the considered setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 06:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 08:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

In this study, ray tracing simulations were carried out in a\nthree-dimensional flow, which is from a direct numerical simulation of\nsingle-phase turbulent mixing of two fluids. Given the data of the numerical\nsimulation as reference, the ray tracing simulation is used to quantify the\nmeasurement errors of the flow velocity and flow acceleration for tracer-based\nvelocimetry, i.e. particle tracking velocimetry in this study. The errors of\nboth flow velocity and flow acceleration are attributed to the spatial and the\nspatio-temporal gradients of the refractive indices, respectively, which are\nclosely inherited from flow characteristics.

We propose a new way of\nthinking about dynamic tactile sensing: by building a light-weighted\ndata-driven model based on the simplified physical principle. The liquid in a\nbottle will oscillate after a perturbation. We propose a simple\nphysics-inspired model to explain this oscillation and use a high-resolution\ntactile sensor GelSight to sense it.

The model can estimate\nvolume with high precision and even estimate the concentration of sugar-water\nsolution. It is data-efficient and can easily generalize to other liquids and\nbottles.

In this study, we propose a method that reduces FRR and\nenhances authentication accuracy; it generates new ear canal acoustic\ncharacteristics called between-class (BC) features, which combine the ear canal\nacoustic characteristics of authorized and unauthorized users features. The\nproposed method uses a support vector machine to learn the BC features as the\ndata of authorized users, then generates a hyperplane in an area close to that\ndata. We hypothesize that this would decrease the possibility of misidentifying\nan unauthorized user as an authorized user and decrease the FRR when the FAR is\n0.1%. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, BC features were\napplied to ear acoustic authentication, and FAR and FRR were calculated. The\nFRR with FAR = 0.1% was 7.95% lower than with the previous method, and the\nequal error rate -- the error rate when FAR and FRR are equivalent -- decreased\nby 0.15%. These results confirmed that the proposed method can make ear\nacoustic authentication more convenient while maintaining a high level of\nsecurity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 08:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

Previous\nstudies showed that in binary systems the majority of the accreted mass falls\nonto the lighter star, thus evolving to mass equalisation. However, young\nstellar systems often comprise more than two stars, which are expected to be in\nhierarchical configurations. Despite its astrophysical relevance, differential\naccretion in hierarchical systems remains to be understood. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether the accretion trends expected in binaries are valid for\nhigher order multiples. We performed a set of 3D Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics simulations of binaries and of hierarchical triples (HTs)\nembedded in an accretion disc, with the code Phantom. We identify for the first\ntime accretion trends in HTs and their deviations compared to binaries. These\ndeviations, due to the interaction of the small binary with the infalling\nmaterial from the circum-triple disc, can be described with a semi-analytical\nprescription. Generally, the smaller binary of a HT accretes more mass than a\nsingle star of the same mass as the smaller binary. We found that in a HT, if\nthe small binary is heavier than the third body, the standard differential\naccretion scenario (whereby the secondary accretes more of the mass) is\nhampered. Reciprocally, if the small binary is lighter than the third body, the\nstandard differential accretion scenario is enhanced. The peculiar differential\naccretion mechanism we find in HTs is expected to affect their mass ratio\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 08:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

Often,\nhowever, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable\ndue to privacy concerns. A promising solution is `surrogate networks',\nsynthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks. Until now, the\ngeneration of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open\nproblem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological\nproperties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable\nmodel. Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate\ntemporal networks. By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods\nsurrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as\nbuilding blocks. Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple\nexamples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical\nsimilarity.

Given a trained machine learning model, PIAs aim to extract statistical\nproperties of its underlying training data, e.g., reveal the ratio of men and\nwomen in a medical training data set. While for other privacy attacks like\nmembership inference, a lot of research on defense mechanisms has been\npublished, this is the first work focusing on defending against PIAs. With the\nprimary goal of developing a generic mitigation strategy against white-box\nPIAs, we propose the novel approach property unlearning. Extensive experiments\nwith property unlearning show that while it is very effective when defending\ntarget models against specific adversaries, property unlearning is not able to\ngeneralize, i.e., protect against a whole class of PIAs. To investigate the\nreasons behind this limitation, we present the results of experiments with the\nexplainable AI tool LIME.

In this work we propose world value functions (WVFs),\nwhich are a type of general value function with mastery of the world - they\nrepresent not only how to solve a given task, but also how to solve any other\ngoal-reaching task. To achieve this, we equip the agent with an internal goal\nspace defined as all the world states where it experiences a terminal\ntransition - a task outcome. The agent can then modify task rewards to define\nits own reward function, which provably drives it to learn how to achieve all\nachievable internal goals, and the value of doing so in the current task. We\ndemonstrate a number of benefits of WVFs. When the agent's internal goal space\nis the entire state space, we demonstrate that the transition function can be\ninferred from the learned WVF, which allows the agent to plan using learned\nvalue functions. Additionally, we show that for tasks in the same world, a\npretrained agent that has learned any WVF can then infer the policy and value\nfunction for any new task directly from its rewards. Finally, an important\nproperty for long-lived agents is the ability to reuse existing knowledge to\nsolve new tasks. Using WVFs as the knowledge representation for learned tasks,\nwe show that an agent is able to solve their logical combination zero-shot,\nresulting in a combinatorially increasing number of skills throughout their\nlifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 09:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

QAnon is considered to have had an influential\nrole in the public discourse during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\nHowever, little is known about QAnon supporters on Parler and what sets them\naside from other users. Building up on social identity theory, we aim at\nprofiling the characteristics of QAnon supporters on Parler. We analyze a\nlarge-scale dataset with more than 600,000 profiles of English-speaking users\non Parler. Based on users' profiles, posts, and comments, we then extract a\ncomprehensive set of user features, linguistic features, network features, and\ncontent features. This allows us to perform user profiling and understand to\nwhat extent these features discriminate between QAnon and non-QAnon supporters\non Parler. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We quantify the number of QAnon\nsupporters on Parler, finding that 34,913 users (5.5% of all users) openly\nreport to support the conspiracy. (2) We examine differences between QAnon vs.\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that QAnon supporters differ statistically\nsignificantly from non-QAnon supporters across multiple dimensions. For\nexample, they have, on average, a larger number of followers, followees, and\nposts, and thus have a large impact on the Parler network. (3) We use machine\nlearning to identify which user characteristics discriminate QAnon from\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that user features, linguistic features, network\nfeatures, and content features, can - to a large extent - discriminate QAnon\nvs. non-QAnon supporters on Parler.

However, the captured HSIs may not represent true\ndistribution of ground objects and the received reflectance at imaging\ninstruments may be degraded, owing to environmental disturbances, atmospheric\neffects and sensors' hardware limitations. These degradations include but are\nnot limited to: complex noise (i.e., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, sparse\nstripes, and their mixtures), heavy stripes, deadlines, cloud and shadow\nocclusion, blurring and spatial-resolution degradation and spectral absorption,\netc. These degradations dramatically reduce the quality and usefulness of HSIs.\nLow-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) is such an emerging technique, having\ngained much attention in HSI restoration community, with ever-growing\ntheoretical foundation and pivotal technological innovation.

Wang\net al (2021) obtained radial velocity measurements of the two stars and\nanalysed these plus the Kepler data to study their spot activity and measure\ntheir physical properties, but left several questions unanswered. We have\nperformed an independent analysis and determined the masses (1.252 +/- 0.018\nand 1.065 +/- 0.013 Msun) and radii (1.449 +/- 0.012 and 1.048 +/- 0.017 Rsun)\nof the stars to high precision.

We also investigated\nthe precision of the numerical integration applied to the model light curve to\nmatch the 1765-s sampling cadence of the Kepler observations. We found that\nignoring this temporal smearing leads to biased radius measurements for the\nstars: that for the primary is too small by 4 sigma and that for the secondary\nis too large by 10 sigma. Doubling the sampling rate of the model light curve\nis sufficient to remove most of this bias, but for precise results a minimum of\nfive samples per observed datapoint is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 10:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

We discover two frequencies in the system, at 2.99 d$^{-1}$\nand 4.00 d$^{-1}$ which are probably due to beta Cephei or slowly-pulsating\nB-star pulsations. A large number of additional significant frequencies exist\nat multiples of the orbital frequency, 0.4572 d$^{-1}$.

This paper describes the implementation of the heat conduction\ninto the code MANCHA3D with an aim of extending single-fluid MHD simulations\nfrom the upper convection zone into the solar corona. Two different schemes to\nmodel heat conduction are implemented: (1) a standard scheme where a parabolic\nterm is added to the energy equation, and (2) a scheme where the hyperbolic\nheat flux equation is solved. The first scheme limits the time step due to the\nexplicit integration of a parabolic term, which makes the simulations\ncomputationally expensive. The second scheme solves the limitations on the time\nstep by artificially limiting the heat conduction speed to computationally\nmanageable values. The validation of both schemes is carried out with standard\ntests in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we implement the\nmodel for heat flux derived by Braginskii (1965) in its most general form, when\nthe expression for the heat flux depends on the ratio of the collisional to\ncyclotron frequencies of the plasma, and, therefore on the magnetic field\nstrength. Additionally, our implementation takes into account the heat\nconduction in parallel, perpendicular, and transverse directions, and provides\nthe contributions from ions and electrons separately. The model also\ntransitions smoothly between field-aligned conductivity and isotropic\nconductivity for regions with a low or null magnetic field. Finally, we present\na two-dimensional test for heat conduction using realistic values of the solar\natmosphere where we prove the robustness of the two schemes implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 10:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 15:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 05:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

We extend our results to account for\nuncertainty in the first two moments and provide applications to portfolio\noptimisation and to model risk assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 10:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 20:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 19:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

However, the central model is\nvulnerable via a single point of failure, and in the local model, the utility\nof the data deteriorates significantly. The recently proposed shuffle model is\nan intermediate framework between the central and the local paradigms where the\nusers send their locally privatized data to a server where messages are\nshuffled, effacing the link between a privatized message and the corresponding\nuser, giving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than the local\nmodel, as its privacy gets amplified without adding more noise. In this paper,\nwe theoretically derive the strictest known bound for DP guarantee for the\nshuffle models with $k$-Randomized Response local randomizers. There on, we\nfocus on the utility of the shuffle model for histogram queries. Leveraging on\nthe matrix inversion method, which is used to approximate the original\ndistribution from the empirical one produced by the $k$-RR mechanism, we\nde-noise the histogram produced by the shuffle model to evaluate the total\nvariation distance of the resulting histogram from the true one, which we\nregard as the measure of utility of the privacy mechanism. We perform\nexperiments on both synthetic and real data to compare the privacy-utility\ntrade-off of the shuffle model with that of the central one privatized by\nadding the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise to each bin. Although the\nexperimental results stay consistent with the literature that favour the\ncentral model, we see that, the difference in statistical utilities between the\ncentral and the shuffle models is very small, showing that they are almost\ncomparable under the same level of DP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 10:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

As a subset of weakly supervised\nlearning, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been proven to be effective in\nsegmentation.

Spatial data is of particular interest, and its\nsensitive nature often leads to privacy concerns. We introduce GeoPointGAN, a\nnovel GAN-based solution for generating synthetic spatial point datasets with\nhigh utility and strong individual level privacy guarantees. GeoPointGAN's\narchitecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to\nproject randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic\nco-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and\nmacroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy\nguarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical\nthan traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level\nof privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level\nand implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels\nassociated with the 'real' and 'fake' points used in training. Extensive\nexperiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions,\nimproving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also\nevaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which\nconfirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving\nquerying.

However, for a multiuser\nWET system, simultaneous multi-beam energy transmission is generally required\nto achieve the maximum performance, which may not be implemented by using the\nIRS having only a single set of coefficients. As a result, it remains unknowns\nhow to exploit the IRS to approach such a performance upper bound. To answer\nthis question, we aim to maximize the total harvested energy of a multiuser WET\nsystem subject to the user fairness constraints and the non-linear energy\nharvesting model. We first consider the static IRS beamforming scheme, which\nshows that the optimal IRS reflection matrix obtained by applying semidefinite\nrelaxation is indeed of high rank in general as the number of energy receivers\n(ERs) increases, due to which the resulting rank-one solution by applying\nGaussian Randomization may lead to significant loss. To achieve the multi-beam\ngain, we then propose a general time-division based novel framework by\nexploiting the IRS's dynamic passive beamforming. Moreover, it is able to\nachieve a good balance between the system performance and complexity by\ncontrolling the number of IRS shift patterns. Finally, we also propose a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) based passive beamforming design for\nperformance comparison. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of\nmulti-beam transmission and the superiority of the proposed dynamic IRS\nbeamforming scheme over existing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 12:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

Despite the recent advances in computer graphics and\nphotogrammetry technology, generating novel views is still challenging\nparticularly for remote sensing images due to its high complexity, view\nsparsity and limited view-perspective variations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel remote sensing view synthesis method by leveraging the recent advances in\nimplicit neural representations. Considering the overhead and far depth imaging\nof remote sensing images, we represent the 3D space by combining implicit\nmultiplane images (MPI) representation and deep neural networks. The 3D scene\nis reconstructed under a self-supervised optimization paradigm through a\ndifferentiable multiplane renderer with multi-view input constraints. Images\nfrom any novel views thus can be freely rendered on the basis of the\nreconstructed model. As a by-product, the depth maps corresponding to the given\nviewpoint can be generated along with the rendering output. We refer to our\nmethod as Implicit Multiplane Images (ImMPI). To further improve the view\nsynthesis under sparse-view inputs, we explore the learning-based\ninitialization of remote sensing 3D scenes and proposed a neural network based\nPrior extractor to accelerate the optimization process. In addition, we propose\na new dataset for remote sensing novel view synthesis with multi-view\nreal-world google earth images.

Based on this mechanism, we derive convergence results\nfor markets with myopic, risk-averse traders who repeatedly interact with the\nmarket maker.

We show that the\nlimiting price converges to the geometric mean of agents' beliefs for\nexponential utility-based markets. For risk measure-based markets, we construct\na risk measure family that meets the convergence requirements and show that the\nlimiting price can converge to a weighted power mean of agent beliefs. For\nmarkets based on hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utilities, we show\nthat the limiting price is also a risk-adjusted weighted power mean of agent\nbeliefs, even though the trading order will affect the aggregation weights. We\nfurther propose an approximation scheme for the limiting price under the HARA\nutility family.

In this paper we define Open ML and\ncontrast it with some of the grand narratives of ML of two forms: 1) Closed ML,\nML which emphasizes learning with minimal human input (e.g. Google's AlphaZero)\nand 2) Partially Open ML, ML which is used to parameterize existing models. To\nachieve this, we use theories of critical complexity to both evaluate these\ngrand narratives and contrast them with the Open ML approach.

The basic idea of\nthe probabilistic approach is to consider the joint probability density or\ngeneralized propagator for particle position and the so-called boundary local\ntime. The latter characterizes the amount of time that a Brownian particle\nspends in the neighborhood of a totally reflecting boundary; the effects of\nsurface reactions are then incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition\nfor the local time. The propagator is determined by solving a Robin boundary\nvalue problem, in which the constant rate of reactivity is identified as the\nLaplace variable $z$ conjugate to the local time, and then inverting the\nsolution with respect to $z$. Here we reinterpret the propagator as a particle\nconcentration in which surface absorption is counterbalanced by particle source\nterms.

Based on properties\nof Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs), we reformulate the 3D source\nlocalization problem as the minimization of a cost function of a single\nvariable, namely the distance between the source and the reference microphone.\nUsing the known microphone geometry and estimated time-differences of arrival\n(TDOAs) between the microphones, we show how the 3D source position can be\ncomputed based on this variable. In addition, instead of using a single TDOA\nestimate per microphone pair, we propose an extension that enables to select\nthe most appropriate estimate from a set of candidate TDOA estimates, which is\nespecially relevant in reverberant environments with strong early reflections.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone constellations show\nthat the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the\nsteered-response power method, especially when the source is close to the\nmicrophones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 14:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

In order to\nsolve the inference problem, the data should satisfy certain conditions that\ndepend also upon the particular questions addressed in a research. Here we\nfocus on the characterization of systems in terms of a distance from\nequilibrium, typically the entropy production (time-reversal asymmetry) or the\nviolation of the Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show how general,\ncounter-intuitive and negative for inference, is the problem of the\nimpossibility to estimate the distance from equilibrium using a series of\nscalar data which have a Gaussian statistics. This impossibility occurs also\nwhen the data are correlated in time, and that is the most interesting case\nbecause it usually stems from a multi-dimensional linear Markovian system where\nthere are many time-scales associated to different variables and, possibly,\nthermal baths. Observing a single variable (or a linear combination of\nvariables) results in a one-dimensional process which is always\nindistinguishable from an equilibrium one (unless a perturbation-response\nexperiment is available). In a setting where only data analysis (and not new\nexperiments) is allowed, we propose - as a way out - the combined use of\ndifferent series of data acquired with different parameters. This strategy\nworks when there is a sufficient knowledge of the connection between\nexperimental parameters and model parameters. We also briefly discuss how such\nresults emerge, similarly, in the context of Markov chains within certain\ncoarse-graining schemes. Our conclusion is that the distance from equilibrium\nis related to quite a fine knowledge of the full phase space, and therefore\ntypically hard to approximate in real experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 14:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

However, the above\nmethods have a rather obvious problem, that is, the features directly input are\ntreated as independent individuals, and in fact there are internal correlations\nbetween features and features, and even different features have different\nimportance in the recommendation. In this regard, this paper adopts a\nself-attentive mechanism to mine the internal correlations between features as\nwell as their relative importance. In recent years, as a special form of\nattention mechanism, self-attention mechanism is favored by many researchers.\nThe self-attentive mechanism captures the internal correlation of data or\nfeatures by learning itself, thus reducing the dependence on external sources.\nTherefore, this paper adopts a multi-headed self-attentive mechanism to mine\nthe internal correlations between features and thus learn the internal\nrepresentation of features.

In\nthis paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing that alternative\nnon-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for positional encoding.\nMoreover, we show that their performance is entirely determined by a trade-off\nbetween the stable rank of the embedded matrix and the distance preservation\nbetween embedded coordinates. We further establish that the now ubiquitous\nFourier feature mapping of position is a special case that fulfills these\nconditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory to analyze\npositional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. In addition, we argue\nthat employing a more complex positional encoding -- that scales exponentially\nwith the number of modes -- requires only a linear (rather than deep)\ncoordinate function to achieve comparable performance.

Current and\nsoon-upcoming experiments will infer a matter map -- at least in part -- from\nthe temperature anisotropies of the CMB. These reconstructions are contaminated\nby extragalactic foregrounds: radio-emitting galaxies, the cosmic infrared\nbackground, or the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effects. Using the Websky simulations,\nwe show that the foregrounds add spurious power to the angular auto-spectrum of\ndelensed $B$-modes via non-Gaussian higher-point functions, biasing constraints\non the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We consider an idealized experiment similar\nto the Simons Observatory, with no Galactic or atmospheric foregrounds. After\nremoving point sources detectable at 143 GHz and reconstructing lensing from\nCMB temperature modes $l<3500$ using a Hu-Okamoto quadratic estimator (QE), we\ninfer a value of $r$ that is $1.5\\,\\sigma$ higher than the true $r=0$.\nReconstructing instead from a minimum-variance ILC map only exacerbates the\nproblem, bringing the bias above $3\\,\\sigma$. When the $TT$ estimator is\nco-added with other QEs or with external matter tracers, new couplings ensue\nwhich partially cancel the diluted bias from $TT$. We provide a simple and\neffective prescription to model these effects. In addition, we demonstrate that\nthe point-source-hardened or shear-only QEs can not only mitigate the biases to\nacceptable levels, but also lead to lower power than the Hu-Okamoto QE after\ndelensing. Thus, temperature-based reconstructions remain powerful tools in the\nquest to measure $r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 15:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 02:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

We seek the mechanism that maximizes revenue over the\nworst-case distribution compatible with the known parameters. Such a mechanism\narises as an equilibrium of a zero-sum game between the seller and an adversary\nwho chooses the distribution, and so can be referred to as the max-min\nmechanism.\n  Carrasco et al.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel\nmobility, communication and computation aware online FL platform that uses\non-road vehicles as learning agents. Thanks to the advanced features of modern\nvehicles, the on-board sensors can collect data as vehicles travel along their\ntrajectories, while the on-board processors can train machine learning models\nusing the collected data. To take the high mobility of vehicles into account,\nwe consider the delay as a learning parameter and restrict it to be less than a\ntolerable threshold. To satisfy this threshold, the central server accepts\npartially trained models, the distributed roadside units (a) perform downlink\nmulticast beamforming to minimize global model distribution delay and (b)\nallocate optimal uplink radio resources to minimize local model offloading\ndelay, and the vehicle agents conduct heterogeneous local model training. Using\nreal-world vehicle trace datasets, we validate our FL solutions. Simulation\nshows that the proposed integrated FL platform is robust and outperforms\nbaseline models. With reasonable local training episodes, it can effectively\nsatisfy all constraints and deliver near ground truth multi-horizon velocity\nand vehicle-specific power predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

We then undergo an ablation\nstudy to investigate the importance of chosen features, finding that text\nsentiment and follower counts, and to a lesser extent mentions and following\ncounts, are the strongest features for the model, and that hashtag counts are\ndetrimental to the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 21:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}
