The PA-PIR-SI problem includes one or more remote servers storing\ncopies of a dataset of $K$ messages, and a user who knows $M$ out of $K$\nmessages -- the identities of which are unknown to the server -- as a prior\nside information, and wishes to retrieve one of the remaining $K-M$ messages.\nThe goal of the user is to minimize the amount of information they must\ndownload from the server while revealing no information about the identity of\nthe desired message. In contrast to PIR-SI, in PA-PIR-SI, the dataset messages\nare not assumed to be equally popular. That is, given the $M$ side information\nmessages, each of the remaining $K-M$ messages is not necessarily equally\nlikely to be the message desired by the user. In this work, we focus on the\nsingle-server setting of PA-PIR-SI, and establish lower and upper bounds on the\ncapacity of this setting -- defined as the maximum possible achievable download\nrate. Our upper bound holds for any message popularity profile, and is the same\nas the capacity of single-server PIR-SI. We prove the lower bound by presenting\na PA-PIR-SI scheme which takes a novel probabilistic approach -- carefully\ndesigned based on the popularity profile -- to integrate two existing PIR-SI\nschemes. The rate of our scheme is strictly higher than that of the only\nexisting PIR-SI scheme applicable to the PA-PIR-SI setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 16:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 11:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

This is achieved by mapping successive\nviews of an object onto close-by internal representations. When considering\nthis learning approach as a model of the development of human object\nrecognition, it is important to consider what visual input a toddler would\ntypically observe while interacting with objects. First, human vision is highly\nfoveated, with high resolution only available in the central region of the\nfield of view. Second, objects may be seen against a blurry background due to\ninfants' limited depth of field. Third, during object manipulation a toddler\nmostly observes close objects filling a large part of the field of view due to\ntheir rather short arms. Here, we study how these effects impact the quality of\nvisual representations learnt through time-contrastive learning. To this end,\nwe let a visually embodied agent \"play\" with objects in different locations of\na near photo-realistic flat. During each play session the agent views an object\nin multiple orientations before turning its body to view another object. The\nresulting sequence of views feeds a time-contrastive learning algorithm. Our\nresults show that visual statistics mimicking those of a toddler improve object\nrecognition accuracy in both familiar and novel environments. We argue that\nthis effect is caused by the reduction of features extracted in the background,\na neural network bias for large features in the image and a greater similarity\nbetween novel and familiar background regions. We conclude that the embodied\nnature of visual learning may be crucial for understanding the development of\nhuman object perception.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 16:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

To tackle\nthis problem, the conditions are supposed to meet two requirements, i.e.,\nmotion information preserving and geometric continuity. To this end, we propose\na novel representation based on a 3D geometric flow, termed facial flow, to\nrepresent the natural motion of the human face at any pose.

After that, in order to utilize the facial flow for face\nediting, we build a synthesis framework generating continuous images with\nconditional facial flows.

Since candidate\ngeneration is the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve\na high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common\napproach for candidate generation is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor\n(ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this\ncan yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often\nhave multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse\nset of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests.

SKYSURF's panchromatic dataset is designed to\nconstrain the discrete and diffuse UV to near-IR sky components: Zodiacal Light\n(ZL; inner Solar System), Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs; outer Solar System),\nDiffuse Galactic Light (DGL), and the discrete plus diffuse Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL). We outline SKYSURF's methods to: (1) measure sky-SB\nlevels between its detected objects; (2) measure the integrated discrete EBL,\nmost of which comes from AB$\\simeq$17-22 mag galaxies; and (3) estimate how\nmuch diffuse light may exist in addition to the extrapolated discrete galaxy\ncounts. Simulations of HST WFC3/IR images with known sky-values and gradients,\nrealistic cosmic ray (CR) distributions, and star plus galaxy counts were\nprocessed with nine different algorithms to measure the \"Lowest Estimated\nSky-SB\" (LES) in each image between the discrete objects. The best algorithms\nrecover the inserted LES values within 0.2% when there are no image gradients,\nand within 0.2-0.4% when there are 5-10% gradients. SKYSURF requires\nnon-standard re-processing of these HST images that includes restoring the\nlowest sky-level from each visit into each drizzled image.

This initiated\nthe research of non-contrastive self-supervised learning. It is mysterious why\neven when there exist trivial collapsed global optimal solutions, neural\nnetworks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent can still learn competitive\nrepresentations. This phenomenon is a typical example of implicit bias in deep\nlearning and remains little understood.\n  In this work, we present our empirical and theoretical discoveries on\nnon-contrastive self-supervised learning. Empirically, we find that when the\nprediction head is initialized as an identity matrix with only its off-diagonal\nentries being trainable, the network can learn competitive representations even\nthough the trivial optima still exist in the training objective. Theoretically,\nwe present a framework to understand the behavior of the trainable, but\nidentity-initialized prediction head. Under a simple setting, we characterized\nthe substitution effect and acceleration effect of the prediction head. The\nsubstitution effect happens when learning the stronger features in some neurons\ncan substitute for learning these features in other neurons through updating\nthe prediction head. And the acceleration effect happens when the substituted\nfeatures can accelerate the learning of other weaker features to prevent them\nfrom being ignored. These two effects enable the neural networks to learn all\nthe features rather than focus only on learning the stronger features, which is\nlikely the cause of the dimensional collapse phenomenon.

The pendulum system exhibits a wide range of\ninteresting behaviors, from simple harmonic motion in the single pendulum to\nchaotic dynamics in multi-arm pendulums. Under forcing, even the single\npendulum may exhibit chaos, providing a simple example of a damped-driven\nsystem. All multi-armed pendulums are characterized by the existence of\nindex-one saddle points, which mediate the transport of trajectories in the\nsystem, providing a simple mechanical analog of various complex transport\nphenomena, from biolocomotion to transport within the solar system. Further,\npendulum systems have long been used to design and test both linear and\nnonlinear control strategies, with the addition of more arms making the problem\nmore challenging. In this work, we provide extensive designs for the\nconstruction and operation of a high-performance, multi-link pendulum on a cart\nsystem. Although many experimental setups have been built to study the behavior\nof pendulum systems, such an extensive documentation on the design,\nconstruction, and operation is missing from the literature. The resulting\nexperimental system is highly flexible, enabling a wide range of benchmark\nproblems in dynamical systems modeling, system identification and learning, and\ncontrol. To promote reproducible research, we have made our entire system\nopen-source, including 3D CAD drawings, basic tutorial code, and data.\nMoreover, we discuss the possibility of extending our system capability to be\noperated remotely to enable researchers all around the world to use it, thus\nincreasing access.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 17:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

Given the multimodal nature of person ReID data (due to variations\nacross camera viewpoints and capture conditions), training a common CNN\nbackbone to address domain shifts across multiple target domains, can provide\nan efficient solution for real-time ReID applications.

Such systems are referred to as balanced\ndistributed databases. When existing nodes leave or new nodes are added to this\nsystem, the balanced nature of the database is lost, either due to the\nreduction in the replication factor, or the non-uniformity of the storage at\nthe nodes. This triggers a rebalancing algorithm, that exchanges data between\nthe nodes so that the balance of the database is reinstated. The goal is then\nto design rebalancing schemes with minimal communication load. In a recent work\nby Krishnan et al., coded transmissions were used to rebalance a carefully\ndesigned distributed database from a node removal or addition. These coded\nrebalancing schemes have optimal communication load, however, require the\nfile-size to be at least exponential in the system parameters. In this work, we\nconsider a cyclic balanced database (where data is cyclically placed in the\nsystem nodes) and present coded rebalancing schemes for node removal and\naddition in such a database. These databases (and the associated rebalancing\nschemes) require the file-size to be only cubic in the number of nodes in the\nsystem. We bound the advantage of our node removal rebalancing scheme over the\nuncoded scheme, and show that our scheme has a smaller communication load.

We first study a class of Anderson\nimpurity models with uniform fractal hybridization functions that the NRG can\nsolve to arbitrarily low temperatures. Below a Kondo scale $T_K$, these models\napproach a fractal strong-coupling fixed point where impurity thermodynamic\nproperties oscillate with $\\log_b T$ about negative average values determined\nby the fractal dimension of the spectrum. The fractal dimension also enters\ninto a power-law dependence of $T_K$ on the Kondo exchange coupling $J_K$.

The\naforementioned fractal strong-coupling fixed point is reached by the critical\nAAA model in a simplified treatment that neglects the wave-function\ncontribution to the hybridization. The temperature-averaged properties are\nthose expected for the numerically determined fractal dimension of $0.5$. At\nthe AA critical point, impurity thermodynamic properties become negative and\noscillatory. Under sample-averaging, the mean and median Kondo temperatures\nexhibit power-law dependences on $J_K$ with exponents characteristic of\ndifferent fractal dimensions. We attribute these signatures to the impurity\nprobing a distribution of fractal strong-coupling fixed points with decreasing\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 17:59:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

We find that, when the binary companion is neglected,\nwhite dwarfs with masses >= 0.8 Msol successfully launch\nradiation-pressure-driven optically thick winds that carry away most of the\nenvelope. However, for most of the mass loss phase, these winds are accelerated\nat radii beyond the white dwarf's Roche radius assuming a typical cataclysmic\nvariable donor. This means that, before a standard optically thick wind can be\nformed, mass loss will instead be initiated and shaped by the binary\ninteraction. An isotropic optically thick wind is only successfully launched\nwhen the acceleration region recedes within the white dwarf's Roche radius,\nwhich occurs after most of the envelope has already been ejected. The\ninteraction between these two modes of outflow -- a first phase of slow,\nbinary-driven, equatorially focused mass loss encompassing most of the mass\nejection and a second phase consisting of a fast, isotropic, optically thick\nwind -- is consistent with observations of aspherical ejecta and signatures of\nmultiple outflow components.

If atmospheric composition largely follows\nmetallicity scaling, the concentration of CO$_{2}$ in a H$_{2}$-dominated\natmosphere will be too low to distinguish CO$_{2}$ isotopologues with JWST. In\ncontrast, at higher metallicities, there will be more CO$_{2}$, but the smaller\natmospheric scale height makes the measurement impossible.

Traditionally, the resonator losses are only\nattributed to two-level system (TLS) defects using a power dependent model for\nthe quality factor. However, excess non-equilibrium quasiparticles can also\nlimit the quality factor of the planar superconducting resonators used in\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics. At millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles\ncan be generated by breaking Cooper pairs via a single high-energy or multiple\nsub-gap photons. Here a two-temperature, power and temperature dependent model\nis proposed to evaluate resonator losses for isolating TLS and quasiparticle\nloss simultaneously. The model combines the conventional TLS power and\ntemperature dependence with an effective temperature non-equilibrium\nquasiparticle description of the superconducting loss. The quasiparticle\ndescription is based on the quasiparticle number density calculated using rate\nequations for an external quasiparticle generation source, recombination, and\ntrapping. The number density is translated to an effective temperature using a\nthermal distribution that may be different from the bath. Experimental\nmeasurements of high-quality factor resonators fabricated from single crystal\naluminum and titanium nitride thin films on silicon are interpreted with the\npresented model. This approach enables identification of quasiparticle and TLS\nloss, resulting in the determination that the TiN resonator has comparable TLS\nand quasiparticle loss at low power and low-temperature, while the\nlow-temperature Al resonator behavior is dominated by non-equilibrium\nquasiparticle loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 18:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

This allows us to utilize Laplace Transforms to derive efficiently\ncomputable functions of average fidelity with respect to the load, buffer size,\nand decoherence rate of the memory platform. We prove that serving qubits in a\nLast In First Out order with pushout for buffer overflow management is optimal\nin terms of average fidelity. Lastly, we apply this framework to model a single\nrepeater node to calculate the average fidelity of the teleportation channels\ncreated by this repeater assuming perfect gate operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 18:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

However, parametrizing a renderer to synthesize realistic\nimages of a given product remains a challenging task that requires expert\nknowledge. While recent work has introduced neural rendering methods for\nvirtual try-on from example images, current approaches are based on large\ngenerative models that cannot be used in real-time on mobile devices. This\ncalls for a hybrid method that combines the advantages of computer graphics and\nneural rendering approaches.

SCR accounts for the\ninherent spatial autocorrelation in individual detections by modelling\ndetection probabilities as a function of distance between the detectors and\nindividual activity centres. However, additional spatial heterogeneity in\ndetection probability may still creep in due to environmental or sampling\ncharacteristics. if unaccounted for, such variation can lead to pronounced bias\nin population size estimates. Using simulations, we describe and test three\nBayesian SCR models that use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to account\nfor latent heterogeneity in baseline detection probability across detectors\nusing: independent random effects (RE), spatially autocorrelated random effects\n(SARE), and a two-group finite mixture model (FM). Overall, SARE provided the\nleast biased population size estimates (median RB: -9 -- 6%). When spatial\nautocorrelation was high, SARE also performed best at predicting the spatial\npattern of heterogeneity in detection probability. At intermediate levels of\nautocorrelation, spatially-explicit estimates of detection probability obtained\nwith FM where more accurate than those generated by SARE and RE. In cases where\nthe number of detections per detector is realistically low (at most 1), all\nGLMMs considered here may require dimension reduction of the random effects by\npooling baseline detection probability parameters across neighboring detectors\n(\"aggregation\") to avoid over-parameterization. The added complexity and\ncomputational overhead associated with SCR-GLMMs may only be justified in\nextreme cases of spatial heterogeneity.

NAS has outperformed hand-designed\nnetworks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the\ndesign of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human\nexpertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task,\nleaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked.\nGenerally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel\ntask. Either searching from scratch, which is ineffective by design, or\ntransferring discovered architectures from other tasks, which provides no\nperformance guarantees and is probably not optimal. In this work, we present a\nmeta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search\n(DARTS).

However, few of them consider\nsecurity as the priority for in-storage computing. Specifically, since modern\nSSD controllers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded\n(malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in\nthe SSD. In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be\nconducted by offloaded in-storage programs.

They facilitate\ninformation discovery by ranking retrieved items on predicted relevance, i.e.\nlikelihood of interaction (click, share) between users and items. Typically\nmodeled using past interactions, such rankings have a major drawback:\ninteraction depends on the attention items receive. A highly-relevant item\nplaced outside a user's attention could receive little interaction. This\ndiscrepancy between observed interaction and true relevance is termed the\nposition bias. Position bias degrades relevance estimation and when it\ncompounds over time, it can silo users into false relevant items, causing\nmarketplace inefficiencies. Position bias may be identified with randomized\nexperiments, but such an approach can be prohibitive in cost and feasibility.\nPast research has also suggested propensity score methods, which do not\nadequately address unobserved confounding; and regression discontinuity\ndesigns, which have poor external validity. In this work, we address these\nconcerns by leveraging the abundance of A/B tests in ranking evaluations as\ninstrumental variables. Historical A/B tests allow us to access exogenous\nvariation in rankings without manually introducing them, harming user\nexperience and platform revenue. We demonstrate our methodology in two distinct\napplications at LinkedIn - feed ads and the People-You-May-Know (PYMK)\nrecommender. The marketplaces comprise users and campaigns on the ads side, and\ninvite senders and recipients on PYMK.

Resolving microstructures with optimization\ntechniques is prone to estimation errors and requires dense sampling in the\nq-space. Deep learning based approaches have been proposed to overcome these\nlimitations. Motivated by the superior performance of the Transformer, in this\nwork, we present a learning-based framework based on Transformer, namely, a\nMicrostructure Estimation Transformer with Sparse Coding (METSC) for dMRI-based\nmicrostructure estimation with downsampled q-space data. To take advantage of\nthe Transformer while addressing its limitation in large training data\nrequirements, we explicitly introduce an inductive bias - model bias into the\nTransformer using a sparse coding technique to facilitate the training process.\nThus, the METSC is composed with three stages, an embedding stage, a sparse\nrepresentation stage, and a mapping stage. The embedding stage is a\nTransformer-based structure that encodes the signal to ensure the voxel is\nrepresented effectively. In the sparse representation stage, a dictionary is\nconstructed by solving a sparse reconstruction problem that unfolds the\nIterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) process. The mapping stage is essentially a\ndecoder that computes the microstructural parameters from the output of the\nsecond stage, based on the weighted sum of normalized dictionary coefficients\nwhere the weights are also learned. We tested our framework on two dMRI models\nwith downsampled q-space data, including the intravoxel incoherent motion\n(IVIM) model and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)\nmodel.

These\nevolutions are further compared with those determined during the past two SC.\nThe integrated radiance of the K-corona and the occurrence rate of CMEs closely\ntrack the indices/proxies of solar activity, prominently the total magnetic\nfield for the radiance and the radio flux for the CMEs, all undergoing a steep\nincrease during the ascending phase of SC 25. This increase is much steeper\nthan anticipated on the basis of the predicted quasi similarity between SC 25\nand 24, and is confirmed by the recent evolution of the sunspot number. The\nradiance reached the same base level during the minima of SC 24 and 25, but the\nlatitudinal extent of the streamer belt differed, being flatter during the\nlatter minimum and in fact more similar to that of the minimum of SC 23.\nPhasing the descending branches of SC 23 and 24 led to a duration of SC 24 of\n11.0 years, similar to that given by the sunspot number. In contrast, the base\nlevel of the occurrence rate of CMEs during the minimum of SC 25 was\nsignificantly larger than during the two previous minima. The southern\nhemisphere is conspicuously more active than the northern one in agreement with\nseveral predictions and the current evolution of the hemispheric sunspot\nnumbers. The mean apparent width of CMEs and the number of halo CMEs remains at\nrelatively large, constant levels throughout the early phase of SC 25 implying\nthe persistence of weak total pressure in the heliosphere. These results and\nthe perspective of a corona more active than anticipated are extremely\npromising for the forthcoming observations by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar\nProbe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 06:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Accordingly, it is both the price and the delivery time that\nmatter most to the ultimate customers of commercial enterprises. Consequently,\nthe importance of having an optimal delivery time is becoming increasingly\nevident these days. Scheduling can be used to optimize supply chains and\nproduction systems in this manner, which is one practical method for lowering\ncosts and boosting productivity. This paper suggests a multi-objective\nscheduling model for hierarchical hub structures (HHS) with three levels of\nservice. The factory and customers hub (second level) and central are on the\nfirst level in which the factory has a Flexible Flow Shop (FFS) environment.\nThe noncentral hub (third level) is responsible for the delivery of products\nmade in the factory to customers. Customer nodes and factories are connected\nseparately to the second level, and the non-central hubs are connected to the\nthird level. The model's objective is to minimize transportation and production\ncosts and product arrival times. To validate and evaluate the model, small\ninstances have been solved and analyzed in detail with the weighted sum and\ne-constraint methods. Consequently, based on the ideal mean distance (MID)\nmetric, the two methods were compared for the designed instances. As\nNP-hardness causes the previously proposed methods to solve large-scale\nproblems to be time-consuming, a meta-heuristic method was developed to solve\nthe large-scale problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 06:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

On\naggregate, the supernova disruption is significantly weaker than that from an\nidealised shock due to the supernova impact being instantaneous, and not\ncontinuous. In both supernova-cloud interactions, we observe two shocks impact\nthe cloud, followed by the development of a weak 10 km s$^{-1}$ upstream flow\non the cloud interface, and a global ambient pressure drop. When the cloud is\nstill atomic, it expands due to this drop. Additionally, the TI is triggered at\nthe front of the cloud, causing the formation of a cap-like structure with\nclumps embedded inside. The upstream flow converges in this region, resulting\nin a lobe-like cloud morphology. When the cloud is molecular, the transmitted\nshock disrupts the inter-clump material and causes the clumps' outer envelopes\nto expand slightly and form tail-like morphologies. These effects are less\npronounced than those in our shock-cloud scenarios, and more pronounced that\nthose in our un-shocked scenario. After 3.5 Myrs, the effects from the\nsupernova decay and the cloud returns to an almost indistinguishable state from\nan un-shocked cloud, in spite of the global ambient pressure drop.

To address this issue, we propose to first build\na syntactic dependency tree for each question with an off-the-shelf tool and\nuse it to guide the extraction of meaningful word compositions. Based on the\nextracted compositions, a hypergraph is further built by viewing the words as\nnodes and the compositions as hyperedges.

While the action of sharing is simple, it\nrequires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to\nshare, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to\nbe shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal\nassistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and\nrecommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content\nthat a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and\nhighly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not\naddress these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant\nshould be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering\nthat user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be\nable to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make\nthe decision on her own. Accordingly, this paper proposes a personal assistant\nthat uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy\nlabel. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can\nmodel its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not\nknow the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty\nis high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk\nfactors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its\nrecommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a\nwell-known data set. Our results show that our personal assistant can\naccurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and\nthus helps users preserve their privacy well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 10:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 15:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 12:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 11:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

Apart from one-loop contribution,\nthese extensions result in dominant tree-level contribution to neutrino masses.\nThe immediate remedy to obtain dominant one-loop contribution requires\ncombination of flavor symmetries and enlarged field content. Alternatively, in\nthis work, we propose a minimal way of realizing the topological structures\nwith dominant one-loop contribution using modular variant of the permutation\nsymmetries. In such a realization, no new fields are needed apart from those\npermitted by the topology itself. For the first time, we have realized one such\ntopological Lorentz structure(T4-2-$i$) pertaining to one-loop extension of\nType-II seesaw using modular A$_4$ symmetry.

It has remained open whether\nthe same bounds hold in the dynamic version of the same game, where balls are\ninserted/deleted with up to $m$ balls present at a time.\n  We show that these bounds do not hold in the dynamic setting: already on $4$\nbins, there exists a sequence of insertions/deletions that cause {Greedy} to\nincur a maximum load of $m/4 + \\Omega(\\sqrt{m})$ with probability $\\Omega(1)$\n-- this is the same bound as if each ball is simply assigned to a random bin!\n  This raises the question of whether any 2-choice allocation strategy can\noffer a strong bound in the dynamic setting.

Recent results indicate an ever increasing predictive ability of\ncurrent approaches on benchmark datasets. However, this effectiveness often\ncomes with the cost of over-parameterization and increased computationally\ncomplexity. The former induces extensive hyperparameter optimization to\nmitigate malicious overfitting. The latter magnifies the importance of winning\nthe hardware lottery. Here, we investigate a remedy for the first problem. We\npropose a technique based on Kronecker decomposition to reduce the number of\nparameters in a knowledge graph embedding model, while retaining its\nexpressiveness. Through Kronecker decomposition, large embedding matrices are\nsplit into smaller embedding matrices during the training process. Hence,\nembeddings of knowledge graphs are not plainly retrieved but reconstructed on\nthe fly. The decomposition ensures that elementwise interactions between three\nembedding vectors are extended with interactions within each embedding vector.\nThis implicitly reduces redundancy in embedding vectors and encourages feature\nreuse. To quantify the impact of applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding\nmatrices, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments suggest that applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding matrices\nleads to an improved parameter efficiency on all benchmark datasets. Moreover,\nempirical evidence suggests that reconstructed embeddings entail robustness\nagainst noise in the input knowledge graph.

The jet width and\njet axis position with distance from the star were studied from the extracted\nspectro-images. We observe the merging of knots and identify two previously\nundetected knots. Measurements of the jet axis position reveal a similar\npattern of deviation in all forbidden emission lines along the first 20 arc\nseconds of the jets. This result is interpreted as being due to asymmetric\nshocks and not due to a wiggling of the jet axis. The number of new knots\ndetected and their positions challenge the 16-year knot ejection periodicity\nproposed in prior studies, arguing for a more complicated jet system than was\npreviously assumed.

Also, ResNets were\nthe first class of neural networks in the development history of deep learning\nthat are really deep. It is of mathematical interest and practical meaning to\nunderstand the convergence of deep ResNets. We aim at characterizing the\nconvergence of deep ResNets as the depth tends to infinity in terms of the\nparameters of the networks. Toward this purpose, we first give a matrix-vector\ndescription of general deep neural networks with shortcut connections and\nformulate an explicit expression for the networks by using the notions of\nactivation domains and activation matrices. The convergence is then reduced to\nthe convergence of two series involving infinite products of non-square\nmatrices. By studying the two series, we establish a sufficient condition for\npointwise convergence of ResNets. Our result is able to give justification for\nthe design of ResNets. We also conduct experiments on benchmark machine\nlearning data to verify our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 11:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Retailers are faced with uncertainty in\ndemand and supply for each demand period. In grocery retailing, perishable\ngoods without best-before-dates further amplify the degree of uncertainty due\nto stochastic spoilage. Assuming a lead time of multiple days, the inventory at\nthe beginning of each demand period is determined jointly by the realisations\nof these stochastic variables. While existing contributions in the literature\nfocus on the role of single components only, we propose to integrate all of\nthem into a joint framework, explicitly modelling demand, supply shortages, and\nspoilage using suitable probability distributions learned from historic data.\nAs the resulting optimisation problem is analytically intractable in general,\nwe use a stochastic lookahead policy incorporating Monte Carlo techniques to\nfully propagate the associated uncertainties in order to derive replenishment\norder quantities. We develop a general inventory management framework and\nanalyse the benefit of modelling each source of uncertainty with an appropriate\nprobability distribution. Additionally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to location and dispersion of these distributions. We illustrate the\npractical feasibility of our framework using a case study on data from a\nEuropean e-grocery retailer.

While the vast majority of the household\nvehicles are still powered by conventional internal combustion engines, the\nprogress of adopting emerging vehicle technologies will critically depend on\nhow soon the existing vehicles are transacted out of the household fleet.\nLeveraging a nationally representative longitudinal data set, the Panel Study\nof Income Dynamics, this study examines how household decisions to dispose of\nor replace a given vehicle are: (1) influenced by the vehicle's attributes, (2)\nmediated by households' concurrent socio-demographic and economic attributes,\nand (3) triggered by key life cycle events. Coupled with a newly developed\nmachine learning interpretation tool, TreeExplainer, we demonstrate an\ninnovative use of machine learning models to augment traditional logit modeling\nto both generate behavioral insights and improve model performance. We find the\ntwo gradient-boosting-based methods, CatBoost and LightGBM, are the best\nperforming machine learning models for this problem. The multinomial logistic\nmodel can achieve similar performance levels after its model specification is\ninformed by TreeExplainer. Both machine learning and multinomial logit models\nsuggest that while older vehicles are more likely to be disposed of or replaced\nthan newer ones, such probability decreases as the vehicles serve the family\nlonger. We find that married families, families with higher education levels,\nhomeowners, and older families tend to keep their vehicles longer. Life events\nsuch as childbirth, residential relocation, and change of household composition\nand income are found to increase vehicle disposal and/or replacement. We\nprovide additional insights on the timing of vehicle replacement or disposal,\nin particular, the presence of children and childbirth events are more strongly\nassociated with vehicle replacement among younger parents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 13:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

Within the context of the\none-shot collective risk dilemma, where enough members of a group must\ncooperate in order to avoid a collective disaster, we study the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in a hybrid population made of both adaptive and\nfixed-behavior agents. Specifically, we show how the first learn to adapt their\nbehavior to compensate for the behavior of the latter.

By\npinpointing how adaptive agents avoid their share of costly cooperation if the\nfixed-behavior agents implement a cooperative policy, our work hints towards an\nunbalanced hybrid world. On one hand, this means that introducing cooperative\nAI agents within our society might unburden human efforts. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant to note that costless artificial cooperation might not be realistic,\nand more than deploying AI systems that carry the cooperative effort, we must\nfocus on mechanisms that nudge shared cooperation among all members in the\nhybrid system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 13:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

This ensures that the Hankel matrix of resulting\ninput/output data has the \"right\" rank, meaning that its columns span the\nentire subspace of trajectories. However, such binary rank conditions are known\nto be fragile in the sense that a small additive noise could already cause the\nHankel matrix to have full rank. Therefore, in this extended abstract we\npresent a robust version of the fundamental lemma. The idea behind the approach\nis to guarantee certain lower bounds on the singular values of the data Hankel\nmatrix, rather than mere rank conditions. This is achieved by designing the\ninputs of the experiment such that the minimum singular value of a deeper input\nHankel matrix is sufficiently large.

In this paper, we aim to minimize privacy leakages that may lead to\nuser identification on mobile devices through user tracking and\ndistinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We\npropose a privacy-preserving mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data\nfluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings while walking, sitting, and\nrunning at different times) by formulating the data as time-series modeling and\nforecasting. The proposed mechanism also uses the notion of correlated\nnoise-series against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to\nfilter out the noise from the perturbed data to re-identify the original data.\nUnlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running in isolation without the\ninteraction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments on\nbenchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking\nand distinguishability threats to a significant extent compared to the original\ndata while maintaining a reasonable level of utility of functionalities. In\ngeneral, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user trackability\nthreat by 60\\% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below\n0.5 Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also observe that our mechanism is more\neffective in large datasets.

Combining information from asteroseismology and multi-band\nphotometry we estimate both the masses and the radii of our targets. Our\nestimates are in agreement with independent sources, serving as a crucial\nverification of asteroseismology in the low metallicity regime.\n  As M4 is an old GC, it hosts multiple stellar populations differing in\nlight-element abundances and in helium mass fraction. This generates a mass\ndifference between the populations along the RGB, which in the case of M4 is\nestimated to be $0.017 M_\\odot$. With this wealth of information we can assign\npopulation membership and estimate the average mass of the stellar populations,\nbut the current uncertainties do not allow us to resolve this mass difference.\nThe population membership and the seismic data of RGB and HB stars, allow us,\nhowever, to assess the integrated mass loss along the RGB of the first\ngeneration stars in the cluster.

Nevertheless, the adoption of FL in cybersecurity is still in\nits infancy, and a range of practical aspects have not been properly addressed\nyet. Indeed, the Federated Averaging algorithm at the core of the FL concept\nrequires the availability of test data to control the FL process. Although this\nmight be feasible in some domains, test network traffic of newly discovered\nattacks cannot be always shared without disclosing sensitive information. In\nthis paper, we address the convergence of the FL process in dynamic\ncybersecurity scenarios, where the trained model must be frequently updated\nwith new recent attack profiles to empower all members of the federation with\nlatest detection features. To this aim, we propose FLAD (adaptive Federated\nLearning Approach to DDoS attack detection), a FL solution for cybersecurity\napplications based on an adaptive mechanism that orchestrates the FL process by\ndynamically assigning more computation to those members whose attacks profiles\nare harder to learn, without the need of sharing any test data to monitor the\nperformance of the trained model.

This core-clustering engine consists of a\nDeep Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM) for processing unlabeled data by\ncreating new features that are uncorrelated and have large variance with each\nother. Next, the number of clusters are predicted using the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC), followed by a Kohonen Network-based clustering\nlayer. The processing of unlabeled data is done in three stages for efficient\nclustering of the non-linearly separable datasets. In the first stage, DRBM\nperforms non-linear feature extraction by capturing the highly complex data\nrepresentation by projecting the feature vectors of $d$ dimensions into $n$\ndimensions. Most clustering algorithms require the number of clusters to be\ndecided a priori, hence here to automate the number of clusters in the second\nstage we use BIC. In the third stage, the number of clusters derived from BIC\nforms the input for the Kohonen network, which performs clustering of the\nfeature-extracted data obtained from the DRBM. This method overcomes the\ngeneral disadvantages of clustering algorithms like the prior specification of\nthe number of clusters, convergence to local optima and poor clustering\naccuracy on non-linear datasets. In this research we use two synthetic\ndatasets, fifteen benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository,\nand four image datasets to analyze the DRBM-ClustNet.

The key idea is that we leverage the teacher's classifier as a\nsemantic critic for evaluating the representations of both teacher and student\nand distilling the semantic knowledge with high-order structured information\nover all feature dimensions.

Assuming a one-body reaction operator, the nuclear wave\nfunction must include two-body short-range correlations (SRCs) with\ndeuteron-like quantum numbers. In a previous paper, we showed that SRC physics\ncan be naturally accounted for at low RG resolution. Here we describe the\nquasi-deuteron model at low RG resolution and determine the Levinger constant,\nwhich is proportional to the ratio of nuclear photo-absorption to that for\nphoto-disintegration of a deuteron. We extract the Levinger constant based on\nthe ratio of momentum distributions at high relative momentum. We compute\nmomentum distributions evolved under similarity RG (SRG) transformations, where\nthe SRC physics is shifted into the operator as a universal two-body term. The\nshort-range nature of this operator motivates using local-density\napproximations with uncorrelated wave functions in evaluating nuclear matrix\nelements, which greatly simplifies the analysis. The operator must be\nconsistently matched to the RG scale and scheme of the interaction for a\nreliable extraction. We apply SRG transformations to different nucleon-nucleon\n(NN) interactions and use the deuteron wave functions and Weinberg eigenvalues\nto determine approximate matching scales. We predict the Levinger constant for\nseveral NN interactions and a wide range of nuclei comparing to experimental\nextractions. The predictions at low RG resolution are in good agreement with\nexperiment when starting with a hard NN interaction and the initial operator.\nSimilar agreement is found using soft NN interactions when the additional\ntwo-body operator induced by evolution from hard to soft is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 15:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Furthermore, using the best fit parameters for the\nBorn-Infeld $f(T)$ model we show the angular diameter is consistent with recent\nobservations for the Sgr A$^{\\star}$ black hole angular diameter $(51.8 \\pm\n2.3) \\mu$arcsec and difficult to be distinguished from the GR. For the\ndeflection angle of light, in leading order terms, we find that the deflection\nangle expressed in the ADM mass coincides with the GR, but the ADM mass in the\nBorn-Infeld $f(T)$ gravity increases with the increase of $\\alpha$ and the\noverall deflection angle is expected to me greater in $f(T)$ gravity. As a\nconsequence of this fact, we have shown that the electromagnetic intensity\nobserved in shadow images is smaller compared to GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 11:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2022 15:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

In this paper, we focus on how to\ntransfer pre-trained models to few-shot downstream tasks from the three\nperspectives: update, data augmentation, and test-time augmentation.

Recent\npattern-information studies of brain activity have used condition-rich designs\nto sample the stimulus space more densely. To test whether brain response\npatterns discriminate among a set of stimuli (e.g. exemplars within a category)\nwith good sensitivity, we can pool statistical evidence over all pairwise\ncomparisons. Here we describe a wide range of statistical tests of exemplar\ndiscriminability and assess the validity (specificity) and power (sensitivity)\nof each test. The tests include previously used and novel, parametric and\nnonparametric tests, which treat subject as a random or fixed effect, and are\nbased on different dissimilarity measures, different test statistics, and\ndifferent inference procedures. We use simulated and real data to determine\nwhich tests are valid and which are most sensitive. A popular test statistic\nreflecting exemplar information is the exemplar discriminability index (EDI),\nwhich is defined as the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between\ndifferent exemplars minus the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates\nbetween repetitions of identical exemplars. The popular across-subject t test\nof the EDI (typically using correlation distance as the pattern dissimilarity\nmeasure) requires the assumption that the EDI is 0-mean normal under H0.\nAlthough this assumption is not strictly true, our simulations suggest that the\ntest controls the false-positives rate at the nominal level, and is thus valid,\nin practice.

Hence, computational models to forecast GICs\nglobally with large forecast horizon, high spatial resolution and temporal\ncadence are of increasing importance to perform prompt necessary mitigation.\nSince GIC data is proprietary, the time variability of horizontal component of\nthe magnetic field perturbation (dB/dt) is used as a proxy for GICs. In this\nwork, we develop a fast, global dB/dt forecasting model, which forecasts 30\nminutes into the future using only solar wind measurements as input. The model\nsummarizes 2 hours of solar wind measurement using a Gated Recurrent Unit, and\ngenerates forecasts of coefficients which are folded with a spherical harmonic\nbasis to enable global forecasts. When deployed, our model produces results in\nunder a second, and generates global forecasts for horizontal magnetic\nperturbation components at 1-minute cadence. We evaluate our model across\nmodels in literature for two specific storms of 5 August 2011 and 17 March\n2015, while having a self-consistent benchmark model set. Our model\noutperforms, or has consistent performance with state-of-the-practice high time\ncadence local and low time cadence global models, while also\noutperforming/having comparable performance with the benchmark models. Such\nquick inferences at high temporal cadence and arbitrary spatial resolutions may\nultimately enable accurate forewarning of dB/dt for any place on Earth,\nresulting in precautionary measures to be taken in an informed manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 18:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

Despite this, we propose that symbols are manufactured simply by\ntraining a sparse random noise as a self-sustaining attractor in a feedback\nspiking neural network. This way, we can generate many of what we shall call\nprime attractors, and the networks that support them are like registers holding\na symbolic value, and we call them registers. Like symbols, prime attractors\nare atomic and devoid of any internal structure. Moreover, the winner-take-all\nmechanism naturally implemented by spiking neurons enables registers to recover\na prime attractor within a noisy signal. Using this faculty, when considering\ntwo connected registers, an input one and an output one, it is possible to bind\nin one shot using a Hebbian rule the attractor active on the output to the\nattractor active on the input. Thus, whenever an attractor is active on the\ninput, it induces its bound attractor on the output; even though the signal\ngets blurrier with more bindings, the winner-take-all filtering faculty can\nrecover the bound prime attractor. However, the capacity is still limited. It\nis also possible to unbind in one shot, restoring the capacity taken by that\nbinding. This mechanism serves as a basis for working memory, turning prime\nattractors into variables. Also, we use a random second-order network to\namalgamate the prime attractors held by two registers to bind the prime\nattractor held by a third register to them in one shot, de facto implementing a\nhash table. Furthermore, we introduce the register switch box composed of\nregisters to move the content of one register to another. Then, we use spiking\nneurons to build a toy symbolic computer based on the above. The technics used\nsuggest ways to design extrapolating, reusable, sample-efficient deep learning\nnetworks at the cost of structural priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 00:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

In recent\nyears, several ethical principles have been released by governments, national\nand international organisations. These principles outline high-level precepts\nto guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. However,\nthe abstract nature, diversity, and context-dependency of these principles make\nthem difficult to implement and operationalize, resulting in gaps between\nprinciples and their execution. Most recent work analysed and summarized\nexisting AI principles and guidelines but they did not provide findings on\nprinciple-implementation gaps and how to mitigate them.

In this paper, we provide a contextual and\nglobal evaluation of current ethical AI principles for all continents, with the\naim to identify potential principle characteristics tailored to specific\ncountries or applicable across countries.
