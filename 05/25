In the critical problem of energy generation\nscheduling for microgrids, one needs to decide when to switch energy supply\nbetween a cheaper local generator with startup cost and the costlier on-demand\nexternal grid, considering intermittent renewable generation and fluctuating\ndemands. Without knowledge of future input, competitive online algorithms are\nappealing as they provide optimality guarantees against the optimal offline\nsolution. In practice, however, future input, e.g., wind generation, is often\npredictable within a limited time window, and can be exploited to further\nimprove the competitiveness of online algorithms. In this paper, we exploit the\nstructure of information in the prediction window to design a novel\nprediction-aware online algorithm for energy generation scheduling in\nmicrogrids. Our algorithm achieves the best competitive ratio to date for this\nimportant problem, which is at most $3-2/(1+\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{w})),$ where\n$w$ is the prediction window size. We also characterize a non-trivial lower\nbound of the competitive ratio and show that the competitive ratio of our\nalgorithm is only $9\\%$ away from the lower bound, when a few hours of\nprediction is available.

A non-minimal coupling term\n$\\xi\\,R\\,|\\phi|^2$ is natural to add to the vortex as it preserves\ngauge-invariance (here $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\\xi$ a dimensionless\ncoupling constant). This term plays a dual role: it contributes to the\npotential of the scalar field and to the Einstein-Hilbert term for gravity. As\na consequence, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar field and the\ncosmological constant in the AdS$_3$ background depend on $\\xi$. This leads to\na novel feature: there is a critical coupling $\\xi_c$ where the VEV is zero for\n$\\xi\\ge \\xi_c$ but becomes non-zero when $\\xi$ crosses below $\\xi_c$ and the\ngauge symmetry is spontaneously broken.

The critical coupling\nexists only in an AdS$_3$ background; it does not exist in asymptotically flat\nspacetime (topologically a cone) where the VEV remains at a fixed non-zero\nvalue independent of $\\xi$.

They connect cells throughout the body, including heart\nmyocytes, neurons, and astrocytes. Propagation mediated by gap junctions can be\npassive or active. In passive propagation, the membrane potential of one cell\ninfluences that of neighboring cells without triggering action potentials\n(APs). In active propagation, an AP in one cell triggers APs in neighboring\ncells; this occurs in cardiac tissue and throughout the nervous system. It is\nknown experimentally that there is an ideal gap junction conductance for AP\npropagation -- weaker or stronger conductance can block propagation. We present\na theory explaining this phenomenon by analyzing an idealized model that\nfocuses exclusively on gap junctional and spike-generating currents. We also\nfind a novel type of behavior that we call semi-active propagation, in which\ncells in the network are not excitable at rest, but still propagate action\npotentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 16:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

This model assumes\nthat the decision-maker has a noisy estimate of each candidate's quality and\nputs forward the difference in the noise variances between different\ndemographic groups as a key factor to explain discrimination. The literature on\ndifferential variance, however, does not consider the strategic behavior of\ncandidates who can react to the selection procedure to improve their outcome,\nwhich is well-known to happen in many domains.\n  In this paper, we study how the strategic aspect affects fairness in\nselection problems. We propose to model selection problems with strategic\ncandidates as a contest game: A population of rational candidates compete by\nchoosing an effort level to increase their quality. They incur a cost-of-effort\nbut get a (random) quality whose expectation equals the chosen effort. A\nBayesian decision-maker observes a noisy estimate of the quality of each\ncandidate (with differential variance) and selects the fraction $\\alpha$ of\nbest candidates based on their posterior expected quality; each selected\ncandidate receives a reward $S$. We characterize the (unique) equilibrium of\nthis game in the different parameters' regimes, both when the decision-maker is\nunconstrained and when they are constrained to respect the fairness notion of\ndemographic parity. Our results reveal important impacts of the strategic\nbehavior on the discrimination observed at equilibrium and allow us to\nunderstand the effect of imposing demographic parity in this context. In\nparticular, we find that, in many cases, the results contrast with the\nnon-strategic setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 17:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Specifically, we\nconsider a randomised basket trial design where patients are randomly assigned\nto the new treatment or a control within each trial subset (`subtrial' for\nshort). Closed-form sample size formulae are derived to ensure each subtrial\nhas a specified chance of correctly deciding whether the new treatment is\nsuperior to or not better than the control by some clinically relevant\ndifference. Given pre-specified levels of pairwise (in)commensurability, the\nsubtrial sample sizes are solved simultaneously.

However, system operators typically have imperfect information\nabout their customers' baselines, that is, their consumption had the incentive\nbeen absent. The standard approach to estimate the reduction in a customer's\nelectricity consumption then is to estimate their counterfactual baseline.\nHowever, this approach is not robust to estimation errors or strategic\nexploitation by the customers and can potentially lead to overpayments to\ncustomers who do not reduce their consumption and underpayments to those who\ndo. Moreover, optimal power consumption reductions of the customers depend on\nthe costs that they incur for curtailing consumption, which in general are\nprivate knowledge of the customers, and which they could strategically\nmisreport in an effort to improve their own utilities even if it deteriorates\nthe overall system cost. The two-stage mechanism proposed in this paper\ncircumvents the aforementioned issues. In the day-ahead market, the\nparticipating loads are required to submit only a probabilistic description of\ntheir next-day consumption and costs to the system operator for day-ahead\nplanning. It is only in real-time, if and when called upon for demand response,\nthat the loads are required to report their baselines and costs. They receive\ncredits for reductions below their reported baselines. The mechanism for\ncalculating the credits guarantees incentive compatibility of truthful\nreporting of the probability distribution in the day-ahead market and truthful\nreporting of the baseline and cost in real-time.

Within a certain scenario of\nextension of the SM, we obtain the relation\n$\\Delta_W\\simeq\\frac{3\\alpha}{8\\pi}M_W\\simeq70$ MeV, where $\\alpha$ is the\nelectromagnetic fine structure constant. The main conjecture is the appearance\nof longitudinal components of the $W$-bosons as the Goldstone bosons of a\nspontaneously broken additional $SU(2)$ global symmetry at distances much\nsmaller than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. We argue that within this\nscenario, the masses of charged Higgs scalars can get an electromagnetic\nradiative contribution which enhances the observed value of $M_{W^\\pm}$ with\nrespect to the usual SM prediction.

We jointly address such modeling and inference challenges by\nproposing an approach that combines a physically plausible body representation\nwith anatomical joint limits, a differentiable physics simulator, and\noptimization techniques that ensure good performance and robustness to\nsuboptimal local optima.

The\nhigh spectral resolution not only brings a major gain in terms of accessible\nspectral features but also enables a better separation of the stellar and\nplanetary signals. Ongoing projects such as Keck/KPIC, Subaru/REACH, and\nVLT/HiRISE base their observing strategy on the use of a few science fibres,\none of which is dedicated to sampling the planet's signal, while the others\nsample the residual starlight in the speckle field. The main challenge in this\napproach is to blindly centre the planet's point spread function (PSF)\naccurately on the science fibre, with an accuracy of less than 0.1 $\\lambda/D$\nto maximise the coupling efficiency. In the context of the HiRISE project,\nthree possible centring strategies are foreseen, either based on\nretro-injecting calibration fibres to localise the position of the science\nfibre or based on a dedicated centring fibre. We implemented these three\napproaches, and we compared their centring accuracy using an upgraded setup of\nthe MITHiC high-contrast imaging testbed, which is similar to the setup that\nwill be adopted in HiRISE. Our results demonstrate that reaching a\nspecification accuracy of 0.1 $\\lambda/D$ is extremely challenging regardless\nof the chosen centring strategy. It requires a high level of accuracy at every\nstep of the centring procedure, which can be reached with very stable\ninstruments.

In alternative, the observed radiation may\narise from the disk formed by the delayed merger of a black hole with a\nWolf-Rayet star. We explore the neutrino production in these scenarios, i.e.\ninternal shocks in a choked jet and interaction between the outflow and the\ncircumstellar medium (CSM).

Here, we\ncompare the contributions of these two steps leading to methanol by\nexperimentally investigating hydrogenation reactions on H2CO and D2CO ices,\nwhich ensures comparable starting points between the two scenarios. The\nexperiments are performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and astronomically\nrelevant temperatures, with H:H2CO (or D2CO) flux ratios of 10:1 and 30:1.

We study the dynamical evolution of a system consisting of the giant\nplanets and a massive planetesimal disk over the age of the Solar System. The\nmain question addressed in this study is whether distant trans-Neptunian\nobjects could have come about as a result of the combined action of planetary\nperturbations and the self-gravity of the disk. Methods. We carried out a\nseries of full N-body numerical simulations of gravitational interactions\nbetween the giant planets and a massive outer disk of planetesimals. Results.\nOur simulations show that the collective gravity of the giant planets and\nmassive planetesimals produces distant trans-Neptunian objects across a wide\nrange of the initial disk mass. The majority of objects that survive up through\nthe age of the Solar System have perihelion distances of q > 40 au. In this\nregion, there is a tendency toward a slow decrease in eccentricities and an\nincrease in perihelion distances for objects with semimajor axes a > 150 au.\nSecular resonances between distant planetesimals play a major role in\nincreasing their perihelion distances. This explains the origin of Sedna-type\nobjects. In our integrations for the age of the Solar System, we registered\ntimes with both high and low clustering of longitudes of perihelion and\narguments of perihelion for objects with q > 40 au, a > 150 au. The resulting\ndistribution of inclinations in our model and the observed distribution of\ninclinations for distant trans-Neptunian objects have similar average values of\naround 20 degrees.

Distant trans-Neptunian objects are a natural\nconsequence in the models that include migrating giant planets and a\nself-gravitating planetesimal disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 18:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Targeted threats, such as ransomware, cause millions of dollars\nin losses every year. The constant increase of malware infections has been\nmotivating popular antiviruses (AVs) to develop dedicated detection strategies,\nwhich include meticulously crafted machine learning (ML) pipelines.

This constant evolution of malware samples causes changes to the\ndata distribution (i.e., concept drifts) that directly affect ML model\ndetection rates, something not considered in the majority of the literature\nwork. In this work, we evaluate the impact of concept drift on malware\nclassifiers for two Android datasets: DREBIN (about 130K apps) and a subset of\nAndroZoo (about 285K apps).

For such fermionic systems, we show that degree-$4$ SoS (called\n$2$-RDM in quantum chemsitry) does not reproduce second order perturbation\ntheory but degree-$6$ SoS ($3$-RDM) does (and we conjecture that it reproduces\nthird order perturbation theory). Indeed, we identify a fragment of degree-$6$\nSoS which can do this, which may be useful for practical quantum chemical\ncalculations as it may be possible to implement this fragment with less cost\nthan the full degree-$6$ SoS. Remarkably, this fragment is very similar to one\nstudied by Hastings and O'Donnell for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 19:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 19:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

In\nthis context, we introduce a new class of high-dimension constant curvature\ncurves codes for analog error correction of independent continuous-alphabet\nuniform sources. In particular, we employ the circumradius function from knot\ntheory to prescribe insulating tubes about the centerline of constant curvature\ncurves. We then use tube packing density within a hypersphere to optimize the\ncurve parameters. The resulting constant curvature curve tube (C3T) codes\npossess the smallest possible latency -- block-length is unity under bandwidth\nexpansion mapping. Further, the codes provide within $5$ dB of Shannon's\noptimal performance theoretically achievable at the lower range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios and BW expansion factors.

However, their foraging strategies and their role as\nmicrobial ecosystem engineers remain unknown. Here we present a multi-scale\napproach, connecting microscopic single-cell analysis and macroscopic whole\necosystem dynamics, to expose a phylogenetically widespread foraging strategy,\nin which an amoeba population spontaneously partitions between cells with fast,\npolarized movement and cells with slow, unpolarized movement. Such\ndifferentiated motion gives rise to efficient colony expansion and consumption\nof the bacterial substrate. From these insights we construct a theoretical\nmodel that predicts how disturbances to amoeba growth rate and movement disrupt\ntheir predation efficiency. These disturbances correspond to distinct classes\nof bacterial defenses, which allows us to experimentally validate our\npredictions.

To prevent\nthe attack of shoulder surfing, if any user wishes to change our system\nprovided password key then he or she is allowed to do so by using this method.\nBesides this method allows user to change the password every single time of\nlogin.

Currently, there are very\nlimited public benchmarks for ICD, while all overlook a critical challenge in\nreal-world applications, i.e., the distraction from hard negative queries.\nSpecifically, some queries are not edited copies but are inherently similar to\nsome reference images. These hard negative queries are easily false recognized\nas edited copies, significantly compromising the ICD accuracy. This observation\nmotivates us to build the first ICD benchmark featuring this characteristic.\nBased on existing ICD datasets, this paper constructs a new dataset by\nadditionally adding 100, 000 and 24, 252 hard negative pairs into the training\nand test set, respectively. Moreover, this paper further reveals a unique\ndifficulty for solving the hard negative problem in ICD, i.e., there is a\nfundamental conflict between current metric learning and ICD. This conflict is:\nthe metric learning adopts symmetric distance while the edited copy is an\nasymmetric (unidirectional) process, e.g., a partial crop is close to its\nholistic reference image and is an edited copy, while the latter cannot be the\nedited copy of the former (in spite the distance is equally small). This\ninsight results in an Asymmetrical-Similarity Learning (ASL) method, which\nallows the similarity in two directions (the query <-> the reference image) to\nbe different from each other. Experimental results show that ASL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by a clear margin, confirming that solving the\nsymmetric-asymmetric conflict is critical for ICD.

We here present the Apertif Radio Transient\nSystem (ARTS), a supercomputing radio-telescope instrument that performs\nreal-time FRB detection and localisation on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope (WSRT) interferometer.

All detections are broad band and very narrow, of order\n1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally high. Only\nthrough the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these\nhard-to-find FRBs detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic\npopulation properties.

With the\nnegative consequences of these undesired biases, researchers have responded\nwith unprecedented effort and proposed promising approaches for bias\nmitigation. In spite of considerable practical importance, current algorithmic\nfairness literature lacks an in-depth understanding of the relations between\ndifferent forms of biases. Social bias is complex by nature. Numerous studies\nin social psychology identify the \"generalized prejudice\", i.e., generalized\ndevaluing sentiments across different groups. For example, people who devalue\nethnic minorities are also likely to devalue women and gays. Therefore, this\nwork aims to provide a first systematic study toward understanding bias\ncorrelations in mitigation. In particular, we examine bias mitigation in two\ncommon NLP tasks -- toxicity detection and word embeddings -- on three social\nidentities, i.e., race, gender, and religion. Our findings suggest that biases\nare correlated and present scenarios in which independent debiasing approaches\ndominant in current literature may be insufficient. We further investigate\nwhether jointly mitigating correlated biases is more desired than independent\nand individual debiasing.

From\nthis viewpoint, symbol emergence is regarded as decentralized Bayesian\ninference, and semiotic communication is regarded as inter-personal cross-modal\ninference. This notion leads to the collective predictive coding hypothesis}\nregarding language evolution and, in general, the emergence of symbols. We also\npropose the inter-Gaussian mixture model (GMM)+ variational autoencoder (VAE),\na deep generative model for emergent communication based on the MH naming game.\nThe model has been validated on MNIST and Fruits 360 datasets.

The use of CAD tools that express designs at higher levels of\nabstraction makes machine learning even more important to highlight the\nperformance of various design steps. Behavioral descriptions used during the\nhigh-level synthesis (HLS) are completely technology independent making it hard\nfor designers to interpret how changes in the synthesis options affect the\nresultant circuit. FPGA design flows are completely embracing HLS based\nmethodologies so that software engineers with almost no hardware design skills\ncan easily use their tools. HLS tools allow design space exploration by\nmodifying synthesis options, however, they lack accuracy in the Quality of\nResults (QoR) reported right after HLS.

This paper presents a\nrobust ML based design flow that can accurately predict post-route QoR for a\ngiven behavioral description without the need to synthesize the design. The\nmodel is an important design exploration tool where a designer can quickly view\nthe impact on overall design quality when local and global optimization\ndirectives are changed.

It not only impacts user\nexperience by showing relevant ads, but also affects ROI of advertisers and\nrevenue of marketplaces. Unlike clicks, which often occur within minutes after\nimpressions, conversions are expected to happen over a long period of time\n(e.g., 30 days for online shopping). It creates a challenge, as the true labels\nare only available after the long delays. Either inaccurate labels (partial\nconversions) are used, or models are trained on stale data (e.g., from 30 days\nago). The problem is more eminent in online learning, which focuses on the live\nperformance on the latest data. In this paper, a novel solution is presented to\naddress this challenge using multi-head modeling. Unlike traditional methods,\nit directly quantizes conversions into multiple windows, such as day 1, day 2,\nday 3-7, and day 8-30. A sub-model is trained specifically on conversions\nwithin each window. Label freshness is maximally preserved in early models\n(e.g., day 1 and day 2), while late conversions are accurately utilized in\nmodels with longer delays (e.g., day 8-30).

We obtain combinatorial models for the cohomology rings and\ntheir distinguished bases.\n  For concreteness and convenience, we focus primarily on the case $G/P =\n\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^\\infty$, where we explicitly identity the Schubert basis\nof $H^*(J(\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^\\infty))$ with monomial quasisymmetric\nfunctions. In this context, we also introduce and study a \"cellular $K$-theory\"\nSchubert basis for\n$K(J(\\mathbb{CP}^\\infty))\\,\\hat{\\otimes}_\\mathbb{Z}\\,\\mathbb{Q}$. We\ncharacterize this $K$-theory ring and develop quasisymmetric representatives\nwith an explicit combinatorial description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 23:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation.

This coincidence is\nrobust and tied with the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity. The\nnontrivial coincidence implies that the $U(1)$ axial anomaly becomes invisible\nin the meson susceptibility functions. The invisibility of the $U(1)$ axial\nanomaly keeps even at hot QCD, so that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry restores\nsimultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures.

Several recent developments have\ntried to overcome these challenges independently.

The proposed framework allows collaborative\nrepresentation learning across all the clients without imposing architectural\nconstraints or requiring presence of labeled data. The key idea in Hetero-SSFL\nis to let each client train its unique self-supervised model and enable the\njoint learning across clients by aligning the lower dimensional representations\non a common dataset. The entire training procedure could be viewed as self and\npeer-supervised as both the local training and the alignment procedures do not\nrequire presence of any labeled data. As in conventional self-supervised\nlearning, the obtained client models are task independent and can be used for\nvaried end-tasks.

GST then trains a dialog agent on the synthetic\nand the original VisDial data. As a result, GST scales the amount of training\ndata up to an order of magnitude that of VisDial (1.2M to 12.9M QA data). For\nrobust training of the synthetic dialogs, we also propose perplexity-based data\nselection and multimodal consistency regularization. Evaluation on VisDial v1.0\nand v0.9 datasets shows that GST achieves new state-of-the-art results on both\ndatasets. We further observe the robustness of GST against both visual and\ntextual adversarial attacks. Finally, GST yields strong performance gains in\nthe low-data regime.

PIBT is an\neffective algorithm that introduces a priority to each agent, and at each\ntimestep, the agents, in descending order of priority, decide their next\nneighboring locations in the next timestep through communications only with the\nlocal agents. Unfortunately, PIBT is only applicable to environments that are\nmodeled as a bi-connected area, and if it contains dead-ends, such as\ntree-shaped paths, PIBT may cause deadlocks. However, in the real-world\nenvironment, there are many dead-end paths to locations such as the shelves\nwhere materials are stored as well as loading/unloading locations to\ntransportation trucks. Our proposed method enables MAPD tasks to be performed\nin environments with some tree-shaped paths without deadlock while preserving\nthe PIBT feature; it does this by allowing the agents to have temporary\npriorities and restricting agents' movements in the trees. First, we\ndemonstrate that agents can always reach their delivery without deadlock. Our\nexperiments indicate that the proposed method is very efficient, even in\nenvironments where PIBT is not applicable, by comparing them with those\nobtained using the well-known token passing method as a baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 05:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

As the frequency increases from the microwave band to the THz band,\nnew spectrum features pose unprecedented challenges to wireless communication\nsystem design. The molecular absorption effect is one of the new THz spectrum\nproperties, which enlarges the path loss and noise at specific frequencies.\nThis brings in a double-edged sword for THz wireless communication systems. On\none hand, from the data rate viewpoint, molecular absorption is detrimental,\nsince it mitigates the received signal power and degrades the channel capacity.\nOn the other hand, it is worth noticing that for wireless security and\ncovertness, the molecular absorption effect can be utilized to safeguard THz\ncommunications among users. In this paper, the features of the molecular\nabsorption effect and their impact on the THz system design are analyzed under\nvarious scenarios, with the ultimate goal of providing guidelines to how better\nexploit this unique THz phenomenon.

By modeling the reverse process of\ngradually diffusing the data distribution into a Gaussian distribution,\ngenerating a sample in DDPMs can be regarded as iteratively denoising a\nrandomly sampled Gaussian noise. However, in practice DDPMs often need hundreds\neven thousands of denoising steps to obtain a high-quality sample from the\nGaussian noise, leading to extremely low inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a principled acceleration strategy, referred to as Early-Stopped DDPM\n(ES-DDPM), for DDPMs. The key idea is to stop the diffusion process early where\nonly the few initial diffusing steps are considered and the reverse denoising\nprocess starts from a non-Gaussian distribution. By further adopting a powerful\npre-trained generative model, such as GAN and VAE, in ES-DDPM, sampling from\nthe target non-Gaussian distribution can be efficiently achieved by diffusing\nsamples obtained from the pre-trained generative model. In this way, the number\nof required denoising steps is significantly reduced.

One\nstraightforward solution is to select samples based on the softmax probability\nscores in the neural classifier corresponding to their pseudo-labels.

However, the huge volume\nand diverse types of crisis-related posts on social media might limit\nhelp-seeking requests to receive adequate engagement and lead to their\noverwhelm. To understand this problem, this work proposes a mixed-methods\napproach to figure out the overwhelm situation of help-seeking requests, and\nindividuals' and online communities' strategies to cope. We focused on the 2021\nHenan Floods in China and collected 141,674 help-seeking posts with the keyword\n\"Henan Rainstorm Mutual Aid\" on a popular Chinese social media platform Weibo.\nThe findings indicate that help-seeking posts confront critical challenges of\nboth external overwhelm (i.e., an enormous number of non-help-seeking posts\nwith the help-seeking-related keyword distracting public attention) and\ninternal overwhelm (i.e., attention inequality with 5% help-seeking posts\nreceiving more than 95% likes, comments, and shares).

Most existing work resorts to tuning soft prompt\n(e.g., embeddings) which falls short of interpretability, reusability across\nLMs, and applicability when gradients are not accessible. Discrete prompt, on\nthe other hand, is difficult to optimize, and is often created by \"enumeration\n(e.g., paraphrasing)-then-selection\" heuristics that do not explore the prompt\nspace systematically. This paper proposes RLPrompt, an efficient discrete\nprompt optimization approach with reinforcement learning (RL). RLPrompt\nformulates a parameter-efficient policy network that generates the desired\ndiscrete prompt after training with reward. To overcome the complexity and\nstochasticity of reward signals by the large LM environment, we incorporate\neffective reward stabilization that substantially enhances the training\nefficiency. RLPrompt is flexibly applicable to different types of LMs, such as\nmasked (e.g., BERT) and left-to-right models (e.g., GPTs), for both\nclassification and generation tasks. Experiments on few-shot classification and\nunsupervised text style transfer show superior performance over a wide range of\nexisting finetuning or prompting methods.

This work\nconsiders an interesting variant of the problem where agents are embedded on a\ngraph.

Given a graph, the goal is to\nefficiently find a locally envy-free allocation where every agent values her\nshare to be at least as much as any of her neighbor's share.\n  The best known algorithm (by Aziz and Mackenzie) for finding envy-free cake\ndivisions has a hyper-exponential query complexity. One of the key technical\ncontributions of this work is to identify a non-trivial graph structure -- tree\ngraphs with depth at-most two (Depth2Tree) -- on $n$ agents that admits a query\nefficient cake-cutting protocol (under the Robertson-Webb query model). In\nparticular, we develop a discrete protocol that finds a locally envy-free\nallocation among $n$ agents on depth-two trees with at-most $O(n^3 \\log(n))$\ncuts on the cake.

In addition to the\nindividual body mesh models, we need to estimate relative 3D positions among\nsubjects to generate a coherent representation.

Nevertheless, we note\nthat, unlike the nonrelativistic case, the entire eigensolution does not\ncompletely vanish, either at the barrier or in the region under the step, but\nits upper component does satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition at the\nbarrier. More importantly, by calculating the mean value of the force exerted\nby the impenetrable wall on the particle in this eigenstate and taking its\nnonrelativistic limit, we recover the required result. We use two different\napproaches to obtain the latter two results. In one of these approaches, the\ncorresponding force on the particle is a type of boundary quantum force.\nThroughout the article, various issues related to the Klein energy zone, the\ntransmitted solutions to this problem, and impenetrable barriers related to\nboundary conditions are also discussed. In particular, if the negative-energy\ntransmitted solution is used, the lower component of the scattering solution\nsatisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition at the barrier, but the mean value\nof the external force when $V_{0}\\rightarrow E+\\mathrm{m}c^{2}$ does not seem\nto be compatible with the existence of the impenetrable barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 09:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 06:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 14:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 09:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

A\nfundamental task in this model is stable leader election, in which all nodes\nstart in an identical state and the aim is to reach a configuration in which\n(1) exactly one node is elected as leader and (2) this node remains as the\nunique leader no matter what sequence of interactions follows. On cliques, the\ncomplexity of this problem has recently been settled: time-optimal protocols\nstabilize in $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ expected steps using $\\Theta(\\log \\log n)$\nstates, whereas protocols that use $O(1)$ states require $\\Theta(n^2)$ expected\nsteps.\n  In this work, we investigate the complexity of stable leader election on\ngeneral graphs.

Recent DA techniques which achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance always meet the need for diversity in augmented training samples.\nHowever, an augmentation strategy that has a high diversity usually introduces\nout-of-distribution (OOD) augmented samples and these samples consequently\nimpair the performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose ReSmooth, a\nframework that firstly detects OOD samples in augmented samples and then\nleverages them. To be specific, we first use a Gaussian mixture model to fit\nthe loss distribution of both the original and augmented samples and\naccordingly split these samples into in-distribution (ID) samples and OOD\nsamples. Then we start a new training where ID and OOD samples are incorporated\nwith different smooth labels. By treating ID samples and OOD samples unequally,\nwe can make better use of the diverse augmented data. Further, we incorporate\nour ReSmooth framework with negative data augmentation strategies. By properly\nhandling their intentionally created OOD samples, the classification\nperformance of negative data augmentations is largely ameliorated.

Given the\nserious impact that breast cancer treatments can have on a patient's body\nimage, consequently affecting her self-confidence and sexual and intimate\nrelationships, it is paramount to ensure that women receive the treatment that\noptimizes both survival and aesthetic outcomes. Currently, there is no gold\nstandard for evaluating the aesthetic outcome of breast cancer treatment. In\naddition, there is no standard way to show patients the potential outcome of\nsurgery. The presentation of similar cases from the past would be extremely\nimportant to manage women's expectations of the possible outcome. In this work,\nwe propose a deep neural network to perform the aesthetic evaluation. As a\nproof-of-concept, we focus on a binary aesthetic evaluation. Besides its use\nfor classification, this deep neural network can also be used to find the most\nsimilar past cases by searching for nearest neighbours in the highly semantic\nspace before classification. We performed the experiments on a dataset\nconsisting of 143 photos of women after conservative treatment for breast\ncancer. The results for accuracy and balanced accuracy showed the superior\nperformance of our proposed model compared to the state of the art in aesthetic\nevaluation of breast cancer treatments. In addition, the model showed a good\nability to retrieve similar previous cases, with the retrieved cases having the\nsame or adjacent class (in the 4-class setting) and having similar types of\nasymmetry. Finally, a qualitative interpretability assessment was also\nperformed to analyse the robustness and trustworthiness of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 09:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

However, in deliberative reasoning such\nas in VQA, attention is unconstrained at each step, and thus may serve as a\nstatistical pooling mechanism rather than a semantic operation intended to\nselect information relevant to inference. This is because at training time,\nattention is only guided by a very sparse signal (i.e. the answer label) at the\nend of the inference chain. This causes the cross-modality attention weights to\ndeviate from the desired visual-language bindings. To rectify this deviation,\nwe propose to guide the attention mechanism using explicit linguistic-visual\ngrounding.

Pneumococcus serotype\nco-colonization, caused by the polymorphic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae,\nhas been increasingly investigated in recent years. While the global genomic\ndiversity and serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae are well-characterized,\nthere is limited information on how co-colonization patterns vary globally,\ncritical for understanding bacterial evolution and dynamics. Gathering a rich\ndataset of cross-sectional pneumococcal colonization studies in the literature,\nwe quantified patterns of transmission intensity and co-colonization prevalence\nin children populations across 17 geographic locations. Fitting these data to\nan SIS model with co-colonization under the assumption of similarity among\ninteracting strains, our analysis reveals strong patterns of negative\nco-variation between transmission intensity ($R_0$) and susceptibility to\nco-colonization ($k$). In support of the stress-gradient hypothesis in ecology\n(SGH), pneumococcus serotypes appear to compete more in high-transmission\nsettings and less in low-transmission settings, a trade-off which ultimately\nleads to a conserved ratio of single to co-colonization $\\mu=1/(R_0-1)k$.\nWithin our mathematical model, such conservation suggests preservation of\n'stability-diversity-complexity' regimes in multi-strain coexistence.

Given as input a low-light\nimage, TreEnhance produces as output its enhanced version together with the\nsequence of image editing operations used to obtain it. During the training\nphase, the method repeatedly alternates two main phases: a generation phase,\nwhere a modified version of MCTS explores the space of image editing operations\nand selects the most promising sequence, and an optimization phase, where the\nparameters of a neural network, implementing the enhancement policy, are\nupdated.\n  Two different inference solutions are proposed for the enhancement of new\nimages: one is based on MCTS and is more accurate but more time and memory\nconsuming; the other directly applies the learned policy and is faster but\nslightly less precise. As a further contribution, we propose a guided search\nstrategy that \"reverses\" the enhancement procedure that a photo editor applied\nto a given input image. Unlike other methods from the state of the art,\nTreEnhance does not pose any constraint on the image resolution and can be used\nin a variety of scenarios with minimal tuning.

Thus, mainstream methods usually rely\non a hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing step to select\nthe optimal prediction result, which hinders end-to-end training. To address\nthis issue, we propose a box-free and NMS-free end-to-end instance segmentation\nframework, termed UniInst, that yields only one unique representation for each\ninstance. Specifically, we design an instance-aware one-to-one assignment\nscheme, namely Only Yield One Representation (OYOR), which dynamically assigns\none unique representation to each instance according to the matching quality\nbetween predictions and ground truths. Then, a novel prediction re-ranking\nstrategy is elegantly integrated into the framework to address the misalignment\nbetween the classification score and the mask quality, enabling the learned\nrepresentation to be more discriminative. With these techniques, our UniInst,\nthe first FCN-based box-free and NMS-free instance segmentation framework,\nachieves competitive performance, e.g., 39.0 mask AP using ResNet-50-FPN and\n40.2 mask AP using ResNet-101-FPN, against mainstream methods on COCO test-dev\n2017. Moreover, the proposed instance-aware method is robust to occlusion\nscenes, outperforming common baselines by remarkable mask AP on the\nheavily-occluded OCHuman benchmark.

However, the use of UAVs introduces novel energy\nconstraints and scheduling challenges in the dynamic management of network\ndevices, due to the need to call back and recharge, or substitute, UAVs that\nrun out of energy. In this paper, we design UAV recharging schemes under\nrealistic assumptions on limited flight times and time consuming charging\noperations. Such schemes are designed to minimize the size of the fleet to be\ndevoted to a persistent service of a set of aerial locations, hence its cost.\nWe consider a fleet of homogeneous UAVs both under homogeneous and\nheterogeneous service topologies. For UAVs serving aerial locations with\nhomogeneous distances to a recharge station, we design a simple scheduling,\nthat we name HORR, which we prove to be feasible and optimal, in the sense that\nit uses the minimum possible number of UAVs to guarantee the coverage of the\naerial service locations. For the case of non-evenly distributed aerial\nlocations, we demonstrate that the problem becomes NP-hard, and design a\nlightweight recharging scheduling scheme, PHERR, that extends the operation of\nHORR to the heterogeneous case, leveraging the partitioning of the set of\nservice locations. We show that PHERR is near-optimal because it approaches the\nperformance limits identified through a lower bound that we formulate on the\ntotal fleet size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 11:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

The apparent presence of a very weak magnetism does not result in long\nrange ordering. We propose a model compatible with a detectable internal\nmagnetic field with no evidence of magnetic long-range order. It invokes higher\norder terms in the vanadium magnetization density compatible with the presence\nof a \"hidden order\" of Dirac (polar) multipoles. The Dirac dipole, known as an\nanapole or toroidal dipole, is one of a family of electronic multipoles visible\nin x-ray and magnetic neutron diffraction while undetectable with standard\nlaboratory-based techniques. Two plausible hidden orders are studied with a\nview to testing in future x-ray and neutron Bragg diffraction experiments\nwhether they are trustworthy. One candidate is magneto-electric and restricted\nto the linear type, while the other candidate cannot show a magneto-electric\neffect of any type. The latter hosts a vanadium entity that is both a true\nscalar and magnetic, and its presence epitomizes an absence of loop currents.\nDiffraction patterns for the two proposed hidden magnetic orders are distinctly\ndifferent, fortunately.

Once the LEV separates from the foil, it\ntravels downstream and rapidly weakens and diffuses. The downstream trajectory\nof the LEV has two characteristic shapes. At low values of ${\\alpha_{T/4}}$, it\ntravels straight downstream after separating from the foil, while at higher\nvalues of ${\\alpha_{T/4}} $, an accompanying Trailing Edge Vortex (TEV) forms\nand the induced velocity generates a cross-stream component to the vortex\ntrajectories.

Traditional\napproaches commonly rely on adding Gaussian white noise to the macroscopic\ndynamical circuit laws, but do not capture rare fluctuations and lead to\nthermodynamic inconsistencies. A correct and thermodynamically consistent\napproach can be achieved by describing single-electron transfers as Poisson\njump processes accounting for charging effects.

Next,\nwe explore cross-task generalization ability on models tuned on InstructDial\nacross diverse dialogue tasks. Our analysis reveals that InstructDial enables\ngood zero-shot performance on unseen datasets and tasks such as dialogue\nevaluation and intent detection, and even better performance in a few-shot\nsetting. To ensure that models adhere to instructions, we introduce novel\nmeta-tasks. We establish benchmark zero-shot and few-shot performance of models\ntrained using the proposed framework on multiple dialogue tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 11:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 17:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

However, unlearning itself may\nnot be enough to implement RTBF unless the unlearning effect can be\nindependently verified, an important aspect that has been overlooked in the\ncurrent literature.

In VeriFi, the leaving\nparticipant is granted the right to verify (RTV), that is, the participant\nnotifies the server before leaving, then actively verifies the unlearning\neffect in the next few communication rounds. The unlearning is done at the\nserver side immediately after receiving the leaving notification, while the\nverification is done locally by the leaving participant via two steps: marking\n(injecting carefully-designed markers to fingerprint the leaver) and checking\n(examining the change of the global model's performance on the markers).

Many diseases present some form of intra-host quiescent stage, also\nknown as covert infection, while others exhibit dormant stages in the\nenvironment. As quiescent/dormant stages can be resistant to drug, antibiotics,\nfungicide treatments, it is of practical relevance to study the influence of\nthese two life-history traits on the coevolutionary dynamics. We develop first\na deterministic coevolutionary model with two parasite types infecting one host\ntype and study analytically the stability of the dynamical system. We\nspecifically derive a stability condition for a five-by-five system of\nequations with quiescence. Second, we develop a stochastic version of the model\nto study the influence of quiescence on stochasticity of the system dynamics.\nWe compute the steady state distribution of the parasite types which follows a\nmultivariate normal distribution. Furthermore, we obtain numerical solutions\nfor the covariance matrix of the system under symmetric and asymmetric\nquiescence rates between parasite types. When parasite strains are identical,\nquiescence increases the variance of the number of infected individuals at high\ntransmission rate and vice versa when the transmission rate is low. However,\nwhen there is competition between parasite strains with different quiescent\nrates, quiescence generates a moving average behaviour which dampen off\nstochasticity and decreases the variance of the number of infected hosts. The\nstrain with the highest rate of entering quiescence determines the strength of\nthe moving average and the magnitude of reduction of stochasticity. Thus, it is\nworth investigating simple models of multi-strain parasite under\nquiescence/dormancy to improve disease management strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 12:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

It greatly reduces the particle and heat flux incident\non a target, and thus reduces the sputtering and heat loading on the target. It\nis therefore advantageous to have accurate simulations of plasma behaviour in\nthe divertor to design future Tokamak divertors. A common simulation package\nused for this purpose is SOLPS-ITER, which has previously been observed to be\nunderestimating the contribution of molecular effects to plasma detachment. To\ncorrect this, its reaction rate for molecular charge exchange was altered. This\nalteration resulted in a significant increase in the density of $D_2^+$ ions\nwithin the divertor. The particle balance and $D\\alpha$ emission data was then\ncomputed from the simulation outputs. These were compared to experimental data\nand a set of post-processing routines for the original simulations that\npredicts the effect of a corrected charge exchange rate. In comparison to the\npost-processing predictions: the increase in Molecular activated Recombination\nand the depth of the target flux rollover was less than predicted.

Our results demonstrate that NSIL\nlearns expressive knowledge, solves computationally complex problems, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and data efficiency.\nCode and technical appendix: https://github.com/DanCunnington/NSIL\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 12:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 10:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 15:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 14:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 09:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 16:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 12:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

A central focus in modern research is to extend the\ngeneration and control of entangled states from few to many qubits, and protect\nthem against decoherence. Optical photons play a prominent role as these qubit\ncarriers are naturally robust and easy to manipulate. However, the most\nsuccessful technique to date for creating photonic entanglement is inherently\nprobabilistic and therefore subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we\navoid these by implementing a deterministic protocol with a single memory atom\nin a cavity. We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored\natomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states\nof up to 14 photons and linear cluster states of up to 12 photons with a\nfidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a\nsource-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon we measure these large\nstates about once every minute, orders of magnitude faster than in any previous\nexperiment. In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the\nscheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity, or several sources could be\nquantum mechanically coupled, to generate higher-dimensional cluster states.\nOur work therefore removes a long-standing obstacle towards scalable\nmeasurement-based quantum computation and communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 12:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Since molecular\nresonances may acquire the spatial coherence of plasmons, which have mm-scale\npropagation lengths, strong-coupling with molecular resonances potentially\nenables long-range molecular energy transfer. Gratings are often used to couple\nincident light to surface plasmons, by scattering the otherwise non-radiative\nsurface plasmon inside the light-line. We calculate the dispersion relation for\nsurface plasmons strongly coupled to molecular resonances when grating\nscattering is involved. By treating the molecules as independent oscillators\nrather than the more typically-considered single collective dipole, we find the\nfull multi-band dispersion relation. This approach offers a natural way to\ninclude the dark states in the dispersion. We demonstrate that for a molecular\nresonance tuned near the crossing point of forward and backward\ngrating-scattered plasmon modes, the interaction between plasmons and molecules\ngives a five-band dispersion relation, including a bright state not captured in\ncalculations using a single collective dipole. We also show that the role of\nthe grating in breaking the translational invariance of the system appears in\nthe position-dependent coupling between the molecules and the surface plasmon.\nThe presence of the grating is thus not only important for the experimental\nobservation of molecule-surface-plasmon coupling, but also provides an\nadditional design parameter that tunes the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 12:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

By evaluating seven\npre-trained models, including ResNets and ViT's with self-supervision and\nsupervision mode, on five important distribution-shift datasets, from WILDS and\nDomainBed benchmarks, with five different learning algorithms, we provide the\nfirst comprehensive empirical study focusing on pre-training and data\naugmentation. With our empirical result obtained from 1,330 models, we provide\nthe following main observations: 1) ERM combined with data augmentation can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance if we choose a proper pre-trained model\nrespecting the data property; 2) specialized algorithms further improve the\nrobustness on top of ERM when handling a specific type of distribution shift,\ne.g., GroupDRO for spurious correlation and CORAL for large-scale\nout-of-distribution data; 3) Comparing different pre-training modes,\narchitectures and data sizes, we provide novel observations about pre-training\non distribution shift, which sheds light on designing or selecting pre-training\nstrategy for different kinds of distribution shifts. In summary, our empirical\nstudy provides a comprehensive baseline for a wide range of pre-training models\nfine-tuned with data augmentation, which potentially inspires research\nexploiting the power of pre-training and data augmentation in the future of\ndistribution shift study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 13:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

It has been\nproposed that Coulomb interactions lead to a time-reversal symmetry broken\nphase when the electron and hole densities are tuned from the trivial to the\nquantum spin Hall insulator regime. We show that the transport properties of\nthe system in the time-reversal symmetry broken phase are consistent with the\nrecent experimental observations in InAs/GaSb. Moreover, we carry out a quantum\ntransport study on a Corbino disc where the bulk and edge contributions to the\nconductance can be separated. We show that the edge becomes smoothly conducting\nand the bulk is always insulating when one tunes the system from the trivial to\nthe quantum spin Hall insulator phase, providing unambiguous transport\nsignatures of the time-reversal symmetry broken phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 14:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Numerous techniques for the use of symmetry\nin SAT have evolved over the past few decades. But no matter how symmetries are\nused precisely, they have to be detected first. We investigate how to detect\nmore symmetry, faster. The initial idea is to reap the benefits of SAT\npreprocessing for symmetry detection. As it turns out, applying an\noff-the-shelf preprocessor before handling symmetry runs into problems: the\npreprocessor can haphazardly remove symmetry from formulas, severely impeding\nsymmetry exploitation.\n  Our main contribution is a theoretical framework that captures the\nrelationship of SAT preprocessing techniques and symmetry.

We then demonstrate that applying the preprocessor does not only\nsubstantially decrease symmetry detection and breaking times, but also uncovers\nhidden symmetry not detectable in the original instances. Overall, we depart\nthe conventional view of treating symmetry detection as a black-box, presenting\na new application-specific approach to symmetry detection in SAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 14:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

To form a sublimation exosphere requires the\nsurface of a body to be sufficiently warm for surface volatiles to sublime; to\nretain an exosphere, the ballistic escape and photodestruction rates and other\nloss mechanisms must be sufficiently low. Here we construct a simple free\nmolecular model of exospheres formed by volatile desorption/sublimation. We\nconsider the conditions for forming and retaining exospheres for common\nvolatile species across the Solar System, and explore how three processes\n(desorption/sublimation, ballistic loss, and photodestruction) shape exospheric\ndynamics on airless bodies. Our model finds that the CO2 exosphere of Callisto\nis too dense to be sustained by impact-delivered volatiles, but could be\nmaintained by only ~7 hectares of exposed CO2 ice.

We suggest that exosphere-mediated volatile transport\ncould produce these moons' leading/trailing CO2 asymmetries, and may be a\nseasonal equinox feature that could be largely erased by volatile migration\nduring the Uranian solstices.

It requires \"bidirectional\" language processing: firstly,\nthe system has to understand the input text (Natural Language Understanding)\nand it then has to generate questions also in the form of text (Natural\nLanguage Generation). In this article, we introduce our framework for\ngenerating the factual questions from unstructured text in the English\nlanguage. It uses a combination of traditional linguistic approaches based on\nsentence patterns with several machine learning methods. We firstly obtain\nlexical, syntactic and semantic information from an input text and we then\nconstruct a hierarchical set of patterns for each sentence. The set of features\nis extracted from the patterns and it is then used for automated learning of\nnew transformation rules. Our learning process is totally data-driven because\nthe transformation rules are obtained from a set of initial sentence-question\npairs. The advantages of this approach lie in a simple expansion of new\ntransformation rules which allows us to generate various types of questions and\nalso in the continuous improvement of the system by reinforcement learning. The\nframework also includes a question evaluation module which estimates the\nquality of generated questions. It serves as a filter for selecting the best\nquestions and eliminating incorrect ones or duplicates. We have performed\nseveral experiments to evaluate the correctness of generated questions and we\nhave also compared our system with several state-of-the-art systems. Our\nresults indicate that the quality of generated questions outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art systems and our questions are also comparable to questions\ncreated by humans. We have also created and published an interface with all\ncreated datasets and evaluated questions, so it is possible to follow up on our\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 14:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

This facility\nopens up many advantages, such as flexibility in packet processing and better\nnetwork management, which leads to better security in the network. However, the\ncurrent literature lacks network security solutions concerning authentication\nand preventing unauthorized access. In this work, our goal is to avoid attacks\nin a two level defense mechanism (P4Filter). The first level is a dynamic\nfirewall logic, which blocks packets generated from an unauthorized source. The\nsecond level is an authentication mechanism based on dynamic port knocking. The\ntwo security levels were tested in a virtual environment with P4 based\nswitches. The packets arriving at the switch from unknown hosts are sent to the\ncontroller. The controller maintains an ACL using which it assigns rules for\nboth the levels to allow or drop the packets. For port knocking a new random\nsequence is generated for every new host. Hosts can only connect using the\ncorrect sequence assigned to them.The tests conducted show this approach\nperforms better than the previous P4 based firewall approaches due to two\nsecurity levels.

Here we present a proof of concept for a\nsuper-resolution method of magnetic imaging by a Josephson junction.

One way is to examine if the light wave-front from a\ndistant quasar or GRB can be noticeably distorted by spacetime-foam-induced\nphase incoherence. As the phase fluctuations are proportional to the distance\nto the source, but inversely proportional to the wavelength, ultra-high energy\nphotons ($>1$ TeV) from distant sources are particularly useful. We elaborate\non several proposals, including the possibility of detecting spacetime foam by\nobserving \"seeing disks\" in the images of distant quasars and active galactic\nnuclei. We also discuss the appropriate distance measure for calculating the\nexpected angular broadening. In addition, we discuss our more recent work in\nwhich we investigate whether wave-front distortions on small scales (due to\nspacetime foam) can cause distant objects become undetectable because the phase\nfluctuations have accumulated to the point at which image formation is\nimpossible. Another possibility that has recently become accessible is to use\ninterferometers to observe cosmologically distant sources, therefore giving a\nlarge baseline perpendicular to the local wave vector over which the wave front\ncould become corrugated and thus distorted, reducing or eliminating its fringe\nvisibility.

For the hybrid case with initial and\nfinal Hamiltonians being Hermitian and non-Hermitian respectively, winding\nnumber exhibits integer spike in addition to the non-monotonic integer jumps.\nFor the non-Hermitian case with initial and final Hamiltonians both being\nnon-Hermitian, the winding number show half-integer jumps for lossy\nsuperconcuctivity that does not have any Hermitian analogue. On the other hand,\nthe integer jumps in winding number is observed for lossy chemical potential.\nWe understand our findings by connecting them with the profile of Fisher zeros\nand number of exceptional points and/or origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 15:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 22:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Quantum radar\nsystems supported by quantum measurement can fulfill not only conventional\ntarget detection and recognition tasks but are also capable of detecting and\nidentifying the RF stealth platform and weapons systems. The development of\nradar technology is of the utmost importance in many avenues of research. The\nconcept of a quantum radar has been proposed which utilizes quantum states of\nphotons to establish information on a target at a distance. A photon, or a\nlittle cluster of photons, is distributed towards the target. The photons are\nabsorbed and reemitted from the target and into the receiver. The measurement\nprocess may be executed in two alternative ways. One can perform an\ninterferometric measurement (or phase measurement) on the photon, or one can\nsimply count the number of photons that return. the previous method is named\nInterferometric Quantum Radar, and therefore the latter method is termed\nQuantum Illumination. For either of those methods, one can use stationary\nquantum states of photons or use entangled states. Its been shown that\nentangled states provide the most effective possible boost in resolution,\nachieving within the ideal case. The benefit of using quantum states is that\nthey exhibit extra degrees of correlation by which to get information compared\nto classical methods. These extra correlations (called quantum correlations)\nserve to boost the resolution and signal/noise (SNR) that may be achieved\nwithin the radar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 06:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

One avenue for its adoption is to employ it in place of\npersistent storage; another is to use it as a cheaper and denser extension of\nDRAM. In pursuit of the latter goal, we present the design of a volatile Optane\nNVRAM cache as a component in a storage engine underlying MongoDB. The primary\ninnovation in our design is a new cache admission policy. We discover that on\nOptane NVRAM, known for its limited write throughput, the presence of writes\ndisproportionately affects the throughput of reads, much more so than on DRAM.\nTherefore, an admission policy that indiscriminately admits new data (and thus\ngenerates writes), severely limits the rate of data retrieval and results in\nexceedingly poor performance for the cache overall. We design an admission\npolicy that balances the rate of admission with the rate of lookups using\ndynamically observed characteristics of the workload. Our implementation\noutperforms OpenCAS (an off-the-shelf Optane-based block cache) in all cases,\nand Intel Memory Mode in cases where the database size exceeds the available\nNVRAM.

Approaches that leverage this technique are usually referred as\ncommunication methods, as full autonomy of agents is compromised for better\nperformance.

Lastly, noisy fitness function\nevaluations may result in solutions that are highly sub-optimal on expectation.\nIn contrast, stochastic optimizers that are motivated by policy gradients, such\nas the Model-based Relative Entropy Stochastic Search (MORE) algorithm,\ndirectly optimize the expected fitness function without the use of rankings.\nMORE can be derived by applying natural policy gradients and compatible\nfunction approximation, and is using information theoretic constraints to\nensure the stability of the policy update. While MORE does not suffer from the\nlisted limitations, it often cannot achieve state of the art performance in\ncomparison to ranking based methods.

Inspired by the good\nrepresentation ability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we propose a\nsimple-structured GNN model named SS-GNN to accurately predict DTBA. By\nconstructing a single undirected graph based on a distance threshold to\nrepresent protein-ligand interactions, the scale of the graph data is greatly\nreduced. Moreover, ignoring covalent bonds in the protein further reduces the\ncomputational cost of the model. The GNN-MLP module takes the latent feature\nextraction of atoms and edges in the graph as two mutually independent\nprocesses. We also develop an edge-based atom-pair feature aggregation method\nto represent complex interactions and a graph pooling-based method to predict\nthe binding affinity of the complex. We achieve state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance using a simple model (with only 0.6M parameters) without\nintroducing complicated geometric feature descriptions. SS-GNN achieves\nPearson's Rp=0.853 on the PDBbind v2016 core set, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art GNN-based methods by 5.2%. Moreover, the simplified model\nstructure and concise data processing procedure improve the prediction\nefficiency of the model.
