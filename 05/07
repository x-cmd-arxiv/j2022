In particular, the\ncolour-colour diagrams known as chromosome maps have been proven to be very\nefficient at separating cluster stars with field-like metal abundance\ndistribution (1P) from object with distinctive light-element abundance\nanti-correlations (2P). The unexpected wide colour ranges covered by the 1P\ngroup in the chromosome maps of the majority of the investigated Galactic GCs\nhave been recently attributed to intrinsic metallicity variations up to ~0.30\ndex, from the study of SGB stars in two metal rich Galactic GCs by employing\nappropriate HST filter combinations. On the other hand, high-resolution\nspectroscopy of small samples of 1P stars in NGC 3201 and NGC 2808 have so far\nprovided conflicting results, with a spread of metallicity detected in NGC 3201\nbut not in NGC 2808. We present a new method that employs HST near-UV and\noptical photometry of RGB stars, to independently confirm these results. Our\napproach has been firstly validated using observational data for M2, a GC\nhosting a small group of 1P stars with enhanced (by ~0.5 dex) metallicity with\nrespect to the main component. We have then applied our method to three\nclusters that cover a much larger metallicity range, and have well populated,\nextended first population sequences in their chromosome maps, namely M92,\nNGC2808, and NGC6362. We confirm that metallicity spreads are present among 1P\nstars in these clusters, thus solidifying the case for the existence of\nunexpected variations up to a factor of two of metal abundances in most GCs. We\nalso confirm the complex behaviour of the mean metallicity differences between\n1P and 2P stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 16:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

In this case -- and because the NM\nusually does not possess the same symmetry as the topological material -- it is\npertinent to ask whether zero-energy edge states in the topological layer are\naffected by the presence of the NM. To address this issue, we consider three\nprototype systems simulated by tight-binding models, namely a\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger/NM, a Kitaev/NM, and a Chern insulator/NM. For all\njunctions investigated, we find that there exist trivial ``fine-tuned''\nzero-energy states in the NM layer that can percolate into the topological\nregion, thus mimicking a topological state. These zero-energy states are\ncreated by fine-tuning the NM chemical potential such that some of the NM\nstates cross zero energy; they can occur even when the topological material is\nin the topologically trivial phase, and exist over a large region of the\ntopological phase diagram. Interestingly, the true Majorana end modes of the\nKitaev/NM model cannot be crossed by any NM state, as the NM metal layer in\nthis case does not break particle-hole symmetry. On the other hand, when the\nchiral symmetry of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is broken by the attached NM,\ncrossings are allowed. In addition, even in Chern insulators that do not\npreserve nonspatial symmetries, but the topological edge state self-generates a\nsymmetry eigenvalue, such a fine-tuned zero-energy state can still occur. Our\nresults indicate that when a topological material is attached to a metallic\nlayer, one has to be cautious as to identify true topological edge states\nmerely from their energy spectra and wave function profiles near the interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 16:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 13:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

A phenomenological theory of this molecular distillation\nprocess has recently been proposed [arXiv:1811.06760], based on the idea that\nmolecular sorting emerges from the combination of: a) phase-separation-driven\nformation of sorting domains, and b) domain-induced membrane bending, leading\nto the production of submicrometric lipid vesicles enriched in the sorted\nmolecules. In this framework, a natural parameter controlling the efficiency of\nmolecular distillation is the critical size of phase-separated domains. In the\nexperiments, sorting domains appear to fall into two classes: unproductive\ndomains, characterized by short lifetimes and low probability of extraction,\nand productive domains, that evolve into vesicles that ultimately detach from\nthe membrane system. It is tempting to link these two classes to the different\nfates predicted by classical phase separation theory for subcritical and\nsupercritical phase-separated domains. Here, we discuss the implication of this\npicture in the framework of the previously introduced phenomenological theory\nof molecular sorting.

It\nhas been shown that using the correlated information between the dark matter\ndistribution in the Universe with the fluctuations of the cosmic radiation\nfields has the potential to allow setting apart a pure dark matter signal from\nastrophysical emissions, since spatial fluctuations in the radiation field due\nto astrophysical sources and dark matter emission have different features. The\ncross-correlation technique has been proposed and adopted for dark matter\nstudies by looking at dark matter halos (overdensities). In this paper we\nextend the technique by focusing on the information on dark matter distribution\noffered by cosmic voids, and by looking specifically at the gamma-ray dark\nmatter emission: we show that, while being underdense and therefore producing a\nreduced emission as compared to halos, nevertheless in voids the relative size\nof the cross-correlation signal due to decaying dark matter vs. astrophysical\nsources is significantly more favourable, producing signal-to-background ratios\n$S/B$ (even significantly) larger than 1 for decay lifetimes up to $2 \\times\n10^{30}$ s. This is at variance with the case of halos, where $S/B$ is\ntypically (even much) smaller than 1.

Despite the substantial progress, the\nFSOD performance is still far behind satisfactory. During pre-training, due to\nthe co-occurrence between base and novel classes, the model is learned to treat\nthe co-occurred novel classes as backgrounds.

While prior AR observations have shown that these\nstructures were always brighter than the quiet Sun at centimeter wavelengths,\nrecent observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have shown ARs\nwith well defined dark umbrae. Given this new information, it is now necessary\nto update our understanding and models of the solar atmosphere in active\nregions. In this work, we present a data-constrained model of the AR solar\natmosphere, in which we use brightness temperature measurements of NOAA 12470\nat three radio frequencies: 17 (NoRH), 100 and 230 GHz (ALMA). Based on our\nmodel, which assumes that the radio emission originates from thermal free-free\nand gyroresonance processes, we calculate radio brightness temperature maps\nthat can be compared with the observations. The magnetic field at distinct\natmospheric heights was determined in our modelling process by force-free field\nextrapolation using photospheric magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO. In order to\ndetermine the best plasma temperature and density height profiles necessary to\nmatch the observations, the model uses a genetic algorithm that modifies a\nstandard quiet Sun atmospheric model. Our results show that the height of the\ntransition region (TR) of the modelled atmosphere varies with the type of\nregion being modelled: for umbrae the TR is located at 1080 +/- 20 km above the\nsolar surface; for penumbrae, the TR is located at 1800 +/- 50 km; and for\nbright regions outside sunspots, the TR is located at 2000 +/- 100 km.

At any time, age of information (AoI) is equal to the\ndifference between the current time, and the arrival time of the latest update\n(at the source) that has been completely transmitted (to the destination). AoI\nquantifies the staleness of the update (information) at the destination. The\ngoal is to find a causal scheduling policy that minimizes the time average of\nAoI, where the possible decisions at any time are i) whether to preempt the\nupdate under transmission upon arrival of a new update, and ii) if no update is\nunder transmission, then choose which update to transmit (among the available\nupdates).\n  In this paper, we propose a causal policy called SRPT$^+$ that at each time,\ni) preempts the update under transmission if a new update arrives with a\nsmaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then begins to\ntransmit the update for which the ratio of the reduction in AoI upon complete\ntransmission (if not preempted in future) and the remaining size, is maximum.\nWe characterize the performance of SRPT$^+$ using the metric called the\ncompetitive ratio, i.e. the ratio of the average AoI of causal policy and the\naverage AoI of an optimal offline policy (that knows the entire input in\nadvance), maximized over all possible inputs. We show that the competitive\nratio of SRPT$^+$ is at most $4$. Further, we propose a simpler policy called\nSRPT$^L$, that i) preempts the update under transmission if a new update\narrives with a smaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then\nbegins to transmit the update with the latest arrival time. We show that the\ncompetitive ratio of SRPT$^L$ is at most $29$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 17:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

As a subset of the space of soliton solutions\nin the SU($2$) Higgs model, in the end we also explicitly discuss solitons in\nthe Abelian Higgs model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 21:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

In addition to unbroken\nglobal lepton number, a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed to forbid direct\ncoupling between right and left chiral parts of light Dirac neutrino.\nGenerating light Dirac neutrino mass requires the singlet scalar to acquire a\nvacuum expectation value (VEV) that also breaks the $Z_2$ symmetry, leading to\nformation of domain walls in the early universe.

Since the Cr concentration of nano-scale {\\alpha}/ phase in\nFe-20 at.% Cr alloy increases continually on aging, the point defects play\nactive role throughout the aging duration. The near-atomic resolution of APT\nand self-seeking ability of positrons towards point defects make this analysis\npossible. The difference of positron affinities between Fe and Cr enables\nidentification of the Cr-rich nano-phases that are specifically associated with\ndefects; they would otherwise be indiscernible in the absence of defect. Thus,\nthe temporal evolution of Cr-rich nano-phase along with the associated point\ndefects can be fully characterized at each stage of aging using APT and PAS,\nrespectively. The combined APT-PAS study shows that Cr-rich alpha-prime\nprecipitation is preceded by vacancy-Cr complexes that act as nucleation sites\nfor Cr clusters, which in turn, cause an early rise in micro-hardness due to\ncluster hardening.

Despite increasingly stronger variants with\never-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model\nsize. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and\nhierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into\nrecent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource\nrequirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop\nlight ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a\nperformance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied\ndirection we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for\nthe first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best\nlight-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency.\nThis is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local\n(LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of\nself-attention and convolutions.

In this scenario the momentum distribution of\nthe produced DM particles is usually taken to be the one obtained at reheating,\nred-shifted at later times due to the expansion of the Universe. However, since\nin such a scenario both the DM and the standard model (SM) fields couple to the\ninflaton, the DM particles necessarily undergo self-scatterings, as well as\nelastic and inelastic scattering reactions with the SM bath, all of which\nproceed through $s-$channel or $t-$channel inflaton exchange. We compute the\nmomentum distribution of the DM particles including the effect of these\nscatterings, and find that the distributions can be significantly altered, even\nthough DM remains non-thermal throughout the cosmological evolution. We observe\nthat if the inflaton dominantly couples to the SM Higgs boson through a\nrenormalizable interaction, then reheating temperatures and inflaton masses at\nthe TeV scale lead to a large effect from the scattering processes, with the\nDM-inflaton coupling constrained by the DM density. The scattering effects are\nfound to be sensitive to the duration of the reheating process -- larger the\nduration, more momentum modes are filled at reheating, leading to an enhanced\nscattering probability. We also obtain the free-streaming length of such DM\nusing the resulting non-thermal momentum distribution, which can be used to\nestimate the implications of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ constraints on the DM mass. It\nis observed that in the scenarios considered, including the scattering effects\ncan reduce the DM average velocity at matter-radiation equality, and its\nfree-streaming length, by upto a factor of $40$, thereby making the constraints\non light DM produced in inflaton decay significantly weaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 18:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 10:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Digital line segments are particularly important as\nother digital objects depend on their definition (e.g., digital convex objects\nor digital star-shaped objects). It may be desirable for the digital line\nsegment systems to satisfy some nice properties that their Euclidean\ncounterparts also satisfy. The system is a consistent digital line segment\nsystem (CDS) if it satisfies five properties, most notably the subsegment\nproperty (the intersection of any two digital line segments should be\nconnected) and the prolongation property (any digital line segment should be\nable to be extended into a digital line). It is known that any CDS must have\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ Hausdorff distance to their Euclidean counterparts, where $n$\nis the number of grid points on a segment. In fact this lower bound even\napplies to consistent digital rays (CDR) where for a fixed $p \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$, we consider the digital segments from $p$ to $q$ for each $q \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$.

Image blurring is caused by several factors.\nAdditionally, during the image acquisition process, noise may get added to the\nimage. Such a noisy and blurred image can be represented as the image resulting\nfrom the convolution of the original image with the associated point spread\nfunction, along with additive noise. However, the blurred image often contains\ninadequate information to uniquely determine the plausible original image.\nBased on the availability of blurring information, image deblurring methods can\nbe classified as blind and non-blind. In non-blind image deblurring, some prior\ninformation is known regarding the corresponding point spread function and the\nadded noise. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of\nnon-blind image deblurring methods with respect to the identification and\nelimination of noise present in blurred images. In this study, three non-blind\nimage deblurring methods, namely Wiener deconvolution, Lucy-Richardson\ndeconvolution, and regularized deconvolution were comparatively analyzed for\nnoisy images featuring salt-and-pepper noise. Two types of blurring effects\nwere simulated, namely motion blurring and Gaussian blurring. The said three\nnon-blind deblurring methods were applied under two scenarios: direct\ndeblurring of noisy blurred images and deblurring of images after denoising\nthrough the application of the adaptive median filter. The obtained results\nwere then compared for each scenario to determine the best approach for\ndeblurring noisy images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 20:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

We compute stellar evolution models with rotation\nand model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant\ndiffusive process parametrized by an additional viscosity.

For red giants in the hydrogen shell-burning phase the transport\nof angular momentum must be more efficient in more massive stars. The\nadditional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude\nin the mass range M $\\sim$ 1 - 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$. As stars evolve along the red\ngiant branch, the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum must\nincrease for low-mass stars (M $\\lesssim$ 2 M$_{\\odot}$) and remain\napproximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M$_{\\odot}$ $\\lesssim$ M\n$\\lesssim$ 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$).

Research has shown that deep neural\nnets make confident mispredictions on OoD inputs. Therefore, it is critical to\nidentify OoD inputs for safe and reliable deployment of deep neural nets. Often\na threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such\nsimilarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent\nrepresentation with the mean class representation. Angular similarity encodes\nuncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain\nthat the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different\nclasses have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying\na single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score\nrepresents different uncertainties for different classes.

A number of solutions to handling GC$\\times$GC-TOFMS data\nhave been proposed: these involve reshaping the data to make it amenable to\neither 2nd order decomposition techniques based on Multivariate Curve\nResolution (MCR), or 3rd order decomposition techniques such as Parallel Factor\nAnalysis 2 (PARAFAC2). PARAFAC2 has been utilised to model chromatographic\ndrift along one mode, which has enabled its use for robust decomposition of\nmultiple GC-MS experiments. Although extensible, it is not straightforward to\nimplement a PARAFAC2 model that accounts for drift along multiple modes. In\nthis submission, we demonstrate a new approach and a general theory for\nmodelling data with drift along multiple modes, for applications in\nmultidimensional chromatography with multivariate detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 23:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Recently, a new\ncomputational strategy for iterative methods called ARCHITECT was proposed by\nLi et al. in [1] that uses the redundant number representation to create\n\"stable digits\" in the Most-significant Digits (MSDs) of an iterate, allowing\nthe future iterations to assume the stable MSDs have not changed their value,\neliminating the need to recompute them. In this work, we present a theoretical\nanalysis of how these \"stable digits\" arise in iterative methods by showing\nthat a Fejer monotone sequence in the redundant number representation can\ndevelop stable MSDs in the elements of the sequence as the sequence grows in\nlength. This property of Fejer monotone sequences allows us to expand the class\nof iterative methods known to have MSD stability when using the redundant\nnumber representation to include any fixed-point iteration of a contractive\nLipschitz continuous function.

The mappings from\ncurrent to voltage can be described by several kinds of models, such as\naccurate but inefficient physics-based models, and efficient but sometimes\ninaccurate equivalent circuit and black-box models. To realize accuracy and\nefficiency simultaneously in battery modeling, we propose to build a\ndata-driven surrogate for a battery system while incorporating the underlying\nphysics as constraints. In this work, we innovatively treat the functional\nmapping from current curve to terminal voltage as a composite of operators,\nwhich is approximated by the powerful deep operator network (DeepONet). Its\nlearning capability is firstly verified through a predictive test for Li-ion\nconcentration at two electrodes. In this experiment, the physics-informed\nDeepONet is found to be more robust than the purely data-driven DeepONet,\nespecially in temporal extrapolation scenarios. A composite surrogate is then\nconstructed for mapping current curve and solid diffusivity to terminal voltage\nwith three operator networks, in which two parallel physics-informed DeepONets\nare firstly used to predict Li-ion concentration at two electrodes, and then\nbased on their surface values, a DeepONet is built to give terminal voltage\npredictions.

In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task\ncoded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on\nthe paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured\nby arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the\nabsence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we\npropose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named\nDual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target\ndomain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the\nDomain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model\ntraining even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA\nfacilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for\ntwo LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial\nAdaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA\ntogether improve the model transferability from the source domain to the\ntarget.

Due to the extensive bandwidth and the\nhuge number of antennas for wideband XL-MIMO, a significant near-field beam\nsplit effect will be induced, where beams at different frequencies are focused\non different locations. The near-field beam split effect results in a severe\narray gain loss, so existing works mainly focus on compensating for this loss\nby utilizing the time delay (TD) beamformer. By contrast, this paper\ndemonstrates that although the near-field beam split effect degrades the array\ngain, it also provides a new possibility to realize fast near-field beam\ntraining. Specifically, we first reveal the mechanism of the near-field\ncontrollable beam split effect. This effect indicates that, by dedicatedly\ndesigning the delay parameters, a TD beamformer is able to control the degree\nof the near-field beam split effect, i.e., beams at different frequencies can\nflexibly occupy the desired location range. Due to the similarity with the\ndispersion of natural light caused by a prism, this effect is also termed as\nthe near-field rainbow in this paper. Then, taking advantage of the near-field\nrainbow effect, a fast wideband beam training scheme is proposed. In our\nscheme, the close form of the beamforming vector is elaborately derived to\nenable beams at different frequencies to be focused on different desired\nlocations. By this means, the optimal beamforming vector with the largest array\ngain can be rapidly searched out by generating multiple beams focused on\nmultiple locations simultaneously through only one radio-frequency (RF) chain.\nFinally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme is able to realize\nnear-optimal nearfield beam training with a very low training overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 04:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

Then, the corresponding countermeasures and performance\nmetrics are given to illustrate how to preserve the control mechanism secrecy.\nNecessary conditions are derived to guide the secrecy design. Finally, thorough\ndiscussions on the control laws and open issues are presented, beckoning future\ninvestigation on reliable countermeasure design and tradeoffs between the\nsecrecy and control performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 05:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Computing the beamforming filter requires\nestimating spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of the source and noise signals.\nTime-frequency masks are often used to compute these SCMs. Most studies of\nmask-based beamforming have assumed that the sources do not move. However,\nsources often move in practice, which causes performance degradation. In this\npaper, we address the problem of mask-based beamforming for moving sources. We\nfirst review classical approaches to tracking a moving source, which perform\nonline or blockwise computation of the SCMs. We show that these approaches can\nbe interpreted as computing a sum of instantaneous SCMs weighted by attention\nweights. These weights indicate which time frames of the signal to consider in\nthe SCM computation. Online or blockwise computation assumes a heuristic and\ndeterministic way of computing these attention weights that, although simple,\nmay not result in optimal performance. We thus introduce a learning-based\nframework that computes optimal attention weights for beamforming. We achieve\nthis using a neural network implemented with self-attention layers.

In order to stay up\nwith time, various performance-oriented programming languages provide a\nmultitude of constructs to allow programmers to write parallelizable loops.\nCorrespondingly, researchers have developed techniques to automatically\nparallelize loops that do not carry dependences across iterations, and/or call\npure functions.

We have also added runtime support in TornadoVM to use\nstatic analysis results for loop parallelization. Our evaluation over several\nstandard parallelization kernels shows that AutoTornado correctly parallelizes\n61.3% of manually parallelizable loops, with an efficient static analysis and a\nnear-zero runtime overhead.

The change of the excitation spectrum\nat the critical point is obtained in both cases of open and periodic boundary\nconditions in the presence of vortices.

Unfortunately, due to the near-field effect, most of\nthe existing XL-MIMO channel models fail to describe mixed line-of-sight (LoS)\nand non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path components simultaneously.

In the\nbin packing problem, we are given n items with sizes in (0,1] and the goal is\nto pack them into the minimum number of unit-sized bins. First, we study bin\npacking under the i.i.d. model, where item sizes are sampled independently and\nidentically from a distribution in (0,1]. Both the distribution and the total\nnumber of items are unknown. The items arrive one by one and their sizes are\nrevealed upon their arrival and they must be packed immediately and irrevocably\nin bins of size 1. We provide a simple meta-algorithm that takes an offline\n$\\alpha$-asymptotic approximation algorithm and provides a polynomial-time\n$(\\alpha + \\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under the\ni.i.d. model, where $\\varepsilon$>0 is a small constant. Using the AFPTAS for\noffline bin packing, we thus provide a linear time\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under i.i.d.\nmodel, thus settling the problem.\n  We then study the random-order model, where an adversary specifies the items,\nbut the order of arrival of items is drawn uniformly at random from the set of\nall permutations of the items.

However, it is fragile because of two inherent defects,\ni.e, boundary effect and filter corruption. Some methods by enlarging the\nsearch area can mitigate the boundary effect, yet introducing the undesired\nbackground distractors. Another approaches can alleviate the temporal\ndegeneration of learned filters by introducing the temporal regularizer, which\ndepends on the assumption that the filers between consecutive frames should be\ncoherent. In fact, sometimes the filers at the ($t-1$)th frame is vulnerable to\nheavy occlusion from backgrounds, which causes that the assumption does not\nhold. To handle them, in this work, we propose a novel $\\ell_{1}$\nregularization correlation filter with adaptive contextual learning and\nkeyfilter selection for UAV tracking. Firstly, we adaptively detect the\npositions of effective contextual distractors by the aid of the distribution of\nlocal maximum values on the response map of current frame which is generated by\nusing the previous correlation filter model. Next, we eliminate inconsistent\nlabels for the tracked target by removing one on each distractor and develop a\nnew score scheme for each distractor. Then, we can select the keyfilter from\nthe filters pool by finding the maximal similarity between the target at the\ncurrent frame and the target template corresponding to each filter in the\nfilters pool. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments on three\nauthoritative UAV datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art tracking methods based on correlation filter framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 10:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 01:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Specifically, we utilize 1.) label\nquantity distribution for modifying the objective loss function to a\nclass-aware weighted form and 2.) label position distribution for constructing\na cropping probability mask to crop more sub-volumes in cartilage areas from\nboth labeled and unlabeled inputs. In addition, we design dual\nuncertainty-aware sampling supervision to enhance the supervision of\nlow-confident categories for efficient unsupervised learning. Experiments show\nthat our proposed framework brings significant improvements by incorporating\nthe unlabeled data and alleviating the problem of class imbalance. More\nimportantly, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods,\ndemonstrating the potential of our framework for the more challenging SSL\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 12:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Although manual picking can produce accurate normal\nmoveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is\ntime-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of\nseismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been\ndeveloped. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good\nresults on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).\nUnfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate\naccurate velocities in the situations of low SNR. In this paper, we propose a\nmulti-information fusion network (MIFN) to estimate stacking velocity from the\nfusion information of velocity spectra and stack gather segments (SGS). In\nparticular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic\nsegmentation problem based on the velocity spectrum images. Meanwhile, the\ninformation provided by SGS is used as a prior in the network to assist\nsegmentation. The experimental results on two field datasets show that the\npicking results of MIFN are stable and accurate for the scenarios with medium\nand high SNR, and it also performs well in low SNR scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 12:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

For example, sparse\ninference in the representations learned in the high-dimensional intermediary\nlayers of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires an iterative minimization to be\nperformed at each training step. As such, recent, quick methods in variational\ninference have been proposed to infer sparse codes by learning a distribution\nover the codes with a DNN. In this work, we propose a new approach to\nvariational sparse coding that allows us to learn sparse distributions by\nthresholding samples, avoiding the use of problematic relaxations.

In many applications standard local models are not sufficient to\naccurately account for certain non-local phenomena such as, e.g., interactions\nat a distance. In order to properly capture these phenomena non-local nonlinear\nPDE models are frequently employed in the literature. In this article we\npropose two numerical methods based on machine learning and on Picard\niterations, respectively, to approximately solve non-local nonlinear PDEs. The\nproposed machine learning-based method is an extended variant of a deep\nlearning-based splitting-up type approximation method previously introduced in\nthe literature and utilizes neural networks to provide approximate solutions on\na subset of the spatial domain of the solution. The Picard iterations-based\nmethod is an extended variant of the so-called full history recursive\nmultilevel Picard approximation scheme previously introduced in the literature\nand provides an approximate solution for a single point of the domain. Both\nmethods are mesh-free and allow non-local nonlinear PDEs with Neumann boundary\nconditions to be solved in high dimensions. In the two methods, the numerical\ndifficulties arising due to the dimensionality of the PDEs are avoided by (i)\nusing the correspondence between the expected trajectory of reflected\nstochastic processes and the solution of PDEs (given by the Feynman-Kac\nformula) and by (ii) using a plain vanilla Monte Carlo integration to handle\nthe non-local term. We evaluate the performance of the two methods on five\ndifferent PDEs arising in physics and biology. In all cases, the methods yield\ngood results in up to 10 dimensions with short run times.

This uncertainty arises in\npart from the difficulty in measuring the vertical distributions of aerosols,\nand only sporadic vertically resolved observations are available. We often have\nto settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol\noptical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical\ndisaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, i.e. the measure of light\nextinction throughout an atmospheric column, using readily available vertically\nresolved meteorological predictors such as temperature, pressure or relative\nhumidity. Using Bayesian nonparametric modelling, we devise a simple Gaussian\nprocess prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD\nobservations to infer a distribution over vertical extinction profiles. To\nvalidate our approach, we use ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data which offers\nself-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD and extinction\nprofiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to\nreconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty,\noutperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is\ntypically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model\ndemonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from\naerosol water uptake in the boundary layer.

The $f(Q)$ modified theory of\ngravity is an alternative theory to General Relativity, where the non-metricity\nscalar $Q$ is the responsible candidate for gravitational interactions. In the\npresent work we consider a Friedmann-Lem\\^aitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological\nmodel dominated by bulk viscous cosmic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity with the\nfunctional form $f(Q)=\\alpha Q^n$, where $\\alpha$ and $n$ are free parameters\nof the model. We constrain our model with the recent Pantheon supernovae data\nset of 1048 data points, Hubble data set of 31 data points and baryon acoustic\noscillations data set consisting of six points. For higher values of redshift,\nit is clear that the $f(Q)$ cosmology better fits data than standard cosmology.\nWe present the evolution of our deceleration parameter with redshift and it\nproperly predicts a transition from decelerated to accelerated phases of the\nuniverse expansion. Also, we present the evolution of density, bulk viscous\npressure and the effective equation of state parameter with redshift. Those\nshow that bulk viscosity in a cosmic fluid is a valid candidate to acquire the\nnegative pressure to drive the cosmic expansion efficiently.We also examine the\nbehavior of different energy conditions to test the viability of our\ncosmological $f(Q)$ model. Furthermore, the statefinder diagnostics are also\ninvestigated in order to distinguish among different dark energy models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 06:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Today's cloud brokers attempt\nto insulate consumers from the vagaries of multiple clouds. To achieve the\ninsulation, the modern cloud broker needs to disguise itself as the\nend-provider to consumers by creating and operating a virtual data center\nconstruct that we call a meta-cloud, which is assembled on top of a set of\nparticipating supplier clouds. It is crucial for such a cloud broker to be\nconsidered a trusted partner both by cloud consumers and by the underpinning\ncloud suppliers. A fundamental tenet of brokerage trust is vendor neutrality.\nOn the one hand, cloud consumers will be comfortable if a cloud broker\nguarantees that they will not be led through a preferred path. And on the other\nhand, cloud suppliers would be more interested in partnering with a cloud\nbroker who promises a fair apportioning of client provisioning requests.\nBecause consumer and supplier trust on a meta-cloud broker stems from the\nassumption of being agnostic to supplier clouds, there is a need for a test\nstrategy that verifies the fairness of cloud brokerage. In this paper, we\npropose a calculus of fairness that defines the rules to determine the\noperational behavior of a cloud broker. The calculus uses temporal logic to\nmodel the fact that fairness is a trait that has to be ascertained over time;\nit is not a characteristic that can be judged at a per-request fulfillment\nlevel. Using our temporal calculus of fairness as the basis, we propose an\nalgorithm to determine the fairness of a broker probabilistically, based on its\nobserved request apportioning policies. Our model for the fairness of cloud\nbroker behavior also factors in inter-provider variables such as cost\ndivergence and capacity variance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 13:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The bosons tend to oscillate at their\nplasma frequency, but are also subjected to electrostatic forces which keep\nthem confined close to lattice sites and cause a frequency shift in the\noscillation. Under certain conditions on these frequencies, we find that a\nsuitably defined set of coherent states (coherent both in the field and matter\ndegrees of freedom) exhibit a negative energy gap with respect to the\nperturbative ground state. This is true in the RWA approximation and for\nposition-independent fields, both to first and second order in the interaction\nHamiltonian. We compare this result with other recent findings from cavity QED\nand notice that: (1) consideration of full 3D wavefunctions and a careful\ndefinition of the coherent states are essential for obtaining the energy gap;\n(2) although our calculation is referred to bosons, it may also apply to\nprotons bound in a crystal matrix, if their density is very low compared to the\ndensity of available states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 20:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 21:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 20:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}
