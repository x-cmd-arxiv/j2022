Phys. {\\bf 125} 67--97 (1980), we discussed the elasticity theory\ndescribed in terms of the gravitational field variables -- the elasticity\nvielbein $E_\\mu^a$. They come from the phase fields, which describe the\ndeformations of crystal. The important property of the elasticity vielbein\n$E^a_\\mu$ is that in general they are not the square mstrices. While the\nspacetime index $\\mu$ takes the values $\\mu=(0,1,2,3)$, in crystals the index\n$a=(1,2,3)$, in vortex lattices $a=(1,2)$, and in smectic liquid crystals there\nis only one phase field, $a=1$. These phase fields can be considered as the\nspin gauge fields, which are similar to the gauge fields in Standard Model (SM)\nor in Grand Unification (GUT).\n  On the other hand, the rectangular vielbein $e^\\mu_a$ may emerge in the\nvicinity of Dirac points in Dirac materials. In particular, in the planar phase\nof the spin-triplet superfluid $^3$He the spacetime index $\\mu=(0,1,2,3)$,\nwhile the spin index $a$ takes values $a=(0,1,2,3,4)$. Although these $(4\n\\times 5)$ vielbein describing the Dirac fermions are rectangular, the\neffective metric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$of Dirac quasiparticles remains (3+1)-dimensional.\nAll this suggests the possible extension of the Einstein-Cartan gravity by\nintroducing the rectangular vielbein, where the spin fields belong to the\nhigher groups, which may include SM or even GUT groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 16:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

However, due to the advancement of camera technology,\n3D point cloud data has become more available than ever, which warrants\nconsidering FSCIL on 3D data. This paper addresses FSCIL in the 3D domain. In\naddition to well-known issues of catastrophic forgetting of past knowledge and\noverfitting of few-shot data, 3D FSCIL can bring newer challenges. For example,\nbase classes may contain many synthetic instances in a realistic scenario.

Across various\ndomains, corresponding methods have proven effective and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, pseudo-labels typically stem from ad-hoc\nheuristics, relying on the quality of the predictions though without\nguaranteeing their validity. One such method, so-called credal self-supervised\nlearning, maintains pseudo-supervision in the form of sets of (instead of\nsingle) probability distributions over labels, thereby allowing for a flexible\nyet uncertainty-aware labeling. Again, however, there is no justification\nbeyond empirical effectiveness. To address this deficiency, we make use of\nconformal prediction, an approach that comes with guarantees on the validity of\nset-valued predictions. As a result, the construction of credal sets of labels\nis supported by a rigorous theoretical foundation, leading to better calibrated\nand less error-prone supervision for unlabeled data. Along with this, we\npresent effective algorithms for learning from credal self-supervision. An\nempirical study demonstrates excellent calibration properties of the\npseudo-supervision, as well as the competitiveness of our method on several\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 16:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Learning optimal\npolicies using reinforcement learning in a multi-agent setting can be very\ndifficult as the number of agents increases. Recent solutions such as Value\nDecomposition Networks (VDN), QMIX, QTRAN and QPLEX adhere to the centralized\ntraining and decentralized execution scheme and perform factorization of the\njoint action-value functions. However, these methods still suffer from\nincreased environmental complexity, and at times fail to converge in a stable\nmanner. We propose a novel concept of Residual Q-Networks (RQNs) for MARL,\nwhich learns to transform the individual Q-value trajectories in a way that\npreserves the Individual-Global-Max criteria (IGM), but is more robust in\nfactorizing action-value functions. The RQN acts as an auxiliary network that\naccelerates convergence and will become obsolete as the agents reach the\ntraining objectives. The performance of the proposed method is compared against\nseveral state-of-the-art techniques such as QPLEX, QMIX, QTRAN and VDN, in a\nrange of multi-agent cooperative tasks. The results illustrate that the\nproposed method, in general, converges faster, with increased stability and\nshows robust performance in a wider family of environments.

On near-term hardware the crucial constraint on these simulations is\ncircuit depth. Many quantum simulation algorithms rely on a layer of unitary\nevolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears in\ntime-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers\nunder the Hamiltonian variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a\nnew quantum algorithm design for materials modelling where the depth of a layer\nis independent of the system size. This design takes advantage of the locality\nof materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding\nthat preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and\npresent a compiler that transforms density functional theory data into quantum\ncircuit instructions -- connecting the physics of the material to the\nsimulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple\nlevels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of\nthe specific target material. We present numerical results for materials\nspanning a wide structural and technological range. Our results demonstrate a\nreduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard prior\nmethods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian. For example our\nresults improve resource requirements for Strontium Vanadate (SrVO$_3$) from\n864 to 180 qubits for a $3\\times3\\times3$ lattice, and the circuit depth of a\nsingle Trotter or variational layer from $7.5\\times 10^8$ to depth $884$.\nAlthough this is still beyond current hardware, our results show that materials\nsimulation may be feasible on quantum computers without necessarily requiring\nscalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, provided quantum algorithm design\nincorporates understanding of the materials and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 17:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 18:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

In the context of Java programs, a number of approaches exist for\nbuilding behavioural models. Most of these approaches rely on the analysis of\nthe compiled bytecode. Instead, we are looking to extract behavioural models in\nthe form of Finite State Machines (FSMs) from the Java source code to ensure\nthat the obtained FSMs can be easily understood by the software developers and,\nif necessary, updated or integrated into the original source code, e.g. in the\nform of annotations.

The ridge of this dimple, with increasing indentation,\neventually buckles into a polygonal shape. The polygon order generally\ncontinues to increase with further indentation. In the case of spherical\nshells, both the underlying axisymmetric deformation and the buckling evolution\nhave been studied in detail. However, little is known about the behaviour of\ngeneral geometries. In this work we describe the geometrical and mechanical\nfeatures of the axisymmetric ridge that forms in indented general shells of\nrevolution with non-negative Gaussian curvature and the conditions for\ncircumferential buckling of this ridge. We show that, under the assumption of\n`mirror buckling' a single unified description of this ridge can be written if\nthe problem is non-dimensionalised using the local slope of the undeformed\nshell mid-profile at the ridge radial location. In dimensional form the ridge\nproperties evolve in quite different ways for different mid-profiles. Focusing\non the indentation of shallow shells of revolution with constant Gaussian\ncurvature, we use our theoretical framework to study the properties of the\nridge at the circumferential buckling threshold and evaluate the validity of\nthe mirror buckling assumption against a linear stability analysis on the\nshallow shell equations, showing very good agreement. Our results highlight\nthat circumferential buckling in indented thin shells is controlled by a\ncomplex interplay between the geometry and the stress state in the ridge. The\nresults of our study will provide greater insight into the mechanics of thin\nshells. This could enable indentation to be used to measure the mechanical\nproperties of a wide range of shell geometries or used to design shells with\nspecific mechanical behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 17:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

NMT\nmodels are often unable to translate idioms accurately and over-generate\ncompositional, literal translations. In this work, we investigate whether the\nnon-compositionality of idioms is reflected in the mechanics of the dominant\nNMT model, Transformer, by analysing the hidden states and attention patterns\nfor models with English as source language and one of seven European languages\nas target language. When Transformer emits a non-literal translation - i.e.\nidentifies the expression as idiomatic - the encoder processes idioms more\nstrongly as single lexical units compared to literal expressions. This\nmanifests in idioms' parts being grouped through attention and in reduced\ninteraction between idioms and their context. In the decoder's cross-attention,\nfigurative inputs result in reduced attention on source-side tokens.

Along the way, we interpret the vanishing of the global\ngauge and ABJ anomalies, which are anomalies not captured by local anomaly\npolynomials, as the requirement that gauge monopole operators and mixed\nmonopole operators for 0-form and gauge symmetries have non-fractional integer\ncharges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In the cosmological context, we\ninvestigate a criterion proposed by Witten (based on works of Kontsevich &\nSegal and of Louko & Sorkin) to decide whether a complex metric is allowable or\nnot. Because of the freedom to deform complex metrics using Cauchy's theorem,\ndeciding whether a metric is allowable in general requires solving a\ncomplicated optimisation problem. We describe a method that allows one to\nquickly determine the allowability of minisuperspace metrics. This enables us\nto study the off-shell structure of minisuperspace path integrals, which we\ninvestigate for various boundary conditions. Classical transitions always\nreside on the boundary of the domain of allowable metrics, and care must be\ntaken in defining appropriate integration contours for the corresponding\ngravitational path integral.

To better appraise\nthe radiobiological effects from GRID, a framework to link local radiation dose\nto clonogenic survival needs to be developed. A549 (lung) cancer cells were\nirradiated in T25 cm$^2$ flasks using 220 kV X-rays with an open field or\nthrough a tungsten GRID collimator with periodical 5 mm openings and 10 mm\nblockings.

Fitting the linear-quadratic (LQ)\nfunction to clonogenic survival data for open field irradiation, the expected\nsurvival level at a given dose level was calculated. The expected survival\nlevel was then mapped together with the observed levels in the GRID-irradiated\nflasks.

As a consequence, waves\noriginating from consecutive shots are entangled within the seismic recordings,\nyielding so-called blended data. For processing and imaging purposes, the data\ngenerated by each individual shot must be retrieved. This process, called\ndeblending, is achieved by solving an inverse problem which is heavily\nunderdetermined. Conventional approaches rely on transformations that render\nthe blending noise into burst-like noise, whilst preserving the signal of\ninterest. Compressed sensing type regularization is then applied, where\nsparsity in some domain is assumed for the signal of interest. The domain of\nchoice depends on the geometry of the acquisition and the properties of seismic\ndata within the chosen domain. In this work, we introduce a new concept that\nconsists of embedding a self-supervised denoising network into the\nPlug-and-Play (PnP) framework. A novel network is introduced whose design\nextends the blind-spot network architecture of [28 ] for partially coherent\nnoise (i.e., correlated in time). The network is then trained directly on the\nnoisy input data at each step of the PnP algorithm. By leveraging both the\nunderlying physics of the problem and the great denoising capabilities of our\nblind-spot network, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an\nindustry-standard method whilst being comparable in terms of computational\ncost. Moreover, being independent on the acquisition geometry, our method can\nbe easily applied to both marine and land data without any significant\nmodification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 19:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Although many reward\nfunctions induce the same optimal behavior (Ng et al., 1999), in practice, some\nof them result in faster learning than others. In this paper, we look at how\nreward-design choices impact learning speed and seek to identify principles of\ngood reward design that quickly induce target behavior. This\nreward-identification problem is framed as an optimization problem: Firstly, we\nadvocate choosing state-based rewards that maximize the action gap, making\noptimal actions easy to distinguish from suboptimal ones. Secondly, we propose\nminimizing a measure of the horizon, something we call the \"subjective\ndiscount\", over which rewards need to be optimized to encourage agents to make\noptimal decisions with less lookahead. To solve this optimization problem, we\npropose a linear-programming based algorithm that efficiently finds a reward\nfunction that maximizes action gap and minimizes subjective discount. We test\nthe rewards generated with the algorithm in tabular environments with\nQ-Learning, and empirically show they lead to faster learning. Although we only\nfocus on Q-Learning because it is perhaps the simplest and most well understood\nRL algorithm, preliminary results with R-max (Brafman and Tennenholtz, 2000)\nsuggest our results are much more general. Our experiments support three\nprinciples of reward design: 1) consistent with existing results, penalizing\neach step taken induces faster learning than rewarding the goal. 2) When\nrewarding subgoals along the target trajectory, rewards should gradually\nincrease as the goal gets closer. 3) Dense reward that's nonzero on every state\nis only good if designed carefully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 19:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In this paper we present Gator, a\nchannel-pruning method which temporarily adds learned gating mechanisms for\npruning of individual channels, and which is trained with an additional\nauxiliary loss, aimed at reducing the computational cost due to memory,\n(theoretical) speedup (in terms of FLOPs), and practical, hardware-specific\nspeedup. Gator introduces a new formulation of dependencies between NN layers\nwhich, in contrast to most previous methods, enables pruning of non-sequential\nparts, such as layers on ResNet's highway, and even removing entire ResNet\nblocks. Gator's pruning for ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet produces\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results, such as 50% FLOPs reduction with only\n0.4%-drop in top-5 accuracy. Also, Gator outperforms previous pruning models,\nin terms of GPU latency by running 1.4 times faster.

Alarm fatigue can occur if the sampling\nrate is high (say, once a millisecond) and the control chart is calibrated to\nan average in-control run length ($ARL_0$) of 200 or 370 which is often done in\nthe literature. As alarm fatigue may not just be annoyance but result in\ndetrimental effects to the quality of the product, control chart designers\nshould seek to minimize the false alarm rate. Unfortunately, reducing the false\nalarm rate typically comes at the cost of detection delay or average\nout-of-control run length ($ARL_1$).

However, the\ndominant paradigm in game theory (GT) assumes that agents are not affected by\nrisk from other agents and only strive to maximise their expected utility. For\nexample, in hybrid human-AI driving systems, it is necessary to limit large\ndeviations in reward resulting from car crashes. Although there are equilibrium\nconcepts in game theory that take into account risk aversion, they either\nassume that agents are risk-neutral with respect to the uncertainty caused by\nthe actions of other agents, or they are not guaranteed to exist. We introduce\na new GT-based Risk-Averse Equilibrium (RAE) that always produces a solution\nthat minimises the potential variance in reward accounting for the strategy of\nother agents. Theoretically and empirically, we show RAE shares many properties\nwith a Nash Equilibrium (NE), establishing convergence properties and\ngeneralising to risk-dominant NE in certain cases.

In these tasks,\nfeature map representations of the human structural information are often\nextracted first from the image by a CNN (such as HRNet), and then further\nprocessed by transformer to predict the heatmaps (encodes each joint's location\ninto a feature map with a Gaussian distribution) for HPE or HMR.

During the tracking process,\nthe system assigns an identifier or label to each tracked object to distinguish\nit from other objects. In such a mission, it is essential to keep this\nidentifier for the same objects, whatever the area, the time of their\nappearance, or the detecting camera. This is to conserve as much information\nabout the tracking object as possible, decrease the number of ID switching\n(ID-Sw), and increase the quality of object tracking. To accomplish object\nlabeling, a massive amount of data collected by the cameras must be searched to\nretrieve the most similar (nearest neighbor) object identifier. Although this\ntask is simple, it becomes very complex in large-scale video surveillance\nnetworks, where the data becomes very large. In this case, the label retrieval\ntime increases significantly with this increase, which negatively affects the\nperformance of the real-time tracking system. To avoid such problems, we\npropose a new solution to automatically label multiple objects for efficient\nreal-time tracking using the indexing mechanism. This mechanism organizes the\nmetadata of the objects extracted during the detection and tracking phase in an\nAdaptive BCCF-tree. The main advantage of this structure is: its ability to\nindex massive metadata generated by multi-cameras, its logarithmic search\ncomplexity, which implicitly reduces the search response time, and its quality\nof research results, which ensure coherent labeling of the tracked objects. The\nsystem load is distributed through a new Internet of Video Things\ninfrastructure-based architecture to improve data processing and real-time\nobject tracking performance.

However, CBMs are restrictive in practice as\nthey require dense concept annotations in the training data to learn the\nbottleneck. Moreover, CBMs often do not match the accuracy of an unrestricted\nneural network, reducing the incentive to deploy them in practice. In this\nwork, we address these limitations of CBMs by introducing Post-hoc Concept\nBottleneck models (PCBMs).

PCBM allows for global model edits, which can be more efficient\nthan previous works on local interventions that fix a specific prediction.\nThrough a model-editing user study, we show that editing PCBMs via\nconcept-level feedback can provide significant performance gains without using\ndata from the target domain or model retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 00:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 22:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel solution named TransSTAM, which leverages Transformer to\neffectively model both the appearance features of each object and the\nspatial-temporal relationships among objects. TransSTAM consists of two major\nparts: (1) The encoder utilizes the powerful self-attention mechanism of\nTransformer to learn discriminative features for each tracklet; (2) The decoder\nadopts the standard cross-attention mechanism to model the affinities between\nthe tracklets and the detections by taking both spatial-temporal and appearance\nfeatures into account.

Intelligent robotic systems today are highly connected systems\nthat rely on DL for a variety of perception, control, and other tasks.

From the\nperspective of collaborative learning, federated learning (FL) enables\ncontinuous training of models in a distributed, privacy-preserving way.

Most\nexisting VLN agents learn the instruction-path data directly and cannot\nsufficiently explore action-level alignment knowledge inside the multi-modal\ninputs. In this paper, we propose modAlity-aligneD Action PrompTs (ADAPT),\nwhich provides the VLN agent with action prompts to enable the explicit\nlearning of action-level modality alignment to pursue successful navigation.\nSpecifically, an action prompt is defined as a modality-aligned pair of an\nimage sub-prompt and a text sub-prompt, where the former is a single-view\nobservation and the latter is a phrase like ''walk past the chair''. When\nstarting navigation, the instruction-related action prompt set is retrieved\nfrom a pre-built action prompt base and passed through a prompt encoder to\nobtain the prompt feature. Then the prompt feature is concatenated with the\noriginal instruction feature and fed to a multi-layer transformer for action\nprediction. To collect high-quality action prompts into the prompt base, we use\nthe Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model which has powerful\ncross-modality alignment ability. A modality alignment loss and a sequential\nconsistency loss are further introduced to enhance the alignment of the action\nprompt and enforce the agent to focus on the related prompt sequentially.\nExperimental results on both R2R and RxR show the superiority of ADAPT over\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 02:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

The numerical approach is\nbased on density-matrix renormalization group analyses of the entanglement\nentropy and the entanglement spectrum. Whereas the entanglement entropy\nexhibits a critical behavior, the entanglement spectrum is nontrivially\ndegenerate. These entanglement properties imply that the ground state is a\ngapless topological phase. We investigate the ATS model using a quantum field\ntheory to support the numerical findings. When the frustrated interchain\ninteraction is deemed a perturbation acting on the three spin chains, the\nfrustrated interchain interaction almost isolates the second chain from the\nother two chains. However, at the same time, the second chain mediates a\nferromagnetic interaction between the first and third chains. Therefore, the\nground state of the ATS model is a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid weakly\ncoupled to a spin-1 Haldane chain with irrelevant interactions. Last but not\nleast, we show that the gapless SPT phase of the ATS model is a\nsymmetry-protected critical phase.

Specifically, we applied a framework for\nanalyzing temporal networks, in which the network structure changes over time.\nWe found that, first, even though the number of nodes and edges returned to\npre-pandemic levels around July 2021, the structure of the entire US domestic\nairline network remained altered. We also found that the network dynamics\nvaried significantly from airline to airline. Full-service carriers were less\nflexible in changing their network structure and suffered higher revenue\nlosses. On the contrary, most regional carriers completely shifted to a new\nstructure, which may have contributed to reducing their revenue losses.\nLow-cost carriers were characterized by more pronounced differences between\nairlines and drastically changed their network structure immediately after the\ndeclaration of a national emergency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 05:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 09:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

This significantly simplifies disk encryption management\nas the disk mapping does not change with encryption. On the other hand, it\nforces the encryption to be deterministic when data is being overwritten and it\ndisallows integrity mechanisms, thus lowering security guarantees. Moreover,\nbecause the most widely used standard encryption methods (like AES-XTS) work at\nsmall sub-blocks of no more than 32 bytes, deterministic overwrites form an\neven greater security risk. Overall, today's standard practice forfeits some\nsecurity for ease of management and performance considerations. This\nshortcoming is further amplified in a virtual disk setting that supports\nversioning and snapshots so that overwritten data remains accessible.\n  In this work, we address these concerns and stipulate that especially with\nvirtual disks, there is motivation and potential to improve security at the\nexpense of a small performance overhead. Specifically, adding per-sector\nmetadata to a virtual disk allows running encryption with a random\ninitialization vector (IV) as well as potentially adding integrity mechanisms.\nWe explore how best to implement additional per-sector information in Ceph RBD,\na popular open-source distributed block storage with client-side encryption.

The combinatorial explosion of possible configurations,\ntogether with the cost of hardware evaluation makes exhaustive explorations of\nthe search space infeasible in practice.

Most existing models\nemploy downsampling-based pooling, which will inevitably incur information loss\nand cannot adapt to different spherical signals and tasks. Besides, the\npreserved information after pooling cannot be well restored by the subsequent\nunpooling to characterize the desirable features for a task. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework of HS-CNNs with a lifting structure to learn adaptive\nspherical wavelets for pooling and unpooling, dubbed LiftHS-CNN, which ensures\na more efficient hierarchical feature learning for both image- and pixel-level\ntasks. Specifically, adaptive spherical wavelets are learned with a lifting\nstructure that consists of trainable lifting operators (i.e., update and\npredict operators). With this learnable lifting structure, we can adaptively\npartition a signal into two sub-bands containing low- and high-frequency\ncomponents, respectively, and thus generate a better down-scaled representation\nfor pooling by preserving more information in the low-frequency sub-band. The\nupdate and predict operators are parameterized with graph-based attention to\njointly consider the signal's characteristics and the underlying geometries. We\nfurther show that particular properties are promised by the learned wavelets,\nensuring the spatial-frequency localization for better exploiting the signal's\ncorrelation in both spatial and frequency domains. We then propose an unpooling\noperation that is invertible to the lifting-based pooling, where an inverse\nwavelet transform is performed by using the learned lifting operators to\nrestore an up-scaled representation. Extensive empirical evaluations on various\nspherical domain tasks validate the superiority of the proposed LiftHS-CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 07:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Such a dip or a fade in the intensity of OJ 287 occurred in\nNovember 2017, when its brightness was about 1.75 magnitudes lower than the\nrecent mean level. We compare the observations of this fade with similar fades\nin OJ 287 observed earlier in 1989, 1999, and 2010. It appears that there is a\nrelatively strong reddening of the B$-$V colours of OJ 287 when its V-band\nbrightness drops below magnitude 17.

Recently,\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a rendering technique that uses neural networks\nto approximate classical ray tracing, have been considered as one of the\npromising approaches for synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of images.\nWe find that NeRF can render new views while maintaining geometric consistency,\nbut it does not properly maintain skin details, such as moles and pores. These\ndetails are important particularly for faces because when we look at an image\nof a face, we are much more sensitive to details than when we look at other\nobjects.

The main motivation for studying such theories stems from the\nRandall-Sundrum model, which was formulated by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum\nback in 1999. We investigate thoroughly the physical characteristics of\nanalytic solutions which concern both black strings and five-dimensional\nlocalized black holes. To be more precise, the black-string solutions emerge in\nthe context of a five-dimensional scalar-tensor theory, where the brane\nline-element is found to describe a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime.\nThe cases of de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski branes are examined\nseparately and in great detail. As far as the five-dimensional black holes are\nconcerned, at first, we present an \"algorithm\" that one may use in order to\nconstruct from first principles the geometry of analytic and exponentially\nlocalized five-dimensional braneworld black holes. In each case, the point-like\nsingularity of the black hole lies entirely on the 3-brane, while its event\nhorizon is exponentially localized close to the 3-brane thus exhibiting a\npancake shape. In the first case, the induced line-element on the brane assumes\nthe form of the Schwarzschild solution while the bulk geometry is effectively\nAdS$_5$ outside the horizon. In the second case, the induced brane geometry is\ndescribed by the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-(A)dS line-element, where a careful\nclassification of the horizons takes place as well. In both cases, the derived\ngeometry is supported by an anisotropic fluid in the bulk described only by two\nindependent components, the energy density and tangential pressure, whereas no\nmatter needs to be introduced on the brane for its consistent embedding in the\nbulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 08:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In particular, addressing this task requires\ntackling two challenges: The transitions between the different actions must be\nsmooth; the length of the predicted motion depends on the action sequence and\nvaries significantly across samples. As we cannot realistically expect training\ndata to cover sufficiently diverse action transitions and motion lengths, we\npropose an effective training strategy consisting of combining multiple motions\nfrom different actions and introducing a weak form of supervision to encourage\nsmooth transitions. We then design a VAE-based model conditioned on both the\nobserved motion and the action label sequence, allowing us to generate multiple\nplausible future motions of varying length.

Tissue engineering and\nregenerative medicine in the nervous system have provided new alternative\nmedical approaches. These methods use external biomaterial supports, known as\nscaffolds, in order to create platforms for the cells to migrate to the injury\nsite and repair the tissue. The challenge in neural tissue engineering (NTE)\nremains the fabrication of scaffolds with precisely controlled, tunable\ntopography, biochemical cues and surface energy, capable of directing and\ncontrolling the function of neuronal cells.

As a consequence of the\nintense research activity in the field, a variety of synthetic approaches and\n3D fabrication methods have been developed for the fabrication of NTE\nscaffolds, including soft lithography and self-assembly, as well as subtractive\n(top-down) and additive (bottom-up) manufacturing.

In many real-life\nsituations, data is collected from different environments, in which the\nfunctional relations remain consistent across environments, while the\ndistribution of additive noises may vary. This paper proposes Differentiable\nInvariant Causal Discovery (DICD), utilizing the multi-environment information\nbased on a differentiable framework to avoid learning spurious edges and wrong\ncausal directions. Specifically, DICD aims to discover the\nenvironment-invariant causation while removing the environment-dependent\ncorrelation. We further formulate the constraint that enforces the target\nstructure equation model to maintain optimal across the environments.\nTheoretical guarantees for the identifiability of proposed DICD are provided\nunder mild conditions with enough environments.

However, ZDI requires experience for reliable\nresults to be reached and is based on a number of prior assumptions that may\nnot be valid, e.g., when the magnetic topology is evolving on timescales\ncomparable to or shorter than the time span over which observations are\ncollected. In this paper, we present a method based on Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) applied to circularly polarised (Stokes~$V$) line profiles of\nmagnetic stars to retrieve the main characteristics of the parent large-scale\nmagnetic topologies, like for instance, the relative strength of the poloidal\nand toroidal components, and the degree of axisymmetry of the dominant field\ncomponent and its complexity (dipolar or more complex). We show that this\nmethod can also be used to diagnose the temporal variability of the large-scale\nmagnetic field. Performing best for stars with moderate projected equatorial\nvelocities hosting relatively simple magnetic field topologies, this new method\nis simpler than ZDI, making it convenient to rapidly diagnose the main\ncharacteristics of the large-scale fields of non-degenerate stars and to\nprovide insights into the temporal evolution of the field topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 09:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Most of the classical GNNs\nsolely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the\noutput. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally\nutilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node\nfeatures via concatenating or adding them with the one-hot encodings of labels,\nwhile other methods optimize the graph structure by assuming neighboring nodes\ntend to have the same label. To bring into full play the rich information of\nlabels, in this paper, we present a label-enhanced learning framework for GNNs,\nwhich first models each label as a virtual center for intra-class nodes and\nthen jointly learns the representations of both nodes and labels. Our approach\ncould not only smooth the representations of nodes belonging to the same class,\nbut also explicitly encode the label semantics into the learning process of\nGNNs. Moreover, a training node selection technique is provided to eliminate\nthe potential label leakage issue and guarantee the model generalization\nability. Finally, an adaptive self-training strategy is proposed to iteratively\nenlarge the training set with more reliable pseudo labels and distinguish the\nimportance of each pseudo-labeled node during the model training process.\nExperimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate our\napproach can not only consistently outperform the state-of-the-arts, but also\neffectively smooth the representations of intra-class nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 09:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 14:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

Current state-of-the art approaches to\ngenerate BEV-maps employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone to\ncreate feature-maps which are passed through a spatial transformer to project\nthe derived features onto the BEV coordinate frame. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe use of vision transformers (ViT) as a backbone architecture to generate BEV\nmaps. Our network architecture, ViT-BEVSeg, employs standard vision\ntransformers to generate a multi-scale representation of the input image.

Previously proposed\ndifferentiable augmentation demonstrates improved data efficiency of training\nGANs. However, the augmentation implicitly introduces undesired invariance to\naugmentation for the discriminator since it ignores the change of semantics in\nthe label space caused by data transformation, which may limit the\nrepresentation learning ability of the discriminator and ultimately affect the\ngenerative modeling performance of the generator. To mitigate the negative\nimpact of invariance while inheriting the benefits of data augmentation, we\npropose a novel augmentation-aware self-supervised discriminator that predicts\nthe augmentation parameter of the augmented data. Particularly, the prediction\ntargets of real data and generated data are required to be distinguished since\nthey are different during training.

In parallel, modern neural\ndensity estimators, such as normalizing flows, are becoming increasingly\npopular for uncertainty quantification, especially when both parameters and\nobservations are high-dimensional. However, parameter inference is an inverse\nproblem and not a prediction task; thus, an open challenge is to construct\nconditionally valid and precise confidence regions, with a guaranteed\nprobability of covering the true parameters of the data-generating process, no\nmatter what the (unknown) parameter values are, and without relying on\nlarge-sample theory.

Several\nmethods have been proposed to successfully handle the multi-scale object\nsegmentation. However, two issues are not considered in previous studies. The\nfirst is the lack of interaction between adjacent feature levels, and this will\nlead to the deviation of high-level features from low-level features and the\nloss of detailed cues. The second is the conflict between the low-level and\nhigh-level features, this occurs because they learn different scales of\nfeatures, thereby confusing the model and decreasing the accuracy of the final\nprediction. In this paper, we propose a progressive multi-scale consistent\nnetwork (PMCNet) that integrates the proposed progressive feature fusion (PFF)\nblock and dynamic attention block (DAB) to address the aforementioned issues.\nSpecifically, PFF block progressively integrates multi-scale features from\nadjacent encoding layers, facilitating feature learning of each layer by\naggregating fine-grained details and high-level semantics. As features at\ndifferent scales should be consistent, DAB is designed to dynamically learn the\nattentive cues from the fused features at different scales, thus aiming to\nsmooth the essential conflicts existing in multi-scale features. The two\nproposed PFF and DAB blocks can be integrated with the off-the-shelf backbone\nnetworks to address the two issues of multi-scale and feature inconsistency in\nthe multi-class segmentation of fundus lesions, which will produce better\nfeature representation in the feature space. Experimental results on three\npublic datasets indicate that the proposed method is more effective than recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 12:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Despite achieving unprecedented fidelity for novel\nview synthesis in dynamic scenes, existing methods based on Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) suffer from slow convergence (i.e., model training time measured\nin days). In this paper, we present DeVRF, a novel representation to accelerate\nlearning dynamic radiance fields. The core of DeVRF is to model both the 3D\ncanonical space and 4D deformation field of a dynamic, non-rigid scene with\nexplicit and discrete voxel-based representations. However, it is quite\nchallenging to train such a representation which has a large number of model\nparameters, often resulting in overfitting issues. To overcome this challenge,\nwe devise a novel static-to-dynamic learning paradigm together with a new data\ncapture setup that is convenient to deploy in practice. This paradigm unlocks\nefficient learning of deformable radiance fields via utilizing the 3D\nvolumetric canonical space learnt from multi-view static images to ease the\nlearning of 4D voxel deformation field with only few-view dynamic sequences. To\nfurther improve the efficiency of our DeVRF and its synthesized novel view's\nquality, we conduct thorough explorations and identify a set of strategies.

One of the\nmost popular and elegant Few-Shot learning approaches is Model-Agnostic\nMeta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this method is to learn the general\nweights of the meta-model, which are further adapted to specific problems in a\nsmall number of gradient steps. However, the model's main limitation lies in\nthe fact that the update procedure is realized by gradient-based optimisation.\nIn consequence, MAML cannot always modify weights to the essential level in one\nor even a few gradient iterations. On the other hand, using many gradient steps\nresults in a complex and time-consuming optimization procedure, which is hard\nto train in practice, and may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we propose\nHyperMAML, a novel generalization of MAML, where the training of the update\nprocedure is also part of the model. Namely, in HyperMAML, instead of updating\nthe weights with gradient descent, we use for this purpose a trainable\nHypernetwork. Consequently, in this framework, the model can generate\nsignificant updates whose range is not limited to a fixed number of gradient\nsteps. Experiments show that HyperMAML consistently outperforms MAML and\nperforms comparably to other state-of-the-art techniques in a number of\nstandard Few-Shot learning benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 12:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 08:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

The main drawback of transformers is\nthat they generate formulas without numerical constants, which have to be\noptimized separately, so yielding suboptimal results. We propose a\ntransformer-based approach called SymFormer, which predicts the formula by\noutputting the individual symbols and the corresponding constants\nsimultaneously. This leads to better performance in terms of fitting the\navailable data. In addition, the constants provided by SymFormer serve as a\ngood starting point for subsequent tuning via gradient descent to further\nimprove the performance. We show on a set of benchmarks that SymFormer\noutperforms two state-of-the-art methods while having faster inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 13:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 10:46:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 21:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

The proposed methodology involves the integration\nof the collision probability density function on the encounter plane, from\nwhich two analytical formulas, one for the number of close approaches and one\nfor their respective average collision probability, are obtained. The\nmathematical description of the crossing dynamics relies on the assumption of\ncircular orbits and independent collision probabilities, but does not require\nto propagate the satellites' orbit. A comparison with a conventional\npropagation method has been performed for validation purposes, proving its\naccuracy also in case of elliptical crossing orbits. The model developed has\nbeen used to assess the risk connected to constellation's satellites\nreplacement, once they have reached their programmed End-of-Life. The\nenvironmental impact of the full replacement of 12 approved constellations is\nanalysed by means of average collision probability.

The consequences of an in-orbit collision are also investigated by\nassessing the collision risk generated by the formation of a debris cloud.

Since this training draws to a\ncurse of human-based image labeling, using synthetic images with automatically\ngenerated labels together with unlabeled real-world images is a promising\nalternative. This implies to address an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a new co-training procedure for\nsynth-to-real UDA of semantic segmentation models. It consists of a\nself-training stage, which provides two domain-adapted models, and a model\ncollaboration loop for the mutual improvement of these two models. These models\nare then used to provide the final semantic segmentation labels (pseudo-labels)\nfor the real-world images. The overall procedure treats the deep models as\nblack boxes and drives their collaboration at the level of pseudo-labeled\ntarget images, i.e., neither modifying loss functions is required, nor explicit\nfeature alignment. We test our proposal on standard synthetic and real-world\ndatasets for on-board semantic segmentation.

Most proposals use normalizing flows, namely neural\nnetworks parametrizing invertible maps used to transform samples from an\nunderlying base measure; the probability density of the transformed samples is\nthen accessible and the normalizing flow can be trained via maximum likelihood\non simulated parameter-observation pairs. A recent work [Ramesh et al., 2022]\napproximated instead the posterior with generative networks, which drop the\ninvertibility requirement and are thus a more flexible class of distributions\nscaling to high-dimensional and structured data. However, generative networks\nonly allow sampling from the parametrized distribution; for this reason, Ramesh\net al. [2022] follows the common solution of adversarial training, where the\ngenerative network plays a min-max game against a \"critic\" network. This\nprocedure is unstable and can lead to a learned distribution underestimating\nthe uncertainty - in extreme cases collapsing to a single point. Here, we\npropose to approximate the posterior with generative networks trained by\nScoring Rule minimization, an overlooked adversarial-free method enabling\nsmooth training and better uncertainty quantification.

In the systems\nconsidered, the noise correlation function is not necessarily related to\nfriction. Thus, there is no conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR)\nof the second kind and no unique way to define a temperature. We start from a\nMarkovian process with time-dependent diffusivity (an example being scaled\nBrownian motion). It turns out that standard stochastic thermodynamic notions\ncan be applied rather straightforwardly by introducing a time-dependent\ntemperature, yielding the integral fluctuation relation. We then proceed to our\nfocal system, that is, a particle undergoing fractional Brownian motion (FBM).\nIn this system, the noise is Gaussian but the noise correlation function is\nnonlocal in time, defining a non- Markovian process. We analyse in detail the\nconsequences when using the conventional notions of stochastic thermodynamics\nwith a constant medium temperature. In particular, the heat calculated from\ndissipation into the medium differs from the log ratio of path probabilities of\nforward and backward motion, yielding a deviation from the standard integral\nfluctuation relation for the total entropy production if the latter is defined\nvia system entropy and heat exchange. These apparent inconsistencies can be\ncircumvented by formally defining a time-nonlocal temperature that fulfils a\ngeneralized FDR. To shed light on the rather abstract quantities resulting from\nthe latter approach we perform a perturbation expansion. This allows us to\ncalculate analytically, up to linear order, the generalized temperature and the\ncorresponding heat exchange.

In this\nmodel, users arrive at a constant rate and leave at a rate function of the\ninterference created by other users in the network. The novelty of this work\nlies in the addition of service differentiation, inspired by bandwidth\npartitioning present in 5G networks: users are allocated a fixed number of\nfrequency bands and only interfere with transmissions on these bands. The first\nresult of the paper is the determination of the critical user arrival rate\nbelow which the system is stochastically stable, and above which it is\nunstable. The analysis requires symmetry assumptions which are defined in the\npaper. The proof for this result uses stochastic monotonicity and fluid limit\nmodels. The monotonicity allows one to bound the dynamics from above and below\nby two adequate discrete-state Markov jump processes, for which we obtain\nstability and instability results using fluid limits. This leads to a closed\nform expression for the critical arrival rate. The second contribution consists\nin two heuristics to estimate the steady-state densities of all classes of\nusers in the network: the first one relies on a Poisson approximation of the\nsteady-state processes. The second one uses a cavity approximation leveraging\nsecond-order moment measures, which leads to more accurate estimates of the\nsteady-state user densities. The Poisson heuristic also gives a good estimate\nfor the critical arrival rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 14:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 10:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 12:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 13:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

It has been argued, however, that such a\ntrack-based mass (M_trk) may tend to be overestimated for the case of red\ngiants. Meanwhile, there is an alternative approach of evaluating mass (M_gLT)\ndirectly from surface gravity (g), L, and T_eff. The practical reliability of\nM_gLT was examined for ~100 benchmark giants in the Kepler field, for which\natmospheric parameters are already determined and the reliable mass (M_seis)\nalong with the evolutionary status are known from asteroseismology. In\naddition, similar check was also made for the accuracy of M_trk for comparison.\nIt turned out that, while a reasonable correlation is seen between M_gLT and\nM_seis almost irrespective of the stellar property, its precision is rather\ninsufficient because log(M_gLT/M_seis) distributes rather widely within\n~+/-0.2--0.3dex.

Special attention was\npaid to check the recent theoretical stellar evolution simulations indicating\nthe importance of thermohaline mixing in low-mass stars (M <~1 M_sun), which is\nexpected to be more significant as the metallicity is lowered. By inspecting\nthe resulting abundances in comparison with those of unevolved metal-poor\ndwarfs at the same metallicity, the deficiency in C as well as enrichment in N\nwas confirmed (while O is almost unchanged), the extent of peculiarities\ntending to increase with a decrease in [Fe/H]. Accordingly, the [C/N] ratio\nturned out to progressively decrease towards lower metallicity from ~0\n(Fe/H]~0) to ~-1 ([Fe/H]~-1.5), which is reasonably consistent with the\ntheoretical prediction in the presence of thermohaline mixing. However, these\nRR Lyr stars do not show any apparent Na anomaly (i.e., essentially the same\n[Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends as those of dwarfs), despite that\nmetallicity-dependent overabundance in Na is theoretically expected for the\ncase of non-canonical mixing. This inconsistency between C/N and Na may suggest\na necessity of further improvement in the current theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 14:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

In binary quantum systems, some efficient\nimplementation of arithmetic operations like, addition/subtraction,\nmultiplication/division, square root, exponential and arcsine etc. have been\nrealized, where resources are reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates\nwith ancilla. Recently it has been demonstrated that intermediate qutrits can\nbe used in place of ancilla, allowing us to operate efficiently in the\nancilla-free frontier zone. In this article, we have incorporated intermediate\nqutrit approach to realize efficient implementation of all the quantum\narithmetic operations mentioned above with respect to gate count and\ncircuit-depth without T gate and ancilla. Our resource estimates with\nintermediate qutrits could guide future research aimed at lowering costs\nconsidering arithmetic operations for computational problems.

To make machine learning accountable to society, one\nimportant goal is to get actionable options for recourse, which allow an\naffected user to change the decision $f(x)$ of a machine learning system by\nmaking limited changes to its input $x$. We formalize this by providing a\ngeneral definition of recourse sensitivity, which needs to be instantiated with\na utility function that describes which changes to the decisions are relevant\nto the user. This definition applies to local attribution methods, which\nattribute an importance weight to each input feature. It is often argued that\nsuch local attributions should be robust, in the sense that a small change in\nthe input $x$ that is being explained, should not cause a large change in the\nfeature weights. However, we prove formally that it is in general impossible\nfor any single attribution method to be both recourse sensitive and robust at\nthe same time. It follows that there must always exist counterexamples to at\nleast one of these properties. We provide such counterexamples for several\npopular attribution methods, including LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients and\nSmoothGrad. Our results also cover counterfactual explanations, which may be\nviewed as attributions that describe a perturbation of $x$. We further discuss\npossible ways to work around our impossibility result, for instance by allowing\nthe output to consist of sets with multiple attributions, and we provide\nsufficient conditions for specific classes of continuous functions to be\nrecourse sensitive. Finally, we strengthen our impossibility result for the\nrestricted case where users are only able to change a single attribute of $x$,\nby providing an exact characterization of the functions $f$ to which\nimpossibility applies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 14:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 15:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

General properties of neutron\nstars such as the maximum mass, radius, tidal deformability, proton fraction,\nhyperon fraction, and speed of sound are discussed. It is shown that the two\nsolar mass constraint imposes that neutron stars described by equations of\nstate that include hyperons have on average a larger radius, $\\gtrsim 0.5$km,\nand a larger tidal deformability, $\\gtrsim 150$, than the stars determined from\na nucleonic equation of state, while the speed of sound at the center of the\nstar is more than 25\\% smaller.

We theoretically analyze that there\nexists a gap between the volume rendering integral and point-based signed\ndistance function (SDF) modeling. To bridge this gap, we directly locate the\nzero-level set of SDF networks and explicitly perform multi-view geometry\noptimization by leveraging the sparse geometry from structure from motion (SFM)\nand photometric consistency in multi-view stereo. This makes our SDF\noptimization unbiased and allows the multi-view geometry constraints to focus\non the true surface optimization. Extensive experiments show that our proposed\nmethod achieves high-quality surface reconstruction in both complex thin\nstructures and large smooth regions, thus outperforming the state-of-the-arts\nby a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 14:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

The reason for this divergence between\nformalism and intuition is that the points of spaces cannot have internal\nsymmetries in traditional, set-level foundations. The extra data of these\nsymmetries must be carried around and accounted for throughout the theory. More\ndrastically, maps between orbifolds presented in the usual ways cannot be\ndefined pointwise.\n  In this paper, we will put forward a definition of orbifold in synthetic\ndifferential cohesive homotopy type theory: an orbifold is a microlinear type\nfor which the type of identifications between any two points is properly\nfinite.

Here we experimentally demonstrate\nthe generation of high purity Laguerre-Gaussian beams with a single step\non-axis transformation implemented with a dielectric phase-amplitude\nmetasurface. By vectorially structuring the input beam and projecting it onto\nan orthogonal polarisation basis, we can sculpt any vortex beam in phase and\namplitude.

It has\nbeen argued that these sets can describe the semi-classical behaviour of closed\nquantum systems. Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent\nsets and one can view each consistent set as a separate context. Using\npropositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to\nparadoxes such as the contrary inferences first noted by Kent [Physical Review\nLetters, 78(15):2874, 1997]. Proponents of the consistent histories formulation\nargue that one should not mix propositions coming from different consistent\nsets in making logical arguments, and that paradoxes such as the aforementioned\ncontrary inferences are nothing else than the usual microscopic paradoxes of\nquantum contextuality as first demonstrated by Kochen and Specker theorem.\n  In this contribution we use the consistent histories to describe a\nmacroscopic (semi-classical) system to show that paradoxes involving\ncontextuality (mixing different consistent sets) persist even in the\nsemi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of\nstandard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in\nthe semi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets\nfor the arrival time of a semi-classical wave packet in an infinite square\nwell. Surprisingly, we get consistent sets that disagree on whether the motion\nof the semi-classical system, that started within a subregion, ever left that\nsubregion or not. Our results point to the need for constraints, additional to\nthe consistency condition, to recover the correct semi-classical limit in this\nformalism and lead to the motto `all consistent sets are equal', but `some\nconsistent sets are more equal than others'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 15:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 14:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Fortunately, X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) images enable capturing\nspecific manifestations of TB that are undetectable using regular diagnostic\ntests.\n  However, this procedure is unfeasible to process the thousands of volume\nimages belonging to the different TB animal models and humans required for a\nsuitable (pre-)clinical trial.

In this\npaper, we proposed a novel Attention-based Multiple Instance Mutation Learning\n(AMIML) model for predicting gene mutations. AMIML was comprised of successive\n1-D convolutional layers, a decoder, and a residual weight connection to\nfacilitate further integration of a lightweight attention mechanism to detect\nthe most predictive image patches. Using data for 24 clinically relevant genes\nfrom four cancer cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (UCEC, BRCA,\nGBM and KIRC), we compared AMIML with one popular instance-based model and four\nrecently published bag-based models (e.g., CHOWDER, HE2RNA, etc.). AMIML\ndemonstrated excellent robustness, not only outperforming all the five baseline\nalgorithms in the vast majority of the tested genes (17 out of 24), but also\nproviding near-best-performance for the other seven genes. Conversely, the\nperformance of the baseline published algorithms varied across different\ncancers/genes. In addition, compared to the published models for genetic\nalterations, AMIML provided a significant improvement for predicting a wide\nrange of genes (e.g., KMT2C, TP53, and SETD2 for KIRC; ERBB2, BRCA1, and BRCA2\nfor BRCA; JAK1, POLE, and MTOR for UCEC) as well as produced outstanding\npredictive models for other clinically relevant gene mutations, which have not\nbeen reported in the current literature.

Next assign the variable $x$ where\nfor any prime $p_i \\leq a$ there must exist some unique $q_i, \\alpha_i \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $x = q_i +p_i$ and $\\prod_{i = 1}^{\\pi(a)}q_i = \\prod_{i\n= 1}^{\\pi(a)}p_i^{\\alpha_i}$. The final step will be to substitute each $q_i =\nx - p_i$ into the product relationship to produce the Goldbach Polynomial\n$\\prod_{i = 1}^{\\pi(a)}(x - p_i) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{\\pi(a)}p_i^{\\alpha_i}$. It\nwill then be shown that the Goldbach Conjecture is false if and only if $2a$ is\na solution to the Goldbach Polynomial when $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $a > 3$.\n  A similar method will be employed to give the necessary and sufficient\nconditions when every even number is not the difference of two primes with one\nprime being less than that even number. To begin, let $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $a\n> 3$.

Such methods have been used pervasively in large-scale data analytics,\nactive learning, and privacy-preserving analysis in recent decades. Instead of\nmodel-based methods, in this paper, we study model-free subsampling methods,\nwhich aim to identify a subsample that is not confined by model assumptions.\nExisting model-free subsampling methods are usually built upon clustering\ntechniques or kernel tricks. Most of these methods suffer from either a large\ncomputational burden or a theoretical weakness. In particular, the theoretical\nweakness is that the empirical distribution of the selected subsample may not\nnecessarily converge to the population distribution. Such computational and\ntheoretical limitations hinder the broad applicability of model-free\nsubsampling methods in practice. We propose a novel model-free subsampling\nmethod by utilizing optimal transport techniques. Moreover, we develop an\nefficient subsampling algorithm that is adaptive to the unknown probability\ndensity function. Theoretically, we show the selected subsample can be used for\nefficient density estimation by deriving the convergence rate for the proposed\nsubsample kernel density estimator.

Trying to avoid these problems we have found simple but novel\nreduction of the iterations applied for Newton's inverse ratio -p'(x)/p(x) to\napproximation of the power sums of the zeros of p(x) and its reverse\npolynomial. The resulting polynomial root-finders can be devised and performed\nindependently of DLG iterations, based on Newton's identities or Cauchy\nintegrals. In the former case the computation involve a set of leading or\ntailing coefficients of an input polynomial. In the latter case we must scale\nthe variable and increase the arithmetic computational cost to ensure numerical\nstability. Nevertheless the cost is still manageable, at least for fast\nroot-refinement, and the algorithms can be applied to a black box polynomial\np(x)--given by a black box for the evaluation of the ratio p'(x)/p(x) rather\nthan by its coefficients. This enables important computational benefits,\nincluding efficient recursive as well as concurrent approximation of a set of\nzeros of p(x) or even all of its zeros, acceleration where an input polynomial\ncan be evaluated fast, and extension to approximation of the eigenvalues of a\nmatrix or a polynomial matrix, being efficient if the matrix can be inverted\nfast, e.g., is data sparse.

The baseline of our proposed\nself-supervised framework consists of two main parts: the contrastive learning\nand the downstream task. In the first stage, we train an encoder using a number\nof augmentations to extract generalizable ECG signal representations. We then\nfreeze the encoder and finetune a few linear layers with different amounts of\nlabelled data for downstream arrhythmia detection. We then experiment with\nvarious augmentations techniques and explore a range of parameters. Our\nexperiments are done on PTB-XL, a large and publicly available 12-lead ECG\ndataset. The results show that applying augmentations in a specific range of\ncomplexities works better for self-supervised contrastive learning. For\ninstance, when adding Gaussian noise, a sigma in the range of 0.1 to 0.2\nachieves better results, while poor training occurs when the added noise is too\nsmall or too large (outside of the specified range). A similar trend is\nobserved with other augmentations, demonstrating the importance of selecting\nthe optimum level of difficulty for the added augmentations, as augmentations\nthat are too simple will not result in effective training, while augmentations\nthat are too difficult will also prevent the model from effective learning of\ngeneralized representations.
