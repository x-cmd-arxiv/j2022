In recent years, several proof-theoretic\ntransformations, based on G\\\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, have been used\nsystematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a\nsuggestion of Kreisel. Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant\napplications in several areas of mathematics and computer science. Several\nauthors have explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical terms. In\nour previous work, we introduced an intrinsic categorical presentation of the\nDialectica construction via a generalisation of Hofstra's work, using the\nnotion of G\\\"odel fibration and its proof-irrelevant version, a G\\\"odel\ndoctrine. The key idea is that G\\\"odel fibrations can be thought of as\nfibrations generated by some basic elements playing the role of quantifier-free\nelements. This categorification of quantifier-free elements is crucial not only\nto show that our notion of G\\\"odel fibration is equivalent to Hofstra's\nDialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but also to show how G\\\"odel\ndoctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation. To\nshow that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication\nconnective, as expounded by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires\nextra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic, namely Markov\nPrinciple and the Independence of Premise principle, as well as some choice. We\nshow how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting,\nestablishing a tight correspondence between the logical system and the\ncategorical framework. Finally, to complete our analysis, we characterise\ncategories obtained as results of the tripos-to-topos of Hyland, Johnstone and\nPitts applied to G\\\"odel doctrines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 16:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

The point\nclouds are associated with the closest curb segment with $L_2$-norm analysis\nafter projecting into the image space with the fisheye model projection. Next,\nthe selected points are clustered using unsupervised density-based spatial\nclustering to detect different curb regions. As new curb points are detected in\nconsecutive frames they are associated with the existing curb clusters using\ntemporal reachability constraints. If no reachability constraints are found a\nnew curb cluster is formed from these new points. This ensures we can detect\nmultiple curbs present in road segments consisting of multiple lanes if they\nare in the sensors' field of view. Finally, Delaunay filtering is applied for\noutlier removal and its performance is compared to traditional RANSAC-based\nfiltering.

Gait cycle detection based on these signals has\napplications in various areas, including authentication, health monitoring, and\nactivity detection. Template-based studies focus on how the entire gait cycle\nrepresents walking patterns, but these are compute-intensive. Aggregate\nfeature-based studies extract features in the time domain and frequency domain\nfrom the entire gait cycle to reduce the number of features. However, these\nmethods may miss critical structural information needed to appropriately\nrepresent the intricacies of walking patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no\nstudy has formally proposed a structure to capture variations within gait\ncycles or phases from accelerometer readings. We propose a new structure named\nthe PQRST Complex, which corresponds to the swing phase in a gait cycle and\nmatches the foot movements during this phase, thus capturing the changes in\nfoot position. In our experiments, based on the nine features derived from this\nstructure, the accelerometer-based gait authentication system outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art gait cycle-based authentication systems.

However, the vast majority of\nstate-of-the-art forward-secure signatures rely on conventional intractability\nassumptions and therefore are not secure against quantum computers. Hash-based\nsignatures (HBS) (e.g., XMSS) can offer forward-secure post-quantum security.\nHowever, they are efficient only for a pre-defined number of messages to be\nsigned and incur high key generation overhead, highly expensive signing, and\nlarge signature sizes for an increasing number of messages. It is an open\nproblem to develop quantum-safe forward-secure signatures that are efficient\nand practical with a signing capability scalable to their security parameters.\n  In this work, we propose a new series of post-quantum signatures that we call\nFROG (Forward-secuRe pOst-quantum siGnature). Unlike HBS alternatives, FROG can\nachieve highly computational efficient signatures with sub-linear key/signature\nsizes and (practically) unbounded signing capability. This is achieved by\ntransforming suitable post-quantum signatures into forward-secure settings via\nMMM constructions. We investigated the transformation of prominent post-quantum\nsecure signatures such as Dilithium, WOTS, and BLISS with MMM. Our experiments\nindicate that FROG outperforms XMSS for the vast majority (if not all for a\nlarge number of messages) of performance metrics. We also discuss one-time\nvariants of these base signature schemes that can push the performance of FROG\nto the edge. Overall, FROG shows a better performance than the existing\nalternatives with forward-security and therefore is an ideal alternative for\nthe standardization efforts for forward-secure post-quantum signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 19:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

These extra rotations allow one to\nperform a fewer number of measurements by grouping more terms into the\nmeasurable fragments with a lower overall estimator variance.

Recently\nproposed SDN-based solutions show incredible performance in managing different\naspects of such networks.

An optimal, reliable, and adaptive\nrouting algorithm compatible with the SDN design and highly dynamic nature of\nsuch networks is required to improve the network performance.

The restricted training\npattern in the standard BP requires end-to-end error propagation, causing large\nmemory cost and prohibiting model parallelization. Existing local training\nmethods aim to resolve the training obstacle by completely cutting off the\nbackward path between modules and isolating their gradients to reduce memory\ncost and accelerate the training process. These methods prevent errors from\nflowing between modules and hence information exchange, resulting in inferior\nperformance. This work proposes a novel local training algorithm, BackLink,\nwhich introduces inter-module backward dependency and allows errors to flow\nbetween modules. The algorithm facilitates information to flow backward along\nwith the network. To preserve the computational advantage of local training,\nBackLink restricts the error propagation length within the module. Extensive\nexperiments performed in various deep convolutional neural networks demonstrate\nthat our method consistently improves the classification performance of local\ntraining algorithms over other methods. For example, in ResNet32 with 16 local\nmodules, our method surpasses the conventional greedy local training method by\n4.00\\% and a recent work by 1.83\\% in accuracy on CIFAR10, respectively.\nAnalysis of computational costs reveals that small overheads are incurred in\nGPU memory costs and runtime on multiple GPUs. Our method can lead up to a 79\\%\nreduction in memory cost and 52\\% in simulation runtime in ResNet110 compared\nto the standard BP. Therefore, our method could create new opportunities for\nimproving training algorithms towards better efficiency and biological\nplausibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 21:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In recent years, thanks to the\nresurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image inpainting task has\nmade great breakthroughs. However, most of the work consider insufficient types\nof mask, and their performance will drop dramatically when encountering unseen\nmasks. To combat these challenges, we propose a simple yet general method to\nsolve this problem based on the LaMa image inpainting framework, dubbed GLaMa.\nOur proposed GLaMa can better capture different types of missing information by\nusing more types of masks. By incorporating more degraded images in the\ntraining phase, we can expect to enhance the robustness of the model with\nrespect to various masks. In order to yield more reasonable results, we further\nintroduce a frequency-based loss in addition to the traditional spatial\nreconstruction loss and adversarial loss. In particular, we introduce an\neffective reconstruction loss both in the spatial and frequency domain to\nreduce the chessboard effect and ripples in the reconstructed image.

Therefore, inspired by contrastive representation\nlearning, we tackle the deepfake detection problem through learning the\ninvariant representations of both classes and propose a novel real-centric\nconsistency learning method. We constraint the representation from both the\nsample level and the feature level. At the sample level, we take the procedure\nof deepfake synthesis into consideration and propose a novel forgery\nsemantical-based pairing strategy to mine latent generation-related features.\nAt the feature level, based on the centers of natural faces at the\nrepresentation space, we design a hard positive mining and synthesizing method\nto simulate the potential marginal features.

The\nExtensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as a natural\nsolution concept for multi-player general-sum IIEFGs. However, existing\nalgorithms for finding an EFCE require full feedback from the game, and it\nremains open how to efficiently learn the EFCE in the more challenging bandit\nfeedback setting where the game can only be learned by observations from\nrepeated playing.\n  This paper presents the first sample-efficient algorithm for learning the\nEFCE from bandit feedback. We begin by proposing $K$-EFCE -- a more generalized\ndefinition that allows players to observe and deviate from the recommended\nactions for $K$ times. The $K$-EFCE includes the EFCE as a special case at\n$K=1$, and is an increasingly stricter notion of equilibrium as $K$ increases.\nWe then design an uncoupled no-regret algorithm that finds an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K}/\\varepsilon^2)$ iterations in the\nfull feedback setting, where $X_i$ and $A_i$ are the number of information sets\nand actions for the $i$-th player.

These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous\ncondensation of multicomponent $\\eta$ pairs. While the $\\eta$-pairing states in\nthe SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact\neigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry\nof the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert\nsubspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\\eta$-pairing\neigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve\nas quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of\nergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\\geq 3$. Furthermore, we\nshow that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the\nHubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This\npartial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly\nbreak ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the\nintegrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization\ncaused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal\nlong-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the\nmulticomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel\nout-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models\nunveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions,\nwhich can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 09:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

It is the first\nreview that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets\nfor COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of\nGANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the\navailability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that\nreported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images\ndata. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the\nperformance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications\nof GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images.\nThe cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures\nused in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies\nused CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47),\nthe experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available\ndata. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was\nreported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have\ngreat potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of\nCOVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training\nof the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of\nCOVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance\nthrough the super-resolution of the images and segmentation. This review also\nidentified key limitations of the potential transformation of GANs based\nmethods in clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 09:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In our previous studies, compressed sensing\nbased synthetic transmit aperture (CS-STA) and minimal l2-norm least squares\n(LS-STA) methods were proposed to recover the complete STA dataset from fewer\nHadamard-encoded plane wave (PW) transmissions. Results demonstrated that,\ncompared with STA imaging, CS/LS-STA can maintain the high resolution of STA\nand improve the contrast in the deep region with increased FR. However, these\nmethods would introduce errors to the recovered STA datasets and subsequently\nproduce severe artifacts to the beamformed images. Recently, we discovered that\nthe theoretical explanation for the error introduced in the LS-STA-based\nrecovery is that LS-STA method neglects the null space component of the real\nSTA data. To deal with this problem, we propose to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) under the null space learning framework (to estimate the missing\nnull space component) for high-accuracy recovery of the STA dataset from fewer\nHadamard-encoded PW transmissions. The mapping between the low-quality STA\ndataset (recovered using the LS-STA method) and the corresponding high-quality\nSTA dataset (obtained using full Hadamard-encoded STA imaging, HE-STA) was\nlearned from phantom and in vivo samples. The performance of the proposed\nCNN-STA method was compared with the LS-STA, STA, and HE-STA methods, in terms\nof visual quality, NRMSE, gCNR, and FWHM. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can improve the recovery accuracy of the STA datasets and\ntherefore effectively suppress the artifacts presented in the images obtained\nusing the LS-STA method. In addition, the proposed method can maintain the high\nlateral resolution of STA with fewer PW transmissions, as LS-STA does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 09:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

For the independence measures, eight simulated data\nwere generating from normal distribution, normal and Archimedean copula\nfunctions to compare the measures in bivariate or multivariate, linear or\nnonlinear settings. Two UCI dataset, including the heart disease data and the\nwine quality data, were used to test the power of the independence measures in\nreal conditions. For the CI measures, two simulated data with normal\ndistribution and Gumbel copula, and one real data (the Beijing air data) were\nutilized to test the CI measures in prespecified linear or nonlinear setting\nand real scenario. From the experimental results, we found that most of the\nmeasures work well on the simulated data by presenting the right monotonicity\nof the simulations. However, the independence and CI measures were\ndifferentiated on much complex real data respectively and only a few can be\nconsidered as working well with reference to domain knowledge. We also found\nthat the measures tend to be separated into groups based on the similarity of\nthe behaviors of them in each setting and in general. According to the\nexperiments, we recommend CE as a good choice for both independence and CI\nmeasure. This is also due to its rigorous distribution-free definition and\nconsistent nonparametric estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 10:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

However, in microbiome research in\nparticular, conditional modeling is an essential tool to investigate\nrelationships between phenotypes and the microbiome. Existing techniques are\noften inadequate: they either rely on extensions of the linear log-contrast\nmodel (which adjusts for compositionality, but is often unable to capture\nuseful signals), or they are based on black-box machine learning methods (which\nmay capture useful signals, but ignore compositionality in downstream\nanalyses).\n  We propose KernelBiome, a kernel-based nonparametric regression and\nclassification framework for compositional data. It is tailored to sparse\ncompositional data and is able to incorporate prior knowledge, such as\nphylogenetic structure. KernelBiome captures complex signals, including in the\nzero-structure, while automatically adapting model complexity. We demonstrate\non par or improved predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art\nmachine learning methods.

For instance, it should not\nbe the case that explanations associated with instances belonging to a\nparticular gender subgroup (e.g., female) are less accurate than those\nassociated with other genders. However, there is little to no research that\nassesses if there exist such group-based disparities in the quality of the\nexplanations output by state-of-the-art explanation methods. In this work, we\naddress the aforementioned gaps by initiating the study of identifying\ngroup-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline\nthe key properties which constitute explanation quality and where disparities\ncan be particularly problematic. We then leverage these properties to propose a\nnovel evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the\nquality of explanations output by state-of-the-art methods.

However, labels from weak supervision can be noisy, and the high capacity\nof DNNs enables them to easily overfit the label noise, resulting in poor\ngeneralization. Recent methods leverage self-training to build noise-resistant\nmodels, in which a teacher trained under weak supervision is used to provide\nhighly confident labels for teaching the students. Nevertheless, the teacher\nderived from such frameworks may have fitted a substantial amount of noise and\ntherefore produce incorrect pseudo-labels with high confidence, leading to\nsevere error propagation. In this work, we propose Meta Self-Refinement (MSR),\na noise-resistant learning framework, to effectively combat label noise from\nweak supervision. Instead of relying on a fixed teacher trained with noisy\nlabels, we encourage the teacher to refine its pseudo-labels.

Several states\nand cities in the U.S. have banned the use of facial recognition by law\nenforcement and governments, but FPT are still being developed and used in a\nwide variety of contexts where they primarily are regulated by state biometric\ninformation privacy laws. Among these laws, the 2008 Illinois Biometric\nInformation Privacy Act (BIPA) has generated a significant amount of\nlitigation. Yet, with most BIPA lawsuits reaching settlements before there have\nbeen meaningful clarifications of relevant technical intricacies and legal\ndefinitions, there remains a great degree of uncertainty as to how exactly this\nlaw applies to FPT. What we have found through applications of BIPA in FPT\nlitigation so far, however, points to potential disconnects between technical\nand legal communities. This paper analyzes what we know based on BIPA court\nproceedings and highlights these points of tension: areas where the technical\noperationalization of BIPA may create unintended and undesirable incentives for\nFPT development, as well as areas where BIPA litigation can bring to light the\nlimitations of solely technical methods in achieving legal privacy values.\nThese factors are relevant for (i) reasoning about biometric information\nprivacy laws as a governing mechanism for FPT, (ii) assessing the potential\nharms of FPT, and (iii) providing incentives for the mitigation of these harms.\nBy illuminating these considerations, we hope to empower courts and lawmakers\nto take a more nuanced approach to regulating FPT and developers to better\nunderstand privacy values in the current U.S. legal landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 14:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

In this work, we focus on a\nnew type of drug design problem -- generating a small \"linker\" to physically\nattach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main\ncomputational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional\non the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from\nscratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the\ntwo molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures\nand orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes,\nfor which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems,\nwe propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to\npredict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures\nbased on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know,\nthere are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model\nwith multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular\ndesign tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in\nrecovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D\ncoordinates of all the atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 15:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

The NFC (Near Field Communication)\nprotocol is also becoming increasingly important for this application since it\nis embedded in most smartphones that can be used as pervasive and low-cost\nreaders. Furthermore, the responder can be passive and can harvest enough power\nto perform electromagnetic sensing. Finally, the NFC coils are robust to\nbending and to the human body's presence. This contribution details the design\nof a new flexible device, including an electrochemical sensor communicating\nthrough the NFC protocol. A spiral NFC antenna is designed, and a manufactured\nprototype is experimentally tested to quantify the robustness to the\ninter-wearer variability and the bending. Lastly, the sensory data retrieval is\nvalidated by comparison with a portable potentiostat.

It works by\nintroducing \"hidden\" or \"latent\" variables via Baum's auxiliary function $Q$\nthat allow the joint data likelihood to be expressed as a product of simple\nfactors. The relevance of EM has increased since the introduction of the\nvariational lower bound (VLB): the VLB differs from Baum's auxiliary function\nonly by the entropy of the PDF of the latent variables $Z$. We first present a\nrederivation of the standard EM algorithm using data association ideas from the\nfield of multiple target tracking, using $K$-valued scalar data association\nhypotheses rather than the usual binary indicator vectors. The same method is\nthen applied to a little known but much more general type of supervised EM\nalgorithm for shared kernel models, related to probabilistic radial basis\nfunction networks. We address a number of shortcomings in the derivations that\nhave been published previously in this area. In particular, we give\ntheoretically rigorous derivations of (i) the complete data likelihood; (ii)\nBaum's auxiliary function (the E-step) and (iii) the maximisation (M-step) in\nthe case of Gaussian shared kernel models. The subsequent algorithm, called\nshared kernel EM (SKEM), is then applied to a digit recognition problem using a\nnovel 7-segment digit representation. Variants of the algorithm that use\ndifferent numbers of features and different EM algorithm dimensions are\ncompared in terms of mean accuracy and mean IoU. A simplified classifier is\nproposed that decomposes the joint data PDF as a product of lower order PDFs\nover non-overlapping subsets of variables. The effect of different numbers of\nassumed mixture components $K$ is also investigated. High-level source code for\nthe data generation and SKEM algorithm is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 10:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

However, the\nuse of high laser fluence to increase the ablation efficiency usually results\nin unwanted effects, such as redeposition of debris, formation of recast layer\nand heat-affected zone in or around the ablation craters. Here we circumvent\nthis limitation by exploiting a thin frost layer with a thickness of tens of\nmicrons, which can be directly formed by the condensation of water vapor from\nthe air onto the exposed surface whose temperature is below the freezing point.\nWhen femtosecond laser beam is focused onto the target surface covered with a\nthin frost layer, only the local frost layer around the laser-irradiated spot\nmelts into water, helping to boost ablation efficiency, suppress the recast\nlayer and reduce the heat-affect zone, while the remaining frost layer can\nprevent ablation debris from adhering to the target surface.
