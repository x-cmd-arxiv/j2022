As such,\nimproving its computational efficiency becomes paramount. One of the major\ncomputational inefficiency of Transformer-based models is that they spend the\nidentical amount of computation throughout all layers. Prior works have\nproposed to augment the Transformer model with the capability of skimming\ntokens to improve its computational efficiency. However, they suffer from not\nhaving effectual and end-to-end optimization of the discrete skimming\npredictor. To address the above limitations, we propose the Transkimmer\narchitecture, which learns to identify hidden state tokens that are not\nrequired by each layer. The skimmed tokens are then forwarded directly to the\nfinal output, thus reducing the computation of the successive layers. The key\nidea in Transkimmer is to add a parameterized predictor before each layer that\nlearns to make the skimming decision. We also propose to adopt\nreparameterization trick and add skim loss for the end-to-end training of\nTranskimmer. Transkimmer achieves 10.97x average speedup on GLUE benchmark\ncompared with vanilla BERT-base baseline with less than 1% accuracy\ndegradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 16:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Traditionally, probing these effects via high\nharmonic generation has involved complicated lasers and apparatuses to generate\nthe few-cycle and high peak power pulses needed to obtain and measure spectra\nthat are sensitive to the phase of the light wave. Instead, we show that\nnonlinear effects dependent on the carrier-envelope phase can be accessed in\nsolid state crystals with simple low-energy frequency combs that we combine\nwith high-sensitivity demodulation techniques to measure harmonic spectral\nmodulations. Central to this advance is the use of a scalable 100 MHz\nErbium-fiber frequency comb at 1550 nm to produce 10 nJ, 20 fs pulses which are\nfocused to the TW/cm2 level. In a single pass through a 500 {\\mu}m ZnO crystal\nthis yields harmonic spectra as short as 200 nm.

We model open\nsystem loss processes operating at high nebula altitudes, such as resulting\nfrom disk winds flowing out of the system entirely, or layered accretion\ndirectly onto the young sun. We find that mass loss rates higher than found in\ntypical T-Tauri disk winds, lasting short periods of time, are most\nsatisfactory, pointing to multiple intense early outburst stages. Using our\nglobal nebula model, incorporating realistic particle growth and inward drift\nfor solids, we constrain how much the MVE depletion signature in the inner\nregion is diluted by the drift of undepleted material from the outer nebula. We\nalso find that a significant irreversible loss of the common rock-forming\nelements (Fe, Mg, Si) can occur, leading to a new explanation of another\nlongstanding puzzle of the apparent \"enhancement\" in the relative abundance of\nhighly refractory elements in chondrites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 17:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

For the case of the endofullerene paramagnet Sc2TbN@C80 the\nconformation is linked to an electric and a magnetic dipole moment.

The molecules assume a hexagonally close packed lattice aligned\nwith the substrate high symmetry directions. The structure is incommensurate\nand arranges at a periodicity of about 4.3x4.3 substrate unit cells. At low\ntemperatures a (2 x 2) superstructure is observed. Angular resolved valence\nband photoemission spectroscopy shows a temperature induced 0.3 eV shift on the\nC80 molecular orbitals to lower binding energies that is parallel to a\nworkfunction increase. From comparison of the molecular orbital angular\nphotoemission intensity distributions it is conjectured that the molecules\nundergo a change in conformation between 30 and 300 K.

Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an\neating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public\nplaces. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high\naccuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and\nselecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a\nnonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable\nfeature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method\nextracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by\nusing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme\nlearning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good\ngeneralization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality\nproblem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix\nwith large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel\nmulticolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d\ntree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each\nsubset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel\nstructures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the\nk-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For\nevaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using\nnine publically available datasets.

Reconstruction methods relying on deep learning have\nattracted a lot of attention recently due to their promising performance for a\nvariety of medical imaging modalities. There are, however, issues that preclude\ndirect application of such methods to CBCT in practice. Firstly, deep learning\nreconstruction methods become prohibitively memory expensive when working with\nfully 3D data such as CBCT. Secondly, deep learning reconstruction methods are\nwidely criticised for being trained and evaluated on data from a specific\nregion of interest such as thorax, raising concerns about generalization to\nother organs. In this work, we aim to address these shortcomings and propose\nLIRE: a fully learned, partially invertible primal-dual iterative scheme for\nCone Beam CT reconstruction. We drastically reduce memory footprint of the\nnetwork without sacrificing expressive power by combining reversible residual\nprimal-dual blocks together with patch-wise computations inside the blocks,\nwhich allows us to train using clinically-relevant resolutions and projection\ncounts on current consumer hardware. The models are trained on thorax CT scans\nand tested using both thorax CT and head \\& neck CT data.

A plaquette action has the product of its\nfour variables and the partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann\nfactor with a product of $U(N)$ Haar measures.

In each case, the seismic source\nderived from these models has significant negative isotropic and negative\ncompensated linear vector dipole components as well as a P-axis approximately\naligned with the direction of maximum compressional principal stress. These\nfeatures indicate that at wavelengths larger than the diameter of the tunnel\nand the extent of damage along it, seismic radiation is controlled by the\nelastic convergence of the surrounding rockmass rather than by rock fracturing.\nAn analytical approximation of the source mechanism is suggested that is based\nsolely on mechanical and geometric properties: the magnitudes\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{min}}$ of the maximum and minimum\nprincipal stresses orthogonal to the tunnel's axis, the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$\nof the rockmass, the length $L_{3}$ of dynamic fracturing along the tunnel, the\neffective tunnel dimension $\\bar{L_{A}}$, and the increase in depth of failure\n$\\triangle d_{f}^{A}$ in the direction of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{min}}$.

Recent research\nproposes various techniques that aim to accurately identify\nperformance-critical data to place it in a \"best-fit\" storage device.\nUnfortunately, most of these techniques are rigid, which (1) limits their\nadaptivity to perform well for a wide range of workloads and storage device\nconfigurations, and (2) makes it difficult for designers to extend these\ntechniques to different storage system configurations (e.g., with a different\nnumber or different types of storage devices) than the configuration they are\ndesigned for. We introduce Sibyl, the first technique that uses reinforcement\nlearning for data placement in hybrid storage systems. Sibyl observes different\nfeatures of the running workload as well as the storage devices to make\nsystem-aware data placement decisions. For every decision it makes, Sibyl\nreceives a reward from the system that it uses to evaluate the long-term\nperformance impact of its decision and continuously optimizes its data\nplacement policy online. We implement Sibyl on real systems with various HSS\nconfigurations. Our results show that Sibyl provides 21.6%/19.9% performance\nimprovement in a performance-oriented/cost-oriented HSS configuration compared\nto the best previous data placement technique. Our evaluation using an HSS\nconfiguration with three different storage devices shows that Sibyl outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art data placement policy by 23.9%-48.2%, while significantly\nreducing the system architect's burden in designing a data placement mechanism\nthat can simultaneously incorporate three storage devices.

Recent research on Nb-Mo-Ta-W\nalloys points to a heightened role of edge dislocations on deformation, which\nis generally attributed to atomic-level chemical fluctuations in the material\nand their interactions with dislocation cores during slip. However, while this\nmodel accounts for a strengthening effect due to the chemical complexity of the\nalloy, it is not sufficient to explain its strength across the entire thermal\nrange. Here we propose a new mechanism that captures the existing theories\nabout enhanced lattice strengthening and a thermally-activated component that\nemanates directly from the chemical complexity of the RMEA. This compositional\ncomplexity results in unique vacancy formation energy distributions with tails\nthat extend into negative energies, leading to spontaneous, i.e., athermal,\nvacancy formation at edge dislocation cores. These vacancies relax into\natomic-sized super-jogs on the dislocation line, acting as extra pinning points\nthat increase the activation stress of the dislocation. At the same time, these\nsuper-jogs can displace diffusively along the glide direction, relieving with\ntheir motion some of the extra stress, thus countering the hardening effect due\nto jog-pinning. The interplay between these two processes as a function of\ntemperature confers an extra strength to edge dislocation at\nintermediate-to-high temperatures, in remarkable agreement with experimental\nmeasurements in Nb-Mo-Ta-W and across a number of different RMEA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 01:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

The problem is\nmagnified in cross-modal scenarios, in which most methods heavily rely on the\npre-training. In this paper, we recouple independent constraints of detection\nand description of multimodal feature learning with a mutual weighting\nstrategy, in which the detected probabilities of robust features are forced to\npeak and repeat, while features with high detection scores are emphasized\nduring optimization. Different from previous works, those weights are detached\nfrom back propagation so that the detected probability of indistinct features\nwould not be directly suppressed and the training would be more stable.\nMoreover, we propose the Super Detector, a detector that possesses a large\nreceptive field and is equipped with learnable non-maximum suppression layers,\nto fulfill the harsh terms of detection.

The freshness of information available at each monitor is quantified\nin terms of the Age of Information (AoI), and the vector of AoI processes at\nthe monitors (or equivalently the age vector) models the continuous state of\nthe system. While the marginal distributional properties of each AoI process\nhave been studied for a variety of settings using the stochastic hybrid system\n(SHS) approach, we lack a counterpart of this approach to systematically study\ntheir joint distributional properties. Developing such a framework is the main\ncontribution of this paper. In particular, we model the discrete state of the\nsystem as a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain, and describe the coupled\nevolution of the continuous and discrete states of the system by a piecewise\nlinear SHS with linear reset maps. Using the notion of tensors, we first derive\nfirst-order linear differential equations for the temporal evolution of both\nthe joint moments and the joint moment generating function (MGF) for an\narbitrary set of age processes. We then characterize the conditions under which\nthe derived differential equations are asymptotically stable. The generality of\nour framework is demonstrated by recovering several existing results as special\ncases. Finally, we apply our framework to derive closed-form expressions of the\nstationary joint MGF in a multi-source updating system under non-preemptive and\nsource-agnostic/source-aware preemptive in service queueing disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 05:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 12:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 14:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Particularly, the convex combination between two samples are\nregarded as the pivot for aggregation. In the embedding space, the selected\nsamples are guided to be similar to the representation of the pivot. On the\nother side, to mitigate the trivial solution of such regularization, the last\nfully-connected layer of the model is replaced by an orthogonal classifier, in\nwhich the embedding codes for different classes are processed orthogonally and\nseparately.

Absent of an associated instability the R-S has been\nascribed to non-normality mediated interaction between the mean flow and\nperturbations. This interaction may occur either directly due to excitation of\na transiently growing perturbation or indirectly due to destabilization of the\nR-S by turbulent Reynolds stresses. A fundamental distinction between the\ndirect and the indirect mechanisms, which is central to understanding the\nphysics of turbulence, is that in the direct mechanism the R-S is itself the\ngrowing structure while in the indirect mechanism the R-S emerges as a\nself-organized structure. In the emergent R-S theory the fundamental mechanism\nis organization by the streak of Reynolds stresses configured to support its\nassociated roll by the lift-up process. This requires that a streak organizes\nturbulent perturbations such as to produce Reynolds stresses configured to\nreinforce the streak. In this paper we provide detailed analysis explaining\nphysically why this positive feedback occurs and is a universal property of\nturbulence in shear flow.

Against this\nissue, we propose an adaptive convolutional dictionary network (ACDNet), which\nleverages both model-based and learning-based methods. Specifically, we explore\nthe prior structures of metal artifacts, e.g., non-local repetitive streaking\npatterns, and encode them as an explicit weighted convolutional dictionary\nmodel.

By unfolding every iterative substep of the proposed algorithm into\na network module, we explicitly embed the prior structure into a deep network,\n\\emph{i.e.,} a clear interpretability for the MAR task. Furthermore, our ACDNet\ncan automatically learn the prior for artifact-free CT images via training data\nand adaptively adjust the representation kernels for each input CT image based\non its content. Hence, our method inherits the clear interpretability of\nmodel-based methods and maintains the powerful representation ability of\nlearning-based methods.

A popular approach to implementing deep SNNs is\nANN-SNN conversion combining both efficient training of ANNs and efficient\ninference of SNNs. However, due to the intrinsic difference between ANNs and\nSNNs, the accuracy loss is usually non-negligible, especially under low\nsimulating steps. It restricts the applications of SNN on latency-sensitive\nedge devices greatly. In this paper, we identify such performance degradation\nstems from the misrepresentation of the negative or overflow residual membrane\npotential in SNNs. Inspired by this, we systematically analyze the conversion\nerror between SNNs and ANNs, and then decompose it into three folds:\nquantization error, clipping error, and residual membrane potential\nrepresentation error.

For instance, product quality is a confounder since\naffecting both item prices and user ratings, but is hidden for the third-party\ne-commerce platform due to the difficulty of large-scale quality inspection;\nignoring it could result in the bias effect of over-recommending high-price\nitems. This work analyzes and addresses the problem from a causal perspective.\nThe key lies in modeling the causal effect of item features on a user's\nfeedback. To mitigate hidden confounding effects, it is compulsory but\nchallenging to estimate the causal effect without measuring the confounder.\nTowards this goal, we propose a Hidden Confounder Removal (HCR) framework that\nleverages front-door adjustment to decompose the causal effect into two partial\neffects, according to the mediators between item features and user feedback.\nThe partial effects are independent from the hidden confounder and\nidentifiable.

Most important and\nchallenging is the accurate modelling of complex real-gas effects in\nhigh-pressure environments, especially the hybrid subcritical-to-supercritical\nmode of evaporation during the mixing of fuel and oxidizer. In this paper, we\npresent a novel modeling framework for high-fidelity simulations of reacting\nand non-reacting transcritical fuel sprays. In this method, the high-pressure\njet disintegration is modeled using a diffuse interface method with multiphase\nthermodynamics, which combines multi-component real-fluid kinetic and caloric\nstate equations with vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations in order to compute\nthermodynamic properties of the mixture at transcritical pressures. All\nmultiphase thermodynamic formulations are presented for general cubic state\nequations coupled with a rapid phase-equilibrium calculation method. The\nproposed method represents multiphase turbulent fluid flows at transcritical\npressures without relying on any semi-empirical break-up and evaporation\nmodels. Combustion source terms are evaluated using a finite-rate chemistry\nmodel, including real-gas effects based on the fugacity of the species in the\nmixture. The adaptive local deconvolution method (ALDM) is used as a physically\nconsistent turbulence model for large-eddy simulation (LES). LES results show a\nvery good agreement with available experimental data for the reacting and\nnon-reacting ECN Spray A at transcritical operating conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 08:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

We detected HC3N in 38 sources, HC5N in 11 sources, and HC7N in\nG24.790+0.084, with the highest detection rate being found for Maser-RRL\nsources and a very low detection rate found for RRL-only sources. Their column\ndensities were derived using the rotational temperature measured from the NH3\nlines. And we constructed and fitted the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy\ndistributions. Based on these, we derive their dust temperatures, H2 column\ndensities, and abundances of cyanopolyynes relative to H2. The detection rate,\nthe column density, and the relative abundance of HC3N increase from Maser-only\nto Maser-RRL sources and decrease from Maser-RRL to RRL-only sources. This\ntrend is consistent with the proposed evolutionary trend of HC3N under the\nassumption that our Maser-only, Maser-RRL, and RRL-only sources correspond to\nmassive young stellar objects, ultra-compact HII regions, and normal classical\nHII regions, respectively. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of the\nintegrated line intensity and column density of HC3N and shock-tracing\nmolecules (SiO, H2CO) enabled us to find positive correlations between them.\nThis suggests that HC3N may be another tracer of shocks, and should therefore\nbe the subject of further observations and corresponding chemical simulations.\nOur results indirectly support the idea that the neutral--neutral reaction\nbetween C2H2 and CN is the dominant formation pathway of HC3N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 08:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Every agent $i$ has a\nvaluation $v_i$ from some given class of valuation functions. A share $s$ is a\nfunction that maps a pair $(v_i,n)$ to a value, with the interpretation that if\nan allocation of $M$ to $n$ agents fails to give agent $i$ a bundle of value at\nleast equal to $s(v_i,n)$, this serves as evidence that the allocation is not\nfair towards $i$. For such an interpretation to make sense, we would like the\nshare to be feasible, meaning that for any valuations in the class, there is an\nallocation that gives every agent at least her share. The maximin share was a\nnatural candidate for a feasible share for additive valuations. However,\nKurokawa, Procaccia and Wang [2018] show that it is not feasible.\n  We initiate a systematic study of the family of feasible shares.

We seek to identify those self-maximizing\nfeasible shares that are polynomial time computable, and offer the highest\nshare values. We show that a SM-dominating feasible share -- one that dominates\nevery self-maximizing (SM) feasible share -- does not exist for additive\nvaluations (and beyond). Consequently, we relax the domination property to that\nof domination up to a multiplicative factor of $\\rho$ (called\n$\\rho$-dominating). For additive valuations we present shares that are\nfeasible, self-maximizing and polynomial-time computable. For $n$ agents we\npresent such a share that is $\\frac{2n}{3n-1}$-dominating.

The classical Eulerian\ndiscretization based approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which\narises from the approximation of high-dimensional velocity field. In this work,\nwe propose a deep learning based method to solve the dynamic optimal transport\nin high dimensional space. Our method contains three main ingredients: a\ncarefully designed representation of the velocity field, the discretization of\nthe PDE constraint along the characteristics, and the computation of high\ndimensional integral by Monte Carlo method in each time step. Specifically, in\nthe representation of the velocity field, we apply the classical nodal basis\nfunction in time and the deep neural networks in space domain with the H1-norm\nregularization. This technique promotes the regularity of the velocity field in\nboth time and space such that the discretization along the characteristic\nremains to be stable during the training process. Extensive numerical examples\nhave been conducted to test the proposed method. Compared to other solvers of\noptimal transport, our method could give more accurate results in high\ndimensional cases and has very good scalability with respect to dimension.\nFinally, we extend our method to more complicated cases such as crowd motion\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 08:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

At the heart of\nDFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the\nuncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on\nhand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction,\nwhich can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic\ndistributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method,\ntermed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language\npriors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically\nand grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained\ngenerative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic\nprompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically\nrelevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As\nshown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the\nsynthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation\nperformance.

Recent studies incorporate feasible sets into\nCRL with energy-based methods such as control barrier function (CBF), safety\nindex (SI), and leverage prior conservative estimations of feasible sets, which\nharms the performance of the learned policy. To deal with this problem, this\npaper proposes the reachability CRL (RCRL) method by using reachability\nanalysis to establish the novel self-consistency condition and characterize the\nfeasible sets. The feasible sets are represented by the safety value function,\nwhich is used as the constraint in CRL. We use the multi-time scale stochastic\napproximation theory to prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a local\noptimum, where the largest feasible set can be guaranteed. Empirical results on\ndifferent benchmarks validate the learned feasible set, the policy performance,\nand constraint satisfaction of RCRL, compared to CRL and safe control\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 09:32:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 03:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In the present work, we focus on the\nform, a specific aspect of the overall shape, of sedimentary grains in order to\ninvestigate and quantify its effect on porosity, ultimately deriving novel\nporosity-prediction models. To this end, we develop a robust and accurate\nsimulation tool based on the discrete element method which we validate against\nlaboratory experiments. Utilizing digital representations of actual sediment\nfrom the Rhine river, we first study packings that are composed of particles\nwith a single form. There, the porosity is found to be mainly determined by the\ninverse equancy, i.e., the ratio of the longest to the smallest form-defining\naxis. Only for small ratios, additional shape-related properties become\nrelevant, as revealed by a direct comparison to packings of form-equivalent\nellipsoids. Since sediment naturally features form mixtures, we extend our\nsimulation tool to study sediment packings with normally-distributed forms. In\nagreement with our single form studies, the porosity depends primarily on the\ninverse of the mean equancy. By supplying additional information about a second\nform factor and the standard deviations, we derive an accurate model for\nporosity prediction. Due to its simplicity, it can be readily applied to\nsediment packings for which some measurements of flatness and elongation, the\ntwo most common form factors, are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 09:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

The\nnon-convexity of the objective function, as well as the use of an inexactness\nspecified gradient at iterations, can lead to various problems. For example,\nthe trajectory of the gradient method may be far enough away from the starting\npoint. On the other hand, the unbounded removal of the trajectory of the\ngradient method in the presence of noise can lead to the removal of the\ntrajectory of the method from the desired exact solution. The results of\ninvestigating the behavior of the trajectory of the gradient method are\nobtained under the assumption of the inexactness of the gradient and the\ncondition of gradient dominance. It is well known that such a condition is\nvalid for many important non-convex problems. Moreover, it leads to good\ncomplexity guarantees for the gradient method. A rule of early stopping of the\ngradient method is proposed. Firstly, it guarantees achieving an acceptable\nquality of the exit point of the method in terms of the function. Secondly, the\nstopping rule ensures a fairly moderate distance of this point from the chosen\ninitial position.

Of the 14 studies\nidentified, 11 focused on the outcomes of co-infection with non-attenuated\ninfluenza A viruses and generally demonstrated that co-infection increased\ndisease severity compared with either mono-infection. By contrast, the effect\nof co-infection on the viral load of either virus was variable and inconsistent\nacross studies. Next, we reviewed the epidemiological evidence about SARS-CoV-2\ninteractions in human populations. Although numerous studies were identified,\nonly few were specifically designed to infer interaction and many were prone to\nmultiple biases, including confounding. Nevertheless, their results suggested\nthat influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were associated with\nreduced riskof SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we formulated simple transmission\nmodels of SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation with a viral or a bacterial pathogen,\nshowing how they can naturally incorporate the proposed framework. More\ngenerally, we argue that such models, when designed with an integrative and\nmultidisciplinary perspective, will be invaluable tools to resolve the\nsubstantial uncertainties that remain about SARS-CoV-2 interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 10:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 23:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

To reach this demanding science goal,\nthe instruments are equipped with eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) systems which\nwill control thousands of actuators at a framerate of kilohertz to several\nkilohertz. Most of the habitable exoplanets are located at small angular\nseparations from their host stars, where the current XAO systems' control laws\nleave strong residuals.Current AO control strategies like static matrix-based\nwavefront reconstruction and integrator control suffer from temporal delay\nerror and are sensitive to mis-registration, i.e., to dynamic variations of the\ncontrol system geometry. We aim to produce control methods that cope with these\nlimitations, provide a significantly improved AO correction and, therefore,\nreduce the residual flux in the coronagraphic point spread function.\n  We extend previous work in Reinforcement Learning for AO. The improved\nmethod, called PO4AO, learns a dynamics model and optimizes a control neural\nnetwork, called a policy. We introduce the method and study it through\nnumerical simulations of XAO with Pyramid wavefront sensing for the 8-m and\n40-m telescope aperture cases. We further implemented PO4AO and carried out\nexperiments in a laboratory environment using MagAO-X at the Steward\nlaboratory. PO4AO provides the desired performance by improving the\ncoronagraphic contrast in numerical simulations by factors 3-5 within the\ncontrol region of DM and Pyramid WFS, in simulation and in the laboratory. The\npresented method is also quick to train, i.e., on timescales of typically 5-10\nseconds, and the inference time is sufficiently small (< ms) to be used in\nreal-time control for XAO with currently available hardware even for extremely\nlarge telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 10:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

To address these issues, a two-stage deep neural network (DNN),\ncalled DMRF-UNet, is proposed to reconstruct the permittivity distributions of\nsubsurface objects from GPR B-scans under heterogeneous soil conditions. In the\nfirst stage, a U-shape DNN with multi-receptive-field convolutions (MRF-UNet1)\nis built to remove the clutters due to inhomogeneity of the heterogeneous soil.\nThen the denoised B-scan from the MRF-UNet1 is combined with the noisy B-scan\nto be inputted to the DNN in the second stage (MRF-UNet2). The MRF-UNet2 learns\nthe inverse mapping relationship and reconstructs the permittivity distribution\nof subsurface objects. To avoid information loss, an end-to-end training method\ncombining the loss functions of two stages is introduced. A wide range of\nsubsurface heterogeneous scenarios and B-scans are generated to evaluate the\ninversion performance. The test results in the numerical experiment and the\nreal measurement show that the proposed network reconstructs the\npermittivities, shapes, sizes, and locations of subsurface objects with high\naccuracy.

Obtaining reliable predictions have been difficult,\nhowever, as often only a small fraction of the relevant variables can be\nmonitored, and even minor perturbations can induce drastic changes in fragile\nstates of a complex system. Data-driven indicators have been proposed as an\nalternative to prediction and signal an increasing risk of forthcoming\ntransitions.

However, the SED is\nsignificantly affected by dust in its interstellar medium. Dust is mainly\nproduced by asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. In addition,\nthe dust mass increases through the metal accretion, and the grain size changes\nby the collisions between the grains. The contribution of each process and the\nextinction depend on the size distribution. Therefore, the SED model should\ntreat the evolution of the dust mass and size distribution. In spite of the\nimportance of dust evolution, many previous SED models have not considered the\nevolution of the total mass and size distribution in a physically consistent\nmanner. In this work, we constructed a new radiative transfer SED model, based\non our dust evolution model consistent with the chemical evolution. To reduce\nthe computational cost, we adopted the mega-grain and the one-dimensional plane\nparallel galaxy approximation. As a fiducial case, we calculated Milky Way-like\ngalaxy SEDs at various ages under the closed-box model. We found that a galaxy\nat the age of 100~Myr does not produce small grains such as polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons. After 1~Gyr, we observed a drastic increase of infrared emission\nand attenuation caused by a rapid increase of dust mass. This phenomenon can be\ntreated appropriately for the first time by our new model.

A major challenge is inferring viewing\ninclination and extracting information about the colliding wind interaction\n(CWI) region. Polarimetric variability from electron scattering in the highly\nionized winds provides important diagnostic information about system geometry.\nWe combine for the first time the well-known generalized treatment of\n\\citet{brown_polarisation_1978} for variable polarization from binaries with\nthe semi-analytic solution for the geometry and surface density CWI shock\ninterface between the winds based on Canto et al 1996. Our calculations include\nsome simplifications in the form of inverse square-law wind densities and the\nassumption of axisymmetry, but in so doing arrive at several robust\nconclusions. One is that when the winds are nearly equal (e.g., O\\,+\\,O\nbinaries), the polarization has a relatively mild decline with binary\nseparation. Another is that despite Thomson scattering being a gray opacity,\nthe continuum polarization can show chromatic effects at ultraviolet\nwavelengths but will be mostly constant at longer wavelengths. Finally, when\none wind dominates the other, as for example in WR+OB binaries, the\npolarization is expected to be larger at wavelengths where the OB component is\nmore luminous, and generally smaller at wavelengths where the WR component is\nmore luminous. This behavior arises because from the perspective of the WR\nstar, the distortion of the scattering envelope from spherical is a minor\nperturbation situated far from the WR star. By contrast, the polarization\ncontribution from the OB star is dominated by the geometry of the CWI shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 12:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

The problem is traditionally formulated as a stochastic\ndynamic program accounting for the uncertainty of electricity prices and\nreservoir inflows. This formulation suffers from the curse of dimensionality,\nas the state space explodes with the number of reservoirs and the history of\nprices and inflows. To avoid computing the expectation of future value\nfunctions, the proposed model takes advantage of the so-called post-decision\nstate. To further tackle the dimensionality issue, we propose an approximate\ndynamic programming approach that estimates the future value of water using a\nlinear approximation architecture. When the time series of prices and inflows\nfollow autoregressive processes, our approximation provides an upper bound on\nthe future value function. We use an offline training algorithm based on the\nhistorical data of prices and inflows and run both in-sample and out-of-sample\nsimulations.

Despite this, the theoretical underpinnings of the Anthologies have\nbeen understudied; in general, the work has been overshadowed by Ptolemy's\ncontemporaneous Tetrabiblos. While the Tetrabiblos explicitly aims to present a\nsystematic account of astrology, Valens' work is often characterised as a\nmiscellaneous collection, of interest to historians only for the evidence it\npreserves about the practical methods used in casting horoscopes. In this\narticle, we argue that the Anthologies is also an invaluable resource for\nengagement with the conceptual basis of astrology. As a case study, we take a\nsection of Anthologies Book 1 which lists the possible astrological effects of\nplanets, both alone and in 'combinations' of two and three. We demonstrate that\nanalysing Valens' descriptions quantitatively with textual analysis reveals a\nconsistent internal logic of planetary combination. By classifying descriptive\nterms as positive or negative, we show that the resulting 'sentiment' of\nplanetary combinations is well-correlated with their component parts.\nFurthermore, we find that the sentiment of three-planet combinations is more\nstrongly correlated with the average sentiment of their three possible\ncomponent pairs than with the average sentiment of individual planets,\nsuggesting an iterative combinatorial logic. Recognition of this feature of\nastrological practice has been neglected compared to the mathematical methods\nfor calculating horoscopes.

Using fully coupled\nnumerical simulations and scaling arguments, we show that a single\ndimensionless number governs buoyant hydraulic fracture growth: the\ndimensionless viscosity of a radial hydraulic fracture at the time when\nbuoyancy becomes of order one. It quantifies if the transition to buoyancy\noccurs when the growth of the radial hydraulic fracture is either still in the\nregime dominated by viscous flow dissipation or is already in the regime where\nfracture energy dissipation dominates. A family of fracture shapes emerge at\nlate time from finger-like (toughness regime) to inverted elongated cudgel-like\n(viscous regime). 3D toughness dominated buoyant fractures exhibit a\nfinger-like shape with a constant volume toughness dominated head and a viscous\ntail having a constant uniform horizontal breadth: there is no further\nhorizontal growth past the onset of buoyancy. However, if the transition to\nbuoyancy occurs while in the viscosity dominated regime, both vertical and\nhorizontal growths continue to match scaling arguments.

We consider the problem of finding ranking policies that\nachieve a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between these two aspects. Several methods\nwere proposed to solve it; for instance a popular one is to use linear\nprogramming with a Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition. These methods, however,\nare based on a classical Position Based exposure Model (PBM), which assumes\nindependence between the items (hence the exposure only depends on the rank).\nIn many applications, this assumption is unrealistic and the community\nincreasingly moves towards considering other models that include dependences,\nsuch as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) exposure model. For such models,\ncomputing (exact) optimal fair ranking policies remains an open question.\n  We answer this question by leveraging a new geometrical method based on the\nso-called expohedron proposed recently for the PBM (Kletti et al., WSDM'22). We\nlay out the structure of a new geometrical object (the DBN-expohedron), and\npropose for it a Carath\\'eodory decomposition algorithm of complexity $O(n^3)$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of documents to rank. Such an algorithm enables\nexpressing any feasible expected exposure vector as a distribution over at most\n$n$ rankings; furthermore we show that we can compute the whole set of\nPareto-optimal expected exposure vectors with the same complexity $O(n^3)$. Our\nwork constitutes the first exact algorithm able to efficiently find a\nPareto-optimal distribution of rankings. It is applicable to a broad range of\nfairness notions, including classical notions of meritocratic and demographic\nfairness.

Distance is estimated from SNe\nIa parameters extracted from light curve fits, where the average quality of\nlight curves is primarily driven by survey parameters such as the cadence and\nthe number of visits per band. An optimal observing strategy is thus critical\nfor measuring cosmological parameters with high accuracy. We present in this\npaper a three-stage analysis aiming at quantifying the impact of the Deep\nDrilling (DD) strategy parameters on three critical aspects of the survey: the\nredshift completeness (originating from the Malmquist cosmological bias), the\nnumber of well-measured SNe Ia, and the cosmological measurements.

We\npropose that the material-time increase over a given time interval reflects the\ndistance traveled by the system's particles. Different possible distance\nmeasures are discussed, starting from the standard mean-square displacement and\nits inherent-state version that excludes the vibrational contribution. The\nviewpoint adopted, which is inspired by and closely related to pioneering works\nof Cugliandolo and Kurchan of the 1990s, implies a \"geometric reversibility\"\nand a \"unique-triangle property\" characterizing the system's path in\nconfiguration space during aging. Both of these properties are inherited from\nequilibrium; they are confirmed by computer simulations of an aging binary\nLennard-Jones system. Our simulations show that the slow particles control the\nmaterial time. This motivates a \"dynamic-rigidity-percolation\" picture of\nphysical aging. The numerical data show that the material time is dominated by\nthe slowest particles' inherent mean-square displacement, which is conveniently\nquantified by the inherent harmonic mean-square displacement. This distance\nmeasure collapses data for potential-energy aging well in the sense that the\nnormalized relaxation functions following different temperature jumps are\nalmost the same function of the material time. Finally, the standard\nTool-Narayanaswamy linear material-time convolution integral description of\nphysical aging is derived from the assumption that when time is replaced by\ndistance in the above sense, an aging system is described by the same\nexpression as that of linear-response theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 13:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 15:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

Robust\ncharacterisation of their stellar content, however, is hindered by the\nexceptionally high nebular emission present in their optical spectroscopic\ndata. This study is dedicated into recovering the stellar properties of a\nsample of 414 EELGs as observed by the SDSS Survey. Such is achieved by means\nof the spectral synthesis code FADO, which self-consistently considers the\nstellar and nebular emission in an optical spectrum. Additionally, a\ncomparative analysis was carried on, by further processing the EELGs sample\nwith the purely stellar spectral synthesis code Starlight, and by extending the\nanalysis to a sample of 697 normal star-forming galaxies, expected to be less\naffected by nebular contribution. We find that, for both galaxy samples,\nstellar mass and mean age estimates by Starlight are systematically biased\ntowards higher values, and that an adequate determination of the physical and\nevolutionary properties of EELGs via spectral synthesis is only possible when\nnebular continuum emission is taken into account. Moreover, the differences\nbetween the two population synthesis codes can be ascribed to the degree of\nstar-formation activity through the specific star-formation rate and the sum of\nthe flux of the most prominent emission lines. As expected, on the basis of the\ntheoretical framework, our results emphasise the importance of considering the\nnebular emission while performing spectral synthesis, even for galaxies hosting\ntypical levels of star-formation activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 13:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

We begin with a typical interstellar dust grain size distribution\nand study dust growth during the collapse of a molecular cloud core and the\nevolution of the first hydrostatic core, prior to the formation of the stellar\ncore. We examine how the dust size distribution evolves both spatially and\ntemporarily.

However, once the\nfirst hydrostatic core forms rapid dust growth to sizes in excess of $100~\\mu$m\noccurs within the core (before stellar core formation). Progressively larger\ngrains are produced at smaller distances from the centre of the core. In\nrapidly-rotating molecular cloud cores, the `first hydrostatic core' that forms\nis better described as a pre-stellar disc that may be gravitationally unstable.\nIn such cases, grain growth is more rapid in the spiral density waves leading\nto the larger grains being preferentially found in the spiral waves even though\nthere is no migration of grains relative to the gas.

We focus on the\ntask of identifying differences between noisy point clouds based on small scale\ncharacteristics, while disregarding large scale information such as overall\nsize. We propose an approach based on a transformation of the data via the\nso-called Distance-to-Measure (DTM) function, a transformation which is based\non the average of nearest neighbor distances. For each data set, we estimate\nthe probability density of average local distances of all data points and use\nthe estimated densities for classification.

In fact, the transformed data are stochastically dependent in a\nnon-local way that is not captured by commonly considered dependence measures.\nNonetheless, we show that the asymptotic behaviour of the density estimator is\ndriven by a kernel density estimator of certain i.i.d. random variables by\nusing theoretical properties of U-statistics, which allows to handle the\ndependencies via a Hoeffding decomposition.

The value of\nthe surface tension is correlated with the slip length of the fluid and\nexplained in terms of the effective and interfacial density, hydration pressure\nand friction coefficient.

In this work, we aim to bridge the conceptual gap\nbetween established time series approaches, such as the Heterogeneous\nAutoregressive (HAR) model, and state-of-the-art deep neural network models.\nThe newly introduced HARNet is based on a hierarchy of dilated convolutional\nlayers, which facilitates an exponential growth of the receptive field of the\nmodel in the number of model parameters. HARNets allow for an explicit\ninitialization scheme such that before optimization, a HARNet yields identical\npredictions as the respective baseline HAR model.

This approach enables the solution of partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) via embedding physical laws into the loss\nfunction. Many inverse problems can be tackled by simply combining the data\nfrom real life scenarios with existing PINN algorithms. In this paper, we\npresent a multi-task learning method using uncertainty weighting to improve the\ntraining efficiency and accuracy of PINNs for inverse problems in linear\nelasticity and hyperelasticity. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of\nPINNs to a practical inverse problem in structural analysis: prediction of\nexternal loads of diverse engineering structures based on limited displacement\nmonitoring points. To this end, we first determine a simplified loading\nscenario at the offline stage. By setting unknown boundary conditions as\nlearnable parameters, PINNs can predict the external loads with the support of\nmeasured data. When it comes to the online stage in real engineering projects,\ntransfer learning is employed to fine-tune the pre-trained model from offline\nstage. Our results show that, even with noisy gappy data, satisfactory results\ncan still be obtained from the PINN model due to the dual regularization of\nphysics laws and prior knowledge, which exhibits better robustness compared to\ntraditional analysis methods. Our approach is capable of bridging the gap\nbetween various structures with geometric scaling and under different loading\nscenarios, and the convergence of training is also greatly accelerated through\nnot only the layer freezing but also the multi-task weight inheritance from\npre-trained models, thus making it possible to be applied as surrogate models\nin actual engineering projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 14:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 15:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 17:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

We propose a methodology to quantitatively investigate the\neffectiveness of software updates strategies against attacks of Advanced\nPersistent Threats (APTs). We consider strategies where the vendor updates are\nthe only limiting factors to cases in which enterprises delay updates from 1 to\n7 months based on SANS data.

It includes information about\nattack vectors, exploited vulnerabilities (e.g. 0-days vs public\nvulnerabilities), and affected software and versions. Contrary to common\nbelief, most APT campaigns employed publicly known vulnerabilities. If an\nenterprise could theoretically update as soon as an update is released, it\nwould face lower odds of being compromised than those waiting one (4.9x) or\nthree (9.1x) months. However, if attacked, it could still be compromised from\n14% to 33% of the times. As in practice enterprises must do regression testing\nbefore applying an update, our major finding is that one could perform 12% of\nall possible updates restricting oneself only to versions fixing publicly known\nvulnerabilities without significant changes to the odds of being compromised\ncompared to a company that updates for all versions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 15:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 09:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

Lumen and calcifications in\npre-stent images were segmented using deep learning, and numerous features per\nlesion were extracted. We analyzed stent expansion along the lesion, enabling\nframe, segmental, and whole-lesion analyses. We trained regression models to\npredict the poststent lumen area and then to compute the stent expansion index\n(SEI).

The first exercise\nbrute-forces an optimal candidate from the set of calibration methods for\nminimum error in inverse recovery. The second exercise, Kanpur Theorem-1 (KT-1)\nexamines if optimal calibration sets electronics to impart minimum noise. The\nmutual conformity between statistics-derived CLT and Riemann integral\ntransform-based KT-1 is shown first time using gamma radiation measurement. The\nanalysis shows that measurement data with normal distribution inflicts the\nleast noise in inverse recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 10:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Understanding and mitigating risk to downstream inhabited areas\nrequire developing and improving low-cost high-fidelity tools, such as\nnumerical models, which allow emergency managers to predict the consequences of\ndam failures better. Two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged hydraulic models can\nprovide valuable insights into the importance of breach parameters or\ndownstream flow characteristics, but historical studies considering historic\nfailures using real topographies are less common in literature. This study\ncompares Geoclaw, a 2D hydraulic model with adaptive mesh refinement\ncapabilities, to an industry-standard software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering\nCenter - River Analysis System) using the 1976 Teton Dam failure as a case\nstudy. The suitability of Geoclaw for dam failure modeling is determined based\non its capability to resolve inundation extent and flood wave arrival times.\nThis study performs sensitivity analyses of the HEC-RAS model to compare an\ninstantaneous dam breach assumption with a time-dependent breach formation for\nquantifying the model uncertainty. We find the 2D Geoclaw dam-break model\nresults compare reasonably with historical gauge and field observational data\nand HEC-RAS results. The model demonstrates stability and relatively low\ncomputational costs. Our findings highlight opportunities for future work, with\nthe Geoclaw software performance supporting continued studies to evaluate\nperformance. Outcomes of this study will assist dam owners, floodplain\nmanagers, and emergency managers by providing an additional tool for estimating\nthe impacts of dam failures to protect lives and infrastructure downstream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 22:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 13:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, these methods\ngenerally tend to have a higher computational load than conventional mesh-based\nmethods because calculation stencils for spatial discretization become large.\nIn this study, a novel approach for the use of compact stencils in meshless\nmethods is proposed, called the mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) approach.\nThe MCD approach introduces a Cartesian mesh system to the background of a\ndomain. And the approach rigorously constrains the distribution of discrete\npoints (DPs) in each mesh by solving a dynamic problem with nonlinear\nconstraints. This can avoid the heterogeneity of the DP distribution at the\nmesh-size level and impose compact stencils with a fixed degree of freedom for\nderivative evaluations. A fundamental formulation for arrangements of DPs and\nan application to unsteady Stokes flows are presented in this paper. Numerical\ntests were performed for the distribution of DPs and flow problems in co-axial\nand eccentric circular channels. The proposed MCD approach achieved a\nreasonable distribution of DPs independently of the spatial resolution with a\nfew iterations in pre-processing. Additionally, solutions using the obtained DP\ndistributions in Stokes flow problems were in good agreement with theoretical\nand reference solutions. The results also confirmed that the numerical\naccuracies of velocity and pressure achieved the expected convergence order,\neven when compact stencils were used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 05:26:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 08:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}
