Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of the\nrecent advances in this field. One popular CNN-based approach involves the\napplication of generated kernels to the input frames to obtain an interpolated\nframe. Despite all the benefits interpolation methods offer, many of these\nnetworks require a lot of parameters, with more parameters meaning a heavier\ncomputational burden. Reducing the size of the model typically impacts\nperformance negatively. This paper presents a method for parameter reduction\nfor a popular flow-less kernel-based network (Adaptive Collaboration of Flows).\nThrough our technique of removing the layers that require the most parameters\nand replacing them with smaller encoders, we reduce the number of parameters of\nthe network and even achieve better performance compared to the original\nmethod. This is achieved by deploying rotation to force each individual encoder\nto learn different features from the input images.

The decrease in the EROI raises questions about meeting\nthe climate targets without adverse socio-economic impact.

Agents learn to produce resources in a\nspatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that\nthey prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing\nbehaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by\nsupply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where\nthe agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local\nabundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then\ndiscover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different\nprevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where\nthey are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of\nablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards,\nbartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods\ncan either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior.

Higher-order phase-field\nmodels have also been proposed to increase the regularity of the exact solution\nand thus increase the spatial convergence rate of its numerical approximation.\nHowever, they require special numerical techniques to enforce the necessary\ncontinuity of the phase field solution. In this paper, we derive a fourth-order\nphase-field model of fracture in two independent ways; namely, from Hamilton's\nprinciple and from a higher-order micromechanics-based approach. The latter\napproach is novel, and provides a physical interpretation of the higher-order\nterms in the model.

In this work, we elucidate the equivalence of these two seemingly\ndistinct perspectives by identifying an underlying symmetry, which we dub\nmismatch symmetry, that exists for any twist angle. For commensurate angles,\nthis is a discrete symmetry whereas for incommensurate angles, it is equivalent\nto a continuous phase symmetry giving rise to phason modes. In the small angle\nlimit, such symmetry becomes a continuous local symmetry whose spontaneous\nbreaking gives rise to Moir\\'e phonons as its Goldstone mode.

We propose\nSemiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression modeling (SGCRM) that allows to model\na joint dependence structure between observed continuous, truncated, ordinal,\nand binary variables and to construct conditional models with these four data\ntypes as outcomes with a guarantee that derived conditional models are mutually\nconsistent.

In this paper, we propose a\nnew and simple automatic evaluation method for NLG called Near-Negative\nDistinction (NND) that repurposes prior human annotations into NND tests. In an\nNND test, an NLG model must place a higher likelihood on a high-quality output\ncandidate than on a near-negative candidate with a known error. Model\nperformance is established by the number of NND tests a model passes, as well\nas the distribution over task-specific errors the model fails on. Through\nexperiments on three NLG tasks (question generation, question answering, and\nsummarization), we show that NND achieves a higher correlation with human\njudgments than standard NLG evaluation metrics.

Consequently, deep learning-based\nsuper-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has emerged as a promising solution for\ngenerating super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution (LR) images.\nUnfortunately, training such neural networks requires aligned authentic HR and\nLR image pairs, which are challenging to obtain due to patient movements during\nand between image acquisitions. While rigid movements of hard tissues can be\ncorrected with image registration, aligning deformed soft tissues is complex,\nmaking it impractical to train neural networks with authentic HR and LR image\npairs. Previous studies have focused on SRR using authentic HR images and\ndown-sampled synthetic LR images.

In this paper, we focus on the post-training backdoor\ndefense scenario commonly considered in the literature, where the defender aims\nto detect whether a trained classifier was backdoor attacked, without any\naccess to the training set. To the best of our knowledge, existing\npost-training backdoor defenses are all designed for BAs with presumed BP\ntypes, where each BP type has a specific embedding function. They may fail when\nthe actual BP type used by the attacker (unknown to the defender) is different\nfrom the BP type assumed by the defender. In contrast, we propose a universal\npost-training defense that detects BAs with arbitrary types of BPs, without\nmaking any assumptions about the BP type. Our detector leverages the influence\nof the BA, independently of the BP type, on the landscape of the classifier's\noutputs prior to the softmax layer. For each class, a maximum margin statistic\nis estimated using a set of random vectors; detection inference is then\nperformed by applying an unsupervised anomaly detector to these statistics.\nThus, our detector is also an advance relative to most existing post-training\nmethods by not needing any legitimate clean samples, and can efficiently detect\nBAs with arbitrary numbers of source classes. These advantages of our detector\nover several state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated on four datasets, for\nthree different types of BPs, and for a variety of attack configurations.\nFinally, we propose a novel, general approach for BA mitigation once a\ndetection is made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 21:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows\nrapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through\ndeep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in\ndifferent wind conditions share a common representation and that the\nwind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly\nuses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant\nmeta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12\nminutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly\nthen uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for\nmixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions\ngenerated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to\n43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight\ncontrol with substantially smaller tracking error than state-of-the-art\nnonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical\nperformance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness\nguarantees.

Control\nstrategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small number of AVs\n(less than 5\\% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that\ncan smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves. This\nin turn may reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n  The lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as\nparameters in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of\nthese parameters in the lane-change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic\naccurately, because different parameter values can lead to drastically\ndifferent traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the\nspeed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. Despite this\nmodeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs,\nthe stabilization of uniform flow steady-state is effective for any realistic\nvalue of the parameters, and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue.\nOur approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models, which\nallows a limit procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology,\nmean-field.

Two models have been proposed for the formation\nof the giant planets,the core accretion model and the disk instability model.\nThe heavy element enrichment, core size, and internal structure of Saturn,\ncompared to Jupiter strongly favor the core accretion model as for Jupiter. Two\nfeatures of the core accretion model that are distinct from the disk\ninstability model are the growth of a core with a mass several times that of\nthe Earth, followed by runaway collapse of gas onto the core once a mass\nthreshold is reached. The heavy element core grows slowly over millions of\nyears through accretion of cm-m sized pebbles, even larger bodies, and moon\nsized embryos in the gaseous disk. The abundance pattern of heavy elements is\nthus a key constraint on formation models. C, N, S, and P at Saturn are\npresently known to varying degree of uncertainty. The He to H ratio in the\natmosphere is crucial for understanding heat balance, interior processes, and\nplanetary evolution, but present values at Saturn range from low to high,\nallowing for a wide range of possibilities.

Based on our findings, we advocate for empirical\nresearch on how MT systems are used in practice as an important first step to\naddressing the challenges in building appropriate trust between users and MT\ntools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 23:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

The formal\nfoundation of Ferrite constitutes the shared session type calculus $\\sills$,\nwhich Ferrite encodes via a novel \\emph{judgmental embedding} technique. The\nfulcrum of the embedding is the notion of a typing judgment that allows\nreasoning about shared and linear resources to type a session. Typing rules are\nthen encoded as functions over judgments, with a valid typing derivation\nmanifesting as a well-typed Rust program. This Rust program generated by\nFerrite serves as a \\emph{certificate}, ensuring that the application will\nproceed according to the protocol defined by the session type.

The first flow model is a normalizing flow that transforms an initial\nsimple density to a target density by applying a sequence of invertible\ntransformations. The second flow model is a Langevin flow that runs finite\nsteps of gradient-based MCMC toward an energy-based model. We start from\nproposing a generative framework that trains an energy-based model with a\nnormalizing flow as an amortized sampler to initialize the MCMC chains of the\nenergy-based model. In each learning iteration, we generate synthesized\nexamples by using a normalizing flow initialization followed by a short-run\nLangevin flow revision toward the current energy-based model. Then we treat the\nsynthesized examples as fair samples from the energy-based model and update the\nmodel parameters with the maximum likelihood learning gradient, while the\nnormalizing flow directly learns from the synthesized examples by maximizing\nthe tractable likelihood. Under the short-run non-mixing MCMC scenario, the\nestimation of the energy-based model is shown to follow the perturbation of\nmaximum likelihood, and the short-run Langevin flow and the normalizing flow\nform a two-flow generator that we call CoopFlow. We provide an understating of\nthe CoopFlow algorithm by information geometry and show that it is a valid\ngenerator as it converges to a moment matching estimator. We demonstrate that\nthe trained CoopFlow is capable of synthesizing realistic images,\nreconstructing images, and interpolating between images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 23:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Nevertheless, localizing the perfect destination\nwithin the last few meters remains an important but unresolved problem. Limited\nby the GPS positioning accuracy, navigation systems always show users a\nvicinity of a destination, but not its exact location. Street view images (SVI)\nin maps as an immersive media technology have served as an aid to provide the\nphysical environment for human last-meters wayfinding. However, due to the\nlarge diversity of geographic context and acquisition conditions, the captured\nSVI always contains various distracting objects (e.g., pedestrians and\nvehicles), which will distract human visual attention from efficiently finding\nthe destination in the last few meters. To address this problem, we highlight\nthe importance of reducing visual distraction in image-based wayfinding by\nproposing a saliency-guided image inpainting framework. It aims at redirecting\nhuman visual attention from distracting objects to destination-related objects\nfor more efficient and accurate wayfinding in the last meters. Specifically, a\ncontext-aware distracting object detection method driven by deep salient object\ndetection has been designed to extract distracting objects from three semantic\nlevels in SVI. Then we employ a large-mask inpainting method with fast Fourier\nconvolutions to remove the detected distracting objects. Experimental results\nwith both qualitative and quantitative analysis show that our saliency-guided\ninpainting method can not only achieve great perceptual quality in street view\nimages but also redirect the human's visual attention to focus more on static\nlocation-related objects than distracting ones.

In these\ndomains, high-stake decisions provided by machine learning necessitate\nresearchers to design interpretable models, where the prediction is\nunderstandable to a human. In interpretable machine learning, rule-based\nclassifiers are particularly effective in representing the decision boundary\nthrough a set of rules comprising input features. The interpretability of\nrule-based classifiers is in general related to the size of the rules, where\nsmaller rules are considered more interpretable. To learn such a classifier,\nthe brute-force direct approach is to consider an optimization problem that\ntries to learn the smallest classification rule that has close to maximum\naccuracy. This optimization problem is computationally intractable due to its\ncombinatorial nature and thus, the problem is not scalable in large datasets.\nTo this end, in this paper we study the triangular relationship among the\naccuracy, interpretability, and scalability of learning rule-based classifiers.\n  The contribution of this paper is an interpretable learning framework IMLI,\nthat is based on maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) for synthesizing\nclassification rules expressible in proposition logic.

Due to multiple rounds\nof iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station\n(BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL\nfor edge-intelligent networks.

The distribution of pairwise distances is shown to obey a separable\ndependence on the magnitude and the polar angle of the separation vector.\nMagnitude dependence obeys a power-law with a negative exponent, manifesting\nmultifractality of the droplet's attractor.

The\nangular dependence of the RDF exhibits a maximum at small angles quantifying\nparticle's formation of spatial columns. We derive the droplet's collision\nkernel using that in the considered limit the gradients of droplet's flow are\nGaussian. We demonstrate that as Re increases the column's aspect ratio\ndecreases, eventually becoming one when the isotropy is restored.

(2021) introduced a latent space item response model\n(LSIRM) for binary item response data by assuming that items and respondents\nare embedded in an unobserved metric space, called an interaction map, where\nthe probability of a correct response decreasing as a function of the distance\nbetween the respondent's and the item's position in the latent space. The R\npackage lsirm12pl implements the original and extended versions of LSIRM, while\nsupplying several flexible modeling options: (1) an extension to the\ntwo-parameter model; (2) an extension to continuous item responses; and (3)\nhandling missing responses. The R package lsirm12pl also offers convenient\nfunctions for visualizing estimated results, including the interaction map that\nrepresents item and person positions and their interactions. In this paper, we\nprovide a brief overview of the methodological basis of LSIRM and describe the\nextensions that are considered in the package. We then showcase the use of the\npackage lsirm12pl with real data examples that are contained in the package.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 07:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Numerous centrality measures have been proposed\nfor identifying and ranking the nodes according to their importance. Classical\ncentrality measures rely on various local or global properties of the nodes.\nThey do not take into account the network community structure. Recently, a\ngrowing number of researches have shifted to community-aware centrality\nmeasures. Indeed, it is a ubiquitous feature in a vast majority of real-world\nnetworks. In the literature, the focus is on designing community-aware\ncentrality measures. However, up to now, there is no systematic evaluation of\ntheir effectiveness. This study fills this gap. It allows answering which\ncommunity-aware centrality measure should be used in practical situations. We\ninvestigate seven influential community-aware centrality measures in an\nepidemic spreading process scenario using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\n(SIR) model on a set of fifteen real-world networks. Results show that\ngenerally, the correlation between community-aware centrality measures is low.\nFurthermore, in a multiple-spreader problem, when resources are available,\ntargeting distant hubs using Modularity Vitality is more effective.

According to this rule, we propose\nthe first class of potential ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals in a\ndistorted {\\alpha}-La-like structure with a polar space group P63mc in which\ntwo inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, z) and 2b (1/3, 2/3, z) are\noccupied by group-V elements (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth).\nAnalyses based on first-principles calculations indicate that the dynamically\nstable polar phase results from a lone pair driven polar distortion of the\nnonploar phase in P63/mmc symmetry where two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a\n(0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) are occupied.

In\nparticular for KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ it is 0.75 hole on Fe-3d states.\nSurprisingly, for the KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ it was found that except the\nFe-3d bands the O-2p bands also cross the Fermi level, which is quite anomalous\nbehavior for O-2p states. In general, the O-2p states are usually fully\noccupied in transition metal oxides. Here it is not the case due to the fact\nthat CaO layer gives some of the electrons to the FeAs layer, thus leaving O-2p\nstates partially occupied. The O-2p states form additional Fermi surface sheet\nwith propeller-like shape around $\\Gamma$-point and modify the Fe-3d Fermi\nsurface sheets due to the hybridization. To prove the presence of anomalous\nmetallic O-2p band in KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$ the comparative study with the\nsame family systems KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ and RbGd$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$\n(where it is not the case) was performed.

VRCockpit is a visual technique that surrounds the player\nwith four 2D views, one for each cardinal direction, that show 2D copies of the\nareas of the 3D environment around the player. To study its effectiveness, we\nconducted two different experiments, one with a car racing game, followed by a\nfirst-person shooter game. Our results show that VRCockpit has the potential to\nmitigate SS and still allows players to have the same level of immersion and\ngameplay performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 11:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 03:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

To enable radial velocity (RV) precision on the order of ~0.1 m/s\nrequired for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting solar-type stars,\nthe main obstacle lies in mitigating the impact of stellar activity. Aims. This\nstudy investigates the dependence of derived RVs with respect to the formation\ntemperature of spectral line segments. Methods. Using spectral synthesis, we\ncompute for each observed wavelength point of unblended spectral lines the\nstellar temperature below which 50% of the emergent flux originates. We can\nthen construct RV time series for different temperature ranges, using template\nmatching. Results. With HARPS-N solar data and HARPS $\\alpha$ Cen B\nmeasurements, we demonstrate on time intervals of prominent stellar activity\nthat the activity-induced RV signal has different amplitude and periodicity\ndepending on the temperature range considered.

Conclusions. From a carefully selected set of spectral lines,\nwe are able to measure the RV impact of stellar activity at various stellar\ntemperatures ranges. We are able to strongly correlate the effect of convective\nsuppression with spectral line segments formed in hotter temperature ranges.

Our dataset is generated\nby NViSII, a Python-based ray tracing renderer, which is designed to be simple\nfor non-experts to use and share, flexible and powerful through its use of\nscripting, and able to create high-quality and physically-based rendered\nimages.

For that reason, we developed the F1 hand, a single-motor\ngripper that facilitates teleoperation with the use of a fixed finger. The hand\nis capable of grasping objects as thin as a paper clip, and as heavy and large\nas a cordless drill. The applicability of the hand can be expanded by replacing\nthe fixed finger with different shapes. This flexibility makes the hand highly\nversatile while being easy and cheap to develop.

The standard definition of the\nT-reversal includes the change of the sign of time variable and replacement of\nthe initial state of the particle (system of particles) by the final state and\nvice versa. Since the time-reversal operation changes the state of a particle,\nthe particle's wave function cannot be the eigenfunction of the corresponding\noperator with a certain eigenvalue, as in the case of space parity. Unlike the\nCPT-transformation, the separate P, T, or C transformations cannot be reduced\nto any 4-rotation. The extended Lorentz group incorporates all the separate C,\nP, or T transformations which do not bring the time axis out of the\ncorresponding light cone. The latter restriction is included in the standard\ndefinition of the time-reversal. In the present communication, we ignore this\nrestriction.\n  This allows to introduce the \"time arrow\" operator and characterize every\nparticle by the new quantum number - \"time arrow\" value. The wave functions of\nall particles are eigenfunctions of this operator with eigenvalues equal to\n\"time arrow\" values. The particles with the \"time arrow\" values opposite to the\n\"time arrow\" value in our universe form another universe (anti-universe). The\nexistence of anti-universe can be confirmed, in principle, by laboratory\n(atomic) experiments. The anti-universe may be also considered as a candidate\nto the role of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 17:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}
