Within this framework, I identify a novel continuum model, which\nmakes individual-level probabilistic predictions.\n  This new model always has a unique stable outcome, which can be found using\nan analog of the Deferred Acceptance algorithm. The crucial difference between\nthis model and that of Azevedo and Leshno (2016) is that they assume that the\namount of student interest at each school is deterministic, whereas my proposed\nalternative assumes that it follows a Poisson distribution. As a result, this\nnew model accurately predicts the simulated distribution of cutoffs, even for\nmarkets with only ten schools and twenty students.\n  This model generates new insights about the number and quality of matches.\nWhen schools are homogeneous, it provides upper and lower bounds on students'\naverage rank, which match results from Ashlagi, Kanoria and Leshno (2017) but\napply to more general settings. This model also provides clean analytical\nexpressions for the number of matches in a platform pricing setting considered\nby Marx and Schummer (2021).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 16:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the\nprediction and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we\nmobilized half a hundred professional and amateur astronomers, and the\noccultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at 18 sites. This\nmakes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO\nin terms of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and\ngeometric albedo, and we also provide constraints on the density and other\ninternal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections of the occultation\nby Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an\nellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the\ninstantaneous limb) with kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and\nminor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using the occultation data are (a',\nb') = (217.6 $\\pm$ 3.5 km, 194.1 $\\pm$ 6.1 km) with a position angle of the\nminor axis P' = 55.2 $\\pm$ 9.1 degrees.

It is based on the idea that all items or item groups should get\nexposure proportional to the merit of the item or the collective merit of the\nitems in the group. Often, stochastic ranking policies are used to ensure\nfairness of exposure. Previous work unrealistically assumes that we can\nreliably estimate the expected exposure for all items in each ranking produced\nby the stochastic policy. In this work, we discuss how to approach fairness of\nexposure in cases where the policy contains rankings of which, due to\ninter-item dependencies, we cannot reliably estimate the exposure distribution.\nIn such cases, we cannot determine whether the policy can be considered fair.\nOur contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we define a method called\nFELIX for finding stochastic policies that avoid showing rankings with unknown\nexposure distribution to the user without having to compromise user utility or\nitem fairness. Second, we extend the study of fairness of exposure to the top-k\nsetting and also assess FELIX in this setting. We find that FELIX can\nsignificantly reduce the number of rankings with unknown exposure distribution\nwithout a drop in user utility or fairness compared to existing fair ranking\nmethods, both for full-length and top-k rankings. This is an important first\nstep in developing fair ranking methods for cases where we have incomplete\nknowledge about the user's behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 16:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

However, these methods generate intermediate GS frames\nthrough image warping based on the RS model, which inevitably result in black\nholes and noticeable motion artifacts. In this paper, we alleviate these issues\nby proposing a context-aware GS video reconstruction architecture.

Specifically, we first estimate the bilateral motion\nfield so that the pixels of the two RS frames are warped to a common GS frame\naccordingly.

Physical qubits have to be carefully calibrated because\nquantum processors are very sensitive to the external environment, with control\nhardware parameters slowly drifting during operation, affecting gate fidelity.\nCurrently, existing calibration techniques require complex and lengthy\nmeasurements to independently control the different parameters of each gate and\nare unscalable to large quantum systems. Therefore, fully automated protocols\nwith the desired functionalities are required to speed up the calibration\nprocess.

Rather than searching over structures, we train a\nvariational inference model to directly predict the causal structure from\nobservational or interventional data. This allows our inference model to\nacquire domain-specific inductive biases for causal discovery solely from data\ngenerated by a simulator, bypassing both the hand-engineering of suitable score\nfunctions and the search over graphs. The architecture of our inference model\nemulates permutation invariances that are crucial for statistical efficiency in\nstructure learning, which facilitates generalization to significantly larger\nproblem instances than seen during training. On synthetic data and\nsemisynthetic gene expression data, our models exhibit robust generalization\ncapabilities when subject to substantial distribution shifts and significantly\noutperform existing algorithms, especially in the challenging genomics domain.\nOur code and models are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/larslorch/avici.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 17:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 09:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 16:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 13:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

A\nprediction interval is considered valid if it covers the true response with (a\npre-specified) high probability. We first distinguish between two notions of\nvalidity in such a setting: cross-sectional and longitudinal. Cross-sectional\nvalidity is concerned with validity across the cross-section of the time series\ndata, while longitudinal validity accounts for the temporal dimension. Coverage\nguarantees along both these dimensions are ideally desirable; however, we show\nthat distribution-free longitudinal validity is theoretically impossible.\nDespite this limitation, we propose Conformal Prediction with Temporal\nDependence (CPTD), a procedure that is able to maintain strict cross-sectional\nvalidity while improving longitudinal coverage. CPTD is post-hoc and\nlight-weight, and can easily be used in conjunction with any prediction model\nas long as a calibration set is available.

Neutrinos could be produced in the decay or\nannihilation of galactic or extragalactic dark matter. Additionally, if an\ninteraction between dark matter and neutrinos exists then dark matter will\ninteract with extragalactic neutrinos. In particular galactic dark matter will\ninduce an anisotropy in the neutrino sky if this interaction is present. We use\nseven and a half years of the High-Energy Starting Event (HESE) sample data,\nwhich measures neutrinos in the energy range of approximately 60 TeV to 10 PeV,\nto study these phenomena. This all-sky event selection is dominated by\nextragalactic neutrinos. For dark matter of $\\sim$ 1 PeV in mass, we constrain\nthe velocity-averaged annihilation cross section to be smaller than\n$10^{-23}$cm$^3$/s for the exclusive $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ channel and $10^{-22}$\ncm$^3$/s for the $b\\bar b$ channel. For the same mass, we constrain the\nlifetime of dark matter to be larger than $10^{28}$ s for all channels studied,\nexcept for decaying exclusively to $b\\bar b$ where it is bounded to be larger\nthan $10^{27}$ s. Finally, we also search for evidence of astrophysical\nneutrinos scattering on galactic dark matter in two scenarios. For fermionic\ndark matter with a vector mediator, we constrain the dimensionless coupling\nassociated with this interaction to be less than 0.1 for dark matter mass of\n0.1 GeV and a mediator mass of $10^{-4}~$ GeV. In the case of scalar dark\nmatter with a fermionic mediator, we constrain the coupling to be less than 0.1\nfor dark matter and mediator masses below 1 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 17:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

To tackle this issue, we present a\nnovel and general-purpose Inception Transformer, or iFormer for short, that\neffectively learns comprehensive features with both high- and low-frequency\ninformation in visual data. Specifically, we design an Inception mixer to\nexplicitly graft the advantages of convolution and max-pooling for capturing\nthe high-frequency information to Transformers. Different from recent hybrid\nframeworks, the Inception mixer brings greater efficiency through a channel\nsplitting mechanism to adopt parallel convolution/max-pooling path and\nself-attention path as high- and low-frequency mixers, while having the\nflexibility to model discriminative information scattered within a wide\nfrequency range. Considering that bottom layers play more roles in capturing\nhigh-frequency details while top layers more in modeling low-frequency global\ninformation, we further introduce a frequency ramp structure, i.e. gradually\ndecreasing the dimensions fed to the high-frequency mixer and increasing those\nto the low-frequency mixer, which can effectively trade-off high- and\nlow-frequency components across different layers. We benchmark the iFormer on a\nseries of vision tasks, and showcase that it achieves impressive performance on\nimage classification, COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation.

To find on-shell wormholes we must stabilize\nthis modulus, which we can do by fixing the total energy on the two boundaries.\nSuch a wormhole gives the saddle point approximation to a non-standard problem\nin quantum gravity, where we fix two asymptotic boundaries and constrain the\ncommon energy. Crucially the dual quantity does not factorize even when the\nbulk is dual to a single CFT, on account of the fixed energy constraint. From\nthis quantity we extract a smeared version of the microcanonical spectral form\nfactor. For a chaotic theory this quantity is self-averaging, i.e.\nwell-approximated by averaging over energy windows, or over coupling constants.\n  We go on to give a precision test involving the microcanonical spectral form\nfactor where the two replicas have slightly different coupling constants. In\nchaotic theories this form factor is known to smoothly decay at a rate\nuniversally predicted in terms of one replica physics, provided that there is\nan average either over a window or over couplings. We compute the expected\ndecay rate for holographic theories, and the form factor from a wormhole, and\nthe two exactly agree for a wide range of two-derivative effective field\ntheories in AdS. This gives a precision test of averaging in AdS/CFT.\n  Our results interpret a number of confusing facts about wormholes and\nfactorization in AdS and suggest that we should regard gravitational effective\nfield theory as a mesoscopic description, analogous to semiclassical mesoscopic\ndescriptions of quantum chaotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

We perform detailed\ncompleteness and contamination analyses, and present measurements of the bright\nend of the UV luminosity function using a pseudo-binning technique. We find a\nnumber density consistent with results from Finkelstein et al. (2022) and other\nsearches in HST parallel fields. These bright candidates likely reside in\noverdensities, potentially representing some of the earliest sites of cosmic\nreionization. These new candidates are excellent targets for follow-up with\nJWST, and four of them will be observed with the NIRSpec prism in Cycle 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

One of the key ingredients for several tests is a metric that allows\nfor deviations from the Kerr solution but remains free of pathologies outside\nits event horizon. Existing metrics that have been used in the literature often\ndo not satisfy the null convergence condition that is necessary to apply the\nstrong rigidity theorem and would have allowed us to calculate the location of\nthe event horizon by identifying it with an appropriate Killing horizon. This\nhas led earlier calculations of event horizons of parametrically deformed\nmetrics to either follow numerical techniques or simply search heuristically\nfor coordinate singularities. We show that several of these metrics, almost by\nconstruction, are circular. We can, therefore, use the weak rigidity and\nCarter's rotosurface theorem and calculate algebraically the locations of their\nevent horizons, without relying on expansions or numerical techniques. We apply\nthis approach to a number of parametrically deformed metrics, calculate the\nlocations of their event horizons, and place constraints on the deviation\nparameters such that the metrics remain regular outside their horizons. We show\nthat calculating the angular velocity of the horizon and the effective gravity\nthere offers new insights into the observational signatures of deformed\nmetrics, such as the sizes and shapes of the predicted black-hole shadows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 18:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Previous approaches for\nscene-aware motion synthesis are constrained by pre-defined target objects or\npositions and thus limit the diversity of human-scene interactions for\nsynthesized motions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of synthesizing\ndiverse scene-aware human motions under the guidance of target action\nsequences. To achieve this, we first decompose the diversity of scene-aware\nhuman motions into three aspects, namely interaction diversity (e.g. sitting on\ndifferent objects with different poses in the given scenes), path diversity\n(e.g. moving to the target locations following different paths), and the motion\ndiversity (e.g. having various body movements during moving). Based on this\nfactorized scheme, a hierarchical framework is proposed, with each sub-module\nresponsible for modeling one aspect. We assess the effectiveness of our\nframework on two challenging datasets for scene-aware human motion synthesis.\nThe experiment results show that the proposed framework remarkably outperforms\nprevious methods in terms of diversity and naturalness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 18:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

These include a two-set\nbinarization scheme, a novel elastic binary activation function with learned\nparameters, and a method to quantize a network to its limit by successively\ndistilling higher precision models into lower precision students. These\napproaches allow for the first time, fully binarized transformer models that\nare at a practical level of accuracy, approaching a full-precision BERT\nbaseline on the GLUE language understanding benchmark within as little as 5.9%.\nCode and models are available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/bit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 19:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 19:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

To that end, it is equally important to\nhave extinction correction performed properly. This means that the physical\nconditions of the target sources -- the very quantities to be derived via\nplasma diagnostics -- must be known even before performing extinction\ncorrection, because the degree of extinction is usually determined by comparing\nthe observed spectra of the target sources with their theoretically predicted\ncounterparts. One way to resolve this conundrum is to perform both extinction\ncorrection and plasma diagnostics together by iteratively seeking a converged\nsolution. In fact, if these analyses are performed self-consistently, a\nconverged solution can be found based solely on well-calibrated line\nintensities, given the adopted extinction law and the R_V value. However, it is\nstill rare to find these analyses done numerically rigorously from start to\nfinish. In this contribution for the APN 8e conference, we would like to review\nthis convoluted problem and sort out critical issues based on the results of\nour recent experiments. It appears that the convoluted theoretical and\nobservational progresses exacerbated by the highly numerical nature of these\nanalyses necessitated a number of analytical simplifications to make the\nproblem analytically tractable in the pre-computer era and that such analytical\nsimplifications still remain rampant in the literature today even after ample\ncomputational resources became readily available.

Deep generative models (DGMs) are widely used to learn data\nrepresentations in an unsupervised way. DGMs parameterize the underlying\nlow-dimensional manifold in the data space using bottleneck architectures such\nas variational autoencoders (VAEs). The bottleneck dimension for VAEs is\ntreated as a hyperparameter that depends on the dataset and is fixed at design\ntime after extensive tuning. As the intrinsic dimensionality of most real-world\ndatasets is unknown, often, there is a mismatch between the intrinsic\ndimensionality and the latent dimensionality chosen as a hyperparameter. This\nmismatch can negatively contribute to the model performance for representation\nlearning and sample generation tasks. This paper proposes relevance encoding\nnetworks (RENs): a novel probabilistic VAE-based framework that uses the\nautomatic relevance determination (ARD) prior in the latent space to learn the\ndata-specific bottleneck dimensionality. The relevance of each latent dimension\nis directly learned from the data along with the other model parameters using\nstochastic gradient descent and a reparameterization trick adapted to\nnon-Gaussian priors.

It has been found that KN has two families $-$ the photon sphere and\nthe near-horizon families $-$ of quasinormal modes (QNMs), which display the\ninteresting phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion. The perturbation equations, in\nspite of being a coupled system of two PDEs, are amenable to an analytic\nsolution using the method of separation of variables in a near-horizon\nexpansion around the extremal KN black hole. This leads to an analytical\nformula for the QNM frequencies that provides an excellent approximation to the\nnumerical data near-extremality. In the present manuscript we provide an\nextended study of these properties that were not detailed in the original\nstudies.

Instead, quantum circuits will be implemented directly using the physical\nnative gate set of the device. These native gates often have a parameterization\n(e.g., rotation angles) which provide the ability to perform a continuous range\nof operations. Verification of the correct operation of these gates across the\nallowable range of parameters is important for gaining confidence in the\nreliability of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate a procedure for\nsample-efficient verification of continuously-parameterized quantum gates for\nsmall quantum processors of up to approximately 10 qubits. This procedure\ninvolves generating random sequences of randomly-parameterized layers of gates\nchosen from the native gate set of the device, and then stochastically\ncompiling an approximate inverse to this sequence such that executing the full\nsequence on the device should leave the system near its initial state. We show\nthat fidelity estimates made via this technique have a lower variance than\nfidelity estimates made via cross-entropy benchmarking. This provides an\nexperimentally-relevant advantage in sample efficiency when estimating the\nfidelity loss to some desired precision.

To\nachieve high-parallelism, we want to process as many objects as possible in\nparallel. The goal is to achieve $\\tilde{O}(D)$ span for a problem with the\ndeepest dependence length $D$.

A state-of-the-art approach for\nthis purpose infers a weighted dynamic aging-specific subnetwork by mapping\ngene expression (GE) levels at different ages onto the protein-protein\ninteraction network (PPIN). Then, it analyzes this subnetwork in a supervised\nmanner by training a predictive model to learn how network topologies of known\naging- vs. non-aging-related genes change across ages. Finally, it uses the\ntrained model to predict novel aging-related genes. However, the best current\nsubnetwork resulting from this approach still yields suboptimal prediction\naccuracy. This could be because it was inferred using outdated GE and PPIN\ndata. Here, we evaluate whether analyzing a weighted dynamic aging-specific\nsubnetwork inferred from newer GE and PPIN data improves prediction accuracy\nupon analyzing the best current subnetwork inferred from outdated data.\nUnexpectedly, we find that not to be the case. To understand this, we perform\naging-related pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses. We find\nthat the suboptimal prediction accuracy, regardless of which GE or PPIN data is\nused, may be caused by the current knowledge about which genes are\naging-related being incomplete, or by the current methods for inferring or\nanalyzing an aging-specific subnetwork being unable to capture all of the\naging-related knowledge.

In the extensive numerical experiments, (i) TWA achieves consistent\nimprovements over SWA with less sensitivity to learning rate; (ii) applying TWA\nin the head stage of training largely speeds up the convergence, resulting in\nover 40% time saving on CIFAR and 30% on ImageNet with improved generalization\ncompared with regular training.

The success of\nclass-specific diffractive cameras was experimentally demonstrated using\nterahertz (THz) waves and 3D-printed diffractive layers that selectively imaged\nonly one class of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, all-optically erasing\nthe other handwritten digits. This diffractive camera design can be scaled to\ndifferent parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including, e.g., the visible\nand infrared wavelengths, to provide transformative opportunities for\nprivacy-preserving digital cameras and task-specific data-efficient imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 03:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

In\nreal scenarios, users often take a sequence of actions to interact with an\nitem, in order to get more information about the item and thus accurately\nevaluate whether an item fits personal preference. Those interaction behaviors\noften obey a certain order, and different behaviors reveal different\ninformation or aspects of user preferences towards the target item. Most\nexisting multi-behavior recommendation methods take the strategy to first\nextract information from different behaviors separately and then fuse them for\nfinal prediction. However, they have not exploited the connections between\ndifferent behaviors to learn user preferences. Besides, they often introduce\ncomplex model structures and more parameters to model multiple behaviors,\nlargely increasing the space and time complexity. In this work, we propose a\nlightweight multi-behavior recommendation model named Cascading Residual Graph\nConvolutional Network (CRGCN for short), which can explicitly exploit the\nconnections between different behaviors into the embedding learning process\nwithout introducing any additional parameters. In particular, we design a\ncascading residual graph convolutional network structure, which enables our\nmodel to learn user preferences by continuously refining user embeddings across\ndifferent types of behaviors.

Our framework is\ncollected under the name deep video semantic transmission (DVST).

Existing masked image modeling (MIM) methods for hierarchical\nVision Transformers replace a random subset of input tokens with a special\n[MASK] symbol and aim at reconstructing original image tokens from the\ncorrupted image. However, we find that using the [MASK] symbol greatly slows\ndown the training and causes pretraining-finetuning inconsistency, due to the\nlarge masking ratio (e.g., 60% in SimMIM). On the other hand, MAE does not\nintroduce [MASK] tokens at its encoder at all but is not applicable for\nhierarchical Vision Transformers. To solve the issue and accelerate the\npretraining of hierarchical models, we replace the masked tokens of one image\nwith visible tokens of another image, i.e., creating a mixed image. We then\nconduct dual reconstruction to reconstruct the two original images from the\nmixed input, which significantly improves efficiency.

The present work widens the mission\ndesign space to 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload and 0.0001-0.99 c cruise velocity.\nDrawing up to 5 GW directly from the grid (to augment power drawn from local\nenergy storage) turns out to be the key to making small missions affordable: It\ncollapses the accelerating laser's capital cost by up to 5 orders of magnitude,\nenabling new possibilities such as a 10 kg Solar system cubesat that\naccelerates to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) using a 77 m sail and \\$610M laser, costing\n\\$58M worth of energy per mission.\n  Trajectory equations describing lightsail acceleration are derived in closed\nform and used instead of numerical integration. Consequently, analyses have\nprogressed from single point designs to whole performance maps comprised of\nthousands of cost-optimized point designs. The performance maps reveal\nqualitatively different regimes characterized by the particular constraint that\ndrives cost, and these driving constraints change depending on mission payload\nmass and cruise velocity.\n  The performance maps also reveal a family of cost-optimal missions that\naccelerate at Earth gravity: The heaviest such mission is a 7.4 km diameter 100\nkt vessel (equivalent to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated\nfor 21 days to achieve 0.07 c, reaching the Centauri system within a human\nlifetime. While unthinkable at this time, the required 380 PW peak radiated\npower (twice terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or\nfusion within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate\nsuch missions using laser-accelerated lightsails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 04:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 08:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 19:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 19:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 19:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

When training such representations, it is\noften the case that computational and statistical constraints for each\ndownstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity\nrepresentations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand.\nThis leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to\nmultiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main\ncontribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes\ninformation at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt\nto the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies\nexisting representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost\nduring inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that\nare at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional\nrepresentations.

It is widely used by researchers\nand practitioners to collect ground truth and evaluate the maliciousness of\nentities. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of VT URL scanning\nreports containing the results of 95 scanners for 1.577 Billion URLs over two\nyears. Individual VT scanners are known to be noisy in terms of their detection\nand attack type classification. To obtain high quality ground truth of URLs and\nactively take proper actions to mitigate different types of attacks, there are\ntwo challenges: (1) how to decide whether a given URL is malicious given noisy\nreports and (2) how to determine attack types (e.g., phishing or malware\nhosting) that the URL is involved in, given conflicting attack labels from\ndifferent scanners. In this work, we provide a systematic comparative study on\nthe behavior of VT scanners for different attack types of URLs. A common\npractice to decide the maliciousness is to use a cut-off threshold of scanners\nthat report the URL as malicious. However, in this work, we show that using a\nfixed threshold is suboptimal, due to several reasons: (1) correlations between\nscanners; (2) lead/lag behavior; (3) the specialty of scanners; (4) the quality\nand reliability of scanners.

Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a\nfull-duplex (FD) jammer capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and\nsubsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable\ncommunication amidst a strong adversary, we propose non-coherent fast-forward\nfull-duplex relaying scheme wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to\nfast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the\ncountermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the\nconstellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent\nconstellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the\ncooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an\noptimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim\nand the helper such that the symbol-error-probability at the base station is\nminimized.

However, accurate liver tumor segmentation\nremains challenging due to the large variability of tumor sizes and\ninhomogeneous texture. Recent advances based on Fully Convolutional Network\n(FCN) for medical image segmentation drew on the success of learning\ndiscriminative pyramid features. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Pyramid\nCorrelation Network (DPC-Net) that exploits attention mechanisms to fully\nleverage both low- and high-level features embedded in FCN to segment liver\ntumor. Methods: We first design a powerful Pyramid Feature Encoder (PFE) to\nextract multi-level features from input images. Then we decouple the\ncharacteristics of features concerning spatial dimension (i.e., height, width,\ndepth) and semantic dimension (i.e., channel). On top of that, we present two\ntypes of attention modules, Spatial Correlation (SpaCor) and Semantic\nCorrelation (SemCor) modules, to recursively measure the correlation of\nmulti-level features. The former selectively emphasizes global semantic\ninformation in low-level features with the guidance of high-level ones. The\nlatter adaptively enhance spatial details in high-level features with the\nguidance of low-level ones. Results: We evaluate the DPC-Net on MICCAI 2017\nLiTS Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge dataset. Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC) and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) are employed\nfor evaluation. The proposed method obtains a DSC of 76.4% and an ASSD of 0.838\nmm for liver tumor segmentation, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

The\naforementioned binary stellar parameters are all correlated with\nlog$L_{\\textrm{X}}$, while only $T_{\\rm eff}$ exhibits a strong correlation\nwith log($L_{\\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\\textrm{bol}}$). Then, EWXs with higher\ntemperature show lower X-ray activity level, which could indicate the thinning\nof the convective area related to the magnetic dynamo mechanism. The total\nX-ray luminosity of an EWX is essentially consistent with that of an X-ray\nsaturated main sequence star with the same mass as its primary, which may imply\nthat the primary star dominates the X-ray emission. The monotonically\ndecreasing $P$-log($L_{\\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\\textrm{bol}}$) relation and the short\norbital periods indicate that EWXs could all be in the X-ray saturated state,\nand they may inherit the changing trend of the saturated X-ray luminosities\nalong with the mass shown by single stars. For EWXs, the orbital period, mass,\nand effective temperature increase in concordance. We demonstrate that the\nperiod $P=0.44$ days corresponds to the primary mass of $\\sim1.1 \\rm M_\\odot$,\nbeyond which the saturated X-ray luminosity of single stars will not continue\nto increase with mass.

Their efficient designs are mostly guided by\nthe indirect metric of computational complexity, i.e., FLOPs, which however has\na clear gap with the direct metric such as throughput. Thus, we propose to use\nthe direct speed evaluation on the target platform as the design principle for\nefficient ViTs. Particularly, we introduce LITv2, a simple and effective ViT\nwhich performs favourably against the existing state-of-the-art methods across\na spectrum of different model sizes with faster speed. At the core of LITv2 is\na novel self-attention mechanism, which we dub HiLo. HiLo is inspired by the\ninsight that high frequencies in an image capture local fine details and low\nfrequencies focus on global structures, whereas a multi-head self-attention\nlayer neglects the characteristic of different frequencies. Therefore, we\npropose to disentangle the high/low frequency patterns in an attention layer by\nseparating the heads into two groups, where one group encodes high frequencies\nvia self-attention within each local window, and another group encodes low\nfrequencies by performing global attention between the average-pooled\nlow-frequency keys and values from each window and each query position in the\ninput feature map. Benefiting from the efficient design for both groups, we\nshow that HiLo is superior to the existing attention mechanisms by\ncomprehensively benchmarking FLOPs, speed and memory consumption on GPUs and\nCPUs. For example, HiLo is 1.4x faster than spatial reduction attention and\n1.6x faster than local window attention on CPUs. Powered by HiLo, LITv2 serves\nas a strong backbone for mainstream vision tasks including image\nclassification, dense detection and segmentation.

In detail, EGA first encodes local gradient updates into an\nencoded domain with injected noises in each client before the aggregation in\nthe server. Then, the encoded gradients aggregation results can be recovered\nfor the global model update via a decoding function. This scheme could prevent\nthe raw gradients of a single client from exposing on the internet and keep\nthem unknown to the server.

We\nfurther provide a theoretical analysis of the approximation error and its\nimpacts on federated optimization. Moreover, EGA is compatible with the most\nfederated optimization algorithms.

Correspondingly, Class-Incremental\nLearning (CIL) aims to train a model with limited memory size to meet this\nrequirement. Typical CIL methods tend to save representative exemplars from\nformer classes to resist forgetting, while recent works find that storing\nmodels from history can substantially boost the performance. However, the\nstored models are not counted into the memory budget, which implicitly results\nin unfair comparisons. We find that when counting the model size into the total\nbudget and comparing methods with aligned memory size, saving models do not\nconsistently work, especially for the case with limited memory budgets. As a\nresult, we need to holistically evaluate different CIL methods at different\nmemory scales and simultaneously consider accuracy and memory size for\nmeasurement. On the other hand, we dive deeply into the construction of the\nmemory buffer for memory efficiency. By analyzing the effect of different\nlayers in the network, we find that shallow and deep layers have different\ncharacteristics in CIL.

We apply DevFoemer to the problem of\ndecoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances\nwhile reducing the number of components by more than $30\\%$. Finally, we show\nthat our approach achieves promising results in other offline contextual\nlearning-based combinatorial optimization tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 08:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 06:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 07:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

However, utilizing the\noriginal Transformer in SV directly may have frame-level information waste on\noutput features, which could lead to restrictions on capacity and\ndiscrimination of speaker embeddings. Therefore, we propose an approach to\nderive utterance-level speaker embeddings via a Transformer architecture that\nuses a novel loss function named diffluence loss to integrate the feature\ninformation of different Transformer layers. Therein, the diffluence loss aims\nto aggregate frame-level features into an utterance-level representation, and\nit could be integrated into the Transformer expediently. Besides, we also\nintroduce a learnable mel-fbank energy feature extractor named time-domain\nfeature extractor that computes the mel-fbank features more precisely and\nefficiently than the standard mel-fbank extractor.

Essentially, the background\nimage of an image macro is a regular image easily recognized as such by humans\nbut cumbersome for the machine to do so due to feature map similarity with the\ncomplete image macro. Hence, accumulating suitable feature maps in such cases\ncan lead to deep understanding of the notion of image memes.

These limitations become more evident when handling demanding\napplications, such as deep learning, well-known for their heavy computational\nrequirements. A case in point is robot pose estimation, an application that\npredicts the critical points of the desired image object. One way to mitigate\nprocessing and storage problems is compressing that deep learning application.\nThis paper proposes a new CNN for the pose estimation while applying the\ncompression techniques of pruning and quantization to reduce his demands and\nimprove the response time. While the pruning process reduces the total number\nof parameters required for inference, quantization decreases the precision of\nthe floating-point. We run the approach using a pose estimation task for a\nrobotic arm and compare the results in a high-end device and a constrained\ndevice. As metrics, we consider the number of Floating-point Operations Per\nSecond(FLOPS), the total of mathematical computations, the calculation of\nparameters, the inference time, and the number of video frames processed per\nsecond. In addition, we undertake a qualitative evaluation where we compare the\noutput image predicted for each pruned network with the corresponding original\none. We reduce the originally proposed network to a 70% pruning rate, implying\nan 88.86% reduction in parameters, 94.45% reduction in FLOPS, and for the disc\nstorage, we reduced the requirement in 70% while increasing error by a mere\n$1\\%$.

Each incident class has around 100 videos with a duration\nof ten seconds on average. To increase diversity, the videos have been searched\nin several languages. To assess the performance of the recent state-of-the-art\napproaches, Vision Transformer and TimeSformer, as well as to explore the\ncontribution of video-based information for incident classification, we\nperformed benchmark experiments on the VIDI and Incidents Dataset.

The accuracy of pixel-level classification can be affected by\nmany factors, such as imaging limitations and the ambiguity of object\nboundaries in an image. Conventional methods exploit three-channel RGB images\ncaptured in the visible spectrum with deep neural networks (DNN). Thermal\nimages can significantly contribute during the segmentation since thermal\nimaging cameras are capable of capturing details despite the weather and\nillumination conditions. Using infrared spectrum in semantic segmentation has\nmany real-world use cases, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging,\nagriculture, defense industry, etc. Due to this wide range of use cases,\ndesigning accurate semantic segmentation algorithms with the help of infrared\nspectrum is an important challenge. One approach is to use both visible and\ninfrared spectrum images as inputs.

One notable\nresearch line uses the Global Covariance Pooling (GCP) layer to learn powerful\nrepresentations with second-order statistics, which can effectively model\ninter-class differences. In our previous conference paper, we show that\ntruncating small eigenvalues of the GCP covariance can attain smoother gradient\nand improve the performance on large-scale benchmarks. However, on fine-grained\ndatasets, truncating the small eigenvalues would make the model fail to\nconverge. This observation contradicts the common assumption that the small\neigenvalues merely correspond to the noisy and unimportant information.\nConsequently, ignoring them should have little influence on the performance. To\ndiagnose this peculiar behavior, we propose two attribution methods whose\nvisualizations demonstrate that the seemingly unimportant small eigenvalues are\ncrucial as they are in charge of extracting the discriminative class-specific\nfeatures. Inspired by this observation, we propose a network branch dedicated\nto magnifying the importance of small eigenvalues.

However, the potential of\nthe (optimal) integration of SE and self-supervised pre-training still remains\nunclear.

Some recent GANs (e.g.,\nInfoGAN), are even able to edit specific properties of the synthesized images\nby introducing latent codes. It is crucial for SAR image synthesis since the\ntargets in real SAR images are with different properties due to the imaging\nmechanism. Despite the success of InfoGAN in manipulating properties, there\nstill lacks a clear explanation of how these latent codes affect synthesized\nproperties, thus editing specific properties usually relies on empirical\ntrials, unreliable and time-consuming. In this paper, we show that latent codes\nare disentangled to affect the properties of SAR images in a non-linear manner.\nBy introducing some property estimators for latent codes, we are able to\nprovide a completely analytical nonlinear model to decompose the entangled\ncausality between latent codes and different properties.

Specifically, a path in the tree from the root to leaf represents\nan individual possible future trajectory. SIT employs a coarse-to-fine\noptimization strategy, in which the tree is first built by high-order velocity\nto balance the complexity and coverage of the tree and then optimized greedily\nto encourage multimodality. Finally, a teacher-forcing refining operation is\nused to predict the final fine trajectory.

Because of this, resolved metallicity maps from\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS) data remain largely incomplete. In this paper\n(the second of a series), we introduce the geostatistical technique of\nuniversal kriging, which allows the complete 2D metallicity distribution of a\ngalaxy to be reconstructed from metallicities measured at Hii regions,\naccounting for spatial correlations between nearby data points. We apply this\nmethod to construct high-fidelity metallicity maps of the local spiral galaxy\nNGC 5236 using data from the TYPHOON/PrISM survey. We find significant\ncorrelation in the metallicity of Hii regions separated by up to 0.4-1.2 kpc.\nPredictions constructed using this method were tested using cross-validation in\nHii regions, and we show that they outperform significantly interpolation based\non metallicity gradients. Furthermore, we apply kriging to predict the\nmetallicities in regions dominated by DIG emission, considering seven\nadditional spiral galaxies with high resolution (<100pc) metallicity maps. We\ncompare kriging maps to DIG metallicities computed with novel ionisation\ncorrections, and find that such corrections introduce a systematic offset of up\nto $\\pm0.1$ dex for any individual galaxy, with a scatter of 0.02-0.07 dex for\nthe sample. Overall we recommend universal kriging, together with a calibrated\ngeostatistical model, as the superior method for inferring the metallicities of\nDIG-dominated regions in local spiral galaxies, demonstrating further the\npotential of applying geostatistical methods to spatially resolved galaxy\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 12:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The\nresulting scheme is able to preserve a large family of smooth and discontinuous\nsteady state moving equilibria. In this work, we focus on an arbitrary high\norder WENO Finite Volume (FV) generalization of the global flux approach.

Advertisers are\nadditionally expected to exhaust nearly all of their sub-interval (by the hour\nor minute) budgets to maintain budgeting quotas in the long run. To resolve\nthis challenge, our study analyzes a simple learning algorithm that adapts to\nthe latent cost function of the market and learns the optimal average bidding\nvalue for a period of auctions in a small fraction of the total campaign time,\nallowing for smooth budget pacing in real-time. We prove our algorithm is\nrobust to changes in the auction mechanism, and exhibits a fast convergence to\na stable average bidding strategy. The algorithm not only guarantees that\nbudgets are nearly spent in their entirety, but also smoothly paces bidding to\nprevent early exit from the campaign and a loss of the opportunity to bid on\npotentially lucrative impressions later in the period.\n  In addition to the theoretical guarantees, we validate our algorithm with\nexperimental results from open source data on real advertising campaigns to\nfurther demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 13:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 18:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

The main goal is to theoretically calculate\nthe dephasing and decay rate of a qubit, particularly due to the circuitry\neffect. Firstly, the Hamiltonian of the system (coupling of a qubit to the\nreservoir modes) is defined and used to derive the time evolution of the\ndensity matrix for the qubit energy levels. By calculating the qubit level\ndensity evolutions, one can estimate at which frequency the maximum coupling\noccurs and, in addition, knows about the role of the electromagnetic bias in\nthe qubit. Secondly, the qubit decay rate is theoretically derived. The results\nshow that the decay rate is strongly affected by circuitry elements such as the\nqubit capacitor and, more importantly, the coupling capacitor between the qubit\nand the reservoir modes. As the main result, it is shown that the slight\ndecrease in the coupling capacitors significantly affects the relaxation time\neven more than the qubit capacitor. Consequently, the dephasing rate, which is\nthe effect of the reservoir modes on the transition frequency of the qubit, is\ntheoretically examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin equation. Finally, by\ntransforming the Heisenberg-Langevin equations into the Fourier domain, the\nnumber of photons of the qubit due to coupling to reservoir modes are\ncalculated. This is considered to be the photons generated in the qubit owing\nto the noise effect. This term significantly influences the qubit coherence\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

In this work, we mathematically\nanalyze the power of RPE-based Transformers regarding whether the model is\ncapable of approximating any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. One may\nnaturally assume the answer is in the affirmative -- RPE-based Transformers are\nuniversal function approximators. However, we present a negative result by\nshowing there exist continuous sequence-to-sequence functions that RPE-based\nTransformers cannot approximate no matter how deep and wide the neural network\nis. One key reason lies in that most RPEs are placed in the softmax attention\nthat always generates a right stochastic matrix. This restricts the network\nfrom capturing positional information in the RPEs and limits its capacity. To\novercome the problem and make the model more powerful, we first present\nsufficient conditions for RPE-based Transformers to achieve universal function\napproximation. With the theoretical guidance, we develop a novel attention\nmodule, called Universal RPE-based (URPE) Attention, which satisfies the\nconditions. Therefore, the corresponding URPE-based Transformers become\nuniversal function approximators. Extensive experiments covering typical\narchitectures and tasks demonstrate that our model is parameter-efficient and\ncan achieve superior performance to strong baselines in a wide range of\napplications.

To help address this need,\nthis paper presents a co-design framework for multi-agent networks and private\ncontrollers that we apply to the problem of private formation control. Agents'\nstate trajectories are protected using differential privacy, which is a\nstatistical notion of privacy that protects data by adding noise to it.

The\noriginal motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations\nencountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the\nsyntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end\nup prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res\nover many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a\ncomparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle\nthis question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only\nLD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently\nknown resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from\nBeyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res\nand LQU$^+$-Res.\n  Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i)\nMRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system,\nand (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an\nexponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the\ncontext of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal\nvariables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without\nweakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening,\nthough whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open.\nWe note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$\n$\\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and\nSlivovsky).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 15:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

However, in practical storage systems, the number of available nodes\nchanges frequently. Thus, it is preferred to construct $(n,k)$ MDS array codes\nwith multiple repair degrees and the optimal repair property for all nodes. To\nthe best of our knowledge, only two MDS array codes have such properties in the\nliterature, which were proposed by Ye and Barg (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory,\n63(10), 2001-2014, 2017). However, their sub-packetization levels are\nrelatively large. In this paper, we present a generic construction method that\ncan convert some MDS array codes with a single repair degree into the ones with\nmultiple repair degrees and optimal repair property for a set of nodes, while\nthe repair efficiency/degrees of the remaining nodes can be kept. As an\napplication of the generic construction method, an explicit construction of\nhigh-rate MDS array code with multiple repair degrees and the optimal access\nproperty for all nodes is obtained over a small finite field.

Although some recent volatility forecasting models have utilized the\ntextual content of conference calls, the dialogue structures of conference\ncalls and company relationships are almost ignored in extant literature. To\nbridge this gap, we propose a new model called Temporal Virtual Graph Neural\nNetwork (TVGNN) for volatility forecasting by jointly modeling conference call\ndialogues and company networks. Our model differs from existing models in\nseveral important ways. First, we propose to exploit more dialogue structures\nby encoding position, utterance, speaker role, and Q\\&A segments. Second, we\npropose to encode the market states for volatility forecasting by extending the\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU). Third, we propose a new method for constructing\ntemporal company networks in which the messages can only flow from temporally\npreceding to successive nodes, and extend the Graph Attention Networks (GAT)\nfor modeling company relationships. We collect conference call transcripts of\nS\\&P500 companies from 2008 to 2019, and construct a dataset of conference call\ndialogues with additional information on dialogue structures and company\nnetworks.

In this context,\ncoding is a semiotic relationship between chemical information stored in one\nlocation that links to chemical information stored in a separate location.\nCoding originated by the cooperative interaction of two, originally separate\ncollectively autocatalytic sets, one for nucleic acids and one for peptides.\nWhen these two sets interacted, a series of RNA-folding-directed processes led\nto their joint cooperativity. The amino acyl adenylate, today amino acid-AMP,\nwas the first covalent association made by these two collectively autocatalytic\nsets and solidified their interdependence. This molecule is a palimpsest of\nthis era, and is a relic of the original semiotic, and thus coding,\nrelationship between RNA and proteins. More defined coding was driven by\nselection pressure to eliminate waste in the collective autocatalytic sets.\nEventually a 1:1 relationship between single amino acids and short RNA pieces\n(e.g., three nucleotides) was established, leading to what is today known as\nthe genetic code. Transfer RNA aminoacylating enzymes, or aaRSs, arose\nconcomitantly with the advent of specific coding. The two classes of aaRS\nenzymes are remnants of the duality of complementary information in two nucleic\nacid strands, as originally postulated by Rodin and Ohno. Every stage in the\nevolution of coding was driven by the downward selection on the components of a\nsystem to satisfy the Kantian whole. Coding was ultimately forced because there\nwere at least two chemically distinct classes of polymers needed for open-ended\nevolution; systems with only one polymer cannot exhibit this characteristic.\nCoding is thus synonymous with life as we know it, and can be thought of as a\nphase transition in the history of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 16:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}
