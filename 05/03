Recent studies have\naddressed a plethora of strategies for flood control in stormwater reservoirs;\nhowever, advanced control theoretic techniques are not yet fully investigated\nand applied to these systems. In addition, there is an absence of a coupled\nintegrated control model for systems composed of watersheds, reservoirs, and\nchannels for flood mitigation.\n  To this end, we develop a novel state-space model of hydrologic and\nhydrodynamic processes in reservoirs and one-dimensional channels. The model is\ntested under different types of reservoir control strategies based on real-time\nmeasurements (reactive control), and based on predictions of the future\nbehavior of the system (predictive control) using rainfall forecastings. We\napply the modeling approach in a system composed by a single watershed,\nreservoir, and a channel connected in series, respectively, for the San Antonio\nobserved rainfall data. Results indicate that for flood mitigation, the\npredictive control strategy outperforms the reactive controls not only when\napplied for synthetic design storm events, but also for a continuous\nsimulation. Moreover, the predictive control strategy requires smaller valve\noperations, while still guaranteeing efficient hydrological performance. From\nthe results, we recommend the use of the model predictive control strategy to\ncontrol stormwater systems due to the ability to handle different objective\nfunctions, which can be altered according to rainfall forecasting and shift the\nreservoir operation from flood-based control to strategies focused on\nincreasing detention times, depending on the forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 16:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 03:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 04:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Characteristic for\ncovalent bonding are small atom groups with short distances between the\ninvolved atoms, indicating that covalent bonding is essentially a local effect,\naccording to Lewis, this is caused by shared electron pairs. However, the\nenergetic stabilization is an approximately additive one-electron effect, as\nwas shown by Ruedenberg and coworkers. In systems composed of many-electron\nsubsystems, the fermionic character of the electrons determines the structure\nof the electron distribution in a subsystem, and it is decisive for the local\ninteractions between the subsystems. Especially important is the Pauli\nexclusion principle (PEP), which directs the relative positions of identical\nelectrons. Spin and charge rearrangements are of utmost importance for chemical\nbonding. Quantum chemical methods like CASSCF (complete active space SCF), also\ncalled FORS (fully optimized reaction space), are made to cover all such\nprocesses. The standard building blocks of CASSCF wave functions are\ndelocalized molecular orbitals, which cannot display local effects. OVB\n(orthogonal valence bond) is a method to analyze CASSCF wave functions and to\nreveal local processes that are responsible for both the energetic aspects of\nbonding and the spatial structure of the stabilized system. This is shown by\nanalyzing dissociation of ethene, disilene, and silaethene, and the\ncorresponding reverse reactions. Aspects of diabaticity of the reactions and\nentanglement of subsystems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 17:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

This approach consists\nof a continuous or stepwise spatial shift of a small sub-volume of only few\ncubic centimeters size, which is scanned using one or multiple excitation\nfields in the kHz range. Under the assumption of ideal magnetic fields, the MPI\nsystem matrix is shift invariant and in turn a single matrix suffices for image\nreconstruction significantly reducing the calibration time and reconstruction\neffort. For large field imperfections, however, the method can lead to severe\nimage artifacts. In the present work we generalize the efficient multi-patch\nreconstruction to work under non-ideal field conditions, where shift invariance\nholds only approximately for small shifts of the sub-volume. Patches are\nclustered based on a magnetic-field-based metric such that in each cluster the\nshift invariance holds in good approximation. The total number of clusters is\nthe main parameter of our method and allows to trade off calibration time and\nimage artifacts. The magnetic-field-based metric allows to perform the\nclustering without prior knowledge of the system matrices. The developed\nreconstruction algorithm is evaluated on a multi-patch measurement sequence\nwith 15 patches, where efficient multi-patch reconstruction with a single\ncalibration measurement leads to strong image artifacts.

The compositionality between the visible and\nhidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the\nphysical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited\nobservations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually\nobservable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact\ninteraction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance\nof inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual\nappearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy)\ndataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving\nand interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated\nbased on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as\nmass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on\none of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video\nreasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to\ncapture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic\nframework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual\nperception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic\nexecution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects'\nphysical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to\nanswer questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 17:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

We study the mechanisms of this classical\ncosmological collider in two categories of primordial features. In the first\ncategory, the primordial feature is classical oscillation, which includes the\ncase of coherent oscillation of a massive field and the case of oscillatory\nfeatures in the inflationary potential. The second category includes any sharp\nfeature in the inflation model. All these classical features can excite\nunsuppressed quantum modes of other heavy fields which leave observational\nsignatures in primordial non-Gaussianities, including the information about the\nparticle spectra of these heavy degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 17:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The goal of this\nstrategy is not to make an overall SM fit but to predict the SM branching\nratios. In the SM there are no new physics (NP) contributions to $\\Delta F=2$\ntransitions and no assumption on the absence of NP is needed. Moreover,\npresently NP is not required to describe simultaneously the very precise data\non $|\\varepsilon_K|$, $\\Delta M_s$, $\\Delta M_d$ and $S_{\\psi K_S}$. This\nstrategy for obtaining true SM predictions for rare decay branching ratios is\nmoreover not polluted by hadronic uncertainies and observed anomalies in\nsemi-leptonic decays used often in global analyses as stressed recently in\n(arxiv: 2209.03968).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 12:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

First we note that\nalong with the discrete architecture search suffering from the combinatorial\nexplosion of complexity, optimization over 1q gates can also be a crucial\nroadblock due to the omnipresence of local minimums (well known in the context\nof variational quantum algorithms but apparently underappreciated in the\ncontext of the variational compiling). Taking the issue seriously, we make an\nextensive search over the initial conditions an essential part of our approach.\nAnother key idea we propose is to use parametrized two-qubit (2q) controlled\nphase gates, which can interpolate between the identity gate and the CNOT gate,\nand allow a continuous relaxation of the discrete architecture search, which\ncan be executed jointly with the optimization over 1q gates. This coherent\noptimization of the architecture together with 1q gates appears to work\nsurprisingly well in practice, sometimes even outperforming optimization over\n1q gates alone (for fixed optimal architectures). As illustrative examples and\napplications we derive 8 CNOT and T depth 3 decomposition of the 3q Toffoli\ngate on the nearest-neighbor topology, rediscover known best decompositions of\nthe 4q Toffoli gate on all 4q topologies including a 1 CNOT gate improvement on\nthe star-shaped topology, and propose decomposition of the 5q Toffoli gate on\nthe nearest-neighbor topology with 48 CNOT gates.

During the observation of very bright X-ray sources, the X-IFU detectors\nwill receive high photon rates. The count rate capability of the X-IFU will be\nimproved by using the defocusing option, which will enable the observations of\nextremely bright sources with fluxes up to $\\simeq 1$ Crab.

We propose a graph\nconvolutional neural network that uses speech content feature, along with an\nindependent emotion input to generate emotion and speech-induced motion on\nfacial geometry-aware landmark representation. This representation is further\nused in our optical flow-guided texture generation network for producing the\ntexture. We propose a two-branch texture generation network, with motion and\ntexture branches designed to consider the motion and texture content\nindependently. Compared to the previous emotion talking face methods, our\nmethod can adapt to arbitrary faces captured in-the-wild by fine-tuning with\nonly a single image of the target identity in neutral emotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 18:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

However,\nfinding a leximax solution can be highly dependent on small variations in the\nutility of certain groups. In this work, we explore new notions of approximate\nleximax solutions with three distinct motivations: better algorithmic\nefficiency, exploiting significant utility improvements, and robustness to\nnoise. Among other definitional contributions, we give a new notion of an\napproximate leximax that satisfies a similarly appealing semantic\ninterpretation and relate it to algorithmically-feasible approximate leximax\nnotions. When group utilities are linear over cohort candidates, we give an\nefficient polynomial-time algorithm for finding a leximax distribution over\ncohort candidates in the exact as well as in the approximate setting.\nFurthermore, we show that finding an integer solution to leximax cohort\nselection with linear utilities is NP-Hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 18:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 18:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

The synthesis, on-the-fly, of gaits with unexpected operational\ncharacteristics or even the blending of dynamic manoeuvres lies beyond the\ncapabilities of the current state-of-the-art. In this work we address this\nlimitation by learning a latent space capturing the key stance phases\nconstituting a particular gait. This is achieved via a generative model trained\non a single trot style, which encourages disentanglement such that application\nof a drive signal to a single dimension of the latent state induces holistic\nplans synthesising a continuous variety of trot styles. We demonstrate that\nspecific properties of the drive signal map directly to gait parameters such as\ncadence, footstep height and full stance duration. Due to the nature of our\napproach these synthesised gaits are continuously variable online during robot\noperation and robustly capture a richness of movement significantly exceeding\nthe relatively narrow behaviour seen during training. In addition, the use of a\ngenerative model facilitates the detection and mitigation of disturbances to\nprovide a versatile and robust planning framework.

In this investigation, we\nattempted to improve upon past research. So we decided to explore a unique\napproach: we wanted to determine if mobile location data could be used to\nimprove the predictive power of popular regression and tree-based models. To\nprepare our data for our models, we processed the mobility data by attaching it\nto individual properties from the real estate data that aggregated users within\n500 meters of the property for each day of the week. We removed people that\nlived within 500 meters of each property, so each property's aggregated\nmobility data only contained non-resident census features. On top of these\ndynamic census features, we also included static census features, including the\nnumber of people in the area, the average proportion of people commuting, and\nthe number of residents in the area. Finally, we tested multiple models to\npredict real estate prices. Our proposed model is two stacked random forest\nmodules combined using a ridge regression that uses the random forest outputs\nas predictors. The first random forest model used static features only and the\nsecond random forest model used dynamic features only.

Conversely, deep\nlearning (DL)-based systems are able to handle increasingly complex tasks for\nwhich no tractable models are available. This thesis aims at comparing\ndifferent approaches to unlock the full potential of DL in the physical layer.\n  First, we describe a neural network (NN)-based block strategy, where an NN is\noptimized to replace a block in a communication system. We apply this strategy\nto introduce a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) detector\nthat builds on top of an existing DL-based architecture. Second, we detail an\nend-to-end strategy, in which the transmitter and receiver are modeled as an\nautoencoder. This approach is illustrated with the design of waveforms that\nachieve high throughputs while satisfying peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)\nand adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) constraints. Lastly, we propose a\nhybrid strategy, where multiple DL components are inserted into a traditional\narchitecture but are trained to optimize the end-to-end performance. To\ndemonstrate its benefits, we propose a DL-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that both\nenable lower bit error rates (BERs) compared to a conventional receiver and\nremains scalable to any number of users.\n  Each approach has its own strengths and shortcomings. While the first one is\nthe easiest to implement, its individual block optimization does not ensure the\noverall system optimality. On the other hand, systems designed with the second\napproach are computationally complex but allow for new opportunities such as\npilotless transmissions. Finally, the combined flexibility and end-to-end\nperformance gains of the third approach motivate its use for short-term\npractical implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 21:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Our work examines the extent to which the CTC has done so. Our\nstudy, which documents clear, consistent, and compelling evidence of gender\ninequity in benefits realization, yields four key findings. First, stringent\nrequisite income thresholds disproportionally disadvantage single mothers, a\nreflection of the high concentration of this demographic in lower segments of\nthe income distribution. Second, married parents and, to a lesser extent,\nsingle fathers, are the primary beneficiaries of the CTC program when benefits\nare structured as credits rather than refunds. Third, making program benefits\nmore generous disproportionally reduces how many single mothers, relative to\nmarried parents and single fathers, can claim this benefit. Fourth and finally,\nincreasing credit refundability can mitigate gender differences in relief\neligibility, although doing so imposes externalities of its own.

First is the massive amount of\ndata streaming to and from IoT devices, and second is the fast pace at which\nthese systems must operate. Distributed computing in the form of edge/cloud\nstructure is a popular technique to overcome these two challenges. In this\npaper, we propose ADDAI (Anomaly Detection using Distributed AI) that can\neasily span out geographically to cover a large number of IoT sources. Due to\nits distributed nature, it guarantees critical IIoT requirements such as high\nspeed, robustness against a single point of failure, low communication\noverhead, privacy, and scalability.

However, designing appropriately fast and\naccurate XAI is still challenging, especially in numerical applications. Here,\nwe propose a universal XAI model named Transparency Relying Upon Statistical\nTheory (TRUST), which is model-agnostic, high-performing, and suitable for\nnumerical applications. Simply put, TRUST XAI models the statistical behavior\nof the AI's outputs in an AI-based system. Factor analysis is used to transform\nthe input features into a new set of latent variables. We use mutual\ninformation to rank these variables and pick only the most influential ones on\nthe AI's outputs and call them \"representatives\" of the classes.

Network simulators such as ns-3 and OMNeT++ can provide\naccurate answers, but are very hard to parallelize, taking hours or days to\nanswer what if questions for a single configuration at even moderate scale.\nRecent work with MimicNet has shown how to use machine learning to improve\nsimulation performance, but at a cost of including a long training step per\nconfiguration, and with assumptions about workload and topology uniformity that\ntypically do not hold in practice.\n  We address this gap by developing a set of techniques to provide fast\nperformance estimates for large scale networks with general traffic matrices\nand topologies.

Metric differential privacy is a generalisation of both\nstandard (i.e., central) differential privacy and local differential privacy,\nand it is increasingly being used in various application domains, for instance\nin location privacy and in privacy preserving machine learning.

Compared to conventional\nsequential models that leverage attention mechanisms and RNNs, recent efforts\nmainly follow two directions for improvement: multi-interest learning and graph\nconvolutional aggregation. Specifically, multi-interest methods such as ComiRec\nand MIMN, focus on extracting different interests for a user by performing\nhistorical item clustering, while graph convolution methods including TGSRec\nand SURGE elect to refine user preferences based on multi-level correlations\nbetween historical items. Unfortunately, neither of them realizes that these\ntwo types of solutions can mutually complement each other, by aggregating\nmulti-level user preference to achieve more precise multi-interest extraction\nfor a better recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified\nmulti-grained neural model(named MGNM) via a combination of multi-interest\nlearning and graph convolutional aggregation.

Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and\ncalculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The\nmulti-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the\nranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that\nshould be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of\nprevious stages. In this paper, we focus on the \\textbf{ranking consistency}\nbetween the pre-ranking and ranking stages.

As a\nresult, many different mathematical models have been studied to capture the\ngeneral trend of the network traffic and predict accordingly. But the\ncomprehensive performance analysis of varying regression models and their\nensemble has not been studied before for analyzing real-world anomalous\ntraffic. In this paper, several regression models such as Extra Gradient Boost\n(XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), and CatBoost Regressor were\nanalyzed to predict real traffic without and with outliers and show the\nsignificance of outlier detection in real-world traffic prediction. Also, we\nshowed the outperformance of the ensemble regression model over the individual\nprediction model. We compared the performance of different regression models\nbased on five different feature sets of lengths 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. Our\nensemble regression model achieved the minimum average gap of 5.04% between\nactual and predicted traffic with nine outlier-adjusted inputs.

Current SGG methods typically utilize\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) to acquire context information between\nobjects/relationships. Despite their effectiveness, however, current SGG\nmethods only assume scene graph homophily while ignoring heterophily.\nAccordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterophily Learning Network\n(HL-Net) to comprehensively explore the homophily and heterophily between\nobjects/relationships in scene graphs. More specifically, HL-Net comprises the\nfollowing 1) an adaptive reweighting transformer module, which adaptively\nintegrates the information from different layers to exploit both the\nheterophily and homophily in objects; 2) a relationship feature propagation\nmodule that efficiently explores the connections between relationships by\nconsidering heterophily in order to refine the relationship representation; 3)\na heterophily-aware message-passing scheme to further distinguish the\nheterophily and homophily between objects/relationships, thereby facilitating\nimproved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on two\npublic datasets: Visual Genome (VG) and Open Images (OI). The experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HL-Net over existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches. In more detail, HL-Net outperforms the second-best\ncompetitors by 2.1$\\%$ on the VG dataset for scene graph classification and\n1.2$\\%$ on the IO dataset for the final score.

In the DRHBc theory, the densities\nand potentials with axial deformation are expanded in terms of Legendre\npolynomials, and the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov equations are solved in a\nDirac Woods-Saxon basis to include the continuum effects. For an odd-$A$ or\nodd-odd nucleus, the blocking effect of unpaired nucleon(s) is taken into\naccount with the equal filling approximation. To determine its ground state, an\nautomatic blocking procedure is adopted, in which the orbital with the lowest\nquasiparticle energy is blocked during the iteration. This procedure is\njustified by comparing with the results from the orbital-fixed blocking\ncalculations, in which the blocked orbital near the Fermi surface is fixed\nduring the iteration. The ground states for both light and heavy nuclei can be\nprovided by the automatic blocking procedure as the orbital-fixed blocking\nprocedure, but with considerably reduced computational cost.

Indeed, to build interactive systems there is a need to\nuse multiple artefacts/models (as they provide a complementary view). However,\nrelevant information for describing the design solution and/or supporting\ndesign decisions (such as rational about the design, decisions made,\nrecommendations, etc.) is not explicitly capturable in the models/artefacts,\nhence the need for annotations. Multi-artefacts approaches usually argue that a\ngiven information should only be present in one artefact to avoid duplication\nand increase maintainability of the artefacts. Nonetheless, annotations created\non one artefact are usually relevant to other artefacts/models. So that, there\nis a need for tools and techniques to coordinate annotations across\nartefacts/models which is the contribution of the present work. In this paper,\nwe propose a model-based approach that was conceived to handle annotations in a\nsystematic way along the development process of interactive systems.

The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by means\nof a tool suite featuring a plugin, which has been deployed and tested over the\nmulti-artefacts.

The approach combines an ML-based detection with a geometry-aware\nvariational-based segmentation using B-splines that are parametrized based on a\ngeometric model of the cell shape. The detection is done first using YOLOv5. In\na second step, each detected cell is segmented individually. Thus, the\nsegmentation only needs to be done on a per-cell basis, which makes it amenable\nto a variational approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the geometry.\nHere, the contour of the segmentation is modelled as closed uniform cubic\nB-spline, whose control points are parametrized using the known cell geometry.\nCompared to purely ML-based segmentation approaches, which need accurate\nsegmentation maps as training data that are very laborious to produce, our\nmethod just needs bounding boxes as training data. Still, the proposed method\nperforms on par with ML-based segmentation approaches usually used in this\ncontext.

The compactness of\nthe underlying semigroup is further used to define an infinite-horizon optimal\ncontrol problem on an appropriately reduced state space.

This paper presents the\nresults of employing the intrinsic entropy model as a substitute for estimating\nthe volatility of stock market indices. Diverging from the widely used\nvolatility models that take into account only the elements related to the\ntraded prices, namely the open, high, low, and close prices of a trading day\n(OHLC), the intrinsic entropy model takes into account the traded volumes\nduring the considered time frame as well. We adjust the intraday intrinsic\nentropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in\norder to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily\nvolume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic\nentropy model conceptualizes this ratio as entropic probability or market\ncredence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is\ncomputed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow\n30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We\ncompare the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility\nestimates obtained for the same data sets using widely employed industry\nvolatility estimators.

Modeling of this mechanism has so far been\nmacroscopic, characterized by an average rate describing the relaxation of all\nions. Here however, we present a microscopic model of flip-flop interactions\nbetween individual nuclear spins of dopant ions. Every ion is situated in a\nunique local environment in the crystal, where each ion has different distances\nand a unique orientation relative to its nearest neighbors, as determined by\nthe lattice structure. Thus, each ion has a unique flip-flop rate and the\ncollective relaxation dynamics of all ions in a bulk crystal is a sum of many\nexponential decays, giving rise to a distribution of rates rather than a single\naverage decay rate. We employ this model to calculate flip-flop rates in\nPr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ and show experimental measurements of population decay\nof the ground state hyperfine levels at $\\sim$2 K. We also present a new method\nto measure rates of individual transitions from hole burning spectra that\nrequires significantly fewer fitting parameters in theoretical rate equations\ncompared to earlier work.

In\nthis work we show that entailment is also effective in Event Argument\nExtraction (EAE), reducing the need of manual annotation to 50% and 20% in ACE\nand WikiEvents respectively, while achieving the same performance as with full\ntraining. More importantly, we show that recasting EAE as entailment alleviates\nthe dependency on schemas, which has been a road-block for transferring\nannotations between domains.

Non-smoothness encodes structural constraints on the\nsolutions, such as sparsity, group sparsity, low-rank and sharp edges. It is\nalso the basis for the definition of robust loss functions and scale-free\nfunctionals such as square-root Lasso. Standard approaches to deal with\nnon-smoothness leverage either proximal splitting or coordinate descent. These\napproaches are effective but usually require parameter tuning, preconditioning\nor some sort of support pruning. In this work, we advocate and study a\ndifferent route, which operates a non-convex but smooth over-parametrization of\nthe underlying non-smooth optimization problems. This generalizes quadratic\nvariational forms that are at the heart of the popular Iterative Reweighted\nLeast Squares (IRLS). Our main theoretical contribution connects gradient\ndescent on this reformulation to a mirror descent flow with a varying Hessian\nmetric. This analysis is crucial to derive convergence bounds that are\ndimension-free. This explains the efficiency of the method when using small\ngrid sizes in imaging. Our main algorithmic contribution is to apply the\nVariable Projection (VarPro) method which defines a new formulation by\nexplicitly minimizing over part of the variables. This leads to a better\nconditioning of the minimized functional and improves the convergence of simple\nbut very efficient gradient-based methods, for instance quasi-Newton solvers.\nWe exemplify the use of this new solver for the resolution of regularized\nregression problems for inverse problems and supervised learning, including\ntotal variation prior and non-convex regularizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 09:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Excess microwave emission, commonly known as anomalous microwave\nemission (AME), is now routinely detected in the Milky Way. Although its link\nwith the rotation of interstellar (carbonaceous) nano-grains seems to be\nrelatively well established at cloud scales, large-scale observations show a\nlack of correlation between the different tracers of nano-carbons and AME,\nwhich has led the community to question the viability of this link. Aims. Using\nancillary data and spinning dust models for nano-carbons and nano-silicates, we\nexplore the extent to which the AME that come out of the Galactic Plane might\noriginate with one or another carrier. Methods. In contrast to previous\nlarge-scale studies, our method is not built on comparing the correlations of\nthe different dust tracers with each other, but rather on comparing the poor\ncorrelations predicted by the models with observed correlations. This is based\non estimates that are as realistic as possible of the gas ionisation state and\ngrain charge as a function of the local radiation field and gas density.\nResults. First, nano-carbon dust can explain all the observations for medium\nproperties, in agreement with the latest findings about the separation of cold\nand warm neutral medium in the diffuse interstellar medium. The dispersion in\nthe observations can be accounted for with little variations in the dust size\ndistribution, abundance, or electric dipole moment. Second, regardless of the\nproperties and abundance of the nano-silicate dust we considered, spinning\nnano-silicates are excluded as the sole source of the AME. Third, the best\nagreement with the observations is obtained when the emission of spinning\nnano-carbons alone is taken into account.

A novel\nobjective function was introduced to account for uncertainty in the passive\nmicrowave measurements, which can be extended to account for arbitrary sources\nof error in the training data, and a recent set of in-situ observations was\nused to evaluate the reliability of the chosen passive microwave concentration\nestimation model. Google Colaboratory was used as the development platform, and\nall notebooks, training data, and trained models are available on GitHub. This\nchapter is an overview of the most interesting aspects of this investigation,\nand a detailed report is also available on GitHub.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 10:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Autonomous vehicles are often tasked\nwith operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. As a result, they often\nmake use of highly complex components, such as machine learning approaches, to\nhandle the nuances of sensing, actuation, and control. While these methods are\nhighly effective, they are notoriously difficult to assure. Moreover, within\nuncertain and dynamic environments, design time assurance analyses may not be\nsufficient to guarantee safety. Thus, it is critical to monitor the correctness\nof these systems at runtime. One approach for providing runtime assurance of\nsystems with components that may not be amenable to formal analysis is the\nsimplex architecture, where an unverified component is wrapped with a safety\ncontroller and a switching logic designed to prevent dangerous behavior. In\nthis paper, we propose using a real-time reachability algorithm for the\nimplementation of the simplex architecture to assure the safety of a 1/10 scale\nopen source autonomous vehicle platform known as F1/10.

It is commonly\nthought that machine learning algorithms infer general prediction rules from\npast observations. This is akin to a statistical procedure by which estimates\nare obtained from a sample of data. But machine learning algorithms can also be\ndescribed as choosing one prediction rule from an entire class of functions. In\nparticular, the algorithm that determines the weights of an artificial neural\nnetwork operates by empirical risk minimization and rejects prediction rules\nthat lack empirical adequacy. It also exhibits a behavior of implicit\nregularization that pushes hypothesis choice toward simpler prediction rules.\nWe argue that taking both aspects together gives rise to a falsificationist\naccount of artificial neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 11:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Although the\nfundamental underlying Navier-Stokes equations have been known for two\ncenturies, it remains extremely challenging to extract from them the\nstatistical properties of turbulence. Therefore, for practical purpose, a\nsustained effort has been devoted to obtaining some effective description of\nturbulence, that we may call turbulence modelling, or statistical theory of\nturbulence. In this respect, the Renormalisation Group (RG) appears as a tool\nof choice, since it is precisely designed to provide effective theories from\nfundamental equations by performing in a systematic way the average over\nfluctuations. However, for Navier-Stokes turbulence, a suitable framework for\nthe RG, allowing in particular for non-perturbative approximations, have been\nmissing, which has thwarted for long RG applications. This framework is\nprovided by the modern formulation of the RG called functional renormalisation\ngroup. The use of the FRG has rooted important progress in the theoretical\nunderstanding of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The major one is the\nrigorous derivation, from the Navier-Stokes equations, of an analytical\nexpression for any Eulerian multi-point multi-time correlation function, which\nis exact in the limit of large wavenumbers.

Communication activities need to be organized and\ncoordinated to defend against the threat of productivity losses, increases in\ncognitive load, and stress among team members. With a plethora of communication\nchannels that were identified by previous research in open-source projects,\nthere is a need to explore organizational issues in how these communication\nchannels are introduced, explained, and motivated for use among all project\nmembers. In this study, we wanted to understand which communication channels\nare used in GitHub projects and how they are presented to the GitHub project\naudience. We employed thematic analysis to analyze 151 artifacts in 90 GitHub\nprojects. Our results revealed 32 unique communications channels that can be\ndivided into nine different types. Projects mostly provide channels of\ndifferent types, but for some types (e.g., chat) it is common to provide\nseveral channels. Maintainers are aware that channels have different properties\nand help the developers to decide which channel should be used in which case.\nHowever, this is not true for all projects, and often we have not found any\nexplicit reasons why maintainers chose to provide one channel over another.\nDifferent channels can be used for different purposes and have different\naffordances, so maintainers have to decide wisely which channels they want to\nprovide and make clear which channel should be used in which case. Otherwise,\ndevelopers might feel overwhelmed of too many channels and information can get\nfragmented over multiple channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 11:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Some local\nplasmonic properties exploited in applications, such as photothermia and\noptical signal amplification, would also be maximized which is important in the\nperspective of mass producing nanostructures at a lower cost. The main lock is\nthat bringing charged particles in close contact requires the charges to be\nscreened/suppressed, which leads to the rapid formation of micrometric\naggregates. In this article, we show that aggregates containing less than 60\nparticles in contact can be obtained with a milli-flow system composed of\nturbulent mixers and flow reactors. This process allows to stop a fast\nnon-equilibrium colloidal aggregation process at millisecond times after the\ninitiation of the aggregation process which allows to control the aggregation\nnumber. As a case study, we considered the rapid mixing of citrate coated gold\nnanoparticles (NP) and AlCl3 in water to initiate a fast aggregation controlled\nby diffusion. Injecting a solution of polycation using a second mixer allowed\nus to arrest the aggregation process after a reaction time by formation of\novercharged cationic aggregates. We obtained within seconds stable dispersions\nof a few milliliters composed of particle aggregates. Our main result is to\nshow that it is possible to master the average aggregation number between 2 and\n60 NP per aggregate by varying the a reaction time between 10 ms and 1 s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 11:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

To overcome this, some methods, such as\nLearning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), shape their opponents'\nlearning process. However, these methods are myopic since only a small number\nof steps can be anticipated, are asymmetric since they treat other agents as\nnaive learners, and require the use of higher-order derivatives, which are\ncalculated through white-box access to an opponent's differentiable learning\nalgorithm. To address these issues, we propose Model-Free Opponent Shaping\n(M-FOS). M-FOS learns in a meta-game in which each meta-step is an episode of\nthe underlying inner game. The meta-state consists of the inner policies, and\nthe meta-policy produces a new inner policy to be used in the next episode.\nM-FOS then uses generic model-free optimisation methods to learn meta-policies\nthat accomplish long-horizon opponent shaping. Empirically, M-FOS\nnear-optimally exploits naive learners and other, more sophisticated algorithms\nfrom the literature. For example, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first\nmethod to learn the well-known Zero-Determinant (ZD) extortion strategy in the\nIPD. In the same settings, M-FOS leads to socially optimal outcomes under\nmeta-self-play. Finally, we show that M-FOS can be scaled to high-dimensional\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 12:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 11:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Tests of the fitting procedure show that\nthe young disc's DF would be strongly constrained by Gaia data if the\ndistribution of Galactic dust were accurately known. The DF that best fits the\nreal data accurately predicts the kinematics of stars at their observed\nlocations, but it predicts the spatial distribution of stars poorly, almost\ncertainly on account of errors in the best-available dust map. We argue that\ndust models could be greatly improved by modifying the dust model until the\nspatial distribution of stars predicted by a DF agreed with the data.

In order to make the\noptimization problem tractable, we derive a new and tight upper bound on the\nloss function, which allows us to obtain closed-form expressions for the number\nof local trainings and that of global aggregations. Simulation results show\nthat our proposed scheme can achieve a better performance in terms of the\nprediction accuracy, and converge much faster than the baseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 13:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Here we exploit a novel,\nparticle-resolved, experimental set-up and complementary computer simulations\nto measure the shear rheology of quasi-hard-disc colloids in extreme\nconfinement. In particular, we confine quasi-2d hard discs in a circular\n`corral' comprised of 27 particles held in optical traps. Confinement and shear\nsuppress hexagonal ordering that would occur in the bulk and create a layered\nfluid. We measure the rheology of our system by balancing drag and driving\nforces on each layer. Given the extreme confinement, it is remarkable that our\nsystem exhibits rheological behavior very similar to unconfined 2d and 3d hard\nparticle systems, characterized by a dynamic yield stress and shear-thinning of\ncomparable magnitude. By quantifying particle motion perpendicular to shear, we\nshow that particles become more tightly confined to their layers with no\nconcomitant increase in density upon increasing shear rate. Shear thinning is\ntherefore a consequence of a reduction in dissipation due to a weakening in\ninteractions between layers as the shear rate increases.

A common ansatz in this context\nis to divide the mesh in temporal direction into so-called space-time slabs,\nwhich are subsequently weakly connected in time with a Discontinuous Galerkin\napproach. The corresponding jumpterm, which is responsible for imposing the\nweak continuity across space-time slabs can be challenging to compute, in\nparticular in the context of deforming domains. Ensuring a conforming\ndiscretization of the space-time slab at the top and bottom in time direction\nsimplifies the handling of this term immensely. Otherwise, a computationally\nexpensive and error prone projection of the solution from one time-level to\nanother is necessary. However, when it comes to simulations with deformable\ndomains, e.g. for free-surface flows, ensuring conforming meshes is quite\nlaborious. A possible solution to this challenge is to extrude a spatial mesh\nin time at each time-step resulting in the so-called time-discontinuous\nprismatic space-time (D-PST) method. However, this procedure is restricted to\nfinite-elements of 1st order in time. We present a novel algorithmic approach\nfor arbitrarily discretized meshes by flipping the mesh in time-direction for\neach time-step. This ansatz allows for a simple evaluation of the jump-term as\nthe mesh is always conforming. The cost of flipping the mesh around its\nsymmetry plane in time scales with the number of nodes, which makes it\ncomputationally cheaper than an additional update of the mesh to enforce\nconformity or the evaluation of a projection. We validate the approach on\nvarious physical problems with and without deforming domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 13:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

We conclude that the spatial\ndistribution of these binaries is insensitive to the choice of galactic models,\ncompared to the stochastic variation induced by the small sample size. In\nparticular, the time-consuming computation of the binaries' Galactic orbits is\nnot necessary. The distributions of eccentricity and gravitational-wave\nfrequency are, however, affected by the choice of star-formation history.\nBinaries with eccentricities e>0.1, which can be measured by LISA observations,\nare mostly younger than 100 Myr. We caution that comparisons between different\npredictions for LISA observations need to use consistent star formation\nhistories, and that the Galactic star formation history should be taken into\naccount in the analysis of the observations themselves. The lack of strong\ndependency on Galactic models means that LISA detection of double neutron star\nbinaries may provide a relatively clean probe of massive binary star evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 14:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 09:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 13:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Experimental results on Stanford large-scale 3-D\nIndoor Spaces(S3DIS) dataset and outdoor dataset(SemanticKITTI), demonstrate\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed mothod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 15:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 06:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 14:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 08:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 05:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 03:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

However, the current multi-view paradigm trains and\ntests on the same single scene and camera-views, which limits its practical\napplication. In this paper, we propose a cross-view cross-scene (CVCS)\nmulti-view crowd counting paradigm, where the training and testing occur on\ndifferent scenes with arbitrary camera layouts. To dynamically handle the\nchallenge of optimal view fusion under scene and camera layout change and\nnon-correspondence noise due to camera calibration errors or erroneous\nfeatures, we propose a CVCS model that attentively selects and fuses multiple\nviews together using camera layout geometry, and a noise view regularization\nmethod to train the model to handle non-correspondence errors. We also generate\na large synthetic multi-camera crowd counting dataset with a large number of\nscenes and camera views to capture many possible variations, which avoids the\ndifficulty of collecting and annotating such a large real dataset. We then test\nour trained CVCS model on real multi-view counting datasets, by using\nunsupervised domain transfer. The proposed CVCS model trained on synthetic data\noutperforms the same model trained only on real data, and achieves promising\nperformance compared to fully supervised methods that train and test on the\nsame single scene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 15:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

The [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are a fundamental fossil signature to\ntrace the chemical evolution of the disc. Despite of the huge observational and\ntheoretical effort, discrepancies between models and data are still present and\nseveral explanations have been put forward to explain the [$\\alpha$/Fe]\nbimodality. Aims. In this work, we take advantage of a new AMBRE:HARPS dataset,\nwhich provides new and more precise [Mg/Fe] estimations, as well as reliable\nstellar ages for a subsample of stars, to study the evolution of the solar\nneighbourhood. Methods. The above data are compared with detailed chemical\nevolution models for the Milky Way, exploring the most used prescriptions for\nstellar yields and different formation scenarios for the Galactic disc, i.e.\nthe delayed two-infall and the parallel model, also including prescriptions for\nstellar radial migration. Results. We see that most of the stellar yields\nstruggle to reproduce the observed trend of the data and that semi-empirical\nyields are still the best to describe the [Mg/Fe] evolution in the thick and\nthin discs. In particular, most of the yields still predict a steeper decrease\nof the [Mg/Fe] ratio at high metallicity than what is shown by the data. The\nbulk of the data are well reproduced by the parallel and two-infall scenarios,\nbut both scenarios have problems in explaining the most metal-rich and\nmetal-poor tails of the low-$\\alpha$ data. These tails can be explained in\nlight of radial migration from inner and outer disc regions, respectively.\nConclusions. Despite of the evidence of stellar migration, it is difficult to\nestimate the actual contribution of stars from other parts of the disc to the\nsolar vicinity. However, the comparison between data and models suggests that\npeculiar histories of star formation, such as that of the two-infall model, are\nstill needed to reproduce the observed distribution of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 15:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

MATISSE makes it possible to\nimage these structures for the first time. We observed the Circinus Galaxy with\nVLTI/MATISSE, producing 150 correlated flux spectra and 100 closure phase\nspectra.

We fit\nblackbody functions with dust extinction to several aperture-extracted fluxes\nfrom the images to produce a temperature distribution of central dusty\nstructures. We find significant substructure in the circumnuclear dust: central\nunresolved flux of ~0.5 Jy, a thin disk 1.9 pc in diameter oriented along ~45\ndeg,and a ~4x1.5 pc polar emission extending orthogonal to the disk. The polar\nemission exhibits patchiness, which we attribute to clumpy dust. Flux\nenhancements to the east and west of the disk are seen for the first time. We\ndistinguish the temperature profiles of the disk and of the polar emission: the\ndisk shows a steep temperature gradient indicative of denser material; the\npolar profile is flatter, indicating clumpiness and/or lower dust density. The\nunresolved flux is fitted with a high temperature, ~370 K. The polar dust\nremains warm (~200 K) out to 1.5 pc from the disk.

This enormous gain in\nacquisition rate, however, necessitates numerous approximations in light\ntransport, breaking many existing NLOS reconstruction methods that assume an\nidealized image formation model. To bridge the gap, we present a novel deep\nmodel that incorporates the complementary physics priors of wave propagation\nand volume rendering into a neural network for high-quality and robust NLOS\nreconstruction.

Once trained, our model renders\nboth intensity and depth images at inference time in a single forward pass,\ncapable of processing more than 5 captures per second on a high-end GPU.\nThrough extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we show that our\nmethod outperforms prior physics and learning based approaches on both\nsynthetic and real measurements.

Typically, a reservoir computer is constructed by connecting a\nlarge number of nonlinear nodes in a network that includes recurrent\nconnections. In order to achieve accurate results, the reservoir usually\ncontains hundreds to thousands of nodes. This high dimensionality makes it\ndifficult to analyze the reservoir computer using tools from dynamical systems\ntheory. Additionally, the need to create and connect large numbers of nonlinear\nnodes makes it difficult to design and build analog reservoir computers that\ncan be faster and consume less power than digital reservoir computers. We\ndemonstrate here that a reservoir computer may be divided into two parts; a\nsmall set of nonlinear nodes (the reservoir), and a separate set of\ntime-shifted reservoir output signals. The time-shifted output signals serve to\nincrease the rank and memory of the reservoir computer, and the set of\nnonlinear nodes may create an embedding of the input dynamical system. We use\nthis time-shifting technique to obtain excellent performance from an\nopto-electronic delay-based reservoir computer with only a small number of\nvirtual nodes. Because only a few nonlinear nodes are required, construction of\na reservoir computer becomes much easier, and delay-based reservoir computers\ncan operate at much higher speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 11:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Spot fires that occur far from the original burn unit\nare rare but have consequential ramifications since their prediction and\ncontrol remains challenging. To facilitate their prediction, we examine three\nmethods for quantifying the landing distribution of firebrands: crude Monte\nCarlo simulations, importance sampling, and large deviation theory (LDT). In\nparticular, we propose an LDT method that accurately and parsimoniously\nquantifies the low probability events at the tail of the landing distribution.\nIn contrast, Monte Carlo and importance sampling methods are most efficient in\nquantifying the high probability landing distances near the mode of the\ndistribution. However, they become computationally intractable for quantifying\nthe tail of the distribution due to the large sample size required. We also\nshow that the most probable landing distance grows linearly with the mean\ncharacteristic velocity of the wind field.

Simulation result shows that the algorithm converges and improve\nthe aggregated PRR and fairness for C-V2X mode broadcast messages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 08:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

In conventional spectral analyses based\non least-square fitting, hyperfine interactions in materials have been\ndetermined from the shape of observed spectra. In conventional spectral\nanalyses, it is difficult to discuss the validity of the hyperfine interactions\nand the estimated values. We propose a spectral analysis method based on\nBayesian inference for the selection of hyperfine interactions and the\nestimation of M\\\"ossbauer parameters. An appropriate Hamiltonian has been\nselected by comparing Bayesian free energy among possible Hamiltonians. We have\nestimated the M\\\"ossbauer parameters and evaluated their estimated values by\ncalculating the posterior distribution of each M\\\"ossbauer parameter with\nconfidence intervals. We have also discussed the accuracy of the spectral\nanalyses to elucidate the noise intensity dependence of numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 03:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Using this framework, I present a brief case\nstudy of the AirQo project in Kampala, Uganda.
