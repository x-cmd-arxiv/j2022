However,\nclean 1D electronic systems are difficult to realize experimentally,\nparticularly magnetically ordered systems. Here, we show that the van der Waals\nlayered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr behaves like a quasi-1D material embedded\nin a magnetically ordered environment. The strong 1D electronic character\noriginates from the Cr-S chains and the combination of weak interlayer\nhybridization and anisotropy in effective mass and dielectric screening with an\neffective electron mass ratio of $m^e_X/m^e_Y \\sim 50$. This extreme anisotropy\nexperimentally manifests in strong electron-phonon and exciton-phonon\ninteractions, a Peierls-like structural instability and a Fano resonance from a\nvan Hove singularity of similar strength of metallic carbon nanotubes.\nMoreover, due to the reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling, CrSBr\nhosts spectrally narrow (1 meV) excitons of high binding energy and oscillator\nstrength that inherit the 1D character. Overall, CrSBr is best understood as a\nstack of weakly hybridized monolayers and appears to be an experimentally\nattractive candidate for the study of exotic exciton and 1D correlated\nmany-body physics in the presence of magnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 16:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 15:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

The\nsender chooses one of her signals, called an ``anecdote'' and communicates it\nto the receiver. The receiver takes an action, yielding a utility for both\nplayers. Sender and receiver both care about the state of the world but are\nalso influenced by a personal preference so that their ideal actions differ. We\ncharacterize perfect Bayesian equilibria when the sender cannot commit to a\nparticular communication scheme. In this setting the sender faces ``persuasion\ntemptation'': she is tempted to select a more biased anecdote to influence the\nreceiver's action. Anecdotes are still informative to the receiver but\npersuasion comes at the cost of precision. This gives rise to ``informational\nhomophily'' where the receiver prefers to listen to like-minded senders because\nthey provide higher-precision signals. In particular, we show that a sender\nwith access to many anecdotes will essentially send the minimum or maximum\nanecdote even though with high probability she has access to an anecdote close\nto the state of the world that would almost perfectly reveal it to the\nreceiver. In contrast to the classic Crawford-Sobel model, full revelation is a\nknife-edge equilibrium and even small differences in personal preferences will\ninduce highly polarized communication and a loss in utility for any\nequilibrium. We show that for fat-tailed anecdote distributions the receiver\nmight even prefer to talk to poorly informed senders with aligned preferences\nrather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own.\nWe also show that under commitment differences in personal preferences no\nlonger affect communication and the sender will generally report the most\nrepresentative anecdote closest to the posterior mean for common distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 16:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

We\nshow that synchronization transition happens by increasing the global coupling\nparameter $K$ with metasatble states depending on the initial conditions so\nthat hysteresis loops occur. We provide analytic results for the time\ndependence of frequency spread in the large $K$ approximation and by comparing\nit with numerics of $d=2,3$ lattices, we find agreement in the case of ordered\ninitial conditions. However, different power-law (PL) tails occur, when the\nfluctuations are strong. After thermalizing the systems we allow a single line\ncut failure and follow the subsequent overloads with respect to threshold\nvalues $T$. The PDFs $p(N_f)$ of the cascade failures exhibit PL tails near the\nsynchronization transition point $K_c$. Near $K_c$ the exponents of the PL-s\nfor the US power grid vary with $T$ as $1.4 \\le \\tau \\le 2.1$, in agreement\nwith the empirical blackout statistics, while on the EU power grid we find\nsomewhat steeper PL-s characterized by $1.4 \\le \\tau \\le 2.4$.

Based on this\ntechnique, we propose SemAffiNet for point cloud semantic segmentation, which\nutilizes the attention mechanism in the Transformer module to implicitly and\nexplicitly capture global structural knowledge within local parts for overall\ncomprehension of each category.

In this work, we create isolated pairs of spin-polarised\nfermionic atoms in a multi-orbital three-dimensional optical lattice. We\nspectroscopically measure elastic p-wave interaction energies of strongly\ninteracting pairs of atoms near a magnetic Feshbach resonance and find pair\nlifetimes to be up to fifty times larger than in free space. We demonstrate\nthat on-site interaction strengths can be widely tuned by the magnetic field\nand confinement strength but collapse onto a universal single-parameter curve\nwhen rescaled by the harmonic energy and length scales of a single lattice\nsite. Since three-body processes are absent within our approach, we are able to\nobserve elastic unitary p-wave interactions for the first time. We take the\nfirst steps towards coherent temporal control via Rabi oscillations between\nfree-atom and interacting-pair states. All experimental observations are\ncompared both to an exact solution for two harmonically confined atoms\ninteracting via a p-wave pseudopotential, and to numerical solutions using an\nab-initio interaction potential.

Recent\nnonideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations have shown that the internal\nJoule heating associated with magnetically driven disk accretion is inefficient\nat heating the disk midplane. A disk temperature model based on the MHD\nsimulations predicts that in a disk around a solar-mass young star, the water\nsnow line can move inside the current Earth's orbit within 1 Myr after disk\nformation. However, the efficiency of the internal Joule heating depends on the\ndisk's ionization and opacity structures, both of which are governed by dust\ngrains. In this study, we investigate these effects by combing the previous\ntemperature model for magnetically accreting disks with a parameterized model\nfor the grain size and vertical distribution. Grain growth enhances the gas\nionization fraction and thereby allows Joule heating to occur closer to the\nmidplane. However, growth beyond 10 $\\rm \\mu m$ causes a decrease in the disk\nopacity, leading to a lower midplane temperature. The combination of these two\neffects results in the midplane temperature being maximized when the grain size\nis in the range 10-100 $\\rm \\mu m$. Grain growth to millimeter sizes can also\ndelay the snow line's migration to the 1 au orbit by up to a few Myr.

Our approach\nconsists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group\nWindow Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate\nthe quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches,\ngroup attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each\nlocal window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked\nself-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve\nthe grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the\noverall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for\nthe convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works\nseamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result,\nMIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and\nefficient way.

The backdoor functionality does not remain in the system if the\nadversary is removed from the training process since the centralized model\nparameters continuously mutate during successive FL training rounds. Therefore,\nin this work, we propose PerDoor, a persistent-by-construction backdoor\ninjection technique for FL, driven by adversarial perturbation and targeting\nparameters of the centralized model that deviate less in successive FL rounds\nand contribute the least to the main task accuracy. An exhaustive evaluation\nconsidering an image classification scenario portrays on average $10.5\\times$\npersistence over multiple FL rounds compared to traditional backdoor attacks.\nThrough experiments, we further exhibit the potency of PerDoor in the presence\nof state-of-the-art backdoor prevention techniques in an FL system.\nAdditionally, the operation of adversarial perturbation also assists PerDoor in\ndeveloping non-uniform trigger patterns for backdoor inputs compared to uniform\ntriggers (with fixed patterns and locations) of existing backdoor techniques,\nwhich are prone to be easily mitigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 17:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 11:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

From the visualizations, we\nfind that MIM brings locality inductive bias to all layers of the trained\nmodels, but supervised models tend to focus locally at lower layers but more\nglobally at higher layers. That may be the reason why MIM helps Vision\nTransformers that have a very large receptive field to optimize. Using MIM, the\nmodel can maintain a large diversity on attention heads in all layers. But for\nsupervised models, the diversity on attention heads almost disappears from the\nlast three layers and less diversity harms the fine-tuning performance.

Given the ubiquity of networked systems,\nsuch work has broad practical applications in a variety of situations, ranging\nfrom drug and material design to telecommunications. The large decision space\nof possible reconfigurations, however, makes this problem computationally\nintensive. In this paper, we cast the problem of network rewiring for\noptimizing a specified structural property as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),\nin which a decision-maker is given a budget of modifications that are performed\nsequentially.

Here we\nargue that in the molecular picture the $Y(4230)$ (or $Y(4260)$), the $Y(4360)$\nand the recently discovered $Y(4500)$ and $Y(4620)$ vector-like resonances are\nlinked by these two symmetries. By formulating a contact-range effective field\ntheory for the $D \\bar{D}_1$ and $D_s \\bar{D}_{s1}$ family of S- and P-wave\ncharmed meson-antimeson systems, we find that if the $Y(4230)$ were to be a\npure $D \\bar{D}_1$ molecular state, there would be a $D^* \\bar{D}_1$ partner\nwith a mass similar to the $Y(4360)$, a $D_s \\bar{D}_{s1}$ partner with a mass\nclose to the $Y(4500)$ and three $J=1,2$ $D_s^* \\bar{D}_{s1}$ and $J=3$ $D_s^*\n\\bar{D}_{s2}^{*}$ bound states with a mass in the vicinity of $4630\\,{\\rm\nMeV}$, of which the first one ($J=1$) might correspond with the $Y(4620)$. The\nprevious predictions can in turn be improved by modifying the assumptions we\nhave used to build the effective field theory.

Here, we introduce a neural architecture\nfor multivariate time series classification designed to address these unique\ndomain challenges. Our proposed behavioral representation learning approach\ncombines novel tasks for self-supervised pretraining and transfer learning to\naddress data scarcity, and captures long-range dependencies across long-history\ntime series through transformer self-attention following convolutional neural\nnetwork-based dimensionality reduction. We propose an evaluation framework\naimed at reflecting expected real-world performance in plausible deployment\nscenarios.

It is clear that one of the reasons\nfor the speedup is the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, which\nallows a quantum processor to be in a superposition of different states at the\nsame time. While such superposition can lead to entanglement across different\nqubits of the processors, there also exists quantum algorithms which outperform\nclassical ones using superpositions of individual qubits without entangling\nthem. As an example, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm allows one to determine a\nbit string encoded into an oracle. While the classical version of the algorithm\nrequires multiple calls of the oracle to learn the bit string, a single query\nof the oracle is enough in the quantum case. In this Letter, we analyze in\ndetail the quantum resources in the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. For this, we\nintroduce and study its probabilistic version, where the goal is to guess the\nbit string after a single call of the oracle.

An adversary can embed a hidden backdoor into a model to\nmanipulate its predictions by only modifying a few training data, without\ncontrolling the training process. Currently, a tangible signature has been\nwidely observed across a diverse set of backdoor poisoning attacks -- models\ntrained on a poisoned dataset tend to learn separable latent representations\nfor poison and clean samples. This latent separation is so pervasive that a\nfamily of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed\nlatent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via\ncluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently\nfollows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks?\nThis question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent\nseparability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor\npoisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks\nto present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two\nkey components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their\nsemantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor\nlearning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison\nsamples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness\nof our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor\ndefenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with\nnegligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take\ncaution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 20:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 00:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 03:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Our approach generalizes\nweight sharing to non-Euclidean neuroimaging data by first performing spectral\nclustering based on the structural and functional similarity between voxels.\nThe spectral clusters and their assignments can then be used as patches in an\nadapted multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer model to share parameters among\ninput points. To encourage temporally independent latent factors, we use an\nadditional total correlation term in the loss. Our approach is evaluated on\ndata with multiple motor sub-tasks to assess whether the model captures\ndisentangled latent factors that correspond to each sub-task. Then, to assess\nthe latent factors we find further, we compare the spatial location of each\nlatent factor to the motor homunculus. Finally, we show that our approach\ncaptures task effects better than the current gold standard of source signal\nseparation, independent component analysis (ICA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 21:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

It is\neven more challenging to disentangle common and individual patterns when\ncomparing brains at different neuro-developmental stages. In this work, we\ndeveloped a novel learning-based few-shot embedding framework to encode the\ncortical folding patterns into a latent space represented by a group of\nanatomically meaningful embedding vectors. Specifically, we adopted 3-hinge\n(3HG) network as the substrate and designed an autoencoder-based embedding\nframework to learn a common embedding vector for each 3HG's multi-hop feature:\neach 3HG can be represented as a combination of these feature embeddings via a\nset of individual specific coefficients to characterize individualized\nanatomical information. That is, the regularity of folding patterns is encoded\ninto the embeddings, while the individual variations are preserved by the\nmulti=hop combination coefficients. To effectively learn the embeddings for the\npopulation with very limited samples, few-shot learning was adopted. We applied\nour method on adult HCP and pediatric datasets with 1,000+ brains (from 34\ngestational weeks to young adult). Our experimental results show that: 1) the\nlearned embedding vectors can quantitatively encode the commonality and\nindividuality of cortical folding patterns; 2) with the embeddings we can\nrobustly infer the complicated many-to-many anatomical correspondences among\ndifferent brains and 3) our model can be successfully transferred to new\npopulations with very limited training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 21:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

Adaptive optics (AO) can only partially\ncompensate for these effects. Neither multi-frame blind deconvolution (MFBD)\nnor speckle techniques restore AO-compensated images to the correct power\nspectrum and contrast. MFBD can only compensate for a finite number of\nlow-order aberrations, leaving a tail of uncorrected high-order modes. Speckle\nrestoration of AO-corrected data depends on calibrations of the AO corrections\nand assumptions regarding the height distribution of atmospheric turbulence. We\nseek to develop an improvement to MFBD that combines speckle's usage of\nturbulence statistics to account for high-order modes with the ability of MFBD\nto sense low-order modes that can be partially corrected by AO and/or include\nfixed or slowly changing instrumental aberrations. We modify the\nimage-formation model, supplementing the fitted low-order wavefront aberrations\nwith tails of random high-order aberrations. These tails follow Kolmogorov\nstatistics scaled to estimated or measured values of Fried's parameter, r0,\nthat characterize the strength of the seeing at the moment of data collection.\nWe refer to this as statistical diversity (SD). We test MFBD with SD with\nnoise-free synthetic data, simulating many different r0 and numbers of\nAO-corrected modes. SD improves the contrasts and power spectra of restored\nimages, both in accuracy and in consistency with varying r0, without penalty in\nprocessing time. With focus diversity (FD), the results are almost perfect. SD\nalso reduces errors in the fitted wavefront parameters. MFBD with SD and FD\nseems resistant to several percents of error in r0. Adding SD to MFBD shows\ngreat promise for improving contrasts and power spectra in restored images.\nFurther studies with real data are merited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 21:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 19:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Since this phenomenon can lead to patterns of interactions that\nsegregate people along different demographic dimensions, it can also lead to\ninequalities in access to information, resources, and opportunities. As we\nconsider potential interventions that might alleviate the effects of\nsegregation, we face the challenge that homophily constitutes a pervasive and\norganic force that is difficult to push back against. Designing effective\ninterventions can therefore benefit from identifying counterbalancing social\nprocesses that might be harnessed to work in opposition to segregation.\n  In this work, we show that triadic closure -- another common phenomenon that\nposits that individuals with a mutual connection are more likely to be\nconnected to one another -- can be one such process. In doing so, we challenge\na long-held belief that triadic closure and homophily work in tandem. By\nanalyzing several fundamental network models using popular integration\nmeasures, we demonstrate the desegregating potential of triadic closure. We\nfurther empirically investigate this effect on real-world dynamic networks,\nsurfacing observations that mirror our theoretical findings. We leverage these\ninsights to discuss simple interventions that can help reduce segregation in\nsettings that exhibit an interplay between triadic closure and homophily. We\nconclude with a discussion on qualitative implications for the design of\ninterventions in settings where individuals arrive in an online fashion, and\nthe designer can influence the initial set of connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 22:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

It turns out that a novel buckling\nmode, preserving the nature of surface wrinkling in tubular structures, can be\ninduced under a plane-strain setup, and a smaller size of the unit cell is\nattained compared to the counterpart of traditional buckled profile in soft\nporous elastomers. In particular, this buckling pattern is able to produce\nseveral bandgaps in different frequency ranges as the macroscopic mean strain\nincreases. We further introduce a metallic core as local resonator, and the\nupdated metamaterial allows a low-frequency bandgap, the bandgap width of which\ncan be estimated by a simplified theoretical model. As more free parameters are\ninvolved in the structure, we perform a detailed parametric study to elucidate\nthe influences of the modulus ratio between coating and matrix, the porosity,\nthe core radius, and the macroscopic mean strain on the buckling initiation and\nthe evolution of bandgap. Remarkably, a stiffer surface coating is prone to\nenhance the stability of the structure, which is contrary to existing results\nin film/substrate bilayers.

Most GNNs interpret nearly all the node\nconnections as inductive bias with feature smoothness, and implicitly assume\nstrong homophily on the observed graph. However, real-world networks are not\nalways homophilic, but sometimes exhibit heterophilic patterns where adjacent\nnodes share dissimilar attributes and distinct labels. Therefore,GNNs smoothing\nthe node proximity holistically may aggregate inconsistent information arising\nfrom both task-relevant and irrelevant connections. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel edge splitting GNN (ES-GNN) framework, which generalizes GNNs beyond\nhomophily by jointly partitioning network topology and disentangling node\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed framework employs an interpretable\noperation to adaptively split the set of edges of the original graph into two\nexclusive sets indicating respectively the task-relevant and irrelevant\nrelations among nodes. The node features are then aggregated separately on\nthese two partial edge sets to produce disentangled representations, based on\nwhich a more accurate edge splitting can be attained later. Theoretically, we\nshow that our ES-GNN can be regarded as a solution to a graph denoising problem\nwith a disentangled smoothness assumption, which further illustrates our\nmotivations and interprets the improved generalization.

We begin by identifying a critical flaw in a popular algorithmic\nchoice used by many ensemble-based RL algorithms, namely the use of shared\npessimistic target values when computing each ensemble member's Bellman error.\nThrough theoretical analyses and construction of examples in toy MDPs, we\ndemonstrate that shared pessimistic targets can paradoxically lead to value\nestimates that are effectively optimistic. Given this result, we propose MSG, a\npractical offline RL algorithm that trains an ensemble of $Q$-functions with\nindependently computed targets based on completely separate networks, and\noptimizes a policy with respect to the lower confidence bound of predicted\naction values. Our experiments on the popular D4RL and RL Unplugged offline RL\nbenchmarks demonstrate that on challenging domains such as antmazes, MSG with\ndeep ensembles surpasses highly well-tuned state-of-the-art methods by a wide\nmargin. Additionally, through ablations on benchmarks domains, we verify the\ncritical significance of using independently trained $Q$-functions, and study\nthe role of ensemble size. Finally, as using separate networks per ensemble\nmember can become computationally costly with larger neural network\narchitectures, we investigate whether efficient ensemble approximations\ndeveloped for supervised learning can be similarly effective, and demonstrate\nthat they do not match the performance and robustness of MSG with separate\nnetworks, highlighting the need for new efforts into efficient uncertainty\nestimation directed at RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 01:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

We accomplish this by mapping displacements and\nresulting contact forces between a linear collision proxy and the underlying\nhigh-order representation.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a selection of problems\nfrom graphics, computational fabrication, and scientific computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 02:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 20:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 21:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Previous works\nattempt to directly synthesize a white-box logic program as the DRL policy,\nmanifesting logic-driven behaviors. However, most synthesis methods are built\non imperative or declarative programming, and each has a distinct limitation,\nrespectively. The former ignores the cause-effect logic during synthesis,\nresulting in low generalizability across tasks. The latter is strictly\nproof-based, thus failing to synthesize programs with complex hierarchical\nlogic. In this paper, we combine the above two paradigms together and propose a\nnovel Generalizable Logic Synthesis (GALOIS) framework to synthesize\nhierarchical and strict cause-effect logic programs. GALOIS leverages the\nprogram sketch and defines a new sketch-based hybrid program language for\nguiding the synthesis. Based on that, GALOIS proposes a sketch-based program\nsynthesis method to automatically generate white-box programs with\ngeneralizable and interpretable cause-effect logic. Extensive evaluations on\nvarious decision-making tasks with complex logic demonstrate the superiority of\nGALOIS over mainstream baselines regarding the asymptotic performance,\ngeneralizability, and great knowledge reusability across different\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 02:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

When the\nsurface of the land is undulating (not flat), these typical hyperbolic fitting\nmethods becomes inaccurate. This is because, the reflection patterns change\nwith the uneven ground surfaces.

Though various algorithms are proposed,\nmost of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph which can\npreserve original predictions. However, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in\nthis framework: several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as\nthe original graphs.

By doing so, the\ndistribution diversity among various SAT instances can be dramatically reduced,\nwhich facilitates improving the generalization capability of the learned model.\nNext, we regard the distribution of SAT solutions being a product of\nconditional Bernoulli distributions. Based on this observation, we approximate\nthe SAT solving procedure with a conditional generative model, leveraging a\nnovel directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) with two polarity\nprototypes for conditional SAT modeling. To effectively train the generative\nmodel, with the help of logic simulation tools, we obtain the probabilities of\nnodes in the AIG being logic `1' as rich supervision.

However, due to the\nnon-convexity/non-concavity of the underlying objective function, theoretical\nunderstandings of this method are limited. In our paper, we consider solving an\nentropy-regularized variant of the Markov game. The regularization introduces\nstructure into the optimization landscape that make the solutions more\nidentifiable and allow the problem to be solved more efficiently. Our main\ncontribution is to show that under proper choices of the regularization\nparameter, the gradient descent ascent algorithm converges to the Nash\nequilibrium of the original unregularized problem. We explicitly characterize\nthe finite-time performance of the last iterate of our algorithm, which vastly\nimproves over the existing convergence bound of the gradient descent ascent\nalgorithm without regularization.

Although a wide array of\nhand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet to be\nan ideal solution for how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, and\nhow to develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design.\nIn this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic\npolymer graph representation. Our pipeline for polymer property predictions is\ncomprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the\nperiodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN)\nthat leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn\nchemically-relevant polymer descriptors.

Deep generative models of\nprotein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most\nsuccessful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these\nmethods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and\ndiverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited\nby the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large\nlanguage models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences\nfrom diverse families address these problems and show potential to eventually\nbridge the performance gap.

Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants,\nrobustness to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach\noffers significant gain of scope over existing approaches.

The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in\ndemand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical\nfacilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the\nseverity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in\ndetecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and\nDeep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT\nScan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID,\nand Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID\ncategory, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are\nof Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially\npre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)\napproach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for\nextracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and\nthe accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold\ncross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined\nwell-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and\nclassification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its\nseverity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19\nimages and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help\nradiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 06:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

Data quality directly dominates the effect of\ndeep learning models, and the long-tailed distribution is one of the factors\naffecting data quality. The long-tailed phenomenon is prevalent due to the\nprevalence of power law in nature. In this case, the performance of deep\nlearning models is often dominated by the head classes while the learning of\nthe tail classes is severely underdeveloped. In order to learn adequately for\nall classes, many researchers have studied and preliminarily addressed the\nlong-tailed problem. In this survey, we focus on the problems caused by\nlong-tailed data distribution, sort out the representative long-tailed visual\nrecognition datasets and summarize some mainstream long-tailed studies.\nSpecifically, we summarize these studies into ten categories from the\nperspective of representation learning, and outline the highlights and\nlimitations of each category. Besides, we have studied four quantitative\nmetrics for evaluating the imbalance, and suggest using the Gini coefficient to\nevaluate the long-tailedness of a dataset. Based on the Gini coefficient, we\nquantitatively study 20 widely-used and large-scale visual datasets proposed in\nthe last decade, and find that the long-tailed phenomenon is widespread and has\nnot been fully studied. Finally, we provide several future directions for the\ndevelopment of long-tailed learning to provide more ideas for readers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 06:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

This inconsistency is called the\nHubble tension and is vastly studied in recent years. Early Dark Energy (EDE)\ngives a few percent contribution to the total energy density of the universe\nonly at an epoch before the recombination, and it is considered as a promising\nsolution to the tension. A simple realization of EDE is given by dynamics of a\nscalar field, called the EDE scalar, and models including the EDE scalar are\nextensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we present a novel EDE\nscenario based on higher-dimensional gauge theories. An extra component of\ngauge fields associated with a compact extra dimension behaves as the EDE\nscalar at low-energy and has a periodic potential, which has a similar form as\npotentials for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGB). In a five-dimensional U(1)\ngauge theory, we show that a scalar field that originates from the gauge field\ncan give EDE through its dynamics in a PNGB type potential with a suitable\nchoice of parameters in the theory. We focus on the scenario where EDE is\nexplained by the scalar field and clarify constraints on the fundamental\nparameters of the gauge theory, such as the gauge coupling, the\ncompactification scale, and the mass parameters for matter fields. We also find\nthat a sufficient dilution of EDE requires non-trivial relations among U(1)\ncharges of matter fields. With specific matter contents, we numerically solve\nthe time evolution of the scalar field and confirm that its energy density\nbehaves as an EDE. In our scenario, the parameters of the gauge theory and\npredicted properties of EDE are related to each other. Thus, the cosmological\nrestrictions on the EDE properties provide insights into higher-dimensional\ngauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 06:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 08:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 09:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

The aforementioned rule mandates that all Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) have to broadcast information about their identity and location\nwirelessly to allow for immediate invasion attribution. However, the\nenforcement of such a rule poses severe concerns on UAV operators, especially\nin terms of location privacy and tracking threats, to name a few. Indeed, by\nsimply eavesdropping on the wireless channel, an adversary could know the\nprecise location of the UAV and track it, as well as obtaining sensitive\ninformation on path source and destination of the UAV. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the trade-off between location privacy and data utility that can be\nprovided to UAVs when obfuscating the broadcasted location through differential\nprivacy techniques. Leveraging the concept of Geo-Indistinguishability\n(Geo-Ind), already adopted in the context of Location-Based Services (LBS), we\nshow that it is possible to enhance the privacy of the UAVs without preventing\nCI operators to timely detect unauthorized invasions. In particular, our\nexperiments showed that when the location of an UAV is obfuscated with an\naverage distance of 1.959 km, a carefully designed UAV detection system can\ndetect 97.9% of invasions, with an average detection delay of 303.97 msec. The\nUAVs have to trade-off such enhanced location privacy with a non-negligible\nprobability of false positives, i.e., being detected as invading while not\nreally invading the no-fly zone. UAVs and CI operators can solve such ambiguous\nsituations later on through the help of the FAA, being this latter the only one\nthat can unveil the actual location of the UAV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 07:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

We also\nfind that the spectral shift of the probe pulse induced by the excitation\nfollows both the magnitude and time dynamics of the NLO phase shift measured\nvia the BD experiments. We observe large, ultrafast cross-phase modulation in\nagreement with a redistribution of carriers in the conduction band.

Short-term intraday trading becomes increasingly important due to\nthe higher penetration of renewables. In Germany, the intraday electricity\nprice typically fluctuates around the day-ahead price of the European Power\nEXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a\nprobabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to\nthe day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by\nconsidering the four 15 min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a\nfour-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial,\nmultivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow,\ni.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density\nestimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the\ninfluence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and\nimpact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The\nnormalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and\nprobabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression\nmodel. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends\nwith the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals.

The individual generators of a particular zone participate in\nthe secondary voltage control by aligning their reactive powers with respect to\nthe pilot point voltage reference. The decentralised nature of the proposed\ncontrol strategy enables plug and play operation: run with different numbers of\ngenerators without any need of regulators reconfiguration, resilience in case\nof generator failure. This allows one to use such control to integrate\nrenewable generators to existing secondary regulations alongside with the\nclassic generators.

The deployment of a discrete-time intelligent proportional\ncontroller simplifies the tuning of the controller gains.

However,\nstatic network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which will\nchanges frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel feudal MARL\napproach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we first partition the\nnetwork into several regions according to the traffic flow. To do this, we\npropose two approaches: one is directly to use graph neural network (GNN) to\ngenerate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search\n(MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we\ndesign a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given\nby the dynamic network partition.

The challenge, both for experiments\nand simulations, is that the liquid-liquid phase transition occurs under deeply\nsupercooled conditions, where crystallization occurs very rapidly. Thus, early\nevidence from numerical equation of state studies was challenged, with the\nargument that slow spontaneous crystallization had been misinterpreted as\nevidence of a second liquid state. Rigorous free energy calculations have\nsubsequently confirmed the existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in\nsome models of water, and exciting new experimental evidence has since\nsupported these computational results. Similar results have so far not been\nfound for silicon. Here, we present results from free energy calculations\nperformed for silicon modelled with the classical, empirical Stillinger-Weber\npotential. Through a careful study employing state-of-the-art constrained\nsimulation protocols and numerous checks for thermodynamic consistency, we find\nthat there are two distinct metastable liquid states and a phase transition.\nOur results resolve a long-standing debate concerning the existence of a\nliquid-liquid transition in supercooled liquid silicon and address key\nquestions regarding the nature of the phase transition and the associated\ncritical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 09:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of this puzzling\nphenomenon from the perspective of expressive power for deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, for binary classification problems with well-separated data, we\nshow that, for ReLU networks, while mild over-parameterization is sufficient\nfor high robust training accuracy, there exists a constant robust\ngeneralization gap unless the size of the neural network is exponential in the\ndata dimension $d$. This result holds even if the data is linear separable\n(which means achieving standard generalization is easy), and more generally for\nany parameterized function classes as long as their VC dimension is at most\npolynomial in the number of parameters.

However, the missing data problem is pervasive\nin many practical scenarios such as clinical trials, economics, and biology.\nOne straightforward way to address the missing data problem is first to impute\nthe data using off-the-shelf imputation methods and then apply existing causal\ndiscovery methods. However, such a two-step method may suffer from\nsuboptimality, as the imputation algorithm may introduce bias for modeling the\nunderlying data distribution. In this paper, we develop a general method, which\nwe call MissDAG, to perform causal discovery from data with incomplete\nobservations. Focusing mainly on the assumptions of ignorable missingness and\nthe identifiable additive noise models (ANMs), MissDAG maximizes the expected\nlikelihood of the visible part of observations under the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, in cases where\ncomputing the posterior distributions of parameters in closed-form is not\nfeasible, Monte Carlo EM is leveraged to approximate the likelihood. In the\nM-step, MissDAG leverages the density transformation to model the noise\ndistributions with simpler and specific formulations by virtue of the ANMs and\nuses a likelihood-based causal discovery algorithm with directed acyclic graph\nconstraint. We demonstrate the flexibility of MissDAG for incorporating various\ncausal discovery algorithms and its efficacy through extensive simulations and\nreal data experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 09:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 04:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 04:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We find an average background of 1.39\n$\\pm$ 0.02 cpd/kg/keV in the region of interest and a spectrum consistent with\ndata previously acquired in the PoP setup, where the external veto background\nsuppression was in place. Our background model indicates that the dominant\nbackground component is due to decays of $^{210}$Pb, only partly residing in\nthe crystal itself. The other location of $^{210}$Pb is the reflector foil that\nwraps the crystal. We now proceed to design the experimental setup for the\nphysics phase based on an array of similar crystals, using a low radioactivity\nPTFE reflector and further improving the passive shielding strategy compliant\nwith the new safety and environmental requirements of Laboratori Nazionali del\nGran Sasso.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 10:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 09:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 17:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

In this paper, we study YouTube channels found to post suitable or\ndisturbing videos targeting kids in the past. We identify a clear discrepancy\nbetween what YouTube assumes and flags as inappropriate content and channel,\nvs. what is found to be disturbing content and still available on the platform,\ntargeting kids. In particular, we find that almost 60\\% of videos that were\nmanually annotated and classified as disturbing by an older study in 2019 (a\ncollection bootstrapped with Elsa and other keywords related to children\nvideos), are still available on YouTube in mid 2021.

Apparently, these channels are less likely to\nbe set as \"madeForKids\" than those sharing suitable content. In addition,\nchannels posting disturbing videos utilize their channel features such as\nkeywords, description, topics, posts, etc., to appeal to kids (e.g., using\ngame-related keywords). Finally, we use a collection of such channel and\ncontent features to train ML classifiers able to detect, at channel creation\ntime, when a channel will be related to disturbing content uploads.

Both of these\ncomplications arise when sampling finely time-discretised continuous-time path\nintegral models, but can occur with hidden Markov models too. Multinomial\nresampling, which is commonly employed with CPFs, resamples excessively for\nweakly informative observations and thereby introduces extra variance.\nFurthermore, slowly mixing dynamics render the backward/ancestor sampling steps\nineffective, leading to degeneracy issues. We detail two conditional resampling\nstrategies suitable for the weakly informative regime: the so-called `killing'\nresampling and the systematic resampling with mean partial order.

This is\nin stark contrast to theory, dictating that given an adequate prior and a\nwell-specified model, the untempered Bayesian posterior should achieve optimal\nperformance. Despite the community's extensive efforts, the observed gains in\nperformance still remain disputed with several plausible causes pointing at its\norigin. While data augmentation has been empirically recognized as one of the\nmain drivers of this effect, a theoretical account of its role, on the other\nhand, is largely missing. In this work we identify two interlaced factors\nconcurrently influencing the strength of the cold posterior effect, namely the\ncorrelated nature of augmentations and the degree of invariance of the employed\nmodel to such transformations.

Upon further investigation, we observe two drawbacks\nstemming from their training procedure and loss definition, hindering their\ndirect deployment as proxies in black-box optimisation. First, we notice that\nthese models are trained on uniformly distributed inputs, which impairs\npredictive accuracy on non-uniform data - a setting arising from any typical BO\nloop due to exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Second, we realise that\ntraining losses (e.g., cross-entropy) only asymptotically guarantee accurate\nposterior approximations, i.e., after arriving at the global optimum, which\ngenerally cannot be ensured.

Focussing on the\nclassic multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework, the current work quantifies the\nperformance of bandit algorithms by applying a fundamental welfare function,\nnamely the Nash social welfare (NSW) function. This corresponds to equating\nalgorithm's performance to the geometric mean of its expected rewards and leads\nus to the study of Nash regret, defined as the difference between the -- a\npriori unknown -- optimal mean (among the arms) and the algorithm's\nperformance. Since NSW is known to satisfy fairness axioms, our approach\ncomplements the utilitarian considerations of average (cumulative) regret,\nwherein the algorithm is evaluated via the arithmetic mean of its expected\nrewards.\n  This work develops an algorithm that, given the horizon of play $T$, achieves\na Nash regret of $O \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{{k \\log T}}{T}} \\right)$, here $k$\ndenotes the number of arms in the MAB instance. Since, for any algorithm, the\nNash regret is at least as much as its average regret (the AM-GM inequality),\nthe known lower bound on average regret holds for Nash regret as well.\nTherefore, our Nash regret guarantee is essentially tight. In addition, we\ndevelop an anytime algorithm with a Nash regret guarantee of $O \\left(\n\\sqrt{\\frac{{k\\log T}}{T}} \\log T \\right)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 12:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

These factors\nincrease domain discrepancy between training (source domain) and testing\n(target domain) database and make the learnt models degenerate in application.\nMeanwhile, due to lack of labeled target data, directly fine-tuning the\npre-learnt models becomes intractable and impractical. In this paper, we\npropose a new clustering-based domain adaptation method designed for face\nrecognition task in which the source and target domain do not share any\nclasses. Our method effectively learns the discriminative target feature by\naligning the feature domain globally, and, at the meantime, distinguishing the\ntarget clusters locally.

However, such GUI\ncomplexity posts a great challenge to the GUI implementation. According to our\npilot study of crowdtesting bug reports, display issues such as text overlap,\ncomponent occlusion, missing image always occur during GUI rendering on\ndifferent devices due to the software or hardware compatibility. They\nnegatively influence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience.

To address this challenge,\ncross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned\nfrom data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of\ndata-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities\nshow irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of\nexisting Few-Shot Learning (\\emph{FSL}) methods. Therefore, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called\nST-GFSL.

However,\nlimited by expertise and resources, most users do not have enough capability to\nimplement EAs to solve COPs. An intuitive and promising solution is to\noutsource evolutionary operations to a cloud server, whilst it suffers from\nprivacy concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel computing paradigm,\nevolution as a service (EaaS), where a cloud server renders evolutionary\ncomputation services for users without sacrificing users' privacy. Inspired by\nthe idea of EaaS, this paper designs PEGA, a novel privacy-preserving GA for\nCOPs. Specifically, PEGA enables users outsourcing COPs to the cloud server\nholding a competitive GA and approximating the optimal solution in a\nprivacy-preserving manner. PEGA features the following characteristics. First,\nany user without expertise and enough resources can solve her COPs. Second,\nPEGA does not leak contents of optimization problems, i.e., users' privacy.\nThird, PEGA has the same capability as the conventional GA to approximate the\noptimal solution. We implements PEGA falling in a twin-server architecture and\nevaluates it in the traveling salesman problem (TSP, a widely known COP).\nParticularly, we utilize encryption cryptography to protect users' privacy and\ncarefully design a suit of secure computing protocols to support evolutionary\noperators of GA on encrypted data. Privacy analysis demonstrates that PEGA does\nnot disclose the contents of the COP to the cloud server. Experimental\nevaluation results on four TSP datasets show that PEGA is as effective as the\nconventional GA in approximating the optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 12:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

The latter\nis determined by a pair of local times $\\ell_{n,t}$, $n=0,1$, which are\nBrownian functionals that keep track of particle-surface encounters over the\ntime interval $[0,t]$.

The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely\na malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected target vertex, the\ndetector places a sensor at a single vertex to monitor the system and detect\nthe presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary selects a\nsingle vertex through which to conduct a cyber-attack that maximally disrupts\nthe target vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first\ncontribution, for a given pair of attack and monitor vertices and a known\ntarget vertex, the game payoff function is defined as the output-to-output gain\nof the respective system. Then, the paper characterizes the set of feasible\nactions by the detector that ensures bounded values of the game payoff.\nFinally, an algebraic sufficient condition is proposed to examine whether a\ngiven vertex belongs to the set of feasible monitor vertices. The optimal\nsensor placement is then determined by computing the mixed-strategy Nash\nequilibrium of the zero-sum game through linear programming. The approach is\nillustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked control system\nwith a given target vertex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

Archimax copulas are a family of distributions endowed with a precise\nrepresentation that allows simultaneous modeling of the bulk and the tails of a\ndistribution. Rather than separating the two as is typically done in practice,\nincorporating additional information from the bulk may improve inference of the\ntails, where observations are limited. Building on the stochastic\nrepresentation of Archimax copulas, we develop a non-parametric inference\nmethod and sampling algorithm. Our proposed methods, to the best of our\nknowledge, are the first that allow for highly flexible and scalable inference\nand sampling algorithms, enabling the increased use of Archimax copulas in\npractical settings. We experimentally compare to state-of-the-art density\nmodeling techniques, and the results suggest that the proposed method\neffectively extrapolates to the tails while scaling to higher dimensional data.\nOur findings suggest that the proposed algorithms can be used in a variety of\napplications where understanding the interplay between the bulk and the tails\nof a distribution is necessary, such as healthcare and safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 12:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The\nconflict between maintaining privacy and ensuring input authenticity has often\nbeen hindered by the need to share raw data, which contains all the\nparalinguistic information required to infer a variety of sensitive\ncharacteristics. Users of voice assistants put their trust in service\nproviders; however, this trust is potentially misplaced considering the\nemergence of first-party 'honest-but-curious' or 'semi-honest' threats. A\nfurther security risk is presented by imposters gaining access to systems by\npretending to be the user leveraging replay or 'deepfake' attacks. Our\nobjective is to design and develop a new voice input-based system that offers\nthe following specifications: local authentication to reduce the need for\nsharing raw voice data, local privacy preservation based on user preferences,\nallowing more flexibility in integrating such a system given target\napplications privacy constraints, and achieving good performance in these\ntargeted applications. The key idea is to locally derive token-based\ncredentials based on unique-identifying attributes obtained from the user's\nvoice and offer selective sensitive information filtering before transmitting\nraw data. Our system consists of (i) 'VoiceID', boosted with a liveness\ndetection technology to thwart replay attacks; (ii) a flexible privacy filter\nthat allows users to select the level of privacy protection they prefer for\ntheir data. The system yields 98.68% accuracy in verifying legitimate users\nwith cross-validation and runs in tens of milliseconds on a CPU and single-core\nARM processor without specialized hardware. Our system demonstrates the\nfeasibility of filtering raw voice input closer to users, in accordance with\ntheir privacy preferences, while maintaining their authenticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 21:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The model\ndescribes a dynamic non-rigid (or elastic) deformation in differential manifold\nto mimic the soft tissues elasticity under wave fluctuation in vivo. Based on\nthe model, three local deformation invariants are constructed by two tensors\ndefined by the first and second order derivatives from the CT images and used\nto generate elastic feature maps after normalization via a novel signal\nsuppression method. The model-based elastic image features are extracted from\nthe feature maps and fed to machine learning to perform lesion classifications.\nTwo pathologically proven image datasets of colon polyps (44 malignant and 43\nbenign) and lung nodules (46 malignant and 20 benign) were used to evaluate the\nproposed model-based lesion classification. The outcomes of this modeling\napproach reached the score of area under the curve of the receiver operating\ncharacteristics of 94.2 % for the polyps and 87.4 % for the nodules, resulting\nin an average gain of 5 % to 30 % over ten existing state-of-the-art lesion\nclassification methods.

Only recently their use as tracers of clustering,\nsimilar to what already proposed for supernovae, has been studied. Focusing on\nthe expected specifications of the Einstein Telescope (ET), we forecast here\nthe performance on cosmological parameters of future standard sirens as both\ndistance and density indicators, with emphasis on the linear perturbation\ngrowth index and on spatial curvature. We improve upon previous studies in a\nnumber of ways: a more detailed analysis of available telescope time, the\ninclusion of more cosmological and nuisance parameters, the Alcock-Paczynski\ncorrection, the use of sirens also as both velocity and density tracers, and a\nmore accurate estimation of the distance posterior. We find that the analysis\nof the clustering of sirens improves the constraints on $H_0$ by 30% and on\n$\\Omega_{k0}$ by over an order of magnitude, with respect to their use merely\nas distance indicators. With 5 years of joint ET and Rubin Observatory\nfollow-ups we could reach precision of 0.1 km/s/Mpc in $H_0$ and 0.02 in\n$\\Omega_{k0}$ using only data in the range $0<z<0.5$.

This situation\narises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs\nthan states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their\nsystem theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension\ndominating learning complexity.

Previous methods would rather\nfocus on improving the reconstruction ability of the generator by some internal\nenhancements such as attention, adaptive normalization and light adjustment,\n$etc.$. However, they pay less attention to discriminating the foreground and\nbackground appearance features within a restricted generator, which becomes a\nnew challenge in image harmonization task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nimage harmonization framework with external style fusion and region-wise\ncontrastive learning scheme. For the external style fusion, we leverage the\nexternal background appearance from the encoder as the style reference to\ngenerate harmonized foreground in the decoder. This approach enhances the\nharmonization ability of the decoder by external background guidance. Moreover,\nfor the contrastive learning scheme, we design a region-wise contrastive loss\nfunction for image harmonization task. Specifically, we first introduce a\nstraight-forward samples generation method that selects negative samples from\nthe output harmonized foreground region and selects positive samples from the\nground-truth background region. Our method attempts to bring together\ncorresponding positive and negative samples by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between the foreground and background styles, which desirably makes\nour harmonization network more robust to discriminate the foreground and\nbackground style features when harmonizing composite images. Extensive\nexperiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve a clear\nimprovement in harmonization quality and demonstrate the good generalization\ncapability in real-scenario applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 15:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 05:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The inclusion of more detailed\nphysics such as higher-order multipoles and relativistic spin-induced orbital\nprecession increases the complexity and hence also computational cost of\nwaveform models, which presents a severe bottleneck to the parameter inference\nproblem. A popular method to generate waveforms more efficiently is to build a\nfast surrogate model of a slower one. In this paper, we show that traditional\nsurrogate modelling methods combined with artificial neural networks can be\nused to build a computationally highly efficient while still accurate emulation\nof multipolar time-domain waveform models of precessing binary black holes.

Both humans and sophisticated AI\nagents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain\nrewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind.\nThis book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general\naudience, requiring only some relevant scientific background. The book starts\nwith the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration\nmeans the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a\nreward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the\noverwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and\nscarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent\nacting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability,\nand uncertainty, which all lead to frustration. Fundamental in such modelling\nis the idea of learning, or adaptation to the environment. While AI uses\nmachine learning, humans and animals adapt by a combination of evolutionary\nmechanisms and ordinary learning. Even frustration is fundamentally an error\nsignal that the system uses for learning. This book explores various aspects\nand limitations of learning algorithms and their implications regarding\nsuffering. At the end of the book, the computational theory is used to derive\nvarious interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans.\nThe amount of frustration is expressed by a simple equation which indicates how\nit can be reduced. The ensuing interventions are very similar to those proposed\nby Buddhist and Stoic philosophy, and include mindfulness meditation.\nTherefore, this book can be interpreted as an exposition of a computational\ntheory justifying why such philosophies and meditation reduce human suffering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 07:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

It concerns a\nnovel approach toward an alternate dimension theory foundation: the\npoint-dimension theory. For this purpose, historical research on this notion\nand related concepts, combined with critical analysis and philosophical\ndevelopment proved necessary. Hence, our main objective is to challenge the\nconventional zero dimension assigned to the point. This reconsideration allows\nus to propose two new ways of conceiving the notion of dimension, which are the\ntwo sides of the same coin. First as an organization; accordingly, we suggest\nthe existence of the Dimensionad, an elementary particle conferring dimension\nto objects and space-time. The idea of the existence of this particle could\npossibly adopted as a projection to create an alternative way to unify quantum\nmechanics and Einstein's general relativity. Secondly, in connection with\nBoltzmann and Shannon entropies, dimension appears essentially as a comparison\nbetween entropies of sets. Thus, we started from the point and succeeded in\nconstructing a point-dimension notion allowing us to extend the principle of\nbox dimension in many directions. More precisely, we introduce the notion of\npoint-extended box dimension in the large framework of topological vector\nspaces, freeing it from the notion of metric. This general setting permits us\nto treat the case of finite, infinite and invisible dimensions. This first part\nof our research project focuses essentially on general properties and is\nparticularly oriented towards establishing a well founded framework for\ninfinite dimension. Among others, one prospect is to test the possibility of\nusing other types of spaces as a setting for quantum mechanics, instead of\nlimiting it to the exclusive Hilbertian framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 09:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In CVD, the complex interplay of various\nfactors like growth temperature, precursors, and nature of the substrate\ndecides the crystallinity, crystallite size, and coverage area of the grown\nMoS$_2$ monolayer. In the present work, we report about the role of weight\nfraction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$), Sulfur, and carrier gas flow rate\ntowards nucleation and monolayer growth. The concentration of MoO$_3$ weight\nfraction has been found to govern the self-seeding process and decides the\ndensity of nucleation sites affecting morphology and coverage area. Carrier gas\nflow of 100 sccm argon results into large crystallite continuous films with\nlower coverage area (70 %), while the flow rate of 150 sccm results into 92 %\ncoverage area with reduced crystallite size. Through systematic variation of\nexperimental parameters, we have established the recipe for the growth of large\ncrystallite atomically thin MoS$_2$ suitable for optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 12:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}
