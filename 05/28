The diffuse interface method is a powerful technique\nthat has been used to describe a wide range of solid-phase interface-driven\nphenomena. The implicit treatment of the interface eliminates the need for\ncumbersome interface tracking, and advances in adaptive mesh refinement have\nprovided a way to sufficiently resolve diffuse interfaces without excessive\ncomputational cost. However, the general scale-invariant coupling of these\ntechniques to flow solvers has been relatively unexplored.

Recently, a line of research under the name of\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown that minimizing a sharpness\nmeasure, which reflects the geometry of the loss landscape, can significantly\nreduce the generalization error. However, SAM-like methods incur a two-fold\ncomputational overhead of the given base optimizer (e.g. SGD) for approximating\nthe sharpness measure. In this paper, we propose Sharpness-Aware Training for\nFree, or SAF, which mitigates the sharp landscape at almost zero additional\ncomputational cost over the base optimizer. Intuitively, SAF achieves this by\navoiding sudden drops in the loss in the sharp local minima throughout the\ntrajectory of the updates of the weights. Specifically, we suggest a novel\ntrajectory loss, based on the KL-divergence between the outputs of DNNs with\nthe current weights and past weights, as a replacement of the SAM's sharpness\nmeasure. This loss captures the rate of change of the training loss along the\nmodel's update trajectory. By minimizing it, SAF ensures the convergence to a\nflat minimum with improved generalization capabilities. Extensive empirical\nresults show that SAF minimizes the sharpness in the same way that SAM does,\nyielding better results on the ImageNet dataset with essentially the same\ncomputational cost as the base optimizer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 16:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 02:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 06:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Overall, we show that long-range, mechanical interactions provide an\noptimal and general strategy for multi-cellular self-organization, leading to\nmore robust and efficient realization of space-spanning networks than through\njust local inter-cellular interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 16:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Most existing\nworks rely on a single Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model, where the\nkernel function form is typically preselected using domain knowledge. To bypass\nsuch a design process, this paper leverages an ensemble (E) of GPs to\nadaptively select the surrogate model fit on-the-fly, yielding a GP mixture\nposterior with enhanced expressiveness for the sought function. Acquisition of\nthe next evaluation input using this EGP-based function posterior is then\nenabled by Thompson sampling (TS) that requires no additional design\nparameters. To endow function sampling with scalability, random feature-based\nkernel approximation is leveraged per GP model. The novel EGP-TS readily\naccommodates parallel operation. To further establish convergence of the\nproposed EGP-TS to the global optimum, analysis is conducted based on the\nnotion of Bayesian regret for both sequential and parallel settings.

However, there is still a lack of\nsystematic study into the ways in which the centrality of a node evolves when a\ngraph changes. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of metrics of equality and\nhierarchical mobility in networks that evolve in time. We propose an indicator\nof equality based on the classical Gini Coefficient from economics, and we\nquantify the hierarchical mobility of nodes, that is, how and to what extent\nthe centrality of a node and its neighbourhood change over time. These measures\nare applied to a corpus of thirty time evolving network data sets from\ndifferent domains.

While\ngreat strides have been taken to create highly efficient MPC algorithms for a\nrange of problems, recent progress has been limited by the 1-vs-2 Cycle\nConjecture [20], which postulates that the simple problem of distinguishing\nbetween one and two cycles requires $\\Omega(\\log n)$ MPC rounds.

We introduce ECORD; a novel RL\nalgorithm that alleviates this expense by restricting the GNN to a single\npre-processing step, before entering a fast-acting exploratory phase directed\nby a recurrent unit. Experimentally, ECORD achieves a new SOTA for RL\nalgorithms on the Maximum Cut problem, whilst also providing orders of\nmagnitude improvement in speed and scalability. Compared to the nearest\ncompetitor, ECORD reduces the optimality gap by up to 73% on 500 vertex graphs\nwith a decreased wall-clock time. Moreover, ECORD retains strong performance\nwhen generalising to larger graphs with up to 10000 vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 17:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

However, in\nmany challenging scenarios, opportunistic networking techniques are required to\nenable communication as devices suffer from intermittent connectivity,\ndisconnections and partitions. This poses novel challenges to service\ncomposition techniques. While several works have discussed middleware and\narchitectures for service composition in well-connected wired networks and in\nstable MANET environments, the underlying mechanism for selecting and\nforwarding service requests in the significantly challenging networking\nenvironment of opportunistic networks has not been entirely addressed. The\nproblem comprises three stages: i) selecting an appropriate service sequence\nset out of available services to obtain the required application level service;\nii) routing results of a previous stage in the composition to the next one\nthrough a multi-hop opportunistic path; and iii) routing final service outcomes\nback to the requester. The proposed algorithm derives efficiency and\neffectiveness by taking into account the estimated load at service providers\nand expected time to opportunistically route information between devices. Based\non this information the algorithm estimates the best composition to obtain a\nrequired service.

These new models are derived from a self-consistent way\nwith the changes in the internal chemical distribution that result from the\nmixing of all the core chemical components induced by mean molecular-weight\ninversions, from $^{22}$Ne diffusion, Coulomb sedimentation, and from residual\nnuclearburning. In addition, the expected nuclear-burning history and mixing\nevents along the progenitor evolution are accounted for, in particular the\noccurrence of third dredge-up, which determines the properties of the core and\nenvelope of post-AGB and white dwarf stars, as well as the WD initial-final\nmass relation. The range of H envelopes of our new ZZ star models extends from\nlog(M_H/M_*)= -4 to -5, to log(M_H/M_*)= -13.5. This allows, for the first\ntime, to consider seismological solutions for ZZ Ceti stars with extremely thin\nH envelopes. Our new H-burning post-AGB models predict chemical profiles of O\nand C near the stellar centre of ZZ Ceti stars substantially different from\nthose we used in our previous works. We find that the pulsation periods of $g$\nmodes and the mode-trapping properties of the new models differ significantly\nfrom those characterizing the ZZ Ceti models of our previous works,\nparticularly for long periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 17:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Viscous outflows disrupt the star within ~100s\nwith explosion energies close to that of hypernovae.

Federated anomaly detection faces two major\nchallenges. One is that isolated data in most industries are restricted share\nwith others for data privacy and security. The other is most of the centralized\napproaches training based on data integration. The main idea of federated\nanomaly detection is aligning private anomalies from local data owners on the\npublic anomalies from the attributed network in the server through public\nanomalies to federate local anomalies. In each private attributed network, the\ndetected anomaly subgraph is aligned with an anomaly subgraph in the public\nattributed network.

Work in MARL\noften focuses on solving tasks where agents interact with all other agents and\nentities in the environment; however, we observe that real-world tasks are\noften composed of several isolated instances of local agent interactions\n(subtasks), and each agent can meaningfully focus on one subtask to the\nexclusion of all else in the environment. In these composite tasks, successful\npolicies can often be decomposed into two levels of decision-making: agents are\nallocated to specific subtasks and each agent acts productively towards their\nassigned subtask alone. This decomposed decision making provides a strong\nstructural inductive bias, significantly reduces agent observation spaces, and\nencourages subtask-specific policies to be reused and composed during training,\nas opposed to treating each new composition of subtasks as unique.

The standard mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory is\nincapable of modeling many phenomena originated from ion correlation. An\nimportant example is charge inversion or overcharging of electrical double\nlayers in multivalent electrolyte solutions. Existing theories aiming to\ninclude correlations cannot capture the nonmonotonic dependence of charge\ninversion on salt concentration because they have not systematically accounted\nfor the inhomogeneous nature of correlations from surface to the bulk and the\nexcluded volume effect of ions and solvent molecules. In this work, we modify\nthe Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory by including the excluded volume\neffect to study ion condensation and charge inversion. A boundary layer\napproach is developed to accurately model the giant difference in ion\ncorrelations between the condensed layer near the surface and the diffuse layer\noutside. The theory is used to study charge inversion in multivalent\nelectrolytes and their mixtures.

Unlike our previous works with\npieces of evidence that these two compounds are in the unitary strong\nscattering regime and that superconductivity is suppressed by the atoms of\nstrontium in both materials, several phases are built. In the case of the\nstrontium-substituted lanthanum cuprate, it was found three phases from one\nfamily of Wigner probabilistic distributions, one corresponding to the\nantiferromagnetic compound La2CuO4 another one which consists of a coalescing\nmetallic phase for very lightly doped La2-xSrxCuO4, and finally a strong\nself-consistent dependent strange metal phase with optimal levels of doping. In\nthe case of a triplet superconductor strontium ruthenate, three phases can be\ndifferentiated from two families of Wigner distribution probabilities, one\nfamily of WDP with point nodes where Cooper pairs and dressed scattered normal\nquasiparticles are mixed for the whole range of frequencies and which\ncorrespond to an FS $\\gamma$ flat-sheet in the ground metallic state, and two\nphases from another WPD family, where, in one of then, the Miyake-Narikiyo\nquasinodal tiny gap model allows the unique presence of Cooper pairs in a tiny\ninterval of frequencies near the superconducting transition TC, the other phase\ncorresponds to the mixed-phase with Cooper pairs and dressed by stoichiometric\nstrontium non-magnetic atoms, where strong self-consistent effects are\nnoticeable. This approach allows comparing experimental results for samples in\nboth compounds with numerical analysis studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 21:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

The traditional planning\nparadigm prescribes using a hard threshold on the occupancy probability to\ndeclare that a cell is an obstacle, and to plan a single path accordingly while\ntreating unknown space as free. We compare this approach against a new\nuncertainty-aware planner, which plans two different path hypotheses and then\nmerges their initial trajectory segments into a single one ending in a\n\"next-best view\" pose. After this informative view is taken, the planner\ncommits to one of the hypotheses, or to a completely new one if a collision is\nimminent. Simulations were conducted comparing the proposed and traditional\nplanner. Results show the existence of planning scenarios -- like when the\nenvironment contains a dead-end, or when the goal is placed close to an\nobstacle -- in which reasoning about uncertainty can significantly decrease the\nrobot's traveled distance and increase the chances of reaching the goal.

In such an approach it is desirable to enforce a consistent\npressure distribution which is not typically the case when using the standard\nRiemann inflow boundary condition. We revisit the Riemann problem adopted in\nmany DG based high fidelity formulations. Through analysis of the 1D linearised\nEuler equations it is demonstrated that maintaining entropy compatibility with\nthe RANS simulation is important for a stable solution. The maintenance of\nRiemann invariant at outflow leaves one condition that can be imposed at the\ninflow. Therefore the entropy-pressure enforcement is the only stable boundary\ncondition to enforce a known pressure distribution. We further demonstrate that\nall the entropy compatible inflow Riemann boundary conditions are stable\nproviding the invariant compatible Riemann outflow boundary condition is also\nrespected. Although the entropy-pressure compatible Riemann inflow boundary\ncondition is stable from the 1D analysis, 2D tests highlight divergence in the\ninviscid problem and neutrally stable wiggles in the velocity fields in viscous\nsimulations around the stagnation point. A 2D analysis about a non-uniform\nbaseflow assumption provides insight into this stability issue (ill-posedness)\nand motivate the use of a mix of inflow boundary conditions in this region of\nthe flow. As a validation we apply the proposed boundary conditions to a\nreduced domain of a wing section normal to the leading-edge of the CRM-NLF\nmodel taken out of a full 3D RANS simulation at Mach 0.86 and a Reynolds number\nof 8.5 million.

The latter, more widely known as Bayesian\nmethods, enable uncertainty evaluation w.r.t. the performed predictions.\nFurthermore, they can better exploit related prior information and naturally\nintroduce robustness into the model, due to their unique capacity to\nmarginalize out uncertainties related to the parameter estimates. Moreover,\nhyper-parameters associated with the adopted priors can be learnt via the\ntraining data. To implement sparsity-aware learning, the crucial point lies in\nthe choice of the function regularizer for discriminative methods and the\nchoice of the prior distribution for Bayesian learning. Over the last decade or\nso, due to the intense research on deep learning, emphasis has been put on\ndiscriminative techniques. However, a come back of Bayesian methods is taking\nplace that sheds new light on the design of deep neural networks, which also\nestablish firm links with Bayesian models and inspire new paths for\nunsupervised learning, such as Bayesian tensor decomposition.\n  The goal of this article is two-fold.

The massive\namount of data transfer incurs significant energy, latency, and bandwidth\nbottlenecks, which hinders real-time processing. To mitigate this problem, we\npropose an algorithm-hardware co-design framework called\nProcessing-in-Pixel-in-Memory-based object Detection and Tracking\n(P2M-DeTrack).

The core notion of this proposed method is to bridge two separate\nblocks on top of an overall network.

In the standard buy-one\nmodel, it is known that optimal mechanisms can yield revenue infinitely higher\nthan that of any \"simple\" mechanism -- the ones with size polynomial in the\nnumber of items -- even with just two items and a single buyer (Briest et al.\n2015, Hart and Nisan 2017).\n  We introduce a new parameterized class of mechanisms, buy-$k$ mechanisms,\nwhich smoothly interpolate between the classical buy-one mechanisms and the\nrecently studied buy-many mechanisms (Chawla et al. 2019, Chawla et al. 2020,\nChawla et al. 2022). Buy-$k$ mechanisms allow the buyer to buy up to $k$ many\nmenu options. We show that restricting the seller to the class of buy-$n$\nincentive-compatible mechanisms suffices to overcome the bizarre, infinite\nrevenue properties of the buy-one model. Our main result is that the revenue\ngap with respect to bundling, an extremely simple mechanism, is bounded by\n$O(n^2)$ for any arbitrarily correlated distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ over $n$\nitems for the case of an additive buyer. Our techniques also allow us to prove\nsimilar upper bounds for arbitrary monotone valuations, albeit with an\nexponential factor in the approximation.\n  On the negative side, we show that allowing the buyer to purchase a small\nnumber of menu options does not suffice to guarantee sub-exponential\napproximations, even when we weaken the benchmark to the optimal buy-$k$\ndeterministic mechanism. If an additive buyer is only allowed to buy $k =\n\\Theta(n^{1/2-\\varepsilon})$ many menu options, the gap between the\nrevenue-optimal deterministic buy-$k$ mechanism and bundling may be exponential\nin $n$. In particular, this implies that no \"simple\" mechanism can obtain a\nsub-exponential approximation in this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 03:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 22:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-22"}

Existing state-of-the-art rotated object detection methods\nmainly rely on angle-based detectors. However, angle regression can easily\nsuffer from the long-standing boundary problem. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a purely angle-free framework for rotated object detection, called\nPoint RCNN, which mainly consists of PointRPN and PointReg. In particular,\nPointRPN generates accurate rotated RoIs (RRoIs) by converting the learned\nrepresentative points with a coarse-to-fine manner, which is motivated by\nRepPoints. Based on the learned RRoIs, PointReg performs corner points\nrefinement for more accurate detection. In addition, aerial images are often\nseverely unbalanced in categories, and existing methods almost ignore this\nissue. In this paper, we also experimentally verify that re-sampling the images\nof the rare categories will stabilize training and further improve the\ndetection performance.

To achieve this, MoE models replace the feedforward\nsub-layer with Mixture-of-Experts sub-layer in transformers and use a gating\nnetwork to route each token to its assigned experts. Since the common practice\nfor efficient training of such models requires distributing experts and tokens\nacross different machines, this routing strategy often incurs huge\ncross-machine communication cost because tokens and their assigned experts\nlikely reside in different machines. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Gating\nDropout}, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their\nlocal machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication. Similar to\ntraditional dropout, we also show that Gating Dropout has a regularization\neffect during training, resulting in improved generalization performance.

The canonical\nbranch-and-bound algorithm seeks to exactly solve MILPs by constructing a\nsearch tree of increasingly constrained sub-problems. In practice, its solving\ntime performance is dependent on heuristics, such as the choice of the next\nvariable to constrain ('branching'). Recently, machine learning (ML) has\nemerged as a promising paradigm for branching. However, prior works have\nstruggled to apply reinforcement learning (RL), citing sparse rewards,\ndifficult exploration, and partial observability as significant challenges.\nInstead, leading ML methodologies resort to approximating high quality\nhandcrafted heuristics with imitation learning (IL), which precludes the\ndiscovery of novel policies and requires expensive data labelling. In this\nwork, we propose retro branching; a simple yet effective approach to RL for\nbranching. By retrospectively deconstructing the search tree into multiple\npaths each contained within a sub-tree, we enable the agent to learn from\nshorter trajectories with more predictable next states. In experiments on four\ncombinatorial tasks, our approach enables learning-to-branch without any expert\nguidance or pre-training. We outperform the current state-of-the-art RL\nbranching algorithm by 3-5x and come within 20% of the best IL method's\nperformance on MILPs with 500 constraints and 1000 variables, with ablations\nverifying that our retrospectively constructed trajectories are essential to\nachieving these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 06:08:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 09:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 08:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Inspired by the recent query-based\nTransformers, we propose a simple pipeline named Multi-Query Transformer\n(MQTransformer) that is equipped with multiple queries from different tasks to\nfacilitate the reasoning among multiple tasks and simplify the cross-task\ninteraction pipeline. Instead of modeling the dense per-pixel context among\ndifferent tasks, we seek a task-specific proxy to perform cross-task reasoning\nvia multiple queries where each query encodes the task-related context. The\nMQTransformer is composed of three key components: shared encoder, cross-task\nquery attention module and shared decoder. We first model each task with a\ntask-relevant query. Then both the task-specific feature output by the feature\nextractor and the task-relevant query are fed into the shared encoder, thus\nencoding the task-relevant query from the task-specific feature. Secondly, we\ndesign a cross-task query attention module to reason the dependencies among\nmultiple task-relevant queries; this enables the module to only focus on the\nquery-level interaction. Finally, we use a shared decoder to gradually refine\nthe image features with the reasoned query features from different tasks.\nExtensive experiment results on two dense prediction datasets (NYUD-v2 and\nPASCAL-Context) show that the proposed method is an effective approach and\nachieves state-of-the-art results.

Perhaps the most common\nfamily of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional\ngroup representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by\nconsidering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness\nshould be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common\nsetting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the\ncenter of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its\ncorresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes,\npositive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of\nthese two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire\nproportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every\ncluster as is done in group fair clustering.

However, since a UGC uploader simultaneously creates the UGC and\nselects the corresponding tags, her personal preference inevitably biases the\ntag selections, which prevents these recommenders from learning the causal\ninfluence of UGCs' content features on tags. In this paper, we propose a deep\ndeconfounded content-based tag recommender system, namely, DecTag, to address\nthe above issues. We first establish a causal graph to represent the relations\namong uploader, UGC, and tag, where the uploaders are identified as confounders\nthat spuriously correlate UGC and tag selections. Specifically, to eliminate\nthe confounding bias, causal intervention is conducted on the UGC node in the\ngraph via backdoor adjustment, where uploaders' influence on tags leaked\nthrough backdoor paths can be eliminated for causal effect estimation.\nObserving that adjusting the causal graph with do-calculus requires integrating\nthe entire uploader space, which is infeasible, we design a novel Monte Carlo\n(MC)-based estimator with bootstrap, which can achieve asymptotic unbiasedness\nprovided that uploaders for the collected UGCs are i.i.d. samples from the\npopulation. In addition, the MC estimator has the intuition of substituting the\nbiased uploaders with a hypothetical random uploader from the population in the\ntraining phase, where deconfounding can be achieved in an interpretable manner.\nFinally, we establish a YT-8M-Causal dataset based on the widely used\nYouTube-8M dataset with causal intervention and propose an evaluation strategy\naccordingly to unbiasedly evaluate causal tag recommenders. Extensive\nexperiments show that DecTag is more robust to confounding bias than\nstate-of-the-art causal recommenders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 09:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 17:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Existing relevant research\nmost relied on survey data or focused on citizens due to the lack of\nlarge-scale, fine-grained tourism datasets. Several scholars have mentioned the\nnotion of trip chains, but few works have been done towards quantitatively\nidentifying the structures of trip chains. In this paper, we propose a model\nfor quantitatively characterizing tourist daily trip chains. After applying\nthis model to tourist mobile phone big data, underlying tourist travel patterns\nare discovered. Through the framework, we find that: (1) Most \"hybrid\"\n(inter-city and intra-city) and \"intra-city\" (only intra-city) patterns can be\ncaptured by only 13 key trip chains relatively; (2) For two continuous days,\nalmost all kinds of original chains have a rather high probability to transfer\nto either the first two transferred chains, or other infrequent chains in our\nstudy areas; (3) The principle of least efforts (PLE) affects tourists'\nstructures of trip chains. We can use average degree and average travel\ndistance to interpret tourist travel behavior (achieving tasks in PLE).

Such models proceed\nby specifying the behavior of individuals (agents) and their interactions, and\nparameterizing the process of infection based on such interactions based on the\ngeography and demography of the city. However, such models are computationally\nvery expensive, and the complexity is often linear in the total number of\nagents. This seriously limits the usage of such models for simulations, which\noften have to be run hundreds of times for policy planning and even model\nparameter estimation. An alternative is to develop an emulator, a surrogate\nmodel that can predict the Agent-Based Simulator's output based on its initial\nconditions and parameters. In this paper, we discuss a Deep Learning model\nbased on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network that can emulate such an agent\nbased model with high accuracy. We show that use of this model instead of the\noriginal Agent-Based Model provides us major gains in the speed of simulations,\nallowing much quicker calibration to observations, and more extensive scenario\nanalysis. The models we consider are spatially explicit, as the locations of\nthe infected individuals are simulated instead of the gross counts.

In this paper, we propose\nPoint-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical\nself-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in\nMAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to\nprogressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and\nhigh-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point\ntokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate\nconsistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial\nself-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns.\nBy multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples\npoint tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which\nfurther promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of\nPoint-M2AE for 3D representation learning.

However, their performance can degenerate\nterribly on non-stationary real-world data in which the joint distribution\nchanges over time. Previous studies primarily adopt stationarization to\nattenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability.\nBut the stationarized series deprived of inherent non-stationarity can be less\ninstructive for real-world bursty events forecasting. This problem, termed\nover-stationarization in this paper, leads Transformers to generate\nindistinguishable temporal attentions for different series and impedes the\npredictive capability of deep models. To tackle the dilemma between series\npredictability and model capability, we propose Non-stationary Transformers as\na generic framework with two interdependent modules: Series Stationarization\nand De-stationary Attention. Concretely, Series Stationarization unifies the\nstatistics of each input and converts the output with restored statistics for\nbetter predictability.

Shocks produced by supernova explosions, jets, radiation from\nmassive stars, or galactic spiral-arm dynamics are amongst the most common\ndrivers of turbulence in the ISM. However, it is not fully understood how\nshocks drive turbulence, in particular whether shock driving is a more\nsolenoidal(rotational, divergence-free) or a more compressive (potential,\ncurl-free) mode of driving turbulence. The mode of turbulence driving has\nprofound consequences for star formation, with compressive driving producing\nthree times larger density dispersion, and an order of magnitude higher star\nformation rate than solenoidal driving. Here, we use hydrodynamical simulations\nof a shock inducing turbulent motions in a structured, multi-phase medium. This\nis done in the context of a laser-induced shock, propagating into a foam\nmaterial, in preparation for an experiment to be performed at the National\nIgnition Facility (NIF). Specifically, we analyse the density and velocity\ndistributions in the shocked turbulent medium, and measure the turbulence\ndriving parameter $b=(\\sigma^{2 \\Gamma}_{\\rho /\\langle \\rho \\rangle}-1)^{1/2}\n(1-\\sigma_{\\rho \\langle \\rho\n\\rangle}^{-2})^{-1/2}\\mathcal{M}^{-1}\\Gamma^{-1/2}$ with the density dispersion\n$\\sigma_{\\rho / \\langle \\rho \\rangle}$, the turbulent Mach number\n$\\mathcal{M}$, and the polytropic exponent $\\Gamma$.

Using simulations in which a shock is driven into a multi-phase\nmedium with structures of different sizes and $\\Gamma < 1$, we find $b \\sim 1$\nfor all cases, showing that shock-driven turbulence is consistent with strongly\ncompressive driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 12:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The posterior samples represent various realizations of\nHypoPINN's weights. Finally, we predict the locations of the hypocenter\nassociated with those weights' realizations to investigate the uncertainty\npropagation that comes from those realisations.

A latent generalized matrix regression (LaGMaR) is formulated,\nwhere the latent predictor is a low-dimensional matrix factor score extracted\nfrom the low-rank signal of the matrix variate through a cutting-edge matrix\nfactor model. Unlike the general spirit of penalizing vectorization plus the\nnecessity of tuning parameters in the literature, instead, our prediction\nmodeling in LaGMaR conducts dimension reduction that respects the geometry\ncharacteristic of intrinsic two-dimensional structure of the matrix covariate\nand thus avoids iteration. This greatly relieves the computation burden, and\nmeanwhile maintains structural information so that the latent matrix factor\nfeature can perfectly replace the intractable matrix-variate owing to\nhigh-dimensionality. The estimation procedure of LaGMaR is subtly derived by\ntransforming the bilinear form matrix factor model onto a high-dimensional\nvector factor model, so that the method of principle components can be applied.\nWe establish bilinear-form consistency of the estimated matrix coefficient of\nthe latent predictor and consistency of prediction.

Specifically, we first present the Reproducing Transformation\nto convert the backward process in TCNNs to an equivalent convolution process.\nThen, based on the convolution operators in the forward and backward processes,\nwe build a unified paradigm to control the variance of features and gradients\nin TCNNs. Thus, we can derive fan-in and fan-out initialization for various\nTCNNs. We demonstrate that our paradigm can stabilize the training of TCNNs,\nleading to faster convergence and better results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 13:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

While there are examples in the literature of integration of\nthese solutions as Green's functions for the transport operator to produce\nresults for more easily simulated sources, they are limited in scope and\nbriefly explained. For a sampling of initial conditions and sources, we present\nsolutions for the uncollided and collided scalar flux to facilitate accurate\ntesting of source treatment in numerical solvers. The solution for the\nuncollided scalar flux is found in analytic form for some sources. Since\nintegrating the Green's functions is often nontrivial, discussion of\nintegration difficulty and workarounds to find convergent integrals is\nincluded.

Hand gesture\nrecognition systems provide a natural way of communication and, thus, are an\nintegral part of seamless Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Recent years have\nwitnessed an immense evolution of computational models powered by deep\nlearning. However, state-of-the-art models fall short in expanding across\ndifferent gesture domains, such as emblems and co-speech. In this paper, we\npropose a novel hybrid hand gesture recognition system. Our architecture\nenables learning both static and dynamic gestures: by capturing a so-called\n\"snapshot\" of the gesture performance at its peak, we integrate the hand pose\nalong with the dynamic movement. Moreover, we present a method for analyzing\nthe motion profile of a gesture to uncover its dynamic characteristics and\nwhich allows regulating a static channel based on the amount of motion. Our\nevaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach on two gesture\nbenchmarks compared to a CNNLSTM baseline. We also provide an analysis on a\ngesture class basis that unveils the potential of our Snapture architecture for\nperformance improvements. Thanks to its modular implementation, our framework\nallows the integration of other multimodal data like facial expressions and\nhead tracking, which are important cues in HRI scenarios, into one\narchitecture. Thus, our work contributes both to gesture recognition research\nand machine learning applications for non-verbal communication with robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 11:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Compared to other\nimage retrieval tasks, facial image retrieval is more challenging due to the\nhigh subjectivity involved in describing a person's facial features. Existing\nmethods do so by comparing specific characteristics from the user's mental\nimage against the suggested images via high-level supervision such as using\nnatural language. In contrast, we propose a method that uses a relatively\nsimpler form of binary supervision by utilizing the user's feedback to label\nimages as either similar or dissimilar to the target image. Such supervision\nenables us to exploit the contrastive learning paradigm for encapsulating each\nuser's personalized notion of similarity. For this, we propose a novel loss\nfunction optimized online via user feedback. We validate the efficacy of our\nproposed approach using a carefully designed testbed to simulate user feedback\nand a large-scale user study.
