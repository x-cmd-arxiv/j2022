However, such an approach lacks\naccurate error control and often trades accuracy off against computational\nefficiency in an empirical fashion, lacking theoretical guarantees. In this\npaper, we propose the concept of certified error control of candidate set\npruning for relevance ranking, which means that the test error after pruning is\nguaranteed to be controlled under a user-specified threshold with high\nprobability. Both in-domain and out-of-domain experiments show that our method\nsuccessfully prunes the first-stage retrieved candidate sets to improve the\nsecond-stage reranking speed while satisfying the pre-specified accuracy\nconstraints in both settings. For example, on MS MARCO Passage v1, our method\nyields an average candidate set size of 27 out of 1,000 which increases the\nreranking speed by about 37 times, while the MRR@10 is greater than a\npre-specified value of 0.38 with about 90% empirical coverage and the empirical\nbaselines fail to provide such guarantee.

Many programming languages offer a\nvariety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data\nstructures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics.\n  Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always\nstraightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in\ndifferent scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to\ntheoretical complexity.\n  Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the\nbest performing valid container implementation from a set of container data\ntypes that satisfy *properties* given by application developers. Primrose\nautomatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the\n*library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries,\nsatisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library\nimplementations based on their runtime performance.\n  Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected\nbehaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g.,\nif the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should\nsatisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement\n*syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together\nallowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and*\nbehaviour without committing to a concrete implementation.\n  Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that\npreprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and\nranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however,\nlanguage-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages\nthat support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our\nimplementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification\nconditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set\nof valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several\ncontainer implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid\nimplementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We\nautomatically validate that container implementations conform to their library\nspecifications via property-based testing.\n  Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling\nand specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow.\nInstead of selecting concrete container implementations, application\nprogrammers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the\nbehaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation\ncan be selected automatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 16:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The soft spectrum of GeV emission may arise from a\nlimited maximum synchrotron energy of only a few hundreds of MeV at\n$\\sim$20,000 s. The usually long duration of the GeV emission could be due to\nthe proximity of this GRB and the long deceleration time of the GRB jet that is\nexpanding in a low-density circumburst medium, consistent with the compact\nstellar merger scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 16:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 06:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 12:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Supporting both computational tractability and better modeling\nflexibility than classical fluid limits, we use a two-level stochastic model\nthat allows correlated shocks caused by weather or large public events.\n  Using this model, we propose a novel pricing mechanism: stochastic\nspatiotemporal pricing (SSP). We show that the SSP mechanism is asymptotically\nincentive-compatible and that all (approximate) equilibria of the resulting\ngame are asymptotically welfare-maximizing when the market is large enough. The\nSSP mechanism iteratively recomputes prices based on realized demand and\nsupply, and in this sense prices dynamically. We show that this is critical:\nwhile a static variant of the SSP mechanism (whose prices vary with the\nmarket-level stochastic scenario but not individual rider and driver decisions)\nhas a sequence of asymptotically welfare-optimal approximate equilibria, we\ndemonstrate that it also has other equilibria producing extremely low social\nwelfare.

The canonical\nreliability diagrams histogram the observed and expected values of the\npredictions; replacing the hard histogram binning with soft kernel density\nestimation is another common practice.

Plots of the cumulative differences between the observed and expected\nvalues largely avoid this question, by displaying miscalibration directly as\nthe slopes of secant lines for the graphs.

The RRC consisted of using a TriFinger\nrobot to manipulate a cube along a specified positional trajectory, but with no\nrequirement for the cube to have any specific orientation. We used a relatively\nsimple reward function, a combination of goal-based sparse reward and distance\nreward, in conjunction with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to guide the\nlearning of the DRL agent (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)). Our\napproach allowed our agents to acquire dexterous robotic manipulation\nstrategies in simulation.

The requirement to also\norient the cube makes the agent unable to learn the task through blind\nexploration due to increased problem complexity.

Recent advancements in diarization technology leverage neural\nnetwork-based approaches to improvise multiple subsystems of speaker\ndiarization system comprising of extracting segment-wise embedding features and\ndetecting changes in the speaker during conversation. However, to identify\nspeaker through clustering, models depend on methodologies like PLDA to\ngenerate similarity measure between two extracted segments from a given\nconversational audio.

All of the planets were identified as\nplanet candidates based on periodic flux dips observed by NASA's Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The signals were confirmed to be from\ntransiting planets using ground-based time-series photometry, high angular\nresolution imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy coordinated with the TESS\nFollow-up Observing Program. The ten newly discovered planets orbit relatively\nbright F and G stars ($G < 12.5$,~$T_\\mathrm{eff}$ between 4800 and 6200 K).\nThe planets' orbital periods range from 2 to 10~days, and their masses range\nfrom 0.2 to 2.2 Jupiter masses. TOI-2421 b is notable for being a Saturn-mass\nplanet and TOI-2567 b for being a ``sub-Saturn'', with masses of $0.322\\pm\n0.073$ and $0.195\\pm 0.030$ Jupiter masses, respectively. In most cases, we\nhave little information about the orbital eccentricities. Two exceptions are\nTOI-2207 b, which has an 8-day period and a detectably eccentric orbit ($e =\n0.17\\pm0.05$), and TOI-3693 b, a 9-day planet for which we can set an upper\nlimit of $e < 0.052$. The ten planets described here are the first new planets\nresulting from an effort to use TESS data to unify and expand on the work of\nprevious ground-based transit surveys in order to create a large and\nstatistically useful sample of hot Jupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 17:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

To overcome this limitation, we present a two-stream\napproach, where high-frequency features interact locally and low-frequency\nfeatures interact globally. The global interaction stream remains robust in\ndifficult situations such as large camera motions, where explicit alignment\nfails. The local interaction stream propagates high-frequency details through\ndeformable feature aggregation and, informed by the global interaction stream,\nlearns to detect and correct errors of the deformation field.

The resulting representations are stored in a dual\nmemory system and enriched with goal-directed and temporal information acquired\nthrough reinforcement learning, creating a higher-level of abstraction. Two\nadditional components work in parallel to detect and recover relevant concepts\nand create new ones, respectively, in a process akin to cognitive Reflective\nReasoning and Blending. The Reflective Reasoning unit detects and recovers from\nmemory concepts relevant to the task by means of a matching process that\ncalculates a similarity value between the current state and memory graph\nstructures.

After the ego-motion alignment, the spatio-temporal encoder is utilized\nfor further feature extraction in BEV. Finally, multiple task decoders are\nattached for joint reasoning and prediction. Within the decoders, we propose\nthe grid sampler to generate BEV features with different ranges and\ngranularities for different tasks. Also, we design the method of iterative flow\nfor memory-efficient future prediction. We show that the temporal information\nimproves 3D object detection and semantic map construction, while the\nmulti-task learning can implicitly benefit motion prediction. With extensive\nexperiments on the nuScenes dataset, we show that the multi-task BEVerse\noutperforms existing single-task methods on 3D object detection, semantic map\nconstruction, and motion prediction. Compared with the sequential paradigm,\nBEVerse also favors in significantly improved efficiency.

We\npresent a new mechanism that describes how collections of particles or 'clouds'\ngain a prograde rotational component when they collapse or contract while\nsubject to an external, central force. The effect is geometric in origin, as\nrelative shear on curved orbits moves their shared center-of-mass slightly\ninward and toward the external potential during a collapse, exchanging orbital\nangular momentum into aligned (prograde) rotation. We perform illustrative\nanalytical and N-body calculations to show that this process of prograde\nspin-up proceeds quadratically in time ($\\delta L_\\mathrm{rot} \\propto t^2$)\nuntil the collapse nears completion.

To study this effect, we carry out high resolution dwarf\ngalaxy simulations that include velocity kicks to massive O/B stars above 8\nM$_{\\odot}$. We consider two scenarios, one that adopts a power law velocity\ndistribution for kick velocities, resulting in more stars with high velocity\nkicks, and a more moderate scenario with a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We\nexplicitly resolve the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and include\nnon-equilibrium cooling and chemistry channels.

DMD is regularly used to understand\nthe fundamental characteristics of turbulence and is closely related to Koopman\noperators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently the computed\nspectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the\ninfinite-dimensional nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious\n(unphysical) modes, and dealing with continuous spectra, both of which occur\nregularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD),\nintroduced by (Colbrook & Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges\nthrough the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full\ninfinite-dimensional Koopman operator. ResDMD computes spectra and\npseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control, and computes\nsmoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra)\nwith explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and\nverified Koopmanism. We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a\nvariety of fluid dynamic situations, at varying Reynolds numbers, arising from\nboth numerical and experimental data. Examples include: vortex shedding behind\na cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle\nimage velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure\nsignals of laser-induced plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely,\nthe ability to verifiably resolve non-linear, transient modes, and spectral\ncalculation with reduced broadening effects.

Specifically, an\ninstantiation method based on \\textsc{DynAnom} achieves the accuracy of 0.5425\ncompared with 0.2790, the best baseline, on the task of node-level anomaly\nlocalization while running 2.3 times faster than the baseline. We present a\nreal-world case study and further demonstrate the usability of \\textsc{DynAnom}\nfor anomaly discovery over large-scale graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 18:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 15:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 17:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}

One way\nrobots can provide this assistance is shared autonomy. Within shared autonomy,\nboth the human and robot maintain control over the robot's motion: as the robot\nbecomes confident it understands what the human wants, it intervenes to\nautomate the task. But how does the robot know these tasks in the first place?\nState-of-the-art approaches to shared autonomy often rely on prior knowledge.\nFor instance, the robot may need to know the human's potential goals\nbeforehand. During long-term interaction these methods will inevitable break\ndown -- sooner or later the human will attempt to perform a task that the robot\ndoes not expect. Accordingly, in this paper we formulate an alternate approach\nto shared autonomy that learns assistance from scratch. Our insight is that\noperators repeat important tasks on a daily basis (e.g., opening the fridge,\nmaking coffee). Instead of relying on prior knowledge, we therefore take\nadvantage of these repeated interactions to learn assistive policies. We\nintroduce SARI, an algorithm that recognizes the human's task, replicates\nsimilar demonstrations, and returns control when unsure. We then combine\nlearning with control to demonstrate that the error of our approach is\nuniformly ultimately bounded. We perform simulations to support this error\nbound, compare our approach to imitation learning baselines, and explore its\ncapacity to assist for an increasing number of tasks. Finally, we conduct three\nuser studies with industry-standard methods and shared autonomy baselines,\nincluding a pilot test with a disabled user. Our results indicate that learning\nshared autonomy across repeated interactions matches existing approaches for\nknown tasks and outperforms baselines on new tasks.

However, existing studies\nfind that MTL could sometimes hurt generalization, especially when two tasks\nare less correlated. One possible reason that hurts generalization is spurious\ncorrelation, i.e., some knowledge is spurious and not causally related to task\nlabels, but the model could mistakenly utilize them and thus fail when such\ncorrelation changes. In MTL setup, there exist several unique challenges of\nspurious correlation. First, the risk of having non-causal knowledge is higher,\nas the shared MTL model needs to encode all knowledge from different tasks, and\ncausal knowledge for one task could be potentially spurious to the other.\nSecond, the confounder between task labels brings in a different type of\nspurious correlation to MTL. We theoretically prove that MTL is more prone to\ntaking non-causal knowledge from other tasks than single-task learning, and\nthus generalize worse. To solve this problem, we propose Multi-Task Causal\nRepresentation Learning framework, aiming to represent multi-task knowledge via\ndisentangled neural modules, and learn which module is causally related to each\ntask via MTL-specific invariant regularization.

We aim to constrain the physical conditions at the\ndifferent molecular emission peaks. This study allows us to compare the\nabundance profiles predicted from chemical models together with the classical\ndensity structure of Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere. We conducted multi-transition\npointed observations of CH$_{3}$OH, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and HNCO with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope, towards the dust peak and the respective molecular peaks of L1544.\nWith non-LTE radiative transfer calculations and a 1-dimensional model, we\nrevisit the physical structure of L1544, and benchmark with the abundance\nprofiles from current chemical models. We find that the HNCO, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$\nand CH$_{3}$OH lines in L1544 are tracing progressively higher density gas,\nfrom $\\sim$10$^{4}$ to several times 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Particularly, we find\nthat to produce the observed intensities and ratios of the CH$_{3}$OH lines, a\nlocal gas density enhancement upon the BE sphere is required. This suggests\nthat the physical structure of an early-stage core may not necessarily follow a\nsmooth decrease of gas density profile locally, but can be intercepted by\nclumpy substructures surrounding the gravitational center. Multiple transitions\nof molecular lines from different molecular species can provide a tomographic\nview of the density structure of pre-stellar cores. The local gas density\nenhancement deviating from the BE sphere may reflect the impact of accretion\nflows that appear asymmetric and are enhanced at the meeting point of\nlarge-scale cloud structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 19:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The optimization of calibration is essential to many\nonline advertising recommendation systems because it directly affects the\ndownstream bids in ads auctions and the amount of money charged to advertisers.\nDespite its importance, calibration optimization often suffers from a problem\ncalled \"maximization bias\". Maximization bias refers to the phenomenon that the\nmaximum of predicted values overestimates the true maximum. The problem is\nintroduced because the calibration is computed on the set selected by the\nprediction model itself. It persists even if unbiased predictions can be\nachieved on every datapoint and worsens when covariate shifts exist between the\ntraining and test sets. To mitigate this problem, we theorize the\nquantification of maximization bias and propose a variance-adjusting debiasing\n(VAD) meta-algorithm in this paper.

However, the fabrication of slow artificial oscillators at micrometre\nscales remains a major roadblock towards the development of fully-autonomous\nmicrorobots.

The maximum yield strength of the Al-Mg-Y system is measured to be\n950 MPa, exceeding that of the Al-Fe-Y system (680 MPa), primarily due to a\ncombination of more carbide nanorods and more amorphous complexions. Both\nalloys exhibited yield strengths much higher than those of commercial Al\nalloys, and therefore have great potential for structural applications.\nHowever, some micropillar specimens were observed to plastically soften through\nshear banding.

Travel\ntimes are subject to stochastic uncertainty resulting from various parameters\nsuch as weather condition, occurrences of road works, or traffic accidents.\nLarge mobility services have an informational advantage over single network\nusers as they are able to learn traffic conditions from data. A benevolent\nmobility service may use this informational advantage in order to steer the\ntraffic equilibrium into a favorable direction. The resulting optimization\nproblem is a task commonly referred to as signaling or Bayesian persuasion.\nPrevious work has shown that the underlying signaling problem can be NP-hard to\napproximate within any non-trivial bounds, even for affine cost functions with\nstochastic offsets. In contrast, we show that in this case, the signaling\nproblem is easy for many networks. We tightly characterize the class of\nsingle-commodity networks, in which full information revelation is always an\noptimal signaling strategy. Moreover, we construct a reduction from optimal\nsignaling to computing an optimal collection of support vectors for the Wardrop\nequilibrium. For two states, this insight can be used to compute an optimal\nsignaling scheme. The algorithm runs in polynomial time whenever the number of\ndifferent supports resulting from any signal distribution is bounded to a\npolynomial in the input size. Using a cell decomposition technique, we extend\nthe approach to a polynomial-time algorithm for multi-commodity parallel link\nnetworks with a constant number of commodities, even when we have a constant\nnumber of different states of nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 19:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

Reliable decoding even from small\nneural populations is possible because high dimensional neural population\nactivity typically occupies low dimensional manifolds that are discoverable\nwith suitable latent variable models. Over time however, drifts in activity of\nindividual neurons and instabilities in neural recording devices can be\nsubstantial, making stable decoding over days and weeks impractical. While this\ndrift cannot be predicted on an individual neuron level, population level\nvariations over consecutive recording sessions such as differing sets of\nneurons and varying permutations of consistent neurons in recorded data may be\nlearnable when the underlying manifold is stable over time. Classification of\nconsistent versus unfamiliar neurons across sessions and accounting for\ndeviations in the order of consistent recording neurons in recording datasets\nover sessions of recordings may then maintain decoding performance.

The quality of video frames from\ncurrent state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models tends to be poor and\ngeneralization beyond the training data is difficult. Furthermore, existing\nprediction frameworks are typically not capable of simultaneously handling\nother video-related tasks such as unconditional generation or interpolation. In\nthis work, we devise a general-purpose framework called Masked Conditional\nVideo Diffusion (MCVD) for all of these video synthesis tasks using a\nprobabilistic conditional score-based denoising diffusion model, conditioned on\npast and/or future frames. We train the model in a manner where we randomly and\nindependently mask all the past frames or all the future frames. This novel but\nstraightforward setup allows us to train a single model that is capable of\nexecuting a broad range of video tasks, specifically: future/past prediction --\nwhen only future/past frames are masked; unconditional generation -- when both\npast and future frames are masked; and interpolation -- when neither past nor\nfuture frames are masked. Our experiments show that this approach can generate\nhigh-quality frames for diverse types of videos.

We map photospheres with\ntemperatures and radial velocities (RV) and integrate specific intensity\nstellar models. We obtain transit spectra affected by stellar contamination,\nthe Rossiter--McLaughlin effect (RME), and center-to-limb variations (CLV). We\nfind that, at low resolution, for later-type stars, planetary water features\nbecome difficult to distinguish from contamination. Many distributions of\nunocculted active regions can induce planetary-like features of similar\namplitudes in the case of a late M dwarf. Atmospheric characterization of\nplanets around late-type stars will likely continue to suffer from degeneracy\nwith stellar activity unless active regions' parameters can be constrained\nusing additional information. For the early-K star, stellar contamination\nmostly manifests itself through a slope at optical wavelengths similar to\nRayleigh scattering. In all cases, contamination induces offsets in measured\nplanet radii. At high resolution, we show that we can determine the origin of\n$\\text{H}_2$O and CO detection signals and lift the degeneracy observed at low\nresolution, provided sufficient planet RV variation during transit and adequate\ncorrection for the RME and CLV when required. High-resolution spectroscopy may\ntherefore help resolve issues arising from stellar contamination for favorable\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 21:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

Interactions\nare often timestamped, which leads to having timestamped edges. Many real-world\ntemporal networks have a recurrent or possibly cyclic behaviour. For example,\nsocial network activity may be heightened during certain hours of day. In this\npaper, our main interest is to model recurrent activity in such temporal\nnetworks. As a starting point we use stochastic block model, a popular choice\nfor modelling static networks, where nodes are split into $R$ groups. We extend\nthis model to temporal networks by modelling the edges with a Poisson process.\nWe make the parameters of the process dependent on time by segmenting the time\nline into $K$ segments. To enforce the recurring activity we require that only\n$H < K$ different set of parameters can be used, that is, several, not\nnecessarily consecutive, segments must share their parameters. We prove that\nthe searching for optimal blocks and segmentation is an NP-hard problem.\nConsequently, we split the problem into 3 subproblems where we optimize blocks,\nmodel parameters, and segmentation in turn while keeping the remaining\nstructures fixed. We propose an iterative algorithm that requires $O(KHm + Rn +\nR^2H)$ time per iteration, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes and edges\nin the network. We demonstrate experimentally that the number of required\niterations is typically low, the algorithm is able to discover the ground truth\nfrom synthetic datasets, and show that certain real-world networks exhibit\nrecurrent behaviour as the likelihood does not deteriorate when $H$ is lowered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 21:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

An essential\naspect of service selection is determining whether the Quality of Service (QoS)\nprofile of a service satisfies the QoS requirements of a client.\n  In realistic execution environments, such QoS values might be influenced by\nexternal, non-controllable events, making it impossible for the service\nprovider to guarantee that the values characterised by a QoS profile will be\nmet, naturally leading to the need of a probabilistic interpretation of QoS\nprofile.\n  In this work we propose: 1) a model for describing probabilistic QoS profiles\nbased on multivariate continuous probability distributions, 2) a language for\ndescribing probabilistic QoS requirements, and 3) an automatic procedure for\nassessing whether a probabilistic QoS profile satisfies a probabilistic QoS\nrequirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 21:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

Statistically, performance variability can be\ncharacterized by a distribution. Predicting performance variability is a\ncritical step in HPC performance variability management and is nontrivial\nbecause one needs to predict a distribution function based on system factors.\nIn this paper, we propose a new framework to predict performance distributions.\nThe proposed model is a modified Gaussian process that can predict the\ndistribution function of the input/output (I/O) throughput under a specific HPC\nsystem configuration. We also impose a monotonic constraint so that the\npredicted function is nondecreasing, which is a property of the cumulative\ndistribution function. Additionally, the proposed model can incorporate both\nquantitative and qualitative input variables. We evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed method by using the IOzone variability data based on various\nprediction tasks. Results show that the proposed method can generate accurate\npredictions, and outperform existing methods. We also show how the predicted\nfunctional output can be used to generate predictions for a scalar summary of\nthe performance distribution, such as the mean, standard deviation, and\nquantiles.

Since Buchberger's algorithm for computing Gr\\\"obner\nbases in the 60s, there has been a lot of progress in this domain. Moreover,\nthese equations have been employed to model and solve problems from diverse\ndisciplines such as biology, cryptography, and robotics. Currently, we have a\ngood understanding of how to solve generic systems from a theoretical and\nalgorithmic point of view. However, polynomial equations encountered in\npractice are usually structured, and so many properties and results about\ngeneric systems do not apply to them. For this reason, a common trend in the\nlast decades has been to develop mathematical and algorithmic frameworks to\nexploit specific structures of systems of polynomials.\n  Arguably, the most common structure is sparsity; that is, the polynomials of\nthe systems only involve a few monomials. Since Bernstein, Khovanskii, and\nKushnirenko's work on the expected number of solutions of sparse systems, toric\ngeometry has been the default mathematical framework to employ sparsity.

Considering that NOMA technology has\ndeeper requirements for the modulation classification of mixed signals under\ndifferent power, this paper mainly introduces and uses a variety of deep\nlearning networks to classify such mixed signals. First, the modulation\nclassification of a single signal based on the existing CNN model is\nreproduced.

In this work, we simulate\nhydrodynamical ejecta interactions with a main-sequence (MS) donor star in two\ndimensions for two near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models of SNe Ia, the W7\nand N100 models. We find that about 0.30 and 0.37 Msun of hydrogen-rich\nmaterial are stripped from a 2.5 Msun donor star in a 2 day orbit by the SN Ia\nexplosion in simulations with the W7 deflagration and N100 delayed-detonation\nexplosion model, respectively.

The modal velocity, about 500 km/s, of\nstripped hydrogen-rich material in the N100 model is faster than the W7 model,\nwith modal velocity of about 350km/s, by a factor 1.4.

Existing studies show the\nevolutionary behaviors of social communities can effectively be described using\npatterns including split, shrink, merge, expand, emerge, and extinct. However,\nexisting pattern-based approaches are limited in supporting quantitative\nanalysis, and are potentially problematic for using the patterns in a mutually\nexclusive manner when describing community evolution. In this work, we propose\nthat different patterns can occur simultaneously between every pair of\ncommunities during the evolution, just in different degrees. Four entropy-based\nindices are devised to measure the degree of community split, shrink, merge,\nand expand, respectively, which can provide a comprehensive and quantitative\nmeasure of community evolution in DSNs. The indices have properties desirable\nto quantify community evolution including monotonicity, and bounded maximum and\nminimum values that correspond to meaningful cases.

The results\nalso show that the indices are useful in predicting OSS team productivity with\nan accuracy of 0.718.

In this\npaper we compare rates of full tidal disruption events (FTDE) with partial\ntidal disruption events (PTDE).

After switching on\nthese two effects in our simulation, the number of FTDEs is reduced by roughly\n28%, and the reduction is mostly due to the ejection of the leftover stars from\nPTDEs coming originally from relatively large distance. The number of PTDEs is\nabout 75% higher than the simple estimation given by Stone et al.

When an ideal photonic\nstructure with a BIC is perturbed, the BIC may be destroyed (becomes a resonant\nstate) or may continue to exist with a slightly different frequency and a\nslightly different wavevector (if appropriate). Some BICs are robust against\ncertain structural perturbations, but most BICs are nonrobust. Recent studies\nsuggest that a nonnegative integer $n$ can be defined for any generic\nnondegenerate BIC with respect to a properly defined set of structural\nperturbations.

Observational evidence is recalled and theoretical\narguments are given for the presence of cyclic activity in the case of\nsufficiently slow rotation only. Slow rotation means proximity to the observed\nupper bound on the rotation period of solar-type stars. This maximum rotation\nperiod depends on temperature and shortens for hotter stars. The maximum\nrotation period is interpreted as the minimum rotation rate for operation of a\nlarge-scale dynamo. A combined model for differential rotation and the dynamo\nis applied to stars of different mass rotating with a rate slightly above the\nthreshold rate for the dynamo. Computations show shorter dynamo cycles for\nhotter stars. As the hotter stars rotate faster, the computed cycles are also\nshorter for faster rotation. The observed smaller upper bound for rotation\nperiod of hotter stars can be explained by the larger threshold amplitude of\nthe $\\alpha$-effect for onset of their dynamos: a larger $\\alpha$ demands\nfaster rotation. The amplitude of the (cycling) magnetic energy in the\ncomputations is proportional to the difference between the rotation period and\nits upper bound for the dynamo.

Existing works have designed various effective modules to\nprecisely localize action instances based on appearance and motion features.\nHowever, by treating these two kinds of features with equal importance,\nprevious works cannot take full advantage of each modality feature, making the\nlearned model still sub-optimal. To tackle this issue, we make an early effort\nto study temporal action localization from the perspective of multi-modality\nfeature learning, based on the observation that different actions exhibit\nspecific preferences to appearance or motion modality. Specifically, we build a\nnovel structured attention composition module. Unlike conventional attention,\nthe proposed module would not infer frame attention and modality attention\nindependently. Instead, by casting the relationship between the modality\nattention and the frame attention as an attention assignment process, the\nstructured attention composition module learns to encode the frame-modality\nstructure and uses it to regularize the inferred frame attention and modality\nattention, respectively, upon the optimal transport theory. The final\nframe-modality attention is obtained by the composition of the two individual\nattentions. The proposed structured attention composition module can be\ndeployed as a plug-and-play module into existing action localization\nframeworks. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that the\nproposed structured attention composition consistently improves four\nstate-of-the-art temporal action localization methods and builds new\nstate-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14.

To validate that these pipelines do not erroneously remove\nor add features that can mimic the cosmic signal (e.g. from side-lobes or\nlarge-scale power leakage), we require reionisation simulations larger than the\nexperiments primary field of view. For an experiment such as the MWA, with a\nfield of view of $\\sim25^{2}$ deg.$^{2}$, this would require a simulation of\nseveral Gpcs, which is currently infeasible. To overcome this, we developed a\nsimplified version of the semi-numerical reionisation simulation code 21CMFAST\npreferencing large volumes over some physical accuracy by assuming linear\ntheory for structure formation. With this, we constructed a 7.5 Gpc comoving\nvolume with voxel resolution of $\\sim1.17$ cMpc tailored specifically to the\nbinned spectral resolution of the MWA. This simulation was used for validating\nthe pipelines for the 2020 MWA 21-cm power spectrum (PS) upper limits (Trott et\nal.). We then use this large-volume simulation to explore: (i) whether smaller\nvolume simulations are biased by the missing large-scale modes, (ii)\nnon-Gaussianity in estimates of the cosmic variance, (iii) biases in the\nrecovered 21-cm PS following foreground wedge removal and (iv) the impact of\ntiling smaller volume simulations to achieve extremely large volumes. In\nsummary, we find: (i) no biases from missing large-scale power, (ii)\nsignificant contribution from non-Gaussianity in the cosmic variance as\nexpected following Mondal et al. (iii) an over-estimate of the 21-cm PS of\n10-20 per cent following wedge mode excision for our particular model and (iv)\ntiling smaller volume simulations under-estimates the large-scale power and\nalso the estimated cosmic variance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 04:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Unfortunately, the compounded loss of\ninformation concerning granularity and non-maximum point features due to\nsampling and max pooling could adversely affect the high-semantic point\nfeatures from existing networks such that they are insufficient to represent\nthe local context of a point cloud, which in turn may hinder the network in\ndistinguishing fine shapes. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel point\ncloud feature learning network, PointStack, using multi-resolution feature\nlearning and learnable pooling (LP). The multi-resolution feature learning is\nrealized by aggregating point features of various resolutions in the multiple\nlayers, so that the final point features contain both high-semantic and\nhigh-resolution information. On the other hand, the LP is used as a generalized\npooling function that calculates the weighted sum of multi-resolution point\nfeatures through the attention mechanism with learnable queries, in order to\nextract all possible information from all available point features.\nConsequently, PointStack is capable of extracting high-semantic point features\nwith minimal loss of information concerning granularity and non-maximum point\nfeatures. Therefore, the final aggregated point features can effectively\nrepresent both global and local contexts of a point cloud. In addition, both\nthe global structure and the local shape details of a point cloud can be well\ncomprehended by the network head, which enables PointStack to advance the\nstate-of-the-art of feature learning on point clouds. The codes are available\nat https://github.com/kaist-avelab/PointStack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 04:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

While heuristic functions have been\nhandcrafted using domain knowledge, recent studies demonstrate that learning\nheuristic functions from data is effective in many applications. Motivated by\nthis emerging approach, we study the sample complexity of learning heuristic\nfunctions for GBFS and A*. We build on a recent framework called\n\\textit{data-driven algorithm design} and evaluate the\n\\textit{pseudo-dimension} of a class of utility functions that measure the\nperformance of parameterized algorithms.

A typical FFG pipeline considers characters in a standard font\nlibrary as content glyphs and transfers them to a new target font by extracting\nstyle information from the reference glyphs. Most existing solutions explicitly\ndisentangle content and style of reference glyphs globally or component-wisely.\nHowever, the style of glyphs mainly lies in the local details, i.e. the styles\nof radicals, components, and strokes together depict the style of a glyph.\nTherefore, even a single character can contain different styles distributed\nover spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a new font generation\napproach by learning 1) the fine-grained local styles from references, and 2)\nthe spatial correspondence between the content and reference glyphs. Therefore,\neach spatial location in the content glyph can be assigned with the right\nfine-grained style. To this end, we adopt cross-attention over the\nrepresentation of the content glyphs as the queries and the representations of\nthe reference glyphs as the keys and values. Instead of explicitly\ndisentangling global or component-wise modeling, the cross-attention mechanism\ncan attend to the right local styles in the reference glyphs and aggregate the\nreference styles into a fine-grained style representation for the given content\nglyphs. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in FFG. In particular, the user studies also\ndemonstrate the style consistency of our approach significantly outperforms\nprevious methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 05:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 13:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 04:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

The interpretability of decision trees motivates\nexplainability approaches by so-called intrinsic interpretability, and it is at\nthe core of recent proposals for applying interpretable ML models in high-risk\napplications. The belief in DT interpretability is justified by the fact that\nexplanations for DT predictions are generally expected to be succinct. Indeed,\nin the case of DTs, explanations correspond to DT paths. Since decision trees\nare ideally shallow, and so paths contain far fewer features than the total\nnumber of features, explanations in DTs are expected to be succinct, and hence\ninterpretable. This paper offers both theoretical and experimental arguments\ndemonstrating that, as long as interpretability of decision trees equates with\nsuccinctness of explanations, then decision trees ought not be deemed\ninterpretable. The paper introduces logically rigorous path explanations and\npath explanation redundancy, and proves that there exist functions for which\ndecision trees must exhibit paths with arbitrarily large explanation\nredundancy. The paper also proves that only a very restricted class of\nfunctions can be represented with DTs that exhibit no explanation redundancy.\nIn addition, the paper includes experimental results substantiating that path\nexplanation redundancy is observed ubiquitously in decision trees, including\nthose obtained using different tree learning algorithms, but also in a wide\nrange of publicly available decision trees. The paper also proposes\npolynomial-time algorithms for eliminating path explanation redundancy, which\nin practice require negligible time to compute.

However, for data-intensive models such as vision transformer (ViT),\ncurrent fine-tuning based FSL approaches are inefficient in knowledge\ngeneralization and thus degenerate the downstream task performances. In this\npaper, we propose a novel mask-guided vision transformer (MG-ViT) to achieve an\neffective and efficient FSL on ViT model. The key idea is to apply a mask on\nimage patches to screen out the task-irrelevant ones and to guide the ViT to\nfocus on task-relevant and discriminative patches during FSL.

To optimally select representative few-shot samples, we also include an\nactive learning based sample selection method to further improve the\ngeneralizability of MG-ViT based FSL.

Nonetheless, a large\nfraction of articles (ranging from 10.2% in Dutch to 99.7% in Kazakh) have no\nshort description yet, with detrimental effects for millions of Wikipedia\nusers. Motivated by this problem, we introduce the novel task of automatically\ngenerating short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and propose Descartes, a\nmultilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of\ninformation to generate an article description in a target language: the text\nof the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions\n(if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information\nobtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for\nhandling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines\n(including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with\nmonolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three\nlanguages further shows that the quality of Descartes's descriptions is largely\nindistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our\nEnglish descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for\ninclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with\nthe potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today's\nWikipedia across languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 08:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 09:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 09:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

GSP auctions, which\nare simple and easy to understand for advertisers, have almost become the\nbenchmark for ad auction mechanisms in the industry. However, most GSP-based\nindustrial practices assume that the user click only relies on the ad itself,\nwhich overlook the effect of external items, referred to as externalities.\nRecently, DNA has attempted to upgrade GSP with deep neural networks and models\nlocal externalities to some extent. However, it only considers set-level\ncontexts from auctions and ignores the order and displayed position of ads,\nwhich is still suboptimal. Although VCG-based multi-slot auctions (e.g., VCG,\nWVCG) make it theoretically possible to model global externalities (e.g., the\norder and positions of ads and so on), they lack an efficient balance of both\nrevenue and social welfare. In this paper, we propose novel auction mechanisms\nnamed Neural Multi-slot Auctions (NMA) to tackle the above-mentioned\nchallenges. Specifically, we model the global externalities effectively with a\ncontext-aware list-wise prediction module to achieve better performance. We\ndesign a list-wise deep rank module to guarantee incentive compatibility in\nend-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose an auxiliary loss for social\nwelfare to effectively reduce the decline of social welfare while maximizing\nrevenue. Experiment results on both offline large-scale datasets and online A/B\ntests demonstrate that NMA obtains higher revenue with balanced social welfare\nthan other existing auction mechanisms (i.e., GSP, DNA, WVCG) in industrial\npractice, and we have successfully deployed NMA on Meituan food delivery\nplatform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 08:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 08:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Thus, exploring novel\nspin-related transports in these unconventional chiral fermion semimetals may\nopen a new door for spintronics and spin caloritronics. In this paper, we study\nthe intrinsic SHE and SNE in the CoSi family based on ab initio relativistic\nband structure calculations. First, we find that unlike nonchiral cubic metals,\nthe CoSi family have two independent nonzero SHC (SNC) tensor elements, namely,\n$\\sigma_{xy}^z$ and $\\sigma_{xz}^y$ ($\\alpha_{xy}^z$ and $\\alpha_{xz}^y$)\ninstead of one element. Furthermore, the SHC ($\\sigma_{xy}^z$ and\n$\\sigma_{xz}^y$) and helicity of the chiral structure are found to be\ncorrelated, thus enabling SHE detection of structural helicity and also chiral\nfermion chirality. Second, the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of the CoSi family\nare large. In particular, the calculated SHC of RhGe is as large as -140\n($\\hbar$/e)(S/cm). The calculated SNC of CoGe is also large, being -1.3\n($\\hbar$/e)(A/m K) at room temperature.

The ExMo\ninterpretable machine learning model consists of a list of IF...THEN...\nstatements with a decision rule in the condition. This way, ExMo naturally\nprovides an explanation for a prediction using the decision rule that was\ntriggered. ExMo uses a new approach to extract decision rules from the training\ndata using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features. With\nTF-IDF, decision rules with feature values that are more relevant to each class\nare extracted. Hence, the decision rules obtained by ExMo can distinguish the\npositive and negative classes better than the decision rules used in the\nexisting Bayesian Rule List (BRL) algorithm, obtained using the frequent\npattern mining approach. The paper also shows that ExMo learns a qualitatively\nbetter model than BRL. Furthermore, ExMo demonstrates that the textual\nexplanation can be provided in a human-friendly way so that the explanation can\nbe easily understood by non-expert users. We validate ExMo on several datasets\nwith different sizes to evaluate its efficacy.

Notably, the success of the asymmetric structure relies on the\n\"global\" property of Vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), whose self-attention\nmechanism reasons over arbitrary subset of discrete image patches. However, it\nis still unclear how the advanced Pyramid-based ViTs (e.g., PVT, Swin) can be\nadopted in MAE pre-training as they commonly introduce operators within \"local\"\nwindows, making it difficult to handle the random sequence of partial vision\ntokens. In this paper, we propose Uniform Masking (UM), successfully enabling\nMAE pre-training for Pyramid-based ViTs with locality (termed \"UM-MAE\" for\nshort). Specifically, UM includes a Uniform Sampling (US) that strictly samples\n$1$ random patch from each $2 \\times 2$ grid, and a Secondary Masking (SM)\nwhich randomly masks a portion of (usually $25\\%$) the already sampled regions\nas learnable tokens. US preserves equivalent elements across multiple\nnon-overlapped local windows, resulting in the smooth support for popular\nPyramid-based ViTs; whilst SM is designed for better transferable visual\nrepresentations since US reduces the difficulty of pixel recovery pre-task that\nhinders the semantic learning. We demonstrate that UM-MAE significantly\nimproves the pre-training efficiency (e.g., it speeds up and reduces the GPU\nmemory by $\\sim 2\\times$) of Pyramid-based ViTs, but maintains the competitive\nfine-tuning performance across downstream tasks. For example using HTC++\ndetector, the pre-trained Swin-Large backbone self-supervised under UM-MAE only\nin ImageNet-1K can even outperform the one supervised in ImageNet-22K.

This method supports seamless end-to-end\nerror propagation from raw time-ordered data to final cosmological parameters.\nAs a first demonstration of the method, we analyze time-ordered Planck LFI\nobservations, combined with selected external data (WMAP 33-61GHz, Planck HFI\nDR4 353 and 857GHz, and Haslam 408MHz) in the form of pixelized maps which are\nused to break critical astrophysical degeneracies. Overall, all results are\ngenerally in good agreement with previously reported values from Planck 2018\nand WMAP, with the largest relative difference for any parameter of about 1\nsigma when considering only temperature multipoles between 29<l<601. In cases\nwhere there are differences, we note that the BP results are generally slightly\ncloser to the high-l HFI-dominated Planck 2018 results than previous analyses,\nsuggesting slightly less tension between low and high multipoles. Using low-l\npolarization information from LFI and WMAP, we find a best-fit value of\ntau=0.066 +/- 0.013, which is higher than the low value of tau=0.051 +/- 0.006\nderived from Planck 2018 and slightly lower than the value of 0.069 +/- 0.011\nderived from joint analysis of official LFI and WMAP products.

Unlike\nadults', whose object recognition performance is robust against a wide range of\nimage distortions, DNNs trained on standard ImageNet (1.3M images) perform\npoorly on distorted images. However, the last two years have seen impressive\ngains in DNN distortion robustness, predominantly achieved through\never-increasing large-scale datasets$\\unicode{x2014}$orders of magnitude larger\nthan ImageNet. While this simple brute-force approach is very effective in\nachieving human-level robustness in DNNs, it raises the question of whether\nhuman robustness, too, is simply due to extensive experience with (distorted)\nvisual input during childhood and beyond. Here we investigate this question by\ncomparing the core object recognition performance of 146 children (aged\n4$\\unicode{x2013}$15) against adults and against DNNs.

Certified\nrobustness has been proposed as a mitigation where given an input $x$, a\nclassifier returns a prediction and a radius with a provable guarantee that any\nperturbation to $x$ within this radius (e.g., under the $L_2$ norm) will not\nalter the classifier's prediction. In this work, we show that these guarantees\ncan be invalidated due to limitations of floating-point representation that\ncause rounding errors. We design a rounding search method that can efficiently\nexploit this vulnerability to find adversarial examples within the certified\nradius. We show that the attack can be carried out against several linear\nclassifiers that have exact certifiable guarantees and against neural networks\nwith ReLU activations that have conservative certifiable guarantees. Our\nexperiments demonstrate attack success rates over 50% on random linear\nclassifiers, up to 23.24% on the MNIST dataset for linear SVM, and up to 15.83%\non the MNIST dataset for a neural network whose certified radius was given by a\nverifier based on mixed integer programming.

Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks\noften requires private data, for which federated learning is the de-facto\napproach (i.e., FedNLP). However, our measurements show that FedNLP is\nprohibitively slow due to the large model sizes and the resultant high\nnetwork/computation cost. Towards practical FedNLP, we identify as the key\nbuilding blocks adapters, small bottleneck modules inserted at a variety of\nmodel layers. A key challenge is to properly configure the depth and width of\nadapters, to which the training speed and efficiency is highly sensitive. No\nsilver-bullet configuration exists: the optimal choice varies across downstream\nNLP tasks, desired model accuracy, and mobile resources. To automate adapter\nconfiguration, we propose FedAdapter, a framework that enhances the existing\nFedNLP with two novel designs. First, FedAdapter progressively upgrades the\nadapter configuration throughout a training session; the principle is to\nquickly learn shallow knowledge by only training fewer and smaller adapters at\nthe model's top layers, and incrementally learn deep knowledge by incorporating\ndeeper and larger adapters. Second, FedAdapter continuously profiles future\nadapter configurations by allocating participant devices to trial groups.\nExtensive experiments show that FedAdapter can reduce FedNLP's model\nconvergence delay to no more than several hours, which is up to 155.5$\\times$\nfaster compared to vanilla FedNLP and 48$\\times$ faster compared to strong\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 13:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 19:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To overcome these challenges, highly directional beams\nare exploited to achieve robust links by hybrid beamforming.

An upper limit\nof $\\sim1.3\\pm0.1$ mas (in $L$) can be given for the diameter of the disk\nregion probed in the $L$ band, corresponding to 0.5 au at the adopted Gaia EDR3\ndistance. This represents the hot, gaseous region of the accretion disk. The\n$N$-band data indicate that the dusty passive disk is silicate-rich. Only the\ninnermost region of said dusty disk is found to emit strongly in the $N$ band,\nand it is resolved at an angular size of $\\sim5$ mas, which translates to a\ndiameter of about 2 au.

The current trend towards federated authentication (e.g.,\nSingle Sign-On) adds an additional layer of complexity because many services\nnow support both the classic approach in which the user directly sets a\npassword, and the federated approach in which the user authenticates via an\nidentity provider.\n  Inspired by previous work on preemptive account hijacking [Ghasemisharif et\nal., USENIX SEC 2018], we show that there exists a whole class of account\npre-hijacking attacks. The distinctive feature of these attacks is that the\nattacker performs some action before the victim creates an account, which makes\nit trivial for the attacker to gain access after the victim has\ncreated/recovered the account. Assuming a realistic attacker who knows only the\nvictim's email address, we identify and discuss five different types of account\npre-hijacking attacks.\n  To ascertain the prevalence of such vulnerabilities in the wild, we analyzed\n75 popular services and found that at least 35 of these were vulnerable to one\nor more account pre-hijacking attacks. Whilst some of these may be noticed by\nattentive users, others were completely undetectable from the victim's\nperspective. Finally, we investigated the root cause of these vulnerabilities\nand present a set of security requirements to prevent such vulnerabilities\narising in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 13:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In this work, we tackle the problem\nof summary redundancy in unsupervised extractive summarization of long,\nhighly-redundant documents. For this, we leverage a psycholinguistic theory of\nhuman reading comprehension which directly models local coherence and\nredundancy. Implementing this theory, our system operates at the proposition\nlevel and exploits properties of human memory representations to rank similarly\ncontent units that are coherent and non-redundant, hence encouraging the\nextraction of less redundant final summaries. Because of the impact of the\nsummary length on automatic measures, we control for it by formulating content\nselection as an optimization problem with soft constraints in the budget of\ninformation retrieved. Using summarization of scientific articles as a case\nstudy, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed systems extract\nconsistently less redundant summaries across increasing levels of document\nredundancy, whilst maintaining comparable performance (in terms of relevancy\nand local coherence) against strong unsupervised baselines according to\nautomated evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 14:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In this work we argue that automated counterfactual\ngeneration should regard several aspects of the produced adversarial instances,\nnot only their adversarial capability.

The utility of the framework is showcased over six\nclassification tasks comprising image and three-dimensional data.

The key novelty of the proposed filter lies in that its process\nmodel meets the group affine property while the filter explicitly addresses the\nIMU placement error by formulating its stochastic process model as Brownian\nmotions and incorporating the error in the leg odometry. Although the\nmeasurement model is imperfect (i.e., it does not possess an invariant\nobservation form) and thus its linearization relies on the state estimate,\nexperimental results demonstrate fast convergence of the proposed filter\n(within 0.2 seconds) during squatting motions even under significant IMU\nplacement inaccuracy and initial estimation errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 15:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In this paper,\nwe target the Greedy Additional (GA) algorithm, which has been widely\nrecognized to be effective but less efficient, and try to improve its\nefficiency while preserving effectiveness. In our Accelerated GA (AGA)\nalgorithm, we use some extra data structures to reduce redundant data accesses\nin the GA algorithm and thus the time complexity is reduced from\n$\\mathcal{O}(m^2n)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(kmn)$ when $n > m$, where $m$ is the number\nof test cases, $n$ is the number of program elements, and $k$ is the iteration\nnumber. Moreover, we observe the impact of iteration numbers on prioritization\nefficiency on our dataset and propose to use a specific iteration number in the\nAGA algorithm to further improve the efficiency. We conducted experiments on 55\nopen-source subjects. In particular, we implemented each TCP algorithm with two\nkinds of widely-used input formats, adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Since\na TCP algorithm with adjacency matrix is less efficient than the algorithm with\nadjacency list, the result analysis is mainly conducted based on TCP algorithms\nwith adjacency list. The results show that AGA achieves 5.95X speedup ratio\nover GA on average, while it achieves the same average effectiveness as GA in\nterms of Average Percentage of Fault Detected (APFD). Moreover, we conducted an\nindustrial case study on 22 subjects, collected from Baidu, and find that the\naverage speedup ratio of AGA over GA is 44.27X, which indicates the practical\nusage of AGA in real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 15:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

As a\nresult, the state trajectory displacement caused by abrupt load changes or\ncontingencies can easily lead to instability. Many existing works have been\ndevoted to studying the region of attraction (ROA) of a DC microgrid, in which\nthe system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. Nevertheless, existing\nwork either focuses on using numerical methods for ROA approximations that\ngenerally have no performance guarantees or cannot ensure a desired ROA for a\ngeneral DC microgrid.

Practically realizing such an algorithm as a program\nfor a quantum computer requires an efficient implementation of the data\nstructure whose operations correspond to unitary operators that manipulate\nquantum superpositions of data.\n  To correctly operate in superposition, an implementation must satisfy three\nproperties -- reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution.\nStandard implementations, such as the representation of an abstract set as a\nhash table, fail these properties, calling for tools to develop specialized\nimplementations.\n  In this work, we present Core Tower, the first language for quantum\nprogramming with random-access memory. Core Tower enables the developer to\nimplement data structures as pointer-based, linked data. It features a\nreversible semantics enabling every valid program to be translated to a unitary\nquantum circuit.\n  We present Boson, the first memory allocator that supports reversible,\nhistory-independent, and constant-time dynamic memory allocation in quantum\nsuperposition. We also present Tower, a language for quantum programming with\nrecursively defined data structures. Tower features a type system that bounds\nall recursion using classical parameters as is necessary for a program to\nexecute on a quantum computer.\n  Using Tower, we implement Ground, the first quantum library of data\nstructures, including lists, stacks, queues, strings, and sets. We provide the\nfirst executable implementation of sets that satisfies all three mandated\nproperties of reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 15:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 19:42:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

The factor\nmodel with martingale difference error (FMMDE) makes it possible to retrieve a\ntransformation of the original series so that the resulting variables can be\npartitioned into distinct groups according to whether they are conditionally\nmean independent upon past information or not. In terms of prediction, this\nfeature of the model allows us to achieve optimal results (in the mean squared\nerror sense) as dimension reduction is performed. Conducting a pseudo-real-time\nforecasting exercise based on a large dataset of macroeconomic and financial\nmonthly time series for the U.S. economy, the results obtained from the\nempirical study suggest that FMMDE performs comparably to SW for short-term\nforecasting horizons.

A major drawback of\nexisting methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data\nand hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static\nregret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are\nsampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online\nlearning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a\nnovel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a\nstrongly adapted loss regret.

For these two cases, the Lyapunov exponent [$\\gamma(E)$], mobility\nedges ($E_c$) and critical indices ($\\nu$) of localized length are obtained\nexactly. In addition, several localized state regions, extended state regions\nand critical regions would appear in the parameter $V_0-E$ plane.

Thus, one family of\ncommunity detection algorithms uses random walks to measure distance between\npairs of nodes in various ways, and then applies K-Means or other generic\nclustering methods to these distances. Interestingly, information processing in\nthe brain may suggest a simpler method of learning clusters directly from\nrandom walks. Drawing inspiration from the hippocampus, we describe a simple\ntwo-layer neural learning framework. Neurons in one layer are associated with\ngraph nodes and simulate random walks. These simulations cause neurons in the\nsecond layer to become tuned to graph clusters through simple associative\nlearning. We show that if these neuronal interactions are modelled a particular\nway, the system is essentially a variant of K-Means clustering applied directly\nin the walk-space, bypassing the usual step of computing node\ndistances/similarities. The result is an efficient graph clustering method.\nBiological information processing systems are known for high efficiency and\nadaptability.

Spin togglings shall be reliable due to the\nclean two-well energy landscapes in the athermal transition theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 02:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 14:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In this work, we\nleverage persistent homology from topological data analysis to study the\nstructure of these networks. We contrast dynamic state detection from time\nseries using CGSSN and TDA to two state of the art approaches: Ordinal\nPartition Networks (OPNs) combined with TDA, and the standard application of\npersistent homology to the time-delay embedding of the signal. We show that the\nCGSSN captures rich information about the dynamic state of the underlying\ndynamical system as evidenced by a significant improvement in dynamic state\ndetection and noise robustness in comparison to OPNs. We also show that because\nthe computational time of CGSSN is not linearly dependent on the signal's\nlength, it is more computationally efficient than applying TDA to the\ntime-delay embedding of the time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 15:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Here, we show using elementary trigonometry\nthat Empirical Law 1 can be converted from a heuristic to a theorem. A second\nancient empirical law is that the distance in kilometers from the observer to\nthe North Pole, the geodesic distance measured along the spherical surface of\nthe planet, is the number of degrees of colatitude multiplied by 111.1\nkilometers. Can Empirical Law 2 be similarly rendered rigorous? No; whereas as\nthe shape of the planet is controlled by trigonometry, the size of our world is\nan accident of cosmological history. However, Empirical Law 2, can be\nrigorously verified by measurements. The association of 111 km of north-south\ndistance to one degree of latitude trivially yields the circumference of the\nglobe as 40,000 km. We also extend these ideas and the parallel ray\napproximation to three different ways of modeling a Flat Earth.

If so, how can we evaluate them? Further, given this evaluation\nframework, how can we induce a particular personality in a controllable\nfashion? To answer these three questions, we propose the Machine Personality\nInventory (MPI) dataset for evaluating the machine personality; MPI follows\nstandardized personality tests, built upon the Big Five Personality Factors\n(Big Five) theory and personality assessment inventories.

The key characteristic of these ViT models is to adopt\ndifferent aggregation strategies of spatial patch information within the\nartificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there is still a key lack of\nunified representation of different ViT architectures for systematic\nunderstanding and assessment of model representation performance. Moreover, how\nthose well-performing ViT ANNs are similar to real biological neural networks\n(BNNs) is largely unexplored. To answer these fundamental questions, we, for\nthe first time, propose a unified and biologically-plausible relational graph\nrepresentation of ViT models. Specifically, the proposed relational graph\nrepresentation consists of two key sub-graphs: aggregation graph and affine\ngraph. The former one considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial\ninteraction, while the latter one regards network channels as nodes and\nreflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified\nrelational graph representation, we found that: a) a sweet spot of the\naggregation graph leads to ViTs with significantly improved predictive\nperformance; b) the graph measures of clustering coefficient and average path\nlength are two effective indicators of model prediction performance, especially\nwhen applying on the datasets with small samples; c) our findings are\nconsistent across various ViT architectures and multiple datasets; d) the\nproposed relational graph representation of ViT has high similarity with real\nBNNs derived from brain science data.
