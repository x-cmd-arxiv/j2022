The observations cover a wide range of sky directions, lunar\nphases and lunar positions. A revised simplified scattering model is developed\nfor estimating the sky brightness due to moonlight that more accurately\nreflects the atmospheric extinction of the lunar beam compared to models\nfrequently applied in astronomical studies. Contributions to night sky\nbrightness due to sources other than moonlight are quantified and subtracted\nfrom the total sky background radiation to determine the spectral intensity and\nangular distribution of scattered moonlight. The atmospheric scattering phase\nfunction is then derived by comparing the sky brightening to the strength of\nthe incoming lunar beam, estimated using a novel approach. The phase function\nis shown to be an excellent match to the combined theoretical Rayleigh and Mie\nscattering functions, the latter with a Henyey--Greenstein form instead of the\nexponential angular relationship often used in previous studies. Where\ndeviations between measured and model sky brightness are evident in some bands\nthese are explained by contributions from multiple scattering or airglow, and\nare quantified accordingly. The model constitutes an effective tool to predict\nsky brightness at SAAO in optical photometric bands, especially with a bright\nmoon present. The methodology can also be readily be adapted for use at other\nastronomical sites. The paper furthermore presents $UBV(RI)_c$ and\nStr{\\\"o}mgren photometry for 49 stars, most with no prior such data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 16:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Given input $x$ of class $y_1$, its counterfactual is\na contrastive example $x^\\prime$ of another class $y_0$. Current approaches\nprimarily solve this task by a complex optimization: define an objective\nfunction based on the loss of the counterfactual outcome $y_0$ with hard or\nsoft constraints, then optimize this function as a black-box. This \"deep\nlearning\" approach, however, is rather slow, sometimes tricky, and may result\nin unrealistic counterfactual examples. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach to deal with these problems using only two gradient computations based\non tractable probabilistic models. First, we compute an unconstrained\ncounterfactual $u$ of $x$ to induce the counterfactual outcome $y_0$. Then, we\nadapt $u$ to higher density regions, resulting in $x^{\\prime}$.

First we resort to the Dirichlet distribution\nfor the prior distribution of the isotopic vector. The Dirichlet distribution\npossesses the attractive property that the elements of its vector samples sum\nup to 1. Second, we demonstrate that such Dirichlet priors can be incorporated\nwithin an hierarchical modeling of the prior uncertainty in the isotopic\nvector, when prior information about isotopic composition is available. Our\nused Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework makes use of this available\ninformation but also acknowledges its uncertainty by letting to a controlled\nextent the information content of the indirect measurement data (i.e., gamma\nand neutron counts) shape the actual prior distribution of the isotopic vector.\nThird, we propose to regularize the Bayesian inversion by using Gaussian\nprocess (GP) prior modeling when inferring 1D spatially-distributed quantities.\nAs of uncertainty in the efficiencies, we keep using the same stylized drum\nmodeling approach as proposed in our previous work to account for the source\ndistribution uncertainty across the vertical direction of the drum. A series of\nsynthetic tests followed by application to a real waste drum show that\ncombining hierarchical modeling of the prior isotopic composition uncertainty\ntogether with GP prior modeling of the vertical Pu profile across the drum\nworks well. We also find that our GP prior can handles both cases with and\nwithout spatial correlation.

One common\ntheoretical approach to this problem is to model the task as a two-agent\ncooperative scheme in which a `speaker' agent would generate the expression\nthat best describes a targeted area and a `listener' agent would identify the\ntarget. Several recent REG systems have used deep learning approaches to\nrepresent the speaker/listener agents. The Rational Speech Act framework (RSA),\na Bayesian approach to pragmatics that can predict human linguistic behavior\nquite accurately, has been shown to generate high quality and explainable\nexpressions on toy datasets involving simple visual scenes. Its application to\nlarge scale problems, however, remains largely unexplored. This paper applies a\ncombination of the probabilistic RSA framework and deep learning approaches to\nlarger datasets involving complex visual scenes in a multi-step process with\nthe aim of generating better-explained expressions.

Recently, deep learning surrogate assisted HSLO\nhas been proposed, which learns the mapping from layout to its corresponding\ntemperature field, so as to substitute the simulation during optimization to\ndecrease the computational cost largely. However, it faces two main challenges:\n1) the neural network surrogate for the certain task is often manually designed\nto be complex and requires rich debugging experience, which is challenging for\nthe designers in the engineering field; 2) existing algorithms for HSLO could\nonly obtain a near optimal solution in single optimization and are easily\ntrapped in local optimum.

The\nCP-violation asymmetry $A_{CP}^{mix}$ comes from the interference of mixing and\ndecay $\\lambda_{\\phi \\phi} = {q \\over p} {\\bar{A} \\over A}$. In the Standard\nModel (SM) and in the Naive Factorization limit, the CP phase from the mixing\n${q \\over p}$ exactly cancels the CP phase from the decay ratio ${\\bar{A} \\over\nA}$. Therefore, this mode is suitable to look for possible New Physics (NP)\nbecause $A_{CP}^{mix}$ would directly indicate the departure from the SM in\nmixing. We estimate the deviation from this cancellation by analyzing possible\nsmall effects in the SM, using in particular the QCD Factorization scheme. We\ncompare the theoretical expectation for $A_{CP}^{mix}$ to the measurement of\nLHCb, and the implications for NP.

To address these challenges,\nin this article, we introduce a new statistic called the multidimensional local\nprecision rate (mLPR) for each object in each class. We show that\nclassification decisions made by simply sorting objects across classes in\ndescending order of their true mLPRs can, in theory, ensure the class hierarchy\nand lead to the maximization of CATCH, an objective function we introduce that\nis related to the area under a hit curve.

The Point Spread Function (PSF) needs to be precisely\nmodeled to avoid systematic error on the weak lensing measurements. The weak\nlensing biases induced by errors in the PSF model second moments, i.e., its\nsize and shape, are well-studied. However, Zhang et al.

Therefore, the goal of this work\nis to comprehensively investigate the modeling quality of PSF moments from the\n$3^{\\text{rd}}$ to $6^{\\text{th}}$ order, and estimate their impact on\ncosmological parameter inference. We propagate the \\textsc{PSFEx} higher\nmoments modeling error in the HSC survey dataset to the weak lensing\n\\edit{shear-shear correlation functions} and their cosmological analyses.

We consider systems of spinful particles on a one-dimensional\nlattice subjected to constrained spin interactions, such that some or even all\nmultipole moments of the effective spin pattern formed by the particles are\nconserved. On the one hand, when all moments - and thus the entire spin pattern\n- are conserved, dynamical spin correlations reduce to tracer motion\nidentically, generically yielding a subdiffusive dynamical exponent $z=4$. This\nprovides a common framework to understand the dynamics of several constrained\nlattice models, including models with XNOR or $tJ_z$ - constraints. We consider\nrandom unitary circuit dynamics with such a conserved spin pattern and use the\ntracer picture to obtain exact expressions for their late-time dynamical\ncorrelations.

On the\nother hand, when only a finite number of moments of the pattern are conserved,\nthe dynamics is described by a convolution of the internal hydrodynamics of the\nspin pattern with a tracer distribution function. As a consequence, we find\nthat the tracer universality is robust in generic systems if at least the\nquadrupole moment of the pattern remains conserved.

They contain a\nsingle magnetic null point in the spine, potentially influencing the evolution\nof nearby flux ropes (FRs). To understand the net effect of the PS on FR\neruptions is first necessary to study diverse and isolated FR-PS scenarios,\nwhich are not influenced by other magnetic structures. We performed numerical\nsimulations in which a FR structure is in the vicinity of a PS magnetic\nconfiguration. The combined magnetic field of the PS and the FR results in the\nformation of two magnetic null points. We evolve this scenario by numerically\nsolving the magnetohydrodynamic equations in 2.5D.

The Average Assignment Map is thus\nshown to be a more sensible choice for the ever more prevalent scenario of\ncomplex quantum systems.

However, the challenge of the eikonal is exacerbated by the\nvelocity models producing caustics, resulting in instabilities and\ndeterioration of accuracy due to the non-smooth solution behaviour. In this\npaper, we revisit the problem of solving the eikonal equation using neural\nnetworks to tackle the caustic pathologies. We introduce the novel Neural\nEikonal Solver (NES) for solving the isotropic eikonal equation in two\nformulations: the one-point problem is for a fixed source location; the\ntwo-point problem is for an arbitrary source-receiver pair. We present several\ntechniques which provide stability in velocity models producing caustics:\nimproved factorization; non-symmetric loss function based on Hamiltonian;\ngaussian activation; symmetrization. In our tests, NES showed the\nrelative-mean-absolute error of about 0.2-0.4% from the second-order factored\nFast Marching Method, and outperformed existing neural-network solvers giving\n10-60 times lower errors and 2-30 times faster training. The inference time of\nNES is comparable with the Fast Marching.

However, when the loss\nfunction is only locally convex, such a step-size schedule artificially slows\nGD down as it cannot explore the flat curvature of the loss function. To\novercome that issue, we propose to exponentially increase the step-size of the\nGD algorithm. Under homogeneous assumptions on the loss function, we\ndemonstrate that the iterates of the proposed \\emph{exponential step size\ngradient descent} (EGD) algorithm converge linearly to the optimal solution.\nLeveraging that optimization insight, we then consider using the EGD algorithm\nfor solving parameter estimation under both regular and non-regular statistical\nmodels whose loss function becomes locally convex when the sample size goes to\ninfinity. We demonstrate that the EGD iterates reach the final statistical\nradius within the true parameter after a logarithmic number of iterations,\nwhich is in stark contrast to a \\emph{polynomial} number of iterations of the\nGD algorithm in non-regular statistical models. Therefore, the total\ncomputational complexity of the EGD algorithm is \\emph{optimal} and\nexponentially cheaper than that of the GD for solving parameter estimation in\nnon-regular statistical models while being comparable to that of the GD in\nregular statistical settings. To the best of our knowledge, it resolves a\nlong-standing gap between statistical and algorithmic computational\ncomplexities of parameter estimation in non-regular statistical models.\nFinally, we provide targeted applications of the general theory to several\nclasses of statistical models, including generalized linear models with\npolynomial link functions and location Gaussian mixture models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 21:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 20:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

It increases the scientific impact of both\nobservatories beyond their individual capabilities. $Gaia$ provides PMs across\nthe whole sky, but the limited mirror size and time baseline restrict the best\nPM performance to relatively bright stars. $HST$ can measure accurate PMs for\nmuch fainter stars over a small field, but this requires two epochs of\nobservation which are not always available. GaiaHub yields considerably\nimproved PM accuracy compared to $Gaia$-only measurements, especially for faint\nsources $(G \\gtrsim 18)$, requiring only a single epoch of $HST$ data observed\nmore than $\\sim 7$ years ago (before 2012). This provides considerable\nscientific value especially for dynamical studies of stellar systems or\nstructures in and beyond the Milky Way (MW) halo, for which the member stars\nare generally faint. To illustrate the capabilities and demonstrate the\naccuracy of GaiaHub, we apply it to samples of MW globular clusters (GCs) and\nclassical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellite galaxies. This allows us, e.g., to\nmeasure the velocity dispersions in the plane of the sky for objects out to and\nbeyond $\\sim 100$ kpc. We find, on average, mild radial velocity anisotropy in\nGCs, consistent with existing results for more nearby samples. We observe a\ncorrelation between the internal kinematics of the clusters and their\nellipticity, with more isotropic clusters being, on average, more round. Our\nresults also support previous findings that Draco and Sculptor dSph galaxies\nappear to be radially anisotropic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 22:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The algorithm converts the original problem into a sequence of convex\nsubproblems. Either exact or approximate solutions of convex subproblems can be\ncomputed efficiently in many cases. For the inexact case, computing the\nsolution of the subproblem requires evaluation of at most one\ngradient/function-value of the original objective and constraint functions.

By\ncarefully increasing this level for each subproblem, we provide a simple\nsolution to overcome the challenge of bounding the Lagrangian multipliers, and\nshow that the algorithm follows a strictly feasible solution path till\nconvergence to the stationary point. Finally, we develop a simple, proximal\ngradient descent type analysis, showing that the complexity bound of this new\nalgorithm is comparable to gradient descent for the unconstrained setting which\nis new in the literature.

Why? Here, we introduce a generic mechanism which promotes\ntransitivity, even when there is ample room for cyclicity. Consider a\ncompetitive system where outcomes are mediated by competitor attributes via a\nperformance function. We demonstrate that, if competitive outcomes depend\nsmoothly on competitor attributes, then similar competitors compete\ntransitively. We quantify the rate of convergence to transitivity given the\nsimilarity of the competitors and the smoothness of the performance function.\nThus, we prove the adage regarding apples and oranges.

In a previous work on the Markovian master\nequation of the system, we investigated a model in which the difference in the\nsite-phonon coupling between adjacent oscillators is the same throughout the\nchain. Here we look into another model in which the oscillators are coupled to\nthe phonon bath with alternating strength at successive sites. Whereas in the\nfirst model all exciton modes are connected, in the second model they are\ncoupled in pairs that are not connected to each other. Owing to this special\nstructure in the coupling, the excitation numbers of different modes can be\nsolved exactly in the steady state. In the first model, the minima of the\nexcitation profile in the site basis occur at the edges of the chain, whereas\nin the second model the maxima occur at the edges. The energy transfer\nefficiency in the first model is affected by the source power whereas in the\nsecond model the efficiency is independent of it. A distinct feature in the\nsecond model is that a sink placed at the middle of the chain is able to\ndistinguish between chains with even and odd number of sites. The energy\ntransfer efficiency in a chain with even number of sites is higher than a chain\nwith odd number of sites. Therefore, it reveals the discrete nature of the\nchain. In the limit of very long chain when the discreteness of the chain is\nless evident, the efficiencies approach each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 23:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

However, when the treatment and the mediator are not randomized, the\nestimates may be biased due to unmeasured confounding among the treatment,\nmediator, and outcome. Building on Cinelli and Hazlett (2020), we propose a\nsharp and interpretable sensitivity analysis method for the Baron-Kenny\napproach to mediation in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We first\nmodify their omitted-variable bias formula to facilitate the discussion with\nheteroskedasticity and model misspecification.

Such models are prone to blowups: for a\nstrong enough interaction coupling, the mean-field rate of interaction diverges\nin finite time with a finite fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously. Due to\nthe reset mechanism of integrate-and-fire neurons, these blowups can happen\nrepeatedly, at least in principle. A benefit of considering Poissonian\nmean-field models is that one can resolve blowups analytically by mapping the\noriginal singular dynamics onto uniformly regular dynamics via a time change.\nResolving a blowup then amounts to solving the fixed-point problem that\nimplicitly defines the time change, which can be done consistently for a single\nblowup and for nonzero delays. Here we extend this time-change analysis in two\nways: First, we exhibit the existence and uniqueness of explosive solutions\nwith a countable infinity of blowups in the large interaction regime. Second,\nwe show that these delayed solutions specify \"physical\" explosive solutions in\nthe limit of vanishing delays, which in turn can be explicitly constructed. The\nfirst result relies on the fact that blowups are self-sustaining but\nnonoverlapping in the time-changed picture. The second result follows from the\ncontinuity of blowups in the time-changed picture and incidentally implies the\nexistence of periodic solutions. These results are useful to study the\nemergence of synchrony in neural network models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 00:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Often, the post-treatment outcome of interest is whether\nthe event happens within a pre-specified time window, which leads to a binary\noutcome. One source of bias for estimating the causal treatment effect is the\npresence of confounders, which are usually controlled using propensity\nscore-based methods. An additional source of bias is right-censoring, which\noccurs when the information on the outcome of interest is not completely\navailable due to dropout, study termination, or treatment switch before the\nevent of interest. We propose an inverse probability weighted regression-based\nestimator that can simultaneously handle both confounding and right-censoring,\ncalling the method CIPWR, with the letter C highlighting the censoring\ncomponent.

Hence, we\nanalyzed the radiomics features of 22 anatomical structures in the head and\nneck area in CT images. Furthermore, we studied whether CT radiomics can\nclassify anatomical structures of the head and neck using unsupervised\nmachine-learning techniques. Materials and methods: We obtained IMRT/VMAT\ntreatment planning data from 36 patients treated for head and neck cancers in a\nsingle institution. There were 1357 contours of more than 22 anatomical\nstructures drawn on planning CTs. We calculated 174 radiomics features using\nthe SIBEX program. First, we tested whether the radiomics features of\nanatomical structures were unique enough to classify all contours into 22\ngroups.

Results: The heatmap of 174 radiomics features of 22\nanatomical structures showed a distinct difference among tumors and other\nhealthy structures. Radiomics features have allowed us to identify the eyes,\nlens, submandibular, pituitary glands, and thyroids with over 90% accuracy. The\ntwo-stage clustering of 22 structures resulted in six subgroups, which shared\ncommon characteristics such as fatty and bony tissues.

In the field of quantum machine learning, several models have\nbeen proposed.

FIDO2 is a new standard\nspecified by the FIDO industry alliance for secure token online authentication.\nIt complements the W3C WebAuthn specification by providing means to use a USB\ntoken or other authenticator as a second factor during the authentication\nprocess. From a cryptographic perspective, the protocol is a simple\nchallenge-response where the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm is used\nto sign challenges. To protect the privacy of the user the token uses unique\nkey pairs per service. To accommodate for small memory, tokens use various\ntechniques that make use of a special parameter called a key handle sent by the\nservice to the token. We identify and analyse a vulnerability in the way the\nprocessing of key handles is implemented that allows attackers to remotely link\nuser accounts on multiple services. We show that for vulnerable authenticators\nthere is a difference between the time it takes to process a key handle for a\ndifferent service but correct authenticator, and for a different authenticator\nbut correct service. This difference can be used to perform a timing attack\nallowing an adversary to link user's accounts across services.

While they can outsource the computational task to\nother facilities, there are various constraints on the amount of data that can\nbe shared. It is natural to ask what can data outsourcing accomplish under such\nconstraints. We address this question from a machine learning perspective. When\ntraining a model with optimization algorithms, the quality of the results often\nrelies heavily on the points where the algorithms are initialized. Random start\nis one of the most popular methods to tackle this issue, but it can be\ncomputationally expensive and not feasible for organizations lacking computing\nresources.

Model compression lowers storage and transfer costs, and can\nfurther make training more efficient by decreasing the number of computations\nin the forward and/or backward pass. Thus, compressing networks also at\ntraining time while maintaining a high performance is an important research\ntopic. This work is a survey on methods which reduce the number of trained\nweights in deep learning models throughout the training. Most of the introduced\nmethods set network parameters to zero which is called pruning. The presented\npruning approaches are categorized into pruning at initialization, lottery\ntickets and dynamic sparse training. Moreover, we discuss methods that freeze\nparts of a network at its random initialization. By freezing weights, the\nnumber of trainable parameters is shrunken which reduces gradient computations\nand the dimensionality of the model's optimization space.

A natural question is that whether CMR works elsewhere in the Galaxy. As\nan initial attempt to answer the question, this paper investigates the\ntriggering of CMR and the production of dense gas in a flat-rotating disk with\na modified BiSymmetric Spiral (BSS) magnetic field. Cloud-cloud collisions at\nfield reversals in the disk are modeled with the Athena++ code. Under the\ncondition that is representative of the warm neutral medium, the cloud-cloud\ncollision successfully triggers CMR at different disk radii. However, dense gas\nformation is hindered by the dominating thermal pressure, unless a moderately\nstronger initial field $\\gtrsim5\\mu$G is present. The strong-field model,\nhaving a larger Lundquist number $S_L$ and lower plasma $\\beta$, activates the\nplasmoid instability in the collision midplane, which is otherwise suppressed\nby the disk rotation. We speculate that CMR can be common if more clouds\ncollide along field reversals. However, to witness the CMR process in numerical\nsimulations, we need to significantly resolve the collision midplane with a\nspatial dynamic range $\\gtrsim10^6$. If Milky Way spiral arms indeed coincide\nwith field reversals in BSS, it is possible that CMR creates or maintains dense\ngas in the arms. High-resolution, high-sensitivity Zeeman/Faraday-Rotation\nobservations are crucial for finding CMR candidates that have helical fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 05:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

This is motivated by the practice that many\ncrowdsourcing contests have very limited resources of reviewers and want to\nimprove the overall quality of the submissions. We first consider a setting\nwhere the designer knows the ranking of the abilities (types) of all $n_1$\nregistered players, and admit the top $n_2$ players with $2\\leq n_2 \\leq n_1$\ninto the contest. The players admitted into the contest update their beliefs\nabout their opponents based on the signal that their abilities are among the\ntop $n_2$.

This result holds generally --\nit is true under any ranking-based reward structure, ability distribution, and\ncost function. We also discuss the situation where the designer can only admit\n$c<n_1$ players.

In this work, we\nexplore the relationship between refactoring and security by analyzing\nrefactoring actions performed jointly with vulnerability fixes in practice. We\nconducted a case study to analyze 143 maven libraries in which 351 known\nvulnerabilities had been detected and fixed. Surprisingly, our exploratory\nresults show that developers incorporate refactoring operations in their fixes,\nwith 31.9% (112 out of 351) of the vulnerabilities paired with refactoring\nactions. We envision this short paper to open up potential new directions to\nmotivate automated tool support, allowing developers to deliver fixes faster,\nwhile maintaining their code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 06:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Due to better\naccessibility and usage flexibility, newly emergent dockless sharing bikes have\nbecome quite popular and are reviving the fashion of cycling in cities. Urban\ncongestion is simultaneously influenced by heterogeneous saptio-temporal travel\ndemands, topology and spatial characteristics of road networks, and the\ninterplay between travel modes. In this paper, by considering aforementioned\nfactors, we discover a robust sublinear scaling relation between the level of\ncongestion for vehicles and the detour ratio weighted by biking traffic, which\nis intriguing given the fact that congestion and detour ratio is linearly\nindependent. Such a scaling relation implies a strong interplay between vehicle\ntraffic and cycling activities and can be applied in predictions for congestion\nor aggregated to more sophisticated traffic models. In addition,\nbiking-traffic-weighted detour ratio can be applied to detect inefficient\nroutes, which would help alleviate urban congestion, make better urban\nplanning, and improve transportation efficiency and equity in cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 06:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Existing clutter removal methods either\nleave residual clutter or deform target responses when facing complex and\nirregular clutter in the real-world radargram. To tackle the challenge of\nclutter removal in real scenarios, a clutter-removal neural network (CR-Net)\ntrained on a large-scale hybrid dataset is presented in this study. The CR-Net\nintegrates residual dense blocks into the U-Net architecture to enhance its\ncapability in clutter suppression and target reflection restoration. The\ncombination of the mean absolute error (MAE) loss and the multi-scale\nstructural similarity (MS-SSIM) loss is used to effectively drive the\noptimization of the network. To train the proposed CR-Net to remove complex and\ndiverse clutter in real-world radargrams, the first large-scale hybrid dataset\nnamed CLT-GPR dataset containing clutter collected by different GPR systems in\nmultiple scenarios is built. The CLT-GPR dataset significantly improves the\ngeneralizability of the network to remove clutter in real-world GPR radargrams.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that the CR-Net achieves superior\nperformance over existing methods in removing clutter and restoring target\nresponses in diverse real-world scenarios. Moreover, the CR-Net with its\nend-to-end design does not require manual parameter tuning, making it highly\nsuitable for automatically producing clutter-free radargrams in GPR\napplications.

A\ncross-polarized configuration can be used to suppress ground clutter and reveal\nthe object reflection, but it suffers from inconsistent detection capability\nwhich significantly varies with different object orientations. To address this\nissue, we propose a dual-cross-polarized detection (DCPD) method which utilizes\ntwo cross-polarized antennas with a special arrangement to detect the object.\nThe signals reflected by the object and collected by the two antennas are\ncombined in a rotationally invariant manner to ensure both effective ground\nclutter suppression and consistent detection irrespective of the object\norientation. In addition, we present a dual-cross-polarized orientation\nestimation (DCPOE) algorithm to estimate the object orientation from the two\ncross-polarized data. The proposed DCPOE algorithm is less affected by\nenvironmental noise and performs robust and accurate azimuth angle estimation.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed techniques in the detection and orientation\nestimation and their advantages over the existing method have been demonstrated\nusing experimental data.

We introduce dissipative\nquantum neural networks (DQNNs), which are designed for fully quantum learning\ntasks, are capable of universal quantum computation and have low memory\nrequirements while training. These networks are optimised with training data\npairs in form of input and desired output states and therefore can be used for\ncharacterising unknown or untrusted quantum devices. We not only demonstrate\nthe generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations, but also\nimplement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the\nultimate limits for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the\nquantum no free lunch theorem, which describes a bound on the probability that\na quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is optimised\nwith quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover\nwe expand the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first\ncase, we include additional information beyond just the training data pairs:\nsince quantum devices are always structured, the resulting data is always\nstructured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge\nabout the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the\ntraining process and show that this can lead to better generalisation\nbehaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including graph structure are\ntrained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation.\nHowever, in the second extension of the algorithm we aim to learn\ncharacteristics of a set of quantum states in order to extend it to quantum\nstates which have similar properties. Therefore we build a generative\nadversarial model where two DQNNs, called the generator and discriminator, are\ntrained in a competitive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 07:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Further, with the explosive rise\nin fake news dissemination over social media, including images and text, it has\nbecome imperative to identify fake news faster and more accurately. To solve\nthis problem, this work investigates a novel multimodal stacked ensemble-based\napproach (SEMIFND) to fake news detection. Focus is also kept on ensuring\nfaster performance with fewer parameters. Moreover, to improve multimodal\nperformance, a deep unimodal analysis is done on the image modality to identify\nNasNet Mobile as the most appropriate model for the task.

The NNs operate on 15 MODIS-Aqua visible and infrared bands and are\ntested using bottom of atmosphere (BOA), top of atmosphere (TOA) and Rayleigh\ncorrected TOA reflectances (RC). In each case, a NN architecture consisting of\n3 layers of 15 neurons improved performances and data availability compared to\ncurrent state-of-the-art algorithms used in the region. The NN operating on TOA\nreflectance outperformed BOA and RC versions. By operating on TOA reflectance\ndata, the NN approach overcomes the common but difficult problem of atmospheric\ncorrection in coastal waters. Moreover, the NN provides data for regions which\nother algorithms often mask out for turbid water or low zenith angle flags. A\ndistinguishing feature of the NN approach is generation of associated product\nuncertainties based on multiple resampling of the training data set to produce\na distribution of values for each pixel, and an example is shown for a coastal\ntime series in the North Sea. The final output of the NN approach consists of a\nbest-estimate image based on medians for each pixel and a second image\nrepresenting uncertainty based on standard deviation for each pixel, providing\npixel-specific estimates of uncertainty in the final product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 09:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

The morally good is often defined in\ncausal terms, as in whether one's actions have in fact caused a particular\noutcome, and whether the outcome could have been anticipated. We propose an\nonline reinforcement learning method that learns a policy under the constraint\nthat the agent should not be the cause of harm. This is accomplished by\ndefining cause using the theory of actual causation and assigning blame to the\nagent when its actions are the actual cause of an undesirable outcome. We\nconduct experiments on a toy ethical dilemma in which a natural choice of\nreward function leads to clearly undesirable behavior, but our method learns a\npolicy that avoids being the cause of harmful behavior, demonstrating the\nsoundness of our approach. Allowing an agent to learn while observing causal\nmoral distinctions such as blame, opens the possibility to learning policies\nthat better conform to our moral judgments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 09:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

We study $E_5$ geometrically, our goal being a conformal map of that\nterrain of possible shapes. The differential geometry that we use is all due to\nGauss, though much of it is named after his student Riemann.\n  The manifold $E_5$ inherits a Riemannian metric from the Grassmannian\napproach of Hausmann and Knutson, a metric $e_5$ under which $E_5$ has 240\nisometries: an optional reflection combined with any permutation of the order\nin which the five edge vectors $V_{k+1}-V_k$ get assembled into a pentagon.\nGiving $E_5$ the conformal structure imposed by $e_5$ yields a compact Riemann\nsurface of genus 4 with 120 automorphisms: the 120 isometries that preserve\norientation. But there is only one Riemann surface with those properties: the\nBring sextic. So $(E_5, e_5)$ conformally embeds in the hyperbolic plane, like\nthe Bring sextic, as a repeating pattern of 240 triangles, each with vertex\nangles of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, and $\\frac{\\pi}{5}$.

We introduce Arbiter as a new\nhyperparameter optimization algorithm to perform batch size adaptations for\nlearnable scheduling heuristics using gradients from a meta-objective function,\nwhich overcomes previous heuristic constraints by enforcing a novel learning\nprocess called hyper-learning. With hyper-learning, Arbiter formulates a neural\nnetwork agent to generate optimal batch size samples for an inner deep network\nby learning an adaptive heuristic through observing concomitant responses over\nT inner descent steps. Arbiter avoids unrolled optimization, and does not\nrequire hypernetworks to facilitate gradients, making it reasonably cheap,\nsimple to implement, and versatile to different tasks.

We find that local stellar mass\nsurface density, when combined with total stellar mass, is sufficient to\nreproduce the overall mass--size trend in a qualitative sense.

To evade detection, including by ML-based techniques, attackers\ninvest in creating malware that closely resemble legitimate apps. In this\npaper, we propose GUIDED RETRAINING, a supervised representation learning-based\nmethod that boosts the performance of a malware detector. First, the dataset is\nsplit into \"easy\" and \"difficult\" samples, where difficulty is associated to\nthe prediction probabilities yielded by a malware detector: for difficult\nsamples, the probabilities are such that the classifier is not confident on the\npredictions, which have high error rates. Then, we apply our GUIDED RETRAINING\nmethod on the difficult samples to improve their classification. For the subset\nof \"easy\" samples, the base malware detector is used to make the final\npredictions since the error rate on that subset is low by construction. For the\nsubset of \"difficult\" samples, we rely on GUIDED RETRAINING, which leverages\nthe correct predictions and the errors made by the base malware detector to\nguide the retraining process. GUIDED RETRAINING focuses on the difficult\nsamples: it learns new embeddings of these samples using Supervised Contrastive\nLearning and trains an auxiliary classifier for the final predictions. We\nvalidate our method on four state-of-the-art Android malware detection\napproaches using over 265k malware and benign apps, and we demonstrate that\nGUIDED RETRAINING can reduce up to 40.41% prediction errors made by the malware\ndetectors.

In comparison to the\nQNMs obtained via more established methods (namely, the continued fraction\nmethod and the 6th-order Wentzel, Kramer, Brillouin method) the PINN\ncomputations share the same degree of accuracy as these counterparts. In other\nwords, our PINN approximations had percentage deviations as low as\n$(\\delta\\omega_{_{Re}}, \\delta\\omega_{_{Im}}) = (<0.01\\%, <0.01\\%)$. In terms\nof the time taken to compute QNMs to this accuracy, however, the PINN approach\nfalls short, leading to our conclusion that the method is currently not to be\nrecommended when considering overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 12:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 18:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Unfortunately, on-demand\nprovisioning is expensive and must be weighed against the costs incurred by an\nadversary. This leads to a recent threat known as {\\it economic\ndenial-of-sustainability (EDoS)}, where the cost for defending a service is\nhigher than that of attacking.\n  A natural tool for combating EDoS is to impose costs via resource burning\n(RB). Here, a client must verifiably consume resources -- for example, by\nsolving a computational challenge -- before service is rendered. However, prior\nRB-based defenses with security guarantees do not account for the cost of\non-demand provisioning.\n  Another common approach is the use of heuristics -- such as a client's\nreputation score or the geographical location -- to identify and discard\nspurious job requests. However, these heuristics may err and existing\napproaches do not provide security guarantees when this occurs.\n  Here, we propose an EDoS defense, LCharge, that uses resource burning while\naccounting for on-demand provisioning. LCharge leverages an estimate of the\nnumber of job requests from honest clients (i.e., good jobs) in any set $S$ of\nrequests to within an $O(\\alpha)$-factor, for any unknown $\\alpha>0$, but\nretains a strong security guarantee despite the uncertainty of this estimate.\nSpecifically, against an adversary that expends $B$ resources to attack, the\ntotal cost for defending is $O( \\alpha^{5/2}\\sqrt{B\\,(g+1)} +\n\\alpha^3(g+\\alpha))$ where $g$ is the number of good jobs. Notably, for large\n$B$ relative to $g$ and $\\alpha$, the adversary has higher cost, implying that\nthe algorithm has an economic advantage. Finally, we prove a lower bound for\nour problem of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\alpha B g})$, showing that the cost of LCharge is\nasymptotically tight for $\\alpha=\\Theta(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 12:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 17:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

The middle-aged pulsar PSR J0738$-$4042, which had\nbeen observed to display variations in the pulse profile associated with its\nspin-down rate change due to external effects, is a remarkable example. In this\nstudy, based on the 12.5-yr combined public timing data from UTMOST and Parkes,\nwe have detected a new emission-rotation correlation in PSR J0738$-$4042\nconcurrent with a glitch. A glitch that occurred at MJD 57359(5) (December 3,\n2015) with $\\Delta\\nu/\\nu \\sim 0.36(4)\\times 10^{-9}$ is the first glitch event\nobserved in this pulsar and is probably the underlying cause of the\nemission-rotation correlation. Unlike the usual post-glitch behaviours, the\nbraking torque on the pulsar has continued to increase over 1380 d,\ncorresponding to a significant decrease in $\\ddot{\\nu}$. As for changes in the\npulse profile after the glitch, the relative amplitude of the leading component\nweakens drastically, while the middle component becomes stronger. A combined\nmodel of crustquake induced platelet movement and vortex creep response is\ninvoked to account for this rare correlation.

In many\nrhythmic systems, robustness against perturbations involves response of both\nthe shape and the timing of the trajectory. This makes the study of robustness\neven more challenging.\n  To understand how a motor system produces robust behaviors in a variable\nenvironment, we consider a neuromechanical model of motor patterns in the\nfeeding apparatus of the marine mollusk \\textit{Aplysia californica}\n\\citep{shaw2015,lyttle2017}.

In contrast,\nthe effect of changed sensory feedback signal is significantly delayed by the\nfiring rates' hard boundary properties. Our analysis suggests that sensory\nfeedback contributes to robustness in swallowing primarily by shifting the\ntiming of neural activation involved in the power stroke of the motor cycle\n(retraction). This effect enables the system to generate stronger retractor\nmuscle forces to compensate for the increased load, and hence achieve strong\nrobustness.\n  The approaches that we are applying to understanding a neuromechanical model\nin \\textit{Aplysia}, and the results that we have obtained, are likely to\nprovide insights into the function of other motor systems that encounter\nchanging mechanical loads and hard boundaries, both due to mechanical and\nneuronal firing properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 13:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

To achieve this, we formalize a general framework distinguishing\nbetween three degrees of quarrelling (weak, strong, cataclysmic), symmetric vs.\nasymmetrical quarrels, and reciprocal vs. non-reciprocal quarrels, and which\nthereby yields twelve conceptions of quarrelling, which encompasses the two\nconceptions proposed by Felsenthal and Machover and by Laruelle and Valenciano,\nrespectively.

In contrast, we prove\nthat the symmetric, weak conception of quarrelling identified by our framework\n-- whether reciprocal or not -- is fit to serve as the basis for a reasonable\nquarrel postulate. Furthermore, the classic Shapley-Shubik index and\nPenrose-Banzhaf measure both satisfy the quarrel postulate based on a symmetric\nweak quarrel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 13:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

We show, first, that several basic results on the\nweaker notion remain valid for the stronger notion (and the corresponding\nmodification of the proofs requires only little extra-effort). Second, it is\ndemonstrated that the stronger notion has applications in the area of Teaching.\nSpecifically, we present an infinite family of concept classes all of which can\nbe taught with a single example in the No-Clash model of teaching while, in\norder to teach a class $\\cC$ of this family in the recursive model of teaching,\norder of $\\log|\\cC|$ many examples are required.

In this paper, we propose periodical\nperturbations (prune and regrow) of DNN weights, especially at the\nself-supervised pre-training stage of deep autoencoders. The proposed weight\nperturbation strategy outperforms dropout learning in four out of six tabular\ndata sets in downstream classification tasks.

So far, it has only been\napplied to rather small molecules, and in the commonly implemented diagonal\napproximations to the electronic self-energy it depends on a mean-field\nstarting point. We describe here an implementation of the self-consistent and\nstarting-point independent quasiparticle self-consistent (qs$GW$)-BSE approach\nwhich is suitable for calculations on large molecules. We herein show that\neigenvalue-only self-consistency leads to an unfaithful description of certain\nexcitonic states for Chlorophyll dimers while the qs$GW$-BSE vertical\nexcitation energies (VEE) are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic\nexperiments for Chlorophyll monomers and dimers measured in the gas phase. On\nthe other hand, VEEs from time-dependent density functional theory calculations\ntend to disagree with experimental values and using different range-separated\nhybrid (RSH) kernels changes the VEEs by up to 0.5 eV. We use the new\nqs$GW$-BSE implementation to calculate the lowest excitation energies of the\nsix chromophores of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) with nearly\n2000 correlated electrons.

In agreement with previous TD-DFT calculations using RSH kernels\non models that do also not include environment effects, our qs$GW$-BSE\ncalculations only yield states with local character in the low-energy spectrum\nof the hexameric complex. Earlier work with RSH kernels has demonstrated that\nthe protein environment facilitates the experimentally observed\ninterchromophoric charge transfer.

Our\nwork reveals that, in contrast to steady shear flows, in which small\norientational fluctuations from a flow-aligned state initiate tumbling and\ndeformations, the periodic flow reversal allows the filament to explore many\ndifferent configurations at the beginning of each cycle. Investigation of\nfilament motion during half time periods of oscillation highlights the critical\nrole of the initial filament orientation on the emergent dynamics. This strong\ncoupling between orientation and deformation results in new deformation regimes\nand novel higher-order buckling modes absent in steady shear flows.

It would be a tremendous success if we can precisely\ndiagnose breast cancer by breast ultrasound images (BUS). Many learning-based\ncomputer-aided diagnostic methods have been proposed to achieve breast cancer\ndiagnosis/lesion classification. However, most of them require a pre-define ROI\nand then classify the lesion inside the ROI. Conventional classification\nbackbones, such as VGG16 and ResNet50, can achieve promising classification\nresults with no ROI requirement. But these models lack interpretability, thus\nrestricting their use in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a novel\nROI-free model for breast cancer diagnosis in ultrasound images with\ninterpretable feature representations. We leverage the anatomical prior\nknowledge that malignant and benign tumors have different spatial relationships\nbetween different tissue layers, and propose a HoVer-Transformer to formulate\nthis prior knowledge. The proposed HoVer-Trans block extracts the inter- and\nintra-layer spatial information horizontally and vertically. We conduct and\nrelease an open dataset GDPH&SYSUCC for breast cancer diagnosis in BUS. The\nproposed model is evaluated in three datasets by comparing with four CNN-based\nmodels and two vision transformer models via five-fold cross validation. It\nachieves state-of-the-art classification performance with the best model\ninterpretability. In the meanwhile, our proposed model outperforms two senior\nsonographers on the breast cancer diagnosis when only one BUS image is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 14:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 05:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

At clinical x-ray\nenergies the scattering of photons causes signal noise and is utilized solely\nfor transmission measurements. However, scatter - particularly Compton scatter,\nis characterizable. In this work we hypothesized that modern radiation sources\nand detectors paired with deep learning techniques can use scattered photon\ninformation constructively to resolve superimposed attenuators in planar x-ray\nimaging. METHODS: We simulated a monoenergetic x-ray imaging system consisting\nof a pencil beam x-ray source directed at an imaging target positioned in front\nof a high spatial- and energy-resolution detector array. The signal was\nanalyzed by a convolutional neural network, and a description of scattering\nmaterial along the axis of the beam was derived. The system was virtually\ndesigned/tested using Monte Carlo processing of simple phantoms consisting of\n10 pseudo-randomly stacked air/bone/water materials, and the network was\ntrained by solving a classification problem. RESULTS: The average accuracy of\nthe material identification along the beam was 0.91 +- 0.01, with slightly\nhigher accuracy towards the entrance/exit peripheral surfaces of the object.\nThe average sensitivity and specificity was 0.91 and 0.95, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work provides proof of principle that deep learning techniques\ncan be used to analyze scattered photon patterns which can constructively\ncontribute to the information content in radiography, here used to infer depth\ninformation in a traditional 2D planar setup. This principle, and our results,\ndemonstrate that the information in Compton scattered photons may provide a\nbasis for further development.

However, one limitation of\nthese methods is that they require strong supervisory information from massive\nannotated samples for network learning. State-of-the-art semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation networks with consistency training can help to deal with\nthis issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data, which encourages the\nconsistency of model output on data perturbation. Considering that rich\ninformation is also encoded in feature maps, we propose to integrate the\nconsistency of both features and outputs in the end-to-end network training of\nunlabeled samples, enabling to impose additional constraints. Prior\nsemi-supervised semantic segmentation networks have established the cluster\nassumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in the vicinity of low\nsample density. In this work, we observe that for building footprint\ngeneration, the low-density regions are more apparent at the intermediate\nfeature representations within the encoder than the encoder's input or output.\nTherefore, we propose an instruction to assign the perturbation to the\nintermediate feature representations within the encoder, which considers the\nspatial resolution of input remote sensing imagery and the mean size of\nindividual buildings in the study area.

The analysis focuses on the highly\ninhomogeneous region around the tip and the near wake; this region is highly\nconvoluted, strongly three-dimensional, and far from being self-similar. The\nflow separates close to the leading edge creating a large, open recirculation\nzone around the central part of the wing. In the proximity of the tip, the flow\nremains attached but another smaller recirculation zone forms closer to the\ntrailing edge; this zone strongly affects the development of main wing tip\nvortex. The early formation mechanisms of three vortices close to the leading\nedge are elucidated and discussed. More specifically, we analyse the role of\nvortex stretching/compression and tilting, and how it affects the strength of\neach vortex as it approaches the trailing edge. We find that the\nthree-dimensional flow separation at the sharp tip close to the leading edge\nplays an important role on the subsequent vortical flow development on the\nsuction side. The production of turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses\nis also investigated and discussed in conjunction with the identified vortex\npatterns. The detailed analysis of the mechanisms that sustain vorticity and\nturbulent kinetic energy improves our understanding of these highly three\ndimensional, non-equilibrium flows and can lead to better actuation methods to\nmanipulate these flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 15:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

We consider TBox\nabduction in the lightweight description logic EL, where the observation is a\nconcept inclusion and the background knowledge is a TBox, i.e., a set of\nconcept inclusions. To avoid useless answers, such problems usually come with\nfurther restrictions on the solution space and/or minimality criteria that help\nsort the chaff from the grain. We argue that existing minimality notions are\ninsufficient, and introduce connection minimality. This criterion follows\nOccam's razor by rejecting hypotheses that use concept inclusions unrelated to\nthe problem at hand. We show how to compute a special class of\nconnection-minimal hypotheses in a sound and complete way.

We\nbegin here by summarizing these unique RQM features, with a focus on those that\nsuggest altered insights into the nature of the randomness exhibited in QM\nphenomena. One of these RQM features is the assumption that all objects in the\nuniverse are quantum objects, regardless of their material complexity. And, the\ninteraction of any two objects can result in new relational quantum states of\neach of the objects with the other as reference. But such new states do not\nreplace relational states corresponding to previous interactions with other\nreference objects. In particular, such earlier relational states that include a\nvariable considered to be random do not collapse to define a determined value\nof the variable, but instead simply take on that specific value in the state\nrelative to the new reference. The concept of randomness associated with\nquantum state variables in RQM thus differs from that in other QM\ninterpretations. Rather than take the usual pedantic approach of elaborate\nside-by-side comparisons between the RQM and other common QM interpretations,\nwe illustrate these differences by describing in some detail the well-known\n\"dual-slit\" experiment in terms of RQM concepts, pointing out the important\nadvantages over other interpretations along the way. Of course, we suggest no\nchange in dual-slit experiment results, but believe that the interpretative\nmodifications are helpful and profound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 14:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

We\nresolve this issue by introducing a novel mechanism of conserving energy at\ntemporal metasurfaces in a non-linear setting. The idea is first demonstrated\nby considering a wave-packet propagating in a discrete medium of 1-d chain of\nsprings and masses, where using our energy conserving mechanism we show that\nthe spring stiffness can be incremented at several time interfaces and the\nenergy will still be conserved. We then consider an interesting application of\ntime-reversed imaging in 1-d and 2-d spring-mass systems with a wave packet\ntraveling in the homogenized regime. Our numerical simulations show that, in\n1-d, when the wave packet hits the time-interface two sets of waves are\ngenerated, one traveling forward in time and the other traveling backward. The\ntime-reversed waves re-converge at the location of the source and we observe\nits regeneration. In 2-d, we use more complicated initial shapes and, even\nthen, we observe regeneration of the original image or source. Thus, we achieve\ntime-reversed imaging with conservation of energy in a non-linear system. The\nenergy conserving mechanism can be easily extended to continuum media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 15:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 03:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

To overcome the\nproblem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high\ndimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration\noperations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of\nhomomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and\nmultiplication of large matrices.

Most of the proposed approaches\nstart with various NLP steps that analyze requirements statements, extract\ntheir linguistic information, and convert them to easy-to-process\nrepresentations, such as lists of features or embedding-based vector\nrepresentations. These NLP-based representations are usually used at a later\nstage as inputs for machine learning techniques or rule-based methods. Thus,\nrequirements representations play a major role in determining the accuracy of\ndifferent approaches. In this paper, we conducted a survey in the form of a\nsystematic literature mapping (classification) to find out (1) what are the\nrepresentations used in RE tasks literature, (2) what is the main focus of\nthese works, (3) what are the main research directions in this domain, and (4)\nwhat are the gaps and potential future directions. After compiling an initial\npool of 2,227 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, we\nobtained a final pool containing 104 relevant papers. Our survey shows that the\nresearch direction has changed from the use of lexical and syntactic features\nto the use of advanced embedding techniques, especially in the last two years.\nUsing advanced embedding representations has proved its effectiveness in most\nRE tasks (such as requirement analysis, extracting requirements from reviews\nand forums, and semantic-level quality tasks). However, representations that\nare based on lexical and syntactic features are still more appropriate for\nother RE tasks (such as modeling and syntax-level quality tasks) since they\nprovide the required information for the rules and regular expressions used\nwhen handling these tasks. In addition, we identify four gaps in the existing\nliterature, why they matter, and how future research can begin to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 02:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of\npeople with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such\nethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem\nwhen it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based\non ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants' ethnicity. In\nprinciple, the GDPR bans the use of certain 'special categories of data'\n(sometimes called 'sensitive data'), which include data on ethnicity, religion,\nand sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission\nincludes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories\nof data for auditing their AI systems.

It is well-known that\nthe surface orientation of a Zn metal anode is vital to the reversibility of a\nZn metal battery. Herein, the (101)-oriented thin Zn metal anode (down to 2\n{\\mu}m) is electrodeposited on a Cu surface by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nelectrolyte additive in ZnSO4 aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscope\n(SEM) observation indicates the formation of flat terrace-like compact\n(101)-oriented surfaces. Insitu optical observation confirms that the\n(101)-oriented surfaces can be reversibly plated and stripped. DFT calculations\nreveal two mechanisms for the nucleation and growth of the Zn-(101) surface:\n(1) formation of Zn(101)//Cu(001) could lower the interface energy as compared\nto Zn(002)//Cu(001); (2) large reconstruction of the Zn (101) surface with DMSO\nand H2O absorption.
