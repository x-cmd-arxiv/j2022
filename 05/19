However, the relationship\nbetween mapping accuracy of built-up surfaces and morphological characteristics\nof built-up areas has not been analyzed explicitly, and previous studies\ntypically rely on aggregated landscape metrics to quantify the morphology of\nbuilt-up areas, neglecting the fine-grained spatial variation and scale\ndependency of such metrics. Herein, we aim to fill this gap by assessing the\nassociations between focal landscape metrics, derived from binary built-up\nsurfaces, and focal data accuracy estimates. We test our approach for built-up\nsurfaces from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for Massachusetts (USA),\nby examining the explanatory power of landscape metrics for predictive modeling\nof commission and omission errors in the GHS-BUILT R2018A data product. We find\nthat the Landscape Shape Index (LSI) exhibits the highest levels of correlation\nto focal accuracy measures. These relationships are scale-dependent, and\nincrease with the level of spatial support. Our results are consistent across\ndifferent regions within the U.S., and we find that the Recall measure has the\nstrongest relationship to measures of built-up surface morphology across\ndifferent temporal epochs and spatial resolutions. Regression analysis results\n(R2>0.9) indicate that it is possible to estimate commission errors in the GHSL\nin the absence of reference data, and that omission errors in the GHSL can be\nmodeled without accessing the data themselves. Lastly, we test the\ngeneralizability of our predictive accuracy models to a different version of\nthe GHSL (i.e., the GHS-BUILT-S2) covering a study area in North Carolina. We\nfind varying levels of model transferability that increases with the spatial\nsupport at which landscape metrics and accuracy estimates are calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

However, from the security perspective, VLCs suffer from\nall known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and\nintegrity attacks). For this reason, security researchers are proposing\ninnovative Physical Layer Security (PLS) solutions to protect such\ncommunication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective Intelligent\nSurface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated\nin recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the\nliterature still lacks analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of\nRIS-based VLC communication. In this paper, we combine watermarking and jamming\nprimitives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec)\nalgorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution\nleverages RIS technology to improve the security properties of the\ncommunication. By using an optimization framework, we can calculate RIS phases\nto maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over a predefined area in\nthe room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution\nimproves the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption\nabout the adversary's location. We validate through numerical evaluations the\npositive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase the secrecy capacity of the\nlegitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario.

This success is\nlargely attributed to the GP's analytical tractability, robustness,\nnon-parametric structure, and natural inclusion of uncertainty quantification.\nUnfortunately, the use of exact GPs is prohibitively expensive for large\ndatasets due to their unfavorable numerical complexity of $O(N^3)$ in\ncomputation and $O(N^2)$ in storage. All existing methods addressing this issue\nutilize some form of approximation -- usually considering subsets of the full\ndataset or finding representative pseudo-points that render the covariance\nmatrix well-structured and sparse. These approximate methods can lead to\ninaccuracies in function approximations and often limit the user's flexibility\nin designing expressive kernels. Instead of inducing sparsity via data-point\ngeometry and structure, we propose to take advantage of naturally-occurring\nsparsity by allowing the kernel to discover -- instead of induce -- sparse\nstructure. The premise of this paper is that GPs, in their most native form,\nare often naturally sparse, but commonly-used kernels do not allow us to\nexploit this sparsity. The core concept of exact, and at the same time sparse\nGPs relies on kernel definitions that provide enough flexibility to learn and\nencode not only non-zero but also zero covariances. This principle of\nultra-flexible, compactly-supported, and non-stationary kernels, combined with\nHPC and constrained optimization, lets us scale exact GPs well beyond 5 million\ndata points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 16:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

A more attainable target is the\n\"excess deaths\", the number of deaths in a particular period, relative to that\nexpected during \"normal times\", and we estimate this for all countries on a\nmonthly time scale for 2020 and 2021. The excess mortality requires two\nnumbers, the total deaths and the expected deaths, but the former is\nunavailable for many countries, and so modeling is required for these\ncountries. The expected deaths are based on historic data and we develop a\nmodel for producing expected estimates for all countries and we allow for\nuncertainty in the modeled expected numbers when calculating the excess. We\ndescribe the methods that were developed to produce the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) excess death estimates. To achieve both interpretability and\ntransparency we developed a relatively simple overdispersed Poisson count\nframework, within which the various data types can be modeled.

A principal component analysis was\nperformed in G,GB,GR,J,H,K multi-colour space for the second catalog. The\nsubspace constituted by the two first components was split into cells in which\nwe estimated deviations from the reference.

For both the combination of two of the investigated\nenhancements, deflation and polynomial preconditioning, yield significant\nimprovements in the regime of small mass parameters. In the clover-improved\nWilson case we observe a significantly improved insensitivity of the solver to\nconditioning, and for twisted mass we are able to get rid of a somewhat\nartificial increase of the twisted mass parameter on the coarsest level used so\nfar to make the coarsest level solves converge more rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 17:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 09:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 13:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Tucana B has a half-light\nradius of 80$\\pm$40 pc, and an absolute magnitude of\n$M_V$=$-$6.9$^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ mag ($L_V$=$(5^{+4}_{-2})\\times$10$^4$\n$L_{\\odot}$), which is again comparable to the Milky Way's ultra-faint\nsatellites.

The second consists in analyzing the\nrelativistic fluid equations at large or small speed of light, after choosing\nan adapted gauge, ADM-Zermelo for the former and Papapetrou-Randers for the\nlatter. Unsurprisingly, the results agree, but the second approach is superior\nas it effortlessly captures more elaborate situations with multiple degrees of\nfreedom. It furthermore allows to investigate the fate of hydrodynamic-frame\ninvariance in the two limits at hand, and conclude that its breaking (in the\nGalilean) or its preservation (in the Carrollian) are fragile consequences of\nthe behaviour of transport attributes at large or small $c$.

To facilitate the use of DERs, the aggregated flexibility in a\ndistribution grid is commonly represented on a $PQ$-plane displaying the\nfeasible active and reactive power exchange with the upstream grid. This paper\nproposes a fast feasible operating region mapping mechanism that utilizes a\nlinear power flow approximation in combination with linearized generator,\ncurrent, and voltage constraints to construct a high-dimensional polyhedral\nfeasible set of DER power injections. The obtained polytope is projected onto\nthe $PQ$-plane using Fourier-Motzkin Elimination to represent the aggregate\nnetwork flexibility. Additionally, uncertainty in DER generation is addressed\nusing chance-constraints. Our analysis of a modified 33-bus IEEE test system\ndemonstrates that the proposed method obtains more accurate approximations than\nformer geometric methods and is ten times faster than the tested\noptimization-based method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 18:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

The learning rates increase at various paces\nduring the first training iterations, until they all reach the same value. From\nthis point on, the neural model is trained as usual.

A basic problem that lies at the core of many questions in this setting\nis the following: given a set of pairs of rational weights and matrices {(w_1 ,\nA_1 ), . . . , (w_m , A_m )}, we ask if the weighted sum of powers of these\nmatrices is eventually non-negative P (resp. n positive), i.e., does there\nexist an integer N s.t for all n greater than N , (w_1 A_1^n + ... + w_m A_m^n)\nis atmost 0 (resp. greater than 0). The restricted setting when m = w_1 = 1,\nresults in so-called eventually non-negative (or eventually positive) matrices,\nwhich enjoy nice spectral properties and have been well-studied in control\ntheory. More applications arise in varied contexts, ranging from program\nverification to partially observable and multi-modal systems.\n  Our goal is to investigate this problem and its link to linear recurrence\nsequences. Our first result is that for m at least 2, the problem is as hard as\nthe ultimate positivity of linear recurrences, a long standing open question\n(known to be coNP-hard). Our second result is a reduction in the other\ndirection showing that for any m at least 1, the problem reduces to ultimate\npositivity of linear recurrences. This shows precise upper bounds for several\nsubclasses of matrices by exploiting known results on linear recurrence\nsequences. Our third main result is a novel reduction technique for a large\nclass of problems (including those mentioned above) over rational\ndiagonalizable matrices to the corresponding problem over simple real-algebraic\nmatrices.

As an example, we choose a multiphase pipe flow process for\nwhich we constructed a three-phase steady state model based on the drift-flux\napproach which can be used for modeling of pipe and well flow behavior in oil\nand gas production systems with or without the neural network tuning. In the\nsimulation results, we show how uncertainty estimates of the resulting hybrid\nmodels can be used to make better operation decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 20:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

To be more specific, we analyze Lotka-Volterra type dynamics\nand concentration-dispersion dynamics. Lotka-Volterra equations describe the\npopulation dynamics of a group of species. Under the assumption that the\ninteraction between species is symmetric, we present two different methods to\nderive the convergence result.

While the m-geodesic\ncorresponds to the posterior mean of the multinomial counts using a conjugate\nprior, the e-geodesic corresponds to an alternative parametrization of the\nposterior where prior and data contributions are weighted by geometric rather\nthan arithmetic means. To optimize the exponential shrinkage parameter, we use\nmean-squared error as a cost function on the tangent space. This is just the\nexpected squared Aitchison distance from the true parameter. We derive an\nanalytic solution for its minimum based on the delta method and test it via\nsimulations. We also discuss exponential shrinkage as an alternative to zero\nimputation for dimension reduction and data normalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 21:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 10:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, there can be many different ways to do this,\nthus raising the problem of ``$G$-invariant neural architecture design'': What\nis the optimal $G$-invariant architecture for a given problem? Before we can\nconsider the optimization problem itself, we must understand the search space,\nthe architectures in it, and how they relate to one another. In this paper, we\ntake a first step towards this goal; we prove a theorem that gives a\nclassification of all $G$-invariant single-hidden-layer or ``shallow'' neural\nnetwork ($G$-SNN) architectures with ReLU activation for any finite orthogonal\ngroup $G$, and we prove a second theorem that characterizes the inclusion maps\nor ``network morphisms'' between the architectures that can be leveraged during\nneural architecture search (NAS). The proof is based on a correspondence of\nevery $G$-SNN to a signed permutation representation of $G$ acting on the\nhidden neurons; the classification is equivalently given in terms of the first\ncohomology classes of $G$, thus admitting a topological interpretation. The\n$G$-SNN architectures corresponding to nontrivial cohomology classes have, to\nour knowledge, never been explicitly identified in the literature previously.\nUsing a code implementation, we enumerate the $G$-SNN architectures for some\nexample groups $G$ and visualize their structure.

We\nthus argue that GPU accounting for throughput-oriented infrastructures should\nbe expressed in GPU core hours, much like it is normally done for the CPUs.\nWhile GPU core compute throughput does change between GPU generations, the\nvariability is similar to what we expect to see among CPU cores. To validate\nour position, we present an extensive set of run time measurements of two\nIceCube photon propagation workflows on 14 GPU models, using both on-prem and\nCloud resources. The measurements also outline the influence of GPU sharing at\nboth HTCondor and Kubernetes infrastructure level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 22:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

However, one of the main conventional\nfull-waveform optimization problems challenges is cycle-skipping, usually\nleading us to an inaccurate local minimum model. A highly investigated track to\nalleviate this challenge involves designing a more global measure of misfit\nbetween the observed and modelled data beyond the sample-to-sample comparison.\nHowever, most of these approaches admit relatively smooth inversion results.\nHere, we introduce a novel misfit function based on the Fourier-based metric.\nThis metric has been successfully applied in molecular physics for solving the\nBoltzmann equation, and we adapt it to full-waveform inversion. This misfit\nfunction exploits the power spectrum information between the modelled and\nobserved data to provide low-wavenumber velocity model updates early, and more\nhigh resolution updates as we approach the solution. Thus, it also can be\nreformulated as a weighted $\\ell_{2}$-norm in a quadratic case, which can be\nseen as a simple extension for conventional full-waveform inversion. Thus,\ndespite its robustness to cycle skipping, it is capable of delivering\nhigh-resolution models synonymous to conventional FWI. Considering its\nfrequency domain utilization, we refer to this inversion method as\n$\\omega$-FWI. Through the synthetic Marmousi model example, this method\nsuccessfully recovers an accurate velocity model, starting from a linearly\nincreasing model even for the case of noisy observed data and the lack of low\nfrequencies below 3 Hz and 5Hz, in which the conventional $\\ell_{2}$-norm\nfull-waveform inversion suffers from cycle skipping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 22:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Traditionally, engineers\nsearch and organize structural condition-related information based on visual\ninspections. Even following the same qualitative inspection standards,\nexperienced engineers tend to find the critical defects and predict the\nunderlying reasons more reliably than less experienced ones. Unique bridge and\nsite conditions, quality of available data, and personal skills and knowledge\ncollectively influence such a subjective nature of data-driven bridge\ndiagnosis. Unfortunately, the lack of detailed data about how experienced\nengineers observe bridge defects and identify failure modes makes it hard to\ncomprehend what engineers' behaviors form the best practice of producing\nreliable bridge inspection. Besides, even experienced engineers could sometimes\nfail to notice critical defects, thereby producing inconsistent, conflicting\ncondition assessments. Therefore, a detailed cognitive behavior analysis of\nbridge inspectors is critical for enabling a proactive inspector coaching\nsystem that uses inspectors' behavior histories to complement personal\nlimitations. This paper presents a computational framework for revealing\nengineers' observation and cognitive-behavioral processes to identify bridge\ndefects and produce diagnosis conclusions. The authors designed a bridge\ninspection game consisting of FEM simulation data and inspection reports to\ncapture and analyze experienced and inexperienced engineers' diagnosis\nbehaviors. Mining these behavioral logs have revealed reusable behavioral\nprocess patterns that map critical bridge defects and diagnosis conclusions.\nThe results indicate that the proposed method can proactively share inspection\nexperiences and improve inspection processes' explainability and reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 00:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Moreover, the equation holds no matter in ideal or noisy environments.\nConsidering the number of qubits is limited in the recent noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, some exact numerical calculation\nexperiments are presented for different database sizes N with different types\nof noises. The results show that the complementary between the success\nprobability and the coherence almost always hold. This work provides a new\nperspective to improve the success probability by manipulating its\ncomplementary coherence, and vice versa. It has an excellent potential for\nhelping quantum algorithms design in the NISQ era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 01:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

One method for improving the\nclassification performance of machine learning models is normalization, such as\nz-score.

The effectiveness of this normalization method was confirmed by\nconducting a single-joint movement experiment of the elbow and predicting its\nrest, flexion, and extension movements from the EMG signal. The proposed\nnormalization method achieved a mean accuracy of 64.6%, an improvement of 15.0%\ncompared to the non-normalization case (mean of 49.8%).

In\neach round of model training, the PS first broadcasts the global model to the\nterminal devices in an analog fashion, and then the terminal devices perform\nlocal training and upload the updated model parameters to the PS via\nover-the-air computation (AirComp). First, we propose an AirComp-based adaptive\nreweighing scheme for the aggregation of local updated models, where the model\naggregation weights are directly determined by the uplink transmit power values\nof the selected devices and which enables the joint learning and communication\noptimization simply by the device selection and power control. Furthermore, we\nprovide a convergence analysis for the proposed wireless FL algorithm and the\nupper bound on the expected optimality gap between the expected and optimal\nglobal loss values is derived. With instantaneous channel state information\n(CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problems under both the\nindividual and sum uplink transmit power constraints, respectively, which are\nshown to be solved by the semidefinite programming (SDR) technique.

Standard clock\nsynchronization techniques such as the network time protocol (NTP) are limited\nto millisecond accuracy, and hence cannot be used.\n  We propose a profiling technique that relates the time-stamp counters (TSCs)\nof nodes to measure the duration of events in a streaming framework. The\nprecision of the TSC relation determines the accuracy of the measured duration.\nThe TSC relation is conducted in quiescent periods of the network to achieve\naccuracy in the tens of microseconds. We propose a throughput-controlled data\ngenerator to reliably determine the sustainable throughput of a streaming\nengine. To facilitate high-throughput data ingestion, we propose a concurrent\nobject factory that moves the deserialization overhead of incoming data tuples\noff the critical path of the streaming framework. The evaluation of the\nproposed techniques within the Apache Storm streaming framework on the Google\nCompute Engine public cloud shows that data ingestion increases from $700$\n$\\text{k}$ to $4.68$ $\\text{M}$ tuples per second, and that time durations can\nbe profiled at a measurement accuracy of $92$ $\\mu\\text{s}$, which is three\norders of magnitude higher than the accuracy of NTP, and one order of magnitude\nhigher than prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 05:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

The repeated\ncomputation of partial derivative terms in the PINN loss functions via\nautomatic differentiation during training is known to be computationally\nexpensive, especially for higher-order derivatives. DT-PINNs are trained by\nreplacing these exact spatial derivatives with high-order accurate numerical\ndiscretizations computed using meshless radial basis function-finite\ndifferences (RBF-FD) and applied via sparse-matrix vector multiplication. The\nuse of RBF-FD allows for DT-PINNs to be trained even on point cloud samples\nplaced on irregular domain geometries. Additionally, though traditional PINNs\n(vanilla-PINNs) are typically stored and trained in 32-bit floating-point\n(fp32) on the GPU, we show that for DT-PINNs, using fp64 on the GPU leads to\nsignificantly faster training times than fp32 vanilla-PINNs with comparable\naccuracy.

Previous single image inverse rendering methods usually\nentangle scene lighting and geometry and only support applications like object\ninsertion. Instead, by combining parametric 3D lighting estimation with neural\nscene rendering, we demonstrate the first automatic method to achieve full\nscene relighting, including light source insertion, removal, and replacement,\nfrom a single image. All source code and data will be publicly released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 06:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The present study aims at providing a deeper insight into the power and\nlimitation of an unsupervised classification algorithm (called Fisher-EM) on\nspectra of galaxies. This algorithm uses a Gaussian mixture in a discriminative\nlatent subspace. To this end, we investigate the capacity of this algorithm to\nsegregate the physical parameters used to generate mock spectra and the\ninfluence of the noise on the classification. Methods. With the code CIGALE and\ndifferent values for nine input parameters characterising the stellar\npopulation, we have simulated a sample of 11 475 optical spectra of galaxies\ncontaining 496 monochromatic fluxes. The statistical model and the optimum\nnumber of clusters is given in Fisher-EM by the integrated completed likelihood\n(ICL) criterion. We repeated the analyses several times to assess the\nrobustness of the results. Results. Two distinct classifications can be\ndistinguished in the case of the noiseless spectra. The one above 13 clusters\ndisappears when noise is added, while the classification with 12 clusters is\nvery robust against noise down to a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 3. At SNR=1,\nthe optimum is 5 clusters, but the classification is still compatible with the\nprevious one. The distribution of the parameters used for the simulation shows\nan excellent discrimination between classes. A higher dispersion both in the\nspectra within each class and in the parameter distribution, leads us to\nconclude that despite a much higher ICL, the classification with more than 13\nclusters in the noiseless case is not physically relevant. Conclusions. This\nstudy yields two conclusions valid at least for the Fisher-EM algorithm.\nFirstly, the unsupervised classification of spectra of galaxies is both\nreliable and robust to noise. Secondly, such analyses are able to extract the\nuseful physical information contained in the spectra and to build highly\nmeaningful classifications. In an epoch of data-driven astrophysics, it is\nimportant to trust unsupervised machine learning approaches that do not require\ntraining samples which are unavoidably biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 06:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Due to the single-pass\ntraining setting, online continual learning is very challenging, but it is\ncloser to the real-world scenarios where quick adaptation to new data is\nappealing. In this paper, we focus on online class-incremental learning setting\nin which new classes emerge over time. Almost all existing methods are\nreplay-based with a softmax classifier. However, the inherent logits bias\nproblem in the softmax classifier is a main cause of catastrophic forgetting\nwhile existing solutions are not applicable for online settings. To bypass this\nproblem, we abandon the softmax classifier and propose a novel generative\nframework based on the feature space. In our framework, a generative classifier\nwhich utilizes replay memory is used for inference, and the training objective\nis a pair-based metric learning loss which is proven theoretically to optimize\nthe feature space in a generative way. In order to improve the ability to learn\nnew data, we further propose a hybrid of generative and discriminative loss to\ntrain the model. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including newly\nintroduced task-free datasets, show that our method beats a series of\nstate-of-the-art replay-based methods with discriminative classifiers, and\nreduces catastrophic forgetting consistently with a remarkable margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 06:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

To compare\n$Sigma$ with existing metrics, we further propose a boundary projection method\nfrom imperfect hypotheses to the true reference.

In this paper, we offer a pattern analysis-based\ndetection approach to serve as a warning system for the existence of nearby sea\nturtles. We focus on the challenge of overcoming the low signal-to-clutter\nratio (SCR) caused by reverberations. Assuming that, due to low SCR, target\nreflections within the point cloud are received in groups, our detector\nsearches for patterns through clustering to identify possible 'blobs' in the\npoint cloud of reflections, and to classify them as either clutter or a target.\nOur unsupervised clustering is based on geometrical and spectral constraints\nover the blob's member relations. In turn, the classification of identified\nblobs as either a target or clutter is based on features extracted from the\nreflection pattern. To this end, assuming reflections from a sea turtle are\nstable but include spectral diversity due to distortions within the turtles\nbody, we quantify the stability of the blob's members and their spectral\nentropy. We test our detector in both modeled simulations, and at sea, for the\ndetection of sea turtles released after rehabilitation.

While traditional control methods such as\nMPC are capable of generating an optimal control sequence at the edge of the\nvehicles physical controllability, these methods are sensitive to the accuracy\nof the modeling parameters. This paper presents TC-Driver, a RL approach for\nrobust control in autonomous racing. In particular, the TC-Driver agent is\nconditioned by a trajectory generated by any arbitrary traditional high-level\nplanner. The proposed TC-Driver addresses the tire parameter modeling\ninaccuracies by exploiting the heuristic nature of RL while leveraging the\nreliability of traditional planning methods in a hierarchical control\nstructure. We train the agent under varying tire conditions, allowing it to\ngeneralize to different model parameters, aiming to increase the racing\ncapabilities of the system in practice. The proposed RL method outperforms a\nnon-learning-based MPC with a 2.7 lower crash ratio in a model mismatch\nsetting, underlining robustness to parameter discrepancies. In addition, the\naverage RL inference duration is 0.25 ms compared to the average MPC solving\ntime of 11.5 ms, yielding a nearly 40-fold speedup, allowing for complex\ncontrol deployment in computationally constrained devices. Lastly, we show that\nthe frequently utilized end-to-end RL architecture, as a control policy\ndirectly learned from sensory input, is not well suited to model mismatch\nrobustness nor track generalization. Our realistic simulations show that\nTC-Driver achieves a 6.7 and 3-fold lower crash ratio under model mismatch and\ntrack generalization settings, while simultaneously achieving lower lap times\nthan an end-to-end approach, demonstrating the viability of TC-driver to robust\nautonomous racing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 08:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

There\nhave been various proposals for software application domain classification over\nthe past years. However, these approaches lack a well-defined taxonomy that is\nhierarchical, grounded in a knowledge base, and free of irrelevant terms. This\nwork proposes GitRanking, a framework for creating a classification ranked into\ndiscrete levels based on how general or specific their meaning is. We collected\n121K topics from GitHub and considered $60\\%$ of the most frequent ones for the\nranking. GitRanking 1) uses active sampling to ensure a minimal number of\nrequired annotations; and 2) links each topic to Wikidata, reducing ambiguities\nand improving the reusability of the taxonomy. Our results show that\ndevelopers, when annotating their projects, avoid using terms with a high\ndegree of specificity. This makes the finding and discovery of their projects\nmore challenging for other users. Furthermore, we show that GitRanking can\neffectively rank terms according to their general or specific meaning. This\nranking would be an essential asset for developers to build upon, allowing them\nto complement their annotations with more precise topics. Finally, we show that\nGitRanking is a dynamically extensible method: it can currently accept further\nterms to be ranked with a minimum number of annotations ($\\sim$ 15).

To gain further insight into\nthis question, here we study a simple system of two interacting neutrino beams,\nand obtain the exact phase-space explored by this system using the Husimi\nquasi-probability distribution.

However, two major challenges in\npre-ranking system still exist: (i) without explicitly modeling the performance\ngain versus computation cost, the predefined latency constraint in the\npre-ranking stage inevitably leads to suboptimal solutions; (ii) transferring\nthe ranking teacher's knowledge to a pre-ranking student with a predetermined\nhandcrafted architecture still suffers from the loss of model performance. In\nthis work, a novel framework AutoFAS is proposed which jointly optimizes the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the pre-ranking model: (i) AutoFAS for the\nfirst time simultaneously selects the most valuable features and network\narchitectures using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique; (ii) equipped\nwith ranking model guided reward during NAS procedure, AutoFAS can select the\nbest pre-ranking architecture for a given ranking teacher without any\ncomputation overhead. Experimental results in our real world search system show\nAutoFAS consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\napproaches at a lower computing cost. Notably, our model has been adopted in\nthe pre-ranking module in the search system of Meituan, bringing significant\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 08:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Full order solutions are often obtained through the use of segregated\nsolvers, employing slightly modified conservation laws so that they can be\ndecoupled and then solved one at a time. Classical reduction architectures, on\nthe contrary, rely on the Galerkin projection of a complete Navier-Stokes\nsystem to be projected all at once, causing a mild discrepancy with the high\norder solutions.

This is particularly true for\nthose available in the near term, so called noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) devices. In this Thesis, we develop and study three quantum machine\nlearning applications suitable for NISQ computers, ordered in terms of\nincreasing complexity of data presented to them. These algorithms are\nvariational in nature and use parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) as the\nunderlying quantum machine learning model. The first application area is\nquantum classification using PQCs, where the data is classical feature vectors\nand their corresponding labels. Here, we study the robustness of certain data\nencoding strategies in such models against noise present in a quantum computer.\nThe second area is generative modelling using quantum computers, where we use\nquantum circuit Born machines to learn and sample from complex probability\ndistributions. We discuss and present a framework for quantum advantage for\nsuch models, propose gradient-based training methods and demonstrate these both\nnumerically and on the Rigetti quantum computer up to 28 qubits. For our final\napplication, we propose a variational algorithm in the area of approximate\nquantum cloning, where the data becomes quantum in nature. For the algorithm,\nwe derive differentiable cost functions, prove theoretical guarantees such as\nfaithfulness, and incorporate state of the art methods such as quantum\narchitecture search. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this algorithm is useful\nin discovering novel implementable attacks on quantum cryptographic protocols,\nfocusing on quantum coin flipping and key distribution as examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 09:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Even\nthough Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not\nstrictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into\npartitions. The well-formulated fine-tuning that is needed in order to improve\nan Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this\npaper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given\ntopic.

We aim to reduce the\nresource cost of this process by introducing a weakly-supervised iterative\ngraph-based approach to detect keywords, topics, and themes related to\nmisinformation, with a focus on COVID-19. Our approach can successfully detect\nspecific topics from general misinformation-related seed words in a few seed\ntexts.

In addition to a qualitative\nanalysis of our approach, our quantitative analyses show that BWGS and BMDWGS\nare effective in extracting misinformation-related content compared to common\nbaselines in low data resource settings.

First, we\nhypothesized merged pull requests that have code reviews, code review comments,\nor pull request comments after merging, may have missed bugs after the code\nreview. We considered these merged pull requests as candidate pull requests\nhaving missed bugs. Based on our assumption, we obtained 3,261 candidate pull\nrequests from 77 open-source GitHub projects. After two rounds of restrictive\nmanual analysis, we found 187 bugs missed in 173 pull requests. In the first\nstep, we found 224 buggy pull requests containing missed bugs after merging the\npull requests. Secondly, we defined and finalized a taxonomy that is\nappropriate for the bugs that we found and then found the distribution of bug\ncategories after analysing those pull requests all over again. The categories\nof missed bugs in pull requests and their distributions are: semantic (51.34%),\nbuild (15.5%), analysis checks (9.09%), compatibility (7.49%), concurrency\n(4.28%), configuration (4.28%), GUI (2.14%), API (2.14%), security (2.14%), and\nmemory (1.6%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 09:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

In total, 43 OtI scenarios were measured in\nWest Harlem, New York City, covering seven highly diverse buildings.

Depending on the time\nof occurrence of the Type-IV singularity, three different cases may arise --\nwhen the singularity occurs before the bounce or after the bounce or at the\ninstant of the bounce respectively. However in all of these cases, we find that\nin the case when the singularity \"globally\" affects the spacetime, the scalar\npower spectrum becomes red tilted and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is too large\nto be consistent with the observational data. Based on these findings, we\ninvestigate a different bouncing scenario which also appears with a Type-IV\nsingularity, and the singularity affects the spacetime \"locally\" around the\ntime when it occurs. As a result, and unlike to the previous scenario, the\nperturbation modes in the second bouncing scenario are likely to generate far\naway from the bounce in the deep contracting phase. This finally results to the\nsimultaneous compatibility of the observable quantities with the Planck data,\nand ensures the viability of the bounce model where the Type-IV singularity has\nlocal effects on the spacetime around the time of the singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 10:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 10:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

In this context,\nan important task for theories of switchback formation and evolution is to\nunderstand their observable distinguishing features, allowing them to be\nassessed in detail using spacecraft data. Here, we work towards this goal by\nstudying the influence of the Parker spiral on the evolution of Alfv\\'enic\nswitchbacks in an expanding plasma. Using simple analytic arguments based on\nthe physics of one-dimensional spherically polarized (constant-field-magnitude)\nAlfv\\'en waves, we find that, by controlling the wave's obliquity, a Parker\nspiral strongly impacts switchback properties. Surprisingly, the Parker spiral\ncan significantly enhance switchback formation, despite normalized wave\namplitudes growing more slowly in its presence. In addition, switchbacks become\nstrongly asymmetric: large switchbacks preferentially involve magnetic-field\nrotation in the plane of the Parker spiral (tangential deflections) rather than\nperpendicular (normal) rotations, and such deflections are strongly\n\"tangentially skewed,\" meaning switchbacks always involve field rotations in\nthe same direction (towards the positive-radial direction for an outwards mean\nfield). In a companion paper, we show that these properties also occur in\nturbulent 3-D fields with switchbacks, with various caveats. These results\ndemonstrate that substantial care is needed in assuming that specific features\nof switchbacks can be used to infer properties of the low corona; asymmetries\nand nontrivial correlations can develop as switchbacks propagate due to the\ninterplay between expansion and spherically polarized, divergence-free magnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 10:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 08:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

We perform a\nseries of challenging mesh generation experiments for grids with large\ndeformations, and demonstrate that SAM is able to produce smooth meshes\ncomparable to state-of-the-art solvers, while running approximately 50-100\ntimes faster.

Thus, noise removal is necessary to draw conclusions from these data,\nand it often becomes essential to construct dynamical models using these data.\nWe discuss a methodology to learn differential equation(s) using noisy and\nirregular sampled measurements. In our methodology, the main innovation can be\nseen in the integration of deep neural networks with the neural ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) approach. Precisely, we aim at learning a neural\nnetwork that provides (approximately) an implicit representation of the data\nand an additional neural network that models the vector fields of the dependent\nvariables. We combine these two networks by constraining using neural ODEs. The\nproposed framework to learn a model describing the vector field is highly\neffective under noisy measurements.

However, the measurements of such exotic effects have been limited\nto subtle space- and momentum-resolved techniques, unfortunately hindering\ntheir applications. Here, we theoretically predict macroscopic non-reciprocal\ntransports induced by HSP when coupling another spatially distributed quantity,\nsuch as staggered local moments in a PT-symmetric anti-ferromagnet. By using a\nfour-band model Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that HSP plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the asymmetric bands with respect to opposite momenta. Such band\nasymmetry leads to non-reciprocal nonlinear conductivity, exemplified by\ntetragonal CuMnAs via first-principles calculations. We further provide the\nmaterial design principles for large nonlinear conductivity, including\ntwo-dimensional nature, multiple band crossings near the Fermi level, and\nsymmetry protected HSP. Our work not only reveals direct spintronic\napplications of HSP (such as N\\'eel order detection), but also sheds light on\nfinding observables of other ''hidden effects'', such as hidden optical\npolarization and hidden Berry curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 12:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 07:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

However,\nexisting black-box query attacks show low performance in a novel scenario where\nonly a few queries are allowed. To address this issue, we propose gradient\naligned attacks (GAA), which use the gradient aligned losses (GAL) we designed\non the surrogate model to estimate the accurate gradient to improve the attack\nperformance on the victim model. Specifically, we propose a gradient aligned\nmechanism to ensure that the derivatives of the loss function with respect to\nthe logit vector have the same weight coefficients between the surrogate and\nvictim models. Using this mechanism, we transform the cross-entropy (CE) loss\nand margin loss into gradient aligned forms, i.e. the gradient aligned CE or\nmargin losses. These losses not only improve the attack performance of our\ngradient aligned attacks in the novel scenario but also increase the query\nefficiency of existing black-box query attacks.

To communicate their digit, users press the button with the\nsame color that is assigned to their digit, which can thus be identified by\nelimination after a few iterations. IFTT-PIN uses the same principle but does\nnot pre-assign colors to each button. Instead, users are free to choose which\nbutton to use for each color. The button-to-color mapping only exists in the\nuser's mind and is never directly communicated to the interface. In other\nwords, IFTT-PIN infers both the user's PIN and their preferred button-to-color\nmapping at the same time, a process called self-calibration.

However, the space of possible proteins is too large to\nsearch exhaustively in the laboratory, and functional proteins are scarce in\nthe vast sequence space. Machine learning (ML) approaches can accelerate\ndirected evolution by learning to map protein sequences to functions without\nbuilding a detailed model of the underlying physics, chemistry and biological\npathways. Despite the great potentials held by these ML methods, they encounter\nsevere challenges in identifying the most suitable sequences for a targeted\nfunction. These failures can be attributed to the common practice of adopting a\nhigh-dimensional feature representation for protein sequences and inefficient\nsearch methods.

With the emergence of data markets, an alternative to\nconstructing a dataset in-house is to purchase external data.

We evaluated our approach on ADHD200 dataset and our results\nindicate that the proposed SCAAE method can effectively recover the dynamic\nchanges of the FBNs at each fMRI time step, without using sliding windows.

Inspired by this, we construct an Adversarial\nResponse Characteristics (ARC) feature to reflect the model's gradient\nconsistency around the input to indicate the extent of linearity.

Recent application of deep learning\nmethods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to\naddressing the challenges when reconstructing images with measurement\nundersampling or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid\nsupervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT)\nimage reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity\nor unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to\nsimulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists\nof a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in\nparallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined, and\nmultiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image\nreconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo\nClinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing.

Then, we propose to train a 3D\nDCNN on the combination of expert and pseudo labeled images for binary\nsegmentation of each anatomical structure. The binary segmentation approach is\nproposed to avoid the poor performance of multi-class segmentation methods on\nlimited and imbalanced data. This also allows to employ a lightweight and\nefficient 3D DCNN in terms of the number of filters and reserve memory\nresources for training the binary networks on full-scale and full-resolution 3D\nMRI volumes instead of 2D/3D patches or 2D slices. Thus, the proposed framework\ncan encapsulate the spatial contiguity in each dimension and enhance\ncontext-awareness. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed framework over the baseline method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively without additional labeling cost for manual labeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 14:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Such worries are at the root\nof the Quantum Measurement Problem. We can identify two kinds of worries: 1)\npragmatic: it's unclear how to model our experiments to extract theoretical\npredictions, and 2) realist: there is no realist narrative for the experiment\nunderlying these theoretical predictions. While both worries deserve attention,\nthe pragmatic worries have far worse consequences if left unanswered. Moreover,\nas I will argue, upon reflection, a satisfactory explanation of almost all of\nquantum theory's experimental successes unavoidably involves modeling quantum\nfields at some point. Thus, without a pragmatic theory-to-experiment link for\nQFT, we are at risk of losing any right to claim evidential support for large\nparts of quantum theory. Hence, I focus on the Pragmatic QFT Measurement\nProblem.\n  But, what makes modeling measurements in QFT so hard? As I will discuss,\nattempts to naively transplant our non-relativistic quantum measurement theory\ninto QFT are deeply unphysical and unsatisfying. Thus we need a new (or at\nleast refined) measurement theory for QFT. However, as I will argue, aiming too\ndirectly at a new measurement theory is an incautious way to proceed and is apt\nto lead us astray. This paper proposes an alternate way forward: We ought to\nfirst better understand how our non-relativistic quantum measurement theory is\nrooted in notions of measurement chains and Heisenberg cuts. Then we ought to\ngeneralize these notions and transplant them into QFT. Such a transplant is\ncarried out in this paper. My analysis suggests the need for a pragmatic\nQFT-cut analogous to the need for a pragmatic Heisenberg cut in\nnon-relativistic contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 15:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

We revisit faithfulness in the context of continuous data and\npropose two formal definitions of faithfulness for feature attribution methods.\nQualitative faithfulness demands that scores reflect the true qualitative\neffect (positive vs. negative) of the feature on the model and quanitative\nfaithfulness that the magnitude of scores reflect the true quantitative effect.\nWe discuss under which conditions these requirements can be satisfied to which\nextent (local vs global). As an application of the conceptual idea, we look at\ndifferentiable classifiers over continuous data and characterize\nGradient-scores as follows: every qualitatively faithful feature attribution\nmethod is qualitatively equivalent to Gradient-scores. Furthermore, if an\nattribution method is quantitatively faithful in the sense that changes of the\noutput of the classifier are proportional to the scores of features, then it is\neither equivalent to gradient-scoring or it is based on an inferior\napproximation of the classifier. To illustrate the practical relevance of the\ntheory, we experimentally demonstrate that popular attribution methods can fail\nto give faithful explanations in the setting where the data is continuous and\nthe classifier differentiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 15:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

Therefore, BP-MAC leverages a universal hash function designed for\nthe bitwise preprocessing of integrity protection to later only require a few\nXOR operations during the latency-critical phase.

More unpredictable outliers will be uncovered in\nprinciple with the increment of the coverage and quality of upcoming survey\ndata. However, it is a severe challenge to mine rare and unexpected targets\nfrom enormous data with human inspection due to a significant workload.\nSupervised learning is also unsuitable for this purpose since designing proper\ntraining sets for unanticipated signals is unworkable. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we adopt unsupervised machine learning approaches to identify\noutliers in the data of galaxy images to explore the paths for detecting\nastronomical outliers. For comparison, we construct three methods, which are\nbuilt upon the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE)+\nKNN, and CAE + KNN + Attention Mechanism (attCAE KNN) separately. Testing sets\nare created based on the Galaxy Zoo image data published online to evaluate the\nperformance of the above methods. Results show that attCAE KNN achieves the\nbest recall (78%), which is 53% higher than the classical KNN method and 22%\nhigher than CAE+KNN. The efficiency of attCAE KNN (10 minutes) is also superior\nto KNN (4 hours) and equal to CAE+KNN(10 minutes) for accomplishing the same\ntask. Thus, we believe it is feasible to detect astronomical outliers in the\ndata of galaxy images in an unsupervised manner. Next, we will apply attCAE KNN\nto available survey datasets to assess its applicability and reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 09:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

However, the current DTL techniques suffer from\neither catastrophic forgetting dilemma (losing the previously obtained\nknowledge) or overly biased pre-trained models (harder to adapt to target data)\nin finetuning pre-trained models or freezing a part of the pre-trained model,\nrespectively. Progressive learning, a sub-category of DTL, reduces the effect\nof the overly biased model in the case of freezing earlier layers by adding a\nnew layer to the end of a frozen pre-trained model. Even though it has been\nsuccessful in many cases, it cannot yet handle distant source and target data.\nWe propose a new continual/progressive learning approach for deep transfer\nlearning to tackle these limitations. To avoid both catastrophic forgetting and\noverly biased-model problems, we expand the pre-trained model by expanding\npre-trained layers (adding new nodes to each layer) in the model instead of\nonly adding new layers. Hence the method is named EXPANSE. Our experimental\nresults confirm that we can tackle distant source and target data using this\ntechnique. At the same time, the final model is still valid on the source data,\nachieving a promising deep continual learning approach. Moreover, we offer a\nnew way of training deep learning models inspired by the human education\nsystem.

Although power series solutions are readily obtainable to the governing\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations, we show that -- in both problems --\nthe series diverge due to non-physical complex or negative real-valued\nsingularities. In both cases, these singularities can be moved by expanding in\nexponential gauge functions motivated by their respective large distance\nasymptotic behaviors to enable series convergence over their full semi-infinite\ndomains. For the Sakiadis problem, this not only provides a convergent Taylor\nseries (and conjectured exact) solution to the ODE, but also a means to\nevaluate the wall shear parameter (and other properties) to within any desired\nprecision. Although the nature of nonlinear ODEs precludes general conclusions,\nour results indicate that asymptotic behaviors can be useful when proposing\nvariable transformations to overcome power series divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 14:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 14:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Words remain 'in-situ', hence they\nare always content-addressable. Arbitrary and novel sentences (with novel\nwords) can be created with 'neural blackboards' for words and sentences. Hence,\nthe unlimited productivity of natural language can be achieved with a 'fixed'\nsmall world like network structure. The article focuses on the neural\nblackboard for sentences. The architecture uses only one 'connection matrix'\nfor binding all structural relations between words in sentences. Its ability to\nrepresent arbitrary (English) sentences is discussed in detail, based on a\ncomprehensive analysis of them. The architecture simulates intra-cranial brain\nactivity observed during sentence processing and fMRI observations related to\nsentence complexity and ambiguity. The simulations indicate that the observed\neffects relate to global control over the architecture, not to the sentence\nstructures involved, which predicts higher activity differences related to\ncomplexity and ambiguity with higher comprehension capacity. Other aspects\ndiscussed are the 'intrinsic' sentence structures provided by connection paths\nand their relation to scope and inflection, the use of a dependency parser for\ncontrol of binding, long-distance dependencies and gaps, question answering,\nambiguity resolution based on backward processing without explicit\nbacktracking, garden paths, and performance difficulties related to embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 13:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Studies show\nparticulates emitted while speaking were generally much smaller compared to\ncoughing or sneezing. However, recent investigations revealed that they are\nlarge enough to carry respiratory contagions. Although studies have shown that\nparticulate emissions do indeed occur during speech, to date, there is little\ninformation about the relative contribution of different speech sounds in\nproducing particle emissions. This study compares airborne aerosol generation\nin participants producing isolated speech sounds: fricative consonants, plosive\nconsonants, and vowel sounds. While participants produced isolated speech\ntasks, a planar beam of laser light, a high-speed camera, and image software\ncalculated the number of particulates detected overtime. This study compares\nairborne aerosols emitted by human participants at a distance of 2.54 cm\nbetween the laser sheet and the mouth and reveals statistically significant\nincreases in particulate counts over ambient dust distribution for all speech\nsounds. Vowel sounds were statistically greater than consonants, suggesting\nthat mouth opening, as opposed to place of vocal tract constriction or manner\nof sound production, might be the primary influence in the degree to which\nparticulates become aerosolized during speech. Results of this research will\ninform boundary conditions for computation models of aerosolized particulates\nduring speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 19:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

At the\nsame time, concern within the population over this strain and the chances of\nbecoming infected has potentially reduced the likelihood of people seeking\nmedical treatment for other health events. Stroke is a medical emergency and\nswift treatment can make a large difference in patient outcomes. Understanding\nhow concern over the COVID-19 pandemic might impact the time delay in seeking\ntreatment after a stroke can be important in understanding both the long term\ncost implications and how to target individuals during another pandemic\nscenario to remind them of the importance of seeking treatment immediately. We\npresent a hybrid agent-based and equation-based model to simulate the delay in\nseeking treatment for stroke due to concerns over COVID-19 and show that even\nsmall changes in behaviour impact the average delay in seeking treatment for\nthe population. This delay could potentially impact the outcomes for stroke\npatients and future healthcare costs to support them.

One of the main characteristics of D2D communication is reuse\nof the frequency resource in order to improve spectral efficiency of the\nsystem. Nevertheless, frequency reuse introduces significantly high\ninterference levels thus necessitating efficient resource allocation algorithms\nthat can enable simultaneous communication sessions through effective channel\nand/or power allocation. This survey paper presents a comprehensive\ninvestigation of the state-of-the-art resource allocation algorithms in D2D\ncommunication underlaying cellular networks. The surveyed algorithms are\nevaluated based on heterogeneous parameters which constitute the elementary\nfeatures of a resource allocation algorithm in D2D paradigm. Additionally, in\norder to familiarize the readers with the basic design of the surveyed resource\nallocation algorithms, brief description of the mode of operation of each\nalgorithm is presented. The surveyed algorithms are divided into four\ncategories based on their technical doctrine i.e., conventional optimization\nbased, Non-Orthogonal-Multiple-Access (NOMA) based, game theory based and\nmachine learning based techniques.

This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single\npoint of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is\ncurrently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things\n(IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason,\nmobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of\nattention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users\nmust perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks\nrequire energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT\nusers' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low\nprocessing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on\ncommodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing.\nTo do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be\ntreated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity\nservers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain\nfunction virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be\nperformed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe\napplications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by\nthe BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages\nof BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy\nconsumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show\nthe performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption,\ntransaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 04:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

The\nreproductive way is sparked by the bee swarm and the collaborative\ndecision-making of FDO. As opposed to the honey bee or artificial bee colony\nalgorithms, this algorithm has no connection to them. In FDO, the search\nagent's position is updated using speed or velocity, but it's done differently.\nIt creates weights based on the fitness function value of the problem, which\nassists lead the agents through the exploration and exploitation processes.\nOther algorithms are evaluated and compared to FDO as Genetic Algorithm (GA)\nand Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the original work. The key current\nalgorithms:The Salp-Swarm Algorithms (SSA), Dragonfly Algorithm (DA), and Whale\nOptimization Algorithm (WOA) have been evaluated against FDO in terms of their\nresults. Using these FDO experimental findings, we may conclude that FDO\noutperforms the other techniques stated. There are two primary goals for this\nchapter: first, the implementation of FDO will be shown step-by-step so that\nreaders can better comprehend the algorithm method and apply FDO to solve\nreal-world applications quickly. The second issue deals with how to tweak the\nFDO settings to make the meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm better in the\nIoT health service system at evaluating big quantities of information.\nUltimately, the target of this chapter's enhancement is to adapt the IoT\nhealthcare framework based on FDO to spawn effective IoT healthcare\napplications for reasoning out real-world optimization, aggregation,\nprediction, segmentation, and other technological problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 16:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}
