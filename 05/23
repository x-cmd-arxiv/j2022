We show that the kernel matrix of this system is in\ngeneral ill-conditioned, so that it can not be solved for the discretized\ndensity using a naive approach.

Specifically, the challenge comes from the\ngap between ground-view and satellite-view, which includes not only large\nviewpoint changes (some parts of the landmark may be invisible from front view\nto top view) but also highly irrelevant background (the target landmark tend to\nbe hidden in other surrounding buildings), making it difficult to learn a\ncommon representation or a suitable mapping.\n  To address this issue, we take advantage of drone-view information as a\nbridge between ground-view and satellite-view domains. We propose a Peer\nLearning and Cross Diffusion (PLCD) framework. PLCD consists of three parts: 1)\na peer learning across ground-view and drone-view to find visible parts to\nbenefit ground-drone cross-view representation learning; 2) a patch-based\nnetwork for satellite-drone cross-view representation learning; 3) a cross\ndiffusion between ground-drone space and satellite-drone space.

In this work we\npropose a machine learning approach to alleviate this problem in the context of\nthe matrices used in the study of large-scale structure. With only a small\namount of data (matrices built with samples of 50-200 halo power spectra) we\nare able to provide significantly improved matrices, which are almost\nindistinguishable from the ones built from much larger samples (thousands of\nspectra). In order to perform this task we trained convolutional neural\nnetworks to denoise the matrices, using in the training process a data set made\nup entirely of spectra extracted from simple, inexpensive halo simulations\n(mocks). We then show that the method not only removes the noise in the\nmatrices of the cheap simulation, but it is also able to successfully denoise\nthe matrices of halo power spectra from N-body simulations. We compare the\ndenoised to the other matrices using several metrics, and in all of them they\nscore better, without any signs of spurious artifacts. With the help of the\nWishart distribution we derive an analytical extrapolation for the effective\nsample augmentation allowed by the denoiser. Finally, we show that, by using\nthe denoised matrices, the cosmological parameters can be recovered with nearly\nthe same accuracy as when using matrices built with a sample of 30,000 spectra\nin the case of the cheap simulations, and with 15,000 spectra in the case of\nthe N-body simulations.

While one of the key principles of GEC is to keep the correct parts\nunchanged and avoid over-correction, previous sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)\nmodels generate results from scratch, which are not guaranteed to follow the\noriginal sentence structure and may suffer from the over-correction problem. In\nthe meantime, the recently proposed sequence tagging models can overcome the\nover-correction problem by only generating edit operations, but are conditioned\non human designed language-specific tagging labels. In this paper, we combine\nthe pros and alleviate the cons of both models by proposing a novel\nSequence-to-Action~(S2A) module. The S2A module jointly takes the source and\ntarget sentences as input, and is able to automatically generate a token-level\naction sequence before predicting each token, where each action is generated\nfrom three choices named SKIP, COPY and GENerate. Then the actions are fused\nwith the basic seq2seq framework to provide final predictions.

Nonetheless,\nimplementing large-scale screening programmes is usually not viable, since the\npopulation at-risk is large and the analysis must be performed by expert\nclinicians. Also, the diagnosis of AMD is considered to be particularly\ndifficult, as it is characterized by many different lesions that, in many\ncases, resemble those of other macular diseases. To overcome these issues,\nseveral works have proposed automatic methods for the detection of AMD in\nretinography images, the most widely used modality for the screening of the\ndisease.

The main message is that an intelligent agent should invest more\non the actions that are beneficial for the future unseen contexts while the\nconditional IDS can be myopic.

However, random drifts in decision variables can corrupt this\ninference by mimicking the signatures of systematic updates. Hence, identifying\nthe trial-by-trial evolution of decision variables requires methods that can\nrobustly account for such drifts. Recent studies (Lak'20, Mendon\\c{c}a'20) have\nmade important advances in this direction, by proposing a convenient method to\ncorrect for the influence of slow drifts in decision criterion, a key decision\nvariable.

A common strategy for monitoring brain activity is to place sensors\non a nearly uniform grid, or sensor array, around the head. By increasing the\ntotal number of sensors, higher spatial-frequency components of brain activity\ncan be resolved as dictated by Nyquist sampling theory. Currently, there are\nfew principled mathematical architectures for sensor placement aside from\nNyquist considerations. However, global brain activity often exhibits\nlow-dimensional patterns of spatio-temporal dynamics. The low-dimensional\nglobal patterns can be computed from the singular value decomposition and can\nbe leveraged to select a small number of sensors optimized for reconstructing\nbrain signals and localizing brain sources.

The idea of\n\"adaptive base class boost\" (ABC-Boost) in ICML'09, adopted a computationally\nexpensive \"exhaustive search\" strategy for the base class at each iteration.

In this paper, we run several one-dimensional gas and dust\nsimulations to make predictions on the time-evolution of disc sizes \\textit{in\nthe dust} and to assess whether they can be used to understand how discs\nevolve. We show that viscous and magnetic wind models have very different dust\ndisc radii. In particular, MHD wind models are compact and their sizes either\nremain constant or decrease with time.

In this paper, we fill this gap by focusing on explanations for\na specific interpretable model, namely pattern-based logistic regression (PLR)\nfor binary text classification. We do so because, albeit interpretable, PLR is\nchallenging when it comes to explanations. In particular, we found that a\nstandard way to extract explanations from this model does not consider\nrelations among the features, making the explanations hardly plausible to\nhumans. Hence, we propose AXPLR, a novel explanation method using (forms of)\ncomputational argumentation to generate explanations (for outputs computed by\nPLR) which unearth model agreements and disagreements among the features.\nSpecifically, we use computational argumentation as follows: we see features\n(patterns) in PLR as arguments in a form of quantified bipolar argumentation\nframeworks (QBAFs) and extract attacks and supports between arguments based on\nspecificity of the arguments; we understand logistic regression as a gradual\nsemantics for these QBAFs, used to determine the arguments' dialectic strength;\nand we study standard properties of gradual semantics for QBAFs in the context\nof our argumentative re-interpretation of PLR, sanctioning its suitability for\nexplanatory purposes. We then show how to extract intuitive explanations (for\noutputs computed by PLR) from the constructed QBAFs. Finally, we conduct an\nempirical evaluation and two experiments in the context of human-AI\ncollaboration to demonstrate the advantages of our resulting AXPLR method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 21:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

This paper\nproposes two gradient based decentralized optimization algorithms that can\nprotect participating agents' privacy without compromising optimization\naccuracy or incurring heavy communication/computational overhead. This is in\ndistinct difference from differential privacy based approaches which have to\ntrade optimization accuracy for privacy, or encryption based approaches which\nincur heavy communication and computational overhead. Both algorithms leverage\na judiciously designed mixing matrix and time-varying uncoordinated stepsizes\nto enable privacy, one using diminishing stepsizes while the other using\nnon-diminishing stepsizes. In both algorithms, when interacting with any one of\nits neighbors, a participating agent only needs to share one message in each\niteration to reach convergence to an exact optimal solution, which is in\ncontrast to most gradient-tracking based algorithms requiring every agent to\nshare two messages (an optimization variable and an auxiliary gradient-tracking\nvariable) under non-diminishing stepsizes. Furthermore, both algorithms can\nguarantee the privacy of a participating agent even when all information shared\nby the agent are accessible to an adversary, a scenario in which most existing\naccuracy-maintaining privacy approaches will fail to protect privacy.\nSimulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 21:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 01:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 00:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The new\ninstrumentation includes a wide-field, 3.2-deg diameter prime-focus corrector\nthat focuses the light onto 5020 robotic fiber positioners on the 0.812 m\ndiameter, aspheric focal surface. The positioners and their fibers are divided\namong ten wedge-shaped petals. Each petal is connected to one of ten\nspectrographs via a contiguous, high-efficiency, nearly 50 m fiber cable\nbundle. The ten spectrographs each use a pair of dichroics to split the light\ninto three channels that together record the light from 360 - 980 nm with a\nresolution of 2000 to 5000. We describe the science requirements, technical\nrequirements on the instrumentation, and management of the project.

These solutions are powerful tools\nwith promising results; however, surprisingly they were never put together in a\nunified model to analyze complex multivariate time-series data. A very recent\nmodeling approach, called the direct discriminative decoder (DDD) model,\nproposes a principal solution to combine SMM and DNN models, with promising\nresults in decoding underlying latent processes, e.g. rat movement trajectory,\nthrough high-dimensional neural recordings. The DDD consists of a) a state\ntransition process, as per the classical dynamical models, and b) a\ndiscriminative process, like DNN, in which the conditional distribution of\nstates is defined as a function of the current observations and their recent\nhistory. Despite promising results of the DDD model, no training solutions, in\nthe context of DNN, have been utilized for this model. Here, we propose how DNN\nparameters along with an optimal history term can be simultaneously estimated\nas a part of the DDD model. We use the D4 abbreviation for a DDD with a DNN as\nits discriminative process. We showed the D4 decoding performance in both\nsimulation and (relatively) high-dimensional neural data. In both datasets, D4\nperformance surpasses the state-of-art decoding solutions, including those of\nSSM and DNNs. The key success of DDD and potentially D4 is efficient\nutilization of the recent history of observation along with the state-process\nthat carries long-term information, which is not addressed in either SSM or DNN\nsolutions.

We posit that\nif there is a malicious or unintentional breach of security policies of a\ndevice, it will be reflected in the form of anomalies in the traditional\ndesign, verification and testing activities throughout the lifecycle. With\nthat, a digital simulacrum of a device's lifecycle, called a digital twin (DT),\ncan be formed by the data gathered from different stages to secure the\nlifecycle of the device. In this paper, we put forward a realization of\nintertwined relationships of security vulnerabilities with data available from\nthe silicon lifecycle and formulate different components of an AI driven DT\nframework. The proposed DT framework leverages these relationships and\nrelational learning to achieve Forward and Backward Trust Analysis\nfunctionalities enabling security aware management of the entire lifecycle.\nFinally, we provide potential future research avenues and challenges for\nrealization of the digital twin framework to enable secure semiconductor\nlifecycle management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 23:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 18:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

While filedata can be\nencrypted, the revealed file activities can leak secrets. To hide the file\nactivities from the filesystem and its OS, we propose Enigma, a deception-based\ndefense injecting sybil file activities as the cover of the actual file\nactivities.\n  Enigma contributes three new designs. (1) To make the deception credible, the\nTEE generates sybil calls by replaying file calls from the TEE code under\nprotection. (2) To make sybil activities cheap, the TEE requests the OS to run\nK filesystem images simultaneously. Concealing the disk, the TEE backs only one\nimage with the actual disk while backing other images by only storing their\nmetadata. (3) To protect filesystem image identities, the TEE shuffles the\nimages frequently, preventing the OS from observing any image for long.\n  Enigma works with unmodified filesystems shipped withLinux. On a low-cost Arm\nSoC with EXT4 and F2FS, our system can concurrently run as many as 50\nfilesystem images with 1% of disk overhead per additional image. Compared to\ncommon obfuscation for hiding addresses in a flat space, Enigma hides file\nactivities with richer semantics.

The ligament is stretched in the flow direction by the\nshearing of airflow. Furthermore, as the influence of the shear flow increases,\nthe ligament becomes deformed into a liquid sheet, and a perforation forms at\nthe center of the liquid sheet. The liquid sheet breaks up due to the growth of\nthe perforation and contracts under the influence of surface tension, forming\ntwo ligaments with diameters smaller than that of the original ligament. The\nshearing of the airflow causes the original ligament to elongate, and the\ncross-section of the ligament becomes elliptical, which increases instability.\nAs a result, the growth rate of the ligament exceeds the theoretical value, and\nincreases with increasing wavenumber of the initial disturbance. Therefore, the\ndiameter of the formed droplets in shear flow decreases due to the increase in\nthe wavenumber that governs the breakup of the ligament, and because the growth\nrate increases, the breakup time for the ligament decreases. As the velocity\ndifference of the shear flow increases, constrictions of the ligament form\nearlier and the diameter of the satellite droplet increases.

While\nthere are a number of available machine learning algorithms for detecting\nanomalies, analysts are frequently asked to take additional steps in reasoning\nabout the root cause of the anomalies and form actionable hypotheses that can\nbe communicated to business stakeholders. Without the appropriate tools, this\nreasoning process is time-consuming, tedious, and potentially error-prone. In\nthis paper we present PIXAL, a visual analytics system developed following an\niterative design process with professional analysts responsible for anomaly\ndetection. PIXAL is designed to fill gaps in existing tools commonly used by\nanalysts to reason with and make sense of anomalies. PIXAL consists of three\ncomponents: (1) an algorithm that finds patterns by aggregating multiple\nanomalous data points using first-order predicates, (2) a visualization tool\nthat allows the analyst to build trust in the algorithmically-generated\npredicates by performing comparative and counterfactual analyses, and (3) a\nvisualization tool that helps the analyst generate and validate hypotheses by\nexploring which features in the data most explain the anomalies. Finally, we\npresent the results of a qualitative observational study with professional\nanalysts. These results of the study indicate that PIXAL facilitates the\nanomaly reasoning process, allowing analysts to make sense of anomalies and\ngenerate hypotheses that are meaningful and actionable to business\nstakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 02:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

While most research focuses on how to accurately retain\nappropriate weights while maintaining the performance of the compressed model,\nthere are challenges in the computational overhead and memory footprint of\nsparse training when compressing large-scale language models. To address this\nproblem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to\nreduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in\ndownstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven\ncriteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then\nwe investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and\nderive two obvious characteristics i.e., low-rankness and structuredness. Based\non that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven\nimportance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score\nmatrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and\nparameter-efficient. Experiments with diverse networks (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa and\nGPT-2) on dozens of datasets demonstrate PST performs on par or better than\nprevious sparsity methods, despite only training a small number of parameters.\nFor instance, compared with previous sparsity methods, our PST only requires\n1.5% trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance on BERT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 02:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

However, automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nerrors are inevitable in real-world applications due to the environment noise,\nunique speech patterns and etc, leading to sharp performance drop in\nstate-of-the-art text-based intent detection models. Essentially, this\nphenomenon is caused by the semantic drift brought by ASR errors and most\nexisting works tend to focus on designing new model structures to reduce its\nimpact, which is at the expense of versatility and flexibility. Different from\nprevious one-piece model, in this paper, we propose a novel and agile framework\ncalled CR-ID for ASR error robust intent detection with two plug-and-play\nmodules, namely semantic drift calibration module (SDCM) and phonemic\nrefinement module (PRM), which are both model-agnostic and thus could be easily\nintegrated to any existing intent detection models without modifying their\nstructures.

When demonstrations are generated by sub-optimal\npolicies or have sparse state-action pairs, policy learned from sub-optimal\ndemonstrations may mislead an agent with incorrect or non-local action\ndecisions. We propose a new method called Local Ensemble and Reparameterization\nwith Split and Merge of expert policies (LEARN-SAM) to improve efficiency and\nmake better use of the sub-optimal demonstrations. First, LEARN-SAM employs a\nnew concept, the lambda-function, based on a discrepancy measure between the\ncurrent state to demonstrated states to \"localize\" the weights of the expert\npolicies during learning. Second, LEARN-SAM employs a split-and-merge (SAM)\nmechanism by separating the helpful parts in each expert demonstration and\nregrouping them into new expert policies to use the demonstrations selectively.\nBoth the lambda-function and SAM mechanism help boost the learning speed.\nTheoretically, we prove the invariant property of reparameterized policy before\nand after the SAM mechanism, providing theoretical guarantees for the\nconvergence of the employed policy gradient method. We demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the LEARN-SAM method and its robustness with varying\ndemonstration quality and sparsity in six experiments on complex continuous\ncontrol problems of low to high dimensions, compared to existing methods on RL\nfrom demonstration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 03:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

In order to address this, we propose\nVector-quantized Input-contextualized Prompts (VIP) as an extension to the soft\nprompt tuning framework.

On various language understanding tasks like SuperGLUE,\nQA, Relation classification, NER and NLI, VIP outperforms the soft prompt\ntuning (PT) baseline by an average margin of 1.19%.

In this case, the flexibility time window of each vehicle admits a\nunified representation, under which the synchronization of departure time is\nequivalent to the management of time-window overlapping. Based on this\nobservation, a time-window-overlapping induced mixed-integer linear program\nformulation has been established which is equivalent to the continuous-time\nformulation established in the previous work. By imposing an adaptive\ntime-discretization procedure, we can further reformulate the time coordination\nproblem using a vehicle-to-time-bucket assignment induced mixed-integer linear\nprogram.

An ideal way to take\nfull advantage of these two training modes is to switch between them upon the\ncluster status.

In experiments, we show that our methods successfully capture the\ncomplex belief states that enable multi-modal predictions as well as high\nquality reconstructions, and results on challenging visual-motor control tasks\nshow that our method achieves superior performance and sample efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 05:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Existing models can be divided into region-based active\ncontour models and edge-based active contour models. However, both models use\ndirect image data to achieve segmentation and face many challenging problems in\nterms of the initial contour position, noise sensitivity, local minima and\ninefficiency owing to the in-homogeneity of image intensities. The saliency map\nof an image changes the image representation, making it more visual and\nmeaningful. In this study, we propose a novel model that uses the advantages of\na saliency map with local image information (LIF) and overcomes the drawbacks\nof previous models. The proposed model is driven by a saliency map of an image\nand the local image information to enhance the progress of the active contour\nmodels. In this model, the saliency map of an image is first computed to find\nthe saliency driven local fitting energy. Then, the saliency-driven local\nfitting energy is combined with the LIF model, resulting in a final novel\nenergy functional. This final energy functional is formulated through a level\nset formulation, and regulation terms are added to evolve the contour more\nprecisely across the object boundaries. The quality of the proposed method was\nverified on different synthetic images, real images and publicly available\ndatasets, including medical images. The image segmentation results, and\nquantitative comparisons confirmed the contour initialization independence,\nnoise insensitivity, and superior segmentation accuracy of the proposed model\nin comparison to the other segmentation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 06:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

The peer-to-peer (P2P) mode of WET brings\nimproved flexibility to the charging process among the devices as they can\nmaintain their mobility while replenishing their battery. Few existing works in\nP2P-WET unrealistically assume the nodes to be exchanging energy at every\nopportunity with any other node. Also, energy exchange between the nodes is not\nbounded by the energy transfer limit in that inter-node meeting duration. In\nthis regard, the parametric heterogeneity (in terms of device's battery\ncapacity and WET hardware) among the nodes also affects the energy transfer\nbound in each P2P interaction, and thus, may lead to unbalanced network energy\ndistributions. This inherent heterogeneity aspect has not been adequately\ncovered in the P2P-WET literature so far, especially from the point of view of\nmaintaining a balanced energy distribution in the networked population. In this\nwork, we present a Heterogeneity-aware Wireless Energy Transfer (HetWET)\nmethod. In contrast to the existing literature, we devise a fine-grained model\nof wireless energy transfer while considering the parametric heterogeneity of\nthe participating devices. Thereafter, we enable the nodes to explore and\ndynamically decide the peers for energy exchange. The performance of HetWET is\nevaluated using extensive simulations with varying heterogeneity settings. The\nevaluation results demonstrate that HetWET can maintain lower energy losses and\nachieve more balanced energy variation distance compared to three different\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 06:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Specifically, we\nintroduce a so-called knowledge delegator, which is capable of transferring\nknowledge from the trained model to a randomly re-initialized new model by\ngenerating informative samples. Given the previous model only, the delegator is\neffectively learned using a self-distillation mechanism in a data-free manner.\nThe knowledge extracted by the delegator is then utilized to maintain the\nperformance of the model on old tasks in incremental learning. This simple\nincremental learning framework surpasses existing exemplar-free methods by a\nlarge margin on four widely used class incremental benchmarks, namely\nCIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, Caltech-101 and Flowers-102. Notably, we achieve\ncomparable performance to some exemplar-based methods without accessing any\nexemplars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 06:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

However, when the models are over-specified, namely, the chosen\nnumber of components to fit the data is larger than the unknown true number of\ncomponents, EM needs a polynomial number of iterations in terms of the sample\nsize to reach the final statistical radius; this is computationally expensive\nin practice. The slow convergence of EM is due to the missing of the locally\nstrong convexity with respect to the location parameter on the negative\npopulation log-likelihood function, i.e., the limit of the negative sample\nlog-likelihood function when the sample size goes to infinity. To efficiently\nexplore the curvature of the negative log-likelihood functions, by specifically\nconsidering two-component location-scale Gaussian mixtures, we develop the\nExponential Location Update (ELU) algorithm. The idea of the ELU algorithm is\nthat we first obtain the exact optimal solution for the scale parameter and\nthen perform an exponential step-size gradient descent for the location\nparameter. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the ELU iterates\nconverge to the final statistical radius of the models after a logarithmic\nnumber of iterations.

A crucial issue in this method\nis that from a biological point of view, reasonable cost values for an\nevent-based parsimonious reconciliation are not easily chosen. Different\napproaches have been developed to infer such cost values for a given pair of\nhost and symbiont trees. However, a major limitation of these approaches is\ntheir inability to model the invasion of different host species by a same\nsymbiont species (referred to as a spread event), which is thought to happen in\nsymbiotic relations. To mention one example, the same species of insects may\npollinate different species of plants. This results in multiple associations\nobserved between the symbionts and their hosts (meaning that a symbiont is no\nlonger specific to a host), that are not compatible with the current methods of\ncoevolution.In this paper, we propose a method, called AmoCoala (a more\nrealistic version of a previous tool called Coala) which for a given pair of\nhost and symbiont trees, estimates the probabilities of the cophylogeny events,\nin presence of spread events, relying on an approximate Bayesian computation\n(ABC) approach. The algorithm that we propose, by including spread events,\nenables the multiple associations to be taken into account in a more accurate\nway, inducing more confidence in the estimated sets of costs and thus in the\nreconciliation of a given pair of host and symbiont trees. Its rooting in the\ntool Coala allows it to estimate the probabilities of the events even in the\ncase of large datasets. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real datasets.\nThe software is available at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/blerinasinaimeri/software/amocoala\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 08:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

In this paper,\nwe explicitly provide exploration and clarify the importance of including\nsemantic information in prompts, while existing prompt methods generate prompts\nwithout exploring the semantic information of textual labels. A challenging\nissue is that manually constructing prompts, with rich semantic information,\nrequires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To this end, we\npropose Causality-pruning Knowledge Prompt (CapKP) for adapting pre-trained\nvision-language models to downstream image recognition. CapKP retrieves an\nontological knowledge graph by treating the textual label as a query to explore\ntask-relevant semantic information. To further refine the derived semantic\ninformation, CapKP introduces causality-pruning by following the first\nprinciple of Granger causality. Empirically, we conduct extensive evaluations\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of CapKP, e.g., with 8 shots, CapKP\noutperforms the manual-prompt method by 12.51% and the learnable-prompt method\nby 1.39% on average, respectively. Experimental analyses prove the superiority\nof CapKP in domain generalization compared to benchmark approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

In our model, requests can either be answered by any server\n(general requests) or by a specific one (specific requests). If only general\nrequests appear, the instance is one of the original $k$-Server Problem, and a\nlower bound for the competitive ratio of $k$ applies.

The Fermi liquid (FL) in $D$ spatial dimensions shows a\nviolation of the area-law in real-space entanglement entropy of a subsystem (of\nlength $L$), $S_{EE} \\sim L^{D-1}\\ln L$, widely believed to be a hallmark\nsignature of the ground state of a gapless quantum critical system of\ninteracting fermions. In this work, we apply a $T=0$ renormalisation group\napproach to a prototype of the FL in momentum (or, $k$)-space, unveiling\nthereby the RG relevant quantum fluctuations (due to forward and tangential\nscattering) from which long-range entanglement arises. A similar analysis of\nnon-Fermi liquids such as the 2D marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) and the 1D\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) reveals a universal logarithmic violation of\nthe area-law in gapless electronic liquids for a subsystem defined within a\n$k$-space window (of size $\\Lambda$) proximate to the Fermi surface, with a\nproportionality constant that depends on the nature of the underlying Fermi\nsurface. We extend this analysis to the gapped quantum liquids emergent from\nthe destabilisation of the Fermi surface by quantum fluctuations arising from\nbackscattering processes. Indeed, we find that the $k$-space entanglement\nsignatures of gapped quantum liquids appear to be governed by the nature of the\nFermi surface (e.g., nested or not) from which they emerge, as well as the\nnature of their parent gapless metallic liquid (e.g., FL, MFL etc.). This is\nconfirmed by our finding an enhanced entanglement entropy for the nodal MFL\npresent at the quantum critical point recently discovered in the 2D Hubbard\nmodel at optimal hole-doping. Our work thus paves the way for an entanglement\nbased classification of quantum liquids emergent from the criticality of\ninteracting fermionic matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 08:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 07:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 10:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

One of the easiest to implement methods to determine the\ntransverse emittance is the phase advance scan method using a focusing element\nand a screen. This method has been shown to work well in the thermal regime. In\nthe space charge dominated laminar flow regime, however, the scheme becomes\ndifficult to apply, because of the lack of a closed description of the beam\nenvelope including space charge effects.

A\ncommonly employed solution for addressing stellar activity is to assume a\nlinear relationship between the RV observations and the activity indicators\nalong the entire time series, and then remove the estimated contribution of\nactivity from the variation in RV data (overall correction method). However,\nsince active regions evolve on the photosphere over time, correlations between\nthe RV observations and the activity indicators will correspondingly be\nanisotropic. We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the\ncorrelations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in\norder to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity. The\nproposed approach uses a general family of statistical breakpoint methods,\noften referred to as change point detection (CPD) algorithms; several\nimplementations of which are available in R and python. A thorough comparison\nis made between the breakpoint-based approach and the overall correction\nmethod. To ensure wide representativity, we use measurements from real stars\nthat have different levels of stellar activity and whose spectra have different\nsignal-to-noise ratios. When the corrections for stellar activity are applied\nseparately to each temporal segment identified by the breakpoint method, the\ncorresponding residuals in the RV time series are typically much smaller than\nthose obtained by the overall correction method. Consequently, the generalized\nLomb-Scargle periodogram contains a smaller number of peaks caused by active\nregions. The CPD algorithm is particularly effective when focusing on active\nstars with long time series, such as alpha Cen B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 08:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 07:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Numerous\nnetwork compression methods such as pruning and quantization are proposed to\nreduce the model size significantly, of which the key is to find suitable\ncompression allocation (e.g., pruning sparsity and quantization codebook) of\neach layer. Existing solutions obtain the compression allocation in an\niterative/manual fashion while finetuning the compressed model, thus suffering\nfrom the efficiency issue. Different from the prior art, we propose a novel\nOne-shot Pruning-Quantization (OPQ) in this paper, which analytically solves\nthe compression allocation with pre-trained weight parameters only.

To this end, we first determine an optimal sampling pattern when the\nnumber of measurements is equal to the sector dimension and then use its\nsubsampled version in the sub-Nyquist regime.

In this paper, we explore the\nspatiotemporal structure of agents' decisions and consider the hierarchy of\ncoordination from the perspective of multilevel emergence dynamics, based on\nwhich a novel approach, Learning to Advise and Learning from Advice (LALA), is\nproposed to improve MARL.

The advisor learns to aggregate decision information in both spatial and\ntemporal domains and generates coordinated decisions by employing a\nspatiotemporal dual graph convolutional neural network with a task-oriented\nobjective function. Each agent learns from the advice via a policy generative\nadversarial learning method where a discriminator distinguishes between the\npolicies of the agent and the advisor and boosts both of them based on its\njudgement.

There is a limited research\non multi-objective optimization for multi-workflow scheduling. Considering\nmulti-workflow scheduling, there is an additional key objective to maintain the\nfairness of workflows using the resources. To address such issues, this paper\nfirst defines a new multi-objective optimization model based on makespan, cost,\nand fairness, and then proposes a global clustering-based multi-workflow\nscheduling strategy for resource allocation. Experimental results show that the\nproposed approach performs better than the compared algorithms without\nsignificant compromise of the overall makespan and cost as well as individual\nfairness, which can guide the simulation workflow scheduling on clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 10:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

In contrast, online methods, which predict task\nruntimes on specific nodes while the workflow is running, have to cope with the\nlack of example runs, especially during the start-up.\n  In this paper, we present Lotaru, a novel online method for locally\nestimating task runtimes in scientific workflows on heterogeneous clusters.\nLotaru first profiles all nodes of a cluster with a set of short-running and\nuniform microbenchmarks. Next, it runs the workflow to be scheduled on the\nuser's local machine with drastically reduced data to determine important task\ncharacteristics. Based on these measurements, Lotaru learns a Bayesian linear\nregression model to predict a task's runtime given the input size and finally\nadjusts the predicted runtime specifically for each task-node pair in the\ncluster based on the micro-benchmark results. Due to its Bayesian approach,\nLotaru can also compute robust uncertainty estimates and provides them as an\ninput for advanced scheduling methods.\n  Our evaluation with five real-world scientific workflows and different\ndatasets shows that Lotaru significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of\nprediction errors for homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 10:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

This means that the\nsymmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we systematically\ndeduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several\ndifferent symmetries. They include the free compact boson theory,\nWess-Zumino-Witten models, and unitary minimal models. When the symmetry of the\nCFT is anomalous, it implies a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type ingappability of the\nsystem. Our results are consistent with, where available, known results in the\nliterature. Moreover, we extend the discussion to other symmetries including\nspin groups and generalized time-reversal symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 10:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Due to\nextreme service environment and load factors, bolts often get loose or even\ndisengaged. To real-time or timely detect the loosed or disengaged bolts is an\nurgent need in practical engineering, which is critical to keep structural\nsafety and service life. In recent years, many bolt loosening detection methods\nusing deep learning and machine learning techniques have been proposed and are\nattracting more and more attention. However, most of these studies use bolt\nimages captured in laboratory for deep leaning model training. The images are\nobtained in a well-controlled light, distance, and view angle conditions. Also,\nthe bolted structures are well designed experimental structures with brand new\nbolts and the bolts are exposed without any shelter nearby. It is noted that in\npractical engineering, the above well controlled lab conditions are not easy\nrealized and the real bolt images often have blur edges, oblique perspective,\npartial occlusion and indistinguishable colors etc., which make the trained\nmodels obtained in laboratory conditions loss their accuracy or fails.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to develop a dataset named NPU-BOLT for\nbolt object detection in natural scene images and open it to researchers for\npublic use and further development. In the first version of the dataset, it\ncontains 337 samples of bolt joints images mainly in the natural environment,\nwith image data sizes ranging from 400*400 to 6000*4000, totaling approximately\n1275 bolt targets. The bolt targets are annotated into four categories named\nblur bolt, bolt head, bolt nut and bolt side.

However, domain adaptation tasks are\nalways addressed in two interactive aspects: domain transfer and the\nenhancement of discrimination, which requires the selected data to be both\nuncertain under the model and diverse in feature space. Contrary to active\nlearning in classification tasks, it is usually challenging to select pixels\nthat contain both the above properties in segmentation tasks, leading to the\ncomplex design of pixel selection strategy. To address such an issue, we\npropose a novel Active Domain Adaptation scheme with Multi-level Contrastive\nUnits (ADA-MCU) for semantic image segmentation. A simple pixel selection\nstrategy followed with the construction of multi-level contrastive units is\nintroduced to optimize the model for both domain adaptation and active\nsupervised learning. In practice, MCUs are constructed from intra-image,\ncross-image, and cross-domain levels by using both labeled and unlabeled\npixels. At each level, we define contrastive losses from center-to-center and\npixel-to-pixel manners, with the aim of jointly aligning the category centers\nand reducing outliers near the decision boundaries. In addition, we also\nintroduce a categories correlation matrix to implicitly describe the\nrelationship between categories, which are used to adjust the weights of the\nlosses for MCUs. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks show\nthat the proposed method achieves competitive performance against\nstate-of-the-art SSDA methods with 50% fewer labeled pixels and significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art with a large margin by using the same level of\nannotation cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 10:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 15:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

In addition to the\nstandard resolvent operator with kinematic viscosity, a resolvent operator\naugmented with the Cess eddy viscosity is considered. Adding eddy viscosity\nsignificantly alters the low-rank behavior of the resolvent. Regardless of the\nwave speed selected, the eddy resolvent is low-rank for spanwise wavelengths of\nly+ = 80 and ly/h = 3.5 in comparison to the standard resolvent whose low-rank\nbehavior depends on the wave speed. The leading eddy modes have higher\nprojections onto the leading mode from spectral proper orthogonal decomposition\nin comparison to standard resolvent modes. Neither analysis, however, reliably\npredicts the most energetic wave speed. The standard resolvent tends to\noverestimate it while the eddy resolvent underestimates it. When the most\nenergetic wave speed is underestimated, the eddy modes are energetic too close\nto the wall. The eddy resolvent does, however, correctly identify the most\nenergetic wave speed and mode shapes for structures associated with the\nnear-wall cycle or that are most energetic at z/h = 0.5. These structures are\nlikely to be correctly predicted for any friction Reynolds number due to the\nscaling of the Cess eddy viscosity profile. Finally, it is shown that the\naccuracy of eddy predictions relies on the right balance between positive and\nnegative energy transfers. Even though eddy viscosity primarily adds\ndissipation, its wall-normal gradient injects energy in the near-wall region,\nresulting in mode shapes that are attached to the wall. For some scales the\npredicted positive energy transfer is too strong thus biasing structures\ntowards the wall. The ability of the Cess eddy viscosity profile to model both\npositive and negative energy transfers suggests that it could be optimized for\nindividual scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 11:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

We examine here the case of V1223 Sgr, an intermediate polar that\nshowed a short outburst in 1984, and compare the outburst characteristics with\nthe predictions of the magnetospheric gating model. We use the archival data\nfrom the AAVSO from which we extract the outburst profiles. We use our code for\ncomputing the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disc truncated by the\nwhite dwarf magnetic field, using a simple description of the interaction\nbetween the disc and the magnetic field, as in D'Antona and Spruit (2010). We\nfind that V1223 Sgr underwent a series of short outbursts, with a rise lasting\nfor typically two to three hours, and a slightly longer decay. When applied to\nintermediate polars, the model by D'Antona and Spruit (2010) accounts well for\nthe observed outburst duration and intensity. We confirm, however, that the\nmodel outcome depends sensitively on the rather poorly constrained model's\nassumptions. We have also searched the AAVSO database for short outbursts in\nother IPs, identifying individual short outbursts in FO Aqr, TV Col, NY Lup and\nEI UMa, but no series as those observed in V1223 Sgr. We also found a\nsuperoutburst, followed by a reflare in CTCV J2056-3014. Although the\nmagnetic-gating accretion instability model is clearly responsible for the\nseries of V1223 Sgr short outbursts and most probably for similar events in\nother intermediate polars, the model describing this process needs improving,\nin particular concerning the interaction of the white-dwarf's magnetic field\nwith the accretion disc. This difficult task might benefit from further\ncomparison of the model outcome with additional observations having good time\ncoverage and time resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 12:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect is widely used to\nexplain dynamical phenomena in varieties of astrophysical systems. The purpose\nof this work is to make clear the dynamical essence of the eccentric ZLK effect\nby constructing an inherent connection between such an effect and dynamics of\nsecular resonance in restricted hierarchical planetary systems. Methods.\nDynamical structures of apsidal resonance are analytically studied by means of\nperturbative treatments. The resonant model is formulated by averaging the\nHamiltonian (up to octupole order) over rotating ZLK cycles, producing an\nadditional motion integral. The phase portraits under the resonant model can be\nused to analyse dynamical structures, including resonant centres, dynamical\nseparatrices and islands of libration. Results. By analysing phase portraits,\nfive branches of libration centres and eight libration zones are found in the\neccentricity--inclination space. There is an excellent agreement between\nanalytical results of libration zone and numerical distributions of resonant\norbit, indicating that the resonant model for apsidal resonances is valid and\napplicable. Additionally, it is found that, in the test-particle limit,\ndistributions of flipping orbits are dominated by those apsidal resonances\ncentred at the inclination of i = 90 deg. Conclusions. The eccentric ZLK effect\nis dynamically equivalent to the effect of apsidal resonance in restricted\nhierarchical planetary systems. The dynamical response of the eccentric ZLK\neffect (or effect of apsidal resonance) is to significantly excite\neccentricities and/or inclinations of test particles in the very long-term\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 12:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In this paper, we analyze challenges\nassociated with treating a language model as an RL policy and show how avoiding\nthose challenges requires moving beyond the RL paradigm. We start by observing\nthat the standard RL approach is flawed as an objective for fine-tuning LMs\nbecause it leads to distribution collapse: turning the LM into a degenerate\ndistribution. Then, we analyze KL-regularised RL, a widely used recipe for\nfine-tuning LMs, which additionally constrains the fine-tuned LM to stay close\nto its original distribution in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We\nshow that KL-regularised RL is equivalent to variational inference:\napproximating a Bayesian posterior which specifies how to update a prior LM to\nconform with evidence provided by the reward function. We argue that this\nBayesian inference view of KL-regularised RL is more insightful than the\ntypically employed RL perspective.

Annotating molecules, however, is\nquite costly because it requires lab experiments conducted by experts. To\nreduce annotation cost, deep Active Learning (AL) methods are developed to\nselect only the most representative and informative data for annotating.\nHowever, existing best deep AL methods are mostly developed for a single type\nof learning task (e.g., single-label classification), and hence may not perform\nwell in molecular property prediction that involves various task types. In this\npaper, we propose a Task-type-generic active learning framework (termed Tyger)\nthat is able to handle different types of learning tasks in a unified manner.\nThe key is to learn a chemically-meaningful embedding space and perform active\nselection fully based on the embeddings, instead of relying on\ntask-type-specific heuristics (e.g., class-wise prediction probability) as done\nin existing works. Specifically, for learning the embedding space, we\ninstantiate a querying module that learns to translate molecule graphs into\ncorresponding SMILES strings. Furthermore, to ensure that samples selected from\nthe space are both representative and informative, we propose to shape the\nembedding space by two learning objectives, one based on domain knowledge and\nthe other leveraging feedback from the task learner (i.e., model that performs\nthe learning task at hand). We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets of different task types. Experimental results show that Tyger\nconsistently achieves high AL performance on molecular property prediction,\noutperforming baselines by a large margin.

For the case of the EHT\nimage of Sgr A$^*$, limits on $\\Delta \\mathcal{C}$ are not available due to the\nsparse interferometric coverage of the 2017 observations, alongside the short\nvariability timescale of Sgr A$^*$ compared to M87$^*$. Concerning this point,\nwe comment on the results of a recent preprint which purports to have derived\nnew limits on extra dimensions using the deviation from circularity of Sgr\nA$^*$'s shadow. The latter is quoted to be $\\lesssim 10\\%$ as with M87$^*$,\nbased on the \"similarity\" of the two shadows: however, this is an incorrect\nassumption, invalidating the subsequent results. In the immediate future, the\nsimplest tests of fundamental physics from Sgr A$^*$'s image will therefore\nmostly have to rely on $r_{\\rm sh}$, whereas additional observables such as the\nphoton ring and azimuthal angle lapse should soon be available and allow for\nnovel tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 13:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

However, above z >~ 6, the neutral intergalactic medium prevents\ndirect observations of LyC. Therefore, recent years have seen the development\nof indirect indicators for LyC that can be calibrated at lower redshifts and\napplied in the Epoch of Reionization. Emission from Mg II \\ly\\ly 2796, 2803\ndoublet has been proposed as a promising LyC proxy. In this paper, we present\nnew Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations for 8 LyC\nemitter candidates, selected to have strong Mg II emission lines. We securely\ndetect LyC emission in 50% (4/8) galaxies with 2$\\sigma$ significance. This\nhigh detection rate suggests that strong Mg II emitters might be more likely to\nleak LyC than similar galaxies without strong Mg II. Using photoionization\nmodels, we constrain the escape fraction of Mg II as ~ 15 -- 60%. We confirm\nthat the escape fraction of Mg II correlates tightly with that of Lyman-alpha\n(LyA), which we interpret as an indication that the escape fraction of both\nspecies is controlled by resonant scattering in the same low column density\ngas. Furthermore, we show that the combination of the Mg II emission and dust\nattenuation can be used to estimate the escape fraction of LyC statistically.\nThese findings confirm that Mg II emission can be adopted to estimate the\nescape fraction of LyA and LyC in local star-forming galaxies and may serve as\na useful indirect indicator at the Epoch of Reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

For these reasons, in this\npaper we propose a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing\napplications, that we call Continual Barlow Twins (CBT). It combines the\nadvantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow\nTwins, with the Elastic Weight Consolidation method to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting.

Until recently, deep active\nlearning methods were ineffectual in the low-budget regime, where only a small\nnumber of examples are annotated. The situation has been alleviated by recent\nadvances in representation and self-supervised learning, which impart the\ngeometry of the data representation with rich information about the points.\nTaking advantage of this progress, we study the problem of subset selection for\nannotation through a \"covering\" lens, proposing ProbCover - a new active\nlearning algorithm for the low budget regime, which seeks to maximize\nProbability Coverage. We then describe a dual way to view the proposed\nformulation, from which one can derive strategies suitable for the high budget\nregime of active learning, related to existing methods like Coreset. We\nconclude with extensive experiments, evaluating ProbCover in the low-budget\nregime. We show that our principled active learning strategy improves the\nstate-of-the-art in the low-budget regime in several image recognition\nbenchmarks.

Nevertheless, it is found that\nmany existing graph learning methods do not work well on data with high\nheterophily level that accounts for a large proportion of edges between\ndifferent class labels. Recent efforts to this problem focus on improving the\nmessage passing mechanism. However, it remains unclear whether heterophily\ntruly does harm to the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). The key is\nto unfold the relationship between a node and its immediate neighbors, e.g.,\nare they heterophilous or homophilious? From this perspective, here we study\nthe role of heterophily in graph representation learning before/after the\nrelationships between connected nodes are disclosed. In particular, we propose\nan end-to-end framework that both learns the type of edges (i.e.,\nheterophilous/homophilious) and leverage edge type information to improve the\nexpressiveness of graph neural networks. We implement this framework in two\ndifferent ways. Specifically, to avoid messages passing through heterophilous\nedges, we can optimize the graph structure to be homophilious by dropping\nheterophilous edges identified by an edge classifier. Alternatively, it is\npossible to exploit the information about the presence of heterophilous\nneighbors for feature learning, so a hybrid message passing approach is devised\nto aggregate homophilious neighbors and diversify heterophilous neighbors based\non edge classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable\nperformance improvement of GNNs with the proposed framework on multiple\ndatasets across the full spectrum of homophily level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 08:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

A\nnew training dataset representing exotic pet animals advertised for sale on the\nweb was generated for this purpose. We trained 24 neural-net models spanning a\ncombination of five different architectures, three methods of training and two\ntypes of datasets.

Models were\nevaluated on both within and out of distribution data to test wider model\napplicability. The top performing models achieved an f-score of over 0.95 on\nwithin distribution evaluation and between 0.75 to 0.87 on the two out of\ndistribution datasets. Notably, feature visualisation indicated that models\nperformed well in detecting the surrounding context (e.g. a cage) in which an\nanimal was located, therefore helping to automatically detect images of animals\nin non-natural environments. The proposed methods can help investigate the\nonline wildlife trade, but can also be adapted to study other types of\npeople-nature interactions from digital platforms.

In particular, we show that given a Strong\nUnique Games instance whose optimal solution $S^*$ is supported on a regular\nlow threshold rank graph, there exists an algorithm that runs in time\nexponential in the threshold rank, and recovers a large satisfiable\nsub-instance whose size is independent on the label set size and maximum degree\nof the graph. Our algorithm combines the techniques of\nBarak-Raghavendra-Steurer (FOCS'11), Guruswami-Sinop (FOCS'11) with several new\nideas and runs in time exponential in the threshold rank of the optimal set. A\nkey component of our algorithm is a new threshold rank based spectral\ndecomposition, which is used to compute a \"large\" induced subgraph of \"small\"\nthreshold rank; our techniques build on the work of Oveis Gharan and Rezaei\n(SODA'17) and could be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Different from traditional radar, the cellular\nstructure of PMNs offers multiple perspectives to sense the same target, but\nthe inherent interference between sensing and communication along with the\njoint processing among distributed sensing nodes (SNs) also cause big\nchallenges for the design of PMNs. In this paper, we first propose a two-stage\nprotocol to tackle the interference between two sub-systems. Specifically, the\nechoes created by communication signals, i.e., interference for sensing, are\nfirst estimated in the clutter estimation (CE) stage and then utilized for\ninterference management in the target sensing (TS) stage. A networked sensing\ndetector is then derived to exploit the perspectives provided by multiple SNs\nfor sensing the same target. The macro-diversity from multiple SNs together\nwith the array gain and the higher angular resolution from multiple receive\nantennas of each SN are investigated to reveal the benefit of networked\nsensing. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient condition to guarantee one SN's\ncontribution is positive, based on which a SN selection algorithm is proposed.\nTo reduce the communication workload, we propose a distributed model-driven\ndeep-learning algorithm that utilizes partially-sampled data for CE. Simulation\nresults confirm the benefits of networked sensing and validate the higher\nefficiency of the proposed CE algorithm than existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 09:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 15:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

However, in practice, the underlying class distribution of unlabeled\nnodes for the given graph is usually imbalanced. This highly imbalanced class\ndistribution inevitably deteriorates the quality of learned node\nrepresentations in GCL. Indeed, we empirically find that most state-of-the-art\nGCL methods cannot obtain discriminative representations and exhibit poor\nperformance on imbalanced node classification. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose a principled GCL framework on Imbalanced node classification\n(ImGCL), which automatically and adaptively balances the representations\nlearned from GCL without labels. Specifically, we first introduce the online\nclustering based progressively balanced sampling (PBS) method with theoretical\nrationale, which balances the training sets based on pseudo-labels obtained\nfrom learned representations in GCL. We then develop the node centrality based\nPBS method to better preserve the intrinsic structure of graphs, by upweighting\nthe important nodes of the given graph. Extensive experiments on multiple\nimbalanced graph datasets and imbalanced settings demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed framework, which significantly improves the performance of the\nrecent state-of-the-art GCL methods. Further experimental ablations and\nanalyses show that the ImGCL framework consistently improves the representation\nquality of nodes in under-represented (tail) classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 06:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

In this way, camouflage acts as a key defence mechanism across\nspecies that is critical to survival. To detect and segment the whole scope of\na camouflaged object, camouflaged object detection (COD) is introduced as a\nbinary segmentation task, with the binary ground truth camouflage map\nindicating the exact regions of the camouflaged objects. In this paper, we\nrevisit this task and argue that the binary segmentation setting fails to fully\nunderstand the concept of camouflage. We find that explicitly modeling the\nconspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can\nnot only lead to a better understanding about camouflage, but also provide\nguidance to designing more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we\nobserve that it is some specific parts of camouflaged objects that make them\ndetectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged\nobjects, we present the first triple-task learning framework to simultaneously\nlocalize, segment, and rank camouflaged objects, indicating the conspicuousness\nlevel of camouflage. As no corresponding datasets exist for either the\nlocalization model or the ranking model, we generate localization maps with an\neye tracker, which are then processed according to the instance level labels to\ngenerate our ranking-based training and testing dataset. We also contribute the\nlargest COD testing set to comprehensively analyse performance of the COD\nmodels.

However, most existing works train the\nsuper-resolution network at a fixed scaling factor, which is not friendly to\nclinical scenes of varying inter-slice spacing in MR scanning. Inspired by the\nrecent progress in implicit neural representation, we propose a Spatial\nAttention-based Implicit Neural Representation (SA-INR) network for arbitrary\nreduction of MR inter-slice spacing. The SA-INR aims to represent an MR image\nas a continuous implicit function of 3D coordinates. In this way, the SA-INR\ncan reconstruct the MR image with arbitrary inter-slice spacing by continuously\nsampling the coordinates in 3D space. In particular, a local-aware spatial\nattention operation is introduced to model nearby voxels and their affinity\nmore accurately in a larger receptive field. Meanwhile, to improve the\ncomputational efficiency, a gradient-guided gating mask is proposed for\napplying the local-aware spatial attention to selected areas only.

CE is one of the most\npreferred mechanisms for allocating a set of items among agents. CE with equal\nincomes (CEEI), Fisher, and Arrow-Debreu (exchange) are the fundamental\neconomic models to study allocation problems, where CEEI is a special case of\nFisher and Fisher is a special case of exchange. When the items are goods\n(giving utility), the CE set is convex even in the exchange model, facilitating\nseveral combinatorial polynomial-time algorithms (starting with the seminal\nwork of Devanur, Papadimitriou, Saberi and Vazirani) for all of these models.\nIn sharp contrast, when the items are chores (giving disutility), the CE set is\nknown to be non-convex and disconnected even in the CEEI model. Further, no\ncombinatorial algorithms or hardness results are known for these models. In\nthis paper, we give two main results for CE with chores:\n  1) A combinatorial algorithm to compute a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximate CEEI\nin time $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^4m^2 / \\varepsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the number\nof agents and $m$ is the number of chores.\n  2) PPAD-hardness of finding a $(1-1/\\mathit{poly}(n))$-approximate CE in the\nexchange model under a sufficient condition. To the best of our knowledge,\nthese results show the first separation between the CEEI and exchange models\nwhen agents have linear preferences, assuming PPAD $\\neq $ P.\n  Finally, we show that our new insight implies a straightforward proof of the\nexistence of an allocation that is both envy-free up to one chore (EF1) and\nPareto optimal (PO) in the discrete setting when agents have factored bivalued\npreferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 14:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Discrete choice models are a key tool for learning\nindividual preferences from such data. Additionally, social factors like\nconformity and contagion influence individual choice. Existing methods for\nincorporating these factors into choice models do not account for the entire\nsocial network and require hand-crafted features. To overcome these\nlimitations, we use graph learning to study choice in networked contexts. We\nidentify three ways in which graph learning techniques can be used for discrete\nchoice: learning chooser representations, regularizing choice model parameters,\nand directly constructing predictions from a network. We design methods in each\ncategory and test them on real-world choice datasets, including county-level\n2016 US election results and Android app installation and usage data.

The model needs to learn\nnewly added capabilities (future tasks) while retaining the old knowledge (past\ntasks). Incremental learning has recently become increasingly appealing for\nthis problem. Task-incremental learning is a kind of incremental learning where\ntask identity of newly included task (a set of classes) remains known during\ninference. A common goal of task-incremental methods is to design a network\nthat can operate on minimal size, maintaining decent performance. To manage the\nstability-plasticity dilemma, different methods utilize replay memory of past\ntasks, specialized hardware, regularization monitoring etc. However, these\nmethods are still less memory efficient in terms of architecture growth or\ninput data costs. In this study, we present a simple yet effective adjustment\nnetwork (SAN) for task incremental learning that achieves near state-of-the-art\nperformance while using minimal architectural size without using memory\ninstances compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

These studies open up the\npossibility of adding constraints on the global mass distribution of the Milky\nWay (MW), and even on the nature of DM itself, with current and upcoming\nstellar surveys reigniting the discussion on response modes in dynamical\nfriction. However, the simulation of such features remains computationally\nchallenging. We used a collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE)+Poisson solver\nbased on an existing method from the literature. We investigated the density\nand velocity response modes in simulations of Galactic-type DM halos accreting\nLMC-sized satellites, including the dependence on the halo density profile. We\nsuccessfully captured both the local wake and the global over- and underdensity\ninduced in the host halo. We also captured the velocity response. In line with\nprevious studies, we find that the code can reproduce the core formation in the\ncuspy profile and the satellite core stalling. The angular power spectrum (APS)\nresponse is shown to be sensitive to each density profile. The cored Plummer\ndensity profile seems the most responsive, displaying a richness of modes. At\nthe end of the simulation, the central halo acquires cylindrical rotation. The\nCBE description makes it tenable to capture the response modes with a better\nhandling of noise in comparison to traditional N-body simulations. Hence, given\na certain noise level, BPM has a lower computational cost than N-body\nsimulations, making it feasible to explore large parameter sets. We anticipate\nthat stellar spheroids in the MW or external galaxies could show central\ncylindrical rotation if they underwent a massive accretion event.

However, controlling them accurately, e.g., when\nparking, is known to be challenging for automatic control methods, including\nmodel predictive control (MPC). Combining results from MPC theory and\nsub-Riemannian geometry in the form of homogeneous nilpotent system\napproximations, this paper proposes a comprehensive, ready-to-apply design\nprocedure for MPC controllers to steer controllable, driftless non-holonomic\nvehicles into given setpoints. It can be ascertained that the resulting\ncontrollers nominally asymptotically stabilize the setpoint for a large-enough\nprediction horizon. The design procedure is exemplarily applied to four\nvehicles, including the kinematic car and a differentially driven mobile robot\nwith up to two trailers. The controllers use a non-quadratic cost function\ntailored to the non-holonomic kinematics. Novelly, for the considered example\nvehicles, it is proven that a quadratic cost employed in an otherwise similar\ncontroller is insufficient to reliably asymptotically stabilize the closed\nloop. Since quadratic costs are the conventional choice in control, this\nhighlights the relevance of the findings. To the knowledge of the authors, it\nis the first time that MPC controllers of the proposed structure are applied to\nnon-holonomic vehicles beyond very simple ones, in particular (partly) on\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 15:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

We relax in particular\nthe so-called determinant condition on the transverse metric, which is only\nassumed to admit a polyhomogeneous radial expansion. This is sufficient in\norder to build the solution space, which here includes a cosmological constant,\ntime-dependent sources in the boundary metric, logarithmic branches, and an\nextra trace mode at subleading order in the transverse metric. The evolution\nequations are studied using the Newman-Penrose formalism in terms of covariant\nfunctionals identified from the Weyl scalars, and we build the explicit\ndictionary between this formalism and the tensorial Einstein equations. This\nprovides in particular a new derivation of the (A)dS mass loss formula. We then\nstudy the holographic renormalisation of the symplectic potential, and the\ntransformation laws under residual asymptotic symmetries. The advantage of the\npartial Bondi gauge is that it allows to contrast and treat in a unified manner\nthe Bondi-Sachs and Newman-Unti gauges, which can each be reached upon imposing\na further specific gauge condition. The differential determinant condition\nleads to the $\\Lambda$-BMSW gauge, while a differential condition on $g_{ur}$\nleads to a generalized Newman-Unti gauge. This latter gives access to a new\nasymptotic symmetry which acts on the asymptotic shear and further extends the\n$\\Lambda$-BMSW group by an extra abelian radial translation. This generalizes\nresults which we have recently obtained in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 15:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

We propose\nInstance-Based Uncertainty estimation for Gradient-boosted regression trees\n(IBUG), a simple method for extending any GBRT point predictor to produce\nprobabilistic predictions. IBUG computes a non-parametric distribution around a\nprediction using the $k$-nearest training instances, where distance is measured\nwith a tree-ensemble kernel. The runtime of IBUG depends on the number of\ntraining examples at each leaf in the ensemble, and can be improved by sampling\ntrees or training instances. Empirically, we find that IBUG achieves similar or\nbetter performance than the previous state-of-the-art across 22 benchmark\nregression datasets. We also find that IBUG can achieve improved probabilistic\nperformance by using different base GBRT models, and can more flexibly model\nthe posterior distribution of a prediction than competing methods. We also find\nthat previous methods suffer from poor probabilistic calibration on some\ndatasets, which can be mitigated using a scalar factor tuned on the validation\ndata.

One of\nthe key challenges in decentralized learning is that the data distribution held\nby each node is statistically heterogeneous. To address this challenge, the\nprimal-dual algorithm called the Edge-Consensus Learning (ECL) was proposed and\nwas experimentally shown to be robust to the heterogeneity of data\ndistributions. However, the convergence rate of the ECL is provided only when\nthe objective function is convex, and has not been shown in a standard machine\nlearning setting where the objective function is non-convex.

In this paper, we revisit various\nSOTA techniques that deal with architecture efficiency (Global Average Pooling,\ndepth-wise convolutions & squeeze and excitation, Blurpool), learning rate\n(Cyclical Learning Rate), data augmentation (Mixup, Cutout), label manipulation\n(label smoothing), weight space manipulation (stochastic weight averaging), and\noptimizer (sharpness aware minimization). We demonstrate how an efficient deep\nconvolution network can be built in a phased manner by sequentially reducing\nthe number of training parameters and using the techniques mentioned above. We\nachieved a SOTA accuracy of 99.2% on MNIST data with just 1500 parameters and\nan accuracy of 86.01% with just over 140K parameters on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 13:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

The absence of\nvolcanic extrusive features along the fan-delta deposit, however, have made the\norigin of these ballast deposits a matter of contention among planetary\nscientists.

In contrast to exisiting KG-GNNs, KQGC focuses on the\nsmoothing, and leverages a simple linear graph convolution for smoothing KGE. A\npre-trained KGE is fed into KQGC, and it is smoothed by aggregating neighbor\nknowledge queries, which allow entity-embeddings to be aligned on appropriate\nvector points for smoothing KGE effectively.
