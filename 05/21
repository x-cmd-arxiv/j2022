Moreover, an expressive virtual agent i.e.\nthat mimics the natural expression of emotions, enhances social interaction\nbetween a user (human) and an agent (intelligent machine). The set of\nnon-verbal behaviors of a virtual character is, therefore, an important\ncomponent in the context of human-machine interaction. Laughter is not just an\naudio signal, but an intrinsic relationship of multimodal non-verbal\ncommunication, in addition to audio, it includes facial expressions and body\nmovements. Motion analysis often relies on a relevant motion capture dataset,\nbut the main issue is that the acquisition of such a dataset is expensive and\ntime-consuming. This work studies the relationship between laughter and body\nmovements in dyadic conversations. The body movements were extracted from\nvideos using deep learning based pose estimator model. We found that, in the\nexplored NDC-ME dataset, a single statistical feature (i.e, the maximum value,\nor the maximum of Fourier transform) of a joint movement weakly correlates with\nlaughter intensity by 30%. However, we did not find a direct correlation\nbetween audio features and body movements. We discuss about the challenges to\nuse such dataset for the audio-driven co-laughter motion synthesis task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

This approach is more\nefficient than other compression-based algorithmic distances, and is\nparticularly suited for the quantitative analysis of visual artifacts, because\nhuman creative processes can be understood as algorithms in the broadest sense.\nUnlike comparable image embedding methods using machine learning, our approach\nis fully explainable through the transformations.

At long times both models\napproach nonequilibrium steady states. In the limit of $N\\to \\infty$, the\nsteady-state particle density in model A has an infinite support, whereas in\nmodel B it has a compact support. A finite system radius, which scales at large\n$N$ as $\\ln N$, appears in model A when $N$ is finite. In both models we study\nstationary fluctuations of the center of mass of the system and of the system's\nradius due to the random character of the Brownian motion and of the resetting\nevents.

The\nvariance of the radius is independent of $N$ in model A and exhibits an unusual\nscaling $(\\ln N)/N$ in model B. The latter scaling is intimately related to the\n$1/f$ noise in the radius autocorrelations.

We produce VLBI images of\nthis core and inner jet region, observed during the past twenty years at 15,\n43, and 86 GHz. We determine the kinematics of the inner jet and ejected\nfeatures at 43 and 86 GHz and compare their ejection times with radio and\n$\\gamma$-ray variability. For the moving jet features, we find an average\nvelocity of $\\beta^\\textrm{avg}_\\textrm{app} = 0.055-0.22$c ($\\mu^\\textrm{avg}\n= 0.04-0.18\\,$mas/yr). From the time-averaged VLBI images at the three\nfrequencies, we measure the transverse jet width along the bulk flow. On the\n$\\leq 1.5$ parsec scale, we find a clear trend of the jet width being frequency\ndependent, with the jet being narrower at higher frequencies. This\nstratification is discussed in the context of a spine-sheath scenario, and is\ncompared to other possible interpretations. From quasi-simultaneous\nobservations at 43 and 86\\,GHz we obtain spectral index maps, revealing a\ntime-variable orientation of the spectral index gradient, due to structural\nvariability of the inner jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 16:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 10:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 09:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

As pretrained language models (PLMs) have\ndemonstrated their effectiveness in obtaining widely generalizable text\nrepresentations, a substantial amount of effort has been made to incorporate\nPLMs into representation learning on text-rich networks. However, few of them\ncan jointly consider heterogeneous structure (network) information as well as\nrich textual semantic information of each node effectively.

Recently it has been pointed out that restricting\nthe attention to pairwise interactions is also a limitation, as the vast\nmajority of complex systems include higher-order interactions that strongly\naffect their dynamics. Here, we propose hyper-diffusion on multiplex networks,\na dynamical process in which diffusion on each single layer is coupled with the\ndiffusion in other layers thanks to the presence of higher-order interactions\noccurring when there exists link overlap. We show that hyper-diffusion on a\nduplex network can be described by the Hyper-Laplacian in which the strength of\nfour-body interactions among every set of four replica nodes connected by a\nmultilink $(1,1)$ can be tuned by a parameter $\\delta_{11}\\ge 0$. The\nHyper-Laplacian reduces to the standard lower Laplacian, capturing pairwise\ninteractions at the two layers, when $\\delta_{11}=0$. By combining tools of\nspectral graph theory, applied topology and network science we provide a\ngeneral understanding of hyper-diffusion on duplex networks when\n$\\delta_{11}>0$, including theoretical bounds on the Fiedler and the largest\neigenvalue of Hyper-Laplacians and the asymptotic expansion of their spectrum\nfor $\\delta_{11}\\ll1$ and $\\delta_{11}\\gg1$.

Instead, we propose that an explanation of the\nsuccess of DL must look at the population of all algorithms in the field and\nhow they have evolved over time. We argue that cultural evolution is a useful\nframework to explain the success of DL. In analogy to biology, we use\n`development' to mean the process converting the pseudocode or text description\nof an algorithm into a fully trained model. This includes writing the\nprogramming code, compiling and running the program, and training the model. If\nall parts of the process don't align well then the resultant model will be\nuseless (if the code runs at all!). This is a constraint. A core component of\nevolutionary developmental biology is the concept of deconstraints -- these are\nmodification to the developmental process that avoid complete failure by\nautomatically accommodating changes in other components. We suggest that many\nimportant innovations in DL, from neural networks themselves to hyperparameter\noptimization and AutoGrad, can be seen as developmental deconstraints. These\ndeconstraints can be very helpful to both the particular algorithm in how it\nhandles challenges in implementation and the overall field of DL in how easy it\nis for new ideas to be generated.

Tabular data consists of rows and columns\ncorresponding to instances and features, respectively. Past studies indicate\nthat traditional classifiers often produce unsatisfactory results in complex\ntabular datasets. Hence, researchers attempt to use the powerful Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNN) for tabular datasets. Recent studies propose several\ntechniques like SuperTML, Conditional GAN (CTGAN), and Tabular Convolution\n(TAC) for applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on tabular data. These\nmodels outperform the traditional classifiers and substantially improve the\nperformance on tabular data. This study introduces a novel technique, namely,\nDynamic Weighted Tabular Method (DWTM), that uses feature weights dynamically\nbased on statistical techniques to apply CNNs on tabular datasets. The method\nassigns weights dynamically to each feature based on their strength of\nassociativity to the class labels. Each data point is converted into images and\nfed to a CNN model. The features are allocated image canvas space based on\ntheir weights. The DWTM is an improvement on the previously mentioned methods\nas it dynamically implements the entire experimental setting rather than using\nthe static configuration provided in the previous methods. Furthermore, it uses\nthe novel idea of using feature weights to create image canvas space. In this\npaper, the DWTM is applied to six benchmarked tabular datasets and it achieves\noutstanding performance (i.e., average accuracy = 95%) on all of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 18:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Ten sets of\nDopplergrams are derived from the bisector of the spectral line corresponding\napproximately to different atmospheric heights, and two sets of Dopplergrams\nare derived using MDI-like algorithm and center-of-gravity method. These data\nare then filtered to keep only acoustic modes, and phase shifts are calculated\nbetween Doppler velocities of different atmospheric heights as a function of\nacoustic frequency. The analysis of the frequency- and height-dependent phase\nshifts shows that for evanescent acoustic waves, oscillations in the higher\natmosphere lead those in the lower atmosphere by an order of 1 s when their\nfrequencies are below about 3.0 mHz, and lags behind by about 1 s when their\nfrequencies are above 3.0 mHz.

These phase shifts in\nthe evanescent waves pose great challenges to the interpretation of some local\nhelioseismic measurements that involve data acquired at different atmospheric\nheights or in regions with systematic vertical flows.

Using the Hessian matrix method across radial\nvelocity channels, we identified the filamentary structures and quantified\ntheir orientations using circular statistics. We found that the regions of the\nMilky Way's disk beyond 10 kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic\ncenter display HI filamentary structures predominantly parallel to the Galactic\nplane. For regions at lower Galactocentric radii, we found that the HI\nfilaments are mostly perpendicular or do not have a preferred orientation with\nrespect to the Galactic plane. We interpret these results as the imprint of\nsupernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic rotation in the outer Milky\nWay. We found that the HI filamentary structures follow the Galactic warp and\nthat they highlight some of the variations interpreted as the effect of the\ngravitational interaction with satellite galaxies. In addition, the mean scale\nheight of the filamentary structures is lower than that sampled by the bulk of\nthe HI emission, thus indicating that the cold and warm atomic hydrogen phases\nhave different scale heights in the outer galaxy.

Understanding how their collective states\nresult from individual activities, such as growth, motion, and interactions, is\na crucial facet of physical and biological studies on bacteria, with\nfar-reaching implications including colonies and biofilms. Dense bacterial\npopulations are expected to show particularly rich emergent phases, which\nhowever remain largely unexplored. A difficulty was to realize a uniform growth\ncondition for dense populations. Here we overcome this by a membrane-based\nmicrofluidic device and report the emergence of glassy states in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) suspension of Escherichia coli. As the number density\nincreases by cell growth, populations of motile bacteria transition to a glassy\nstate, where cells are packed and unable to move. This takes place in two\nsteps, the first one suppressing only the orientational freedom of bacteria,\nand the second one vitrifying the bacteria completely.

However, KNN is very sensitive to the local\ndistribution of the data. Moreover, it also has a high computational cost as it\nrequires storing the whole data in memory and performing multiple distance\ncalculations during inference. Hence, the dependency on the KNN algorithm ends\nup limiting the use of DES techniques for large-scale problems. This paper\npresents a new DES framework based on fuzzy hyperboxes called FH-DES. Each\nhyperbox can represent a group of samples using only two data points (Min and\nMax corners). Thus, the hyperbox-based system will have less computational\ncomplexity than other dynamic selection methods. In addition, despite the\nKNN-based approaches, the fuzzy hyperbox is not sensitive to the local data\ndistribution. Therefore, the local distribution of the samples does not affect\nthe system's performance. Furthermore, in this research, for the first time,\nmisclassified samples are used to estimate the competence of the classifiers,\nwhich has not been observed in previous fusion approaches. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method has high classification accuracy while\nhaving a lower complexity when compared with the state-of-the-art dynamic\nselection methods.

We argue that these types of\nuncertainties can be underestimated with common PDF ensembles in high-stake\nmeasurements at the Large Hadron Collider and Tevatron. A fruitful approach to\nquantify these uncertainties is to view them as arising from sampling of\nallowed PDF solutions in a multidimensional parametric space. This approach\napplies powerful insights gained in recent statistical studies of large-scale\npopulation surveys and quasi-Monte Carlo integration methods. In particular,\nPDF fits may be affected by the big data paradox, which stipulates that more\nexperimental data do not automatically raise the accuracy of PDFs -- close\nattention to the data quality and sampling of possible PDF solutions is as\nessential. To test if the sampling of the PDF uncertainty of an experimental\nobservable is truly representative of all acceptable solutions, we introduce a\ntechnique (``a hopscotch scan'') based on a combination of parameter scans and\nstochastic sampling. With this technique, we show that the PDF uncertainty on\nkey LHC cross sections at 13 TeV obtained with the public NNPDF4.0 fitting code\nis larger than the nominal uncertainty obtained with the published NNPDF4.0\nMonte-Carlo replica sets, when accounting for the likelihood distribution. On\nthe same grounds, the uncertainties on the charm distribution at a large\nmomentum fraction $x$ and gluon PDF at small $x$ are enlarged.

In this paper, we develop a method\ncalled Poisson assisted Smooth Sparse Tensor Decomposition (PoSSTenD), which\nnot only detects when hot-spots occur but also localizes where hot-spots occur.\nThe main idea of our proposed PoSSTenD method is articulated as follows. First,\nwe represent the observed count data as a three-dimensional tensor including\n(1) a spatial dimension for location patterns, e.g., different\ncities/countries/states; (2) a temporal domain for time patterns, e.g.,\ndaily/weekly/monthly; (3) a categorical dimension for different types of data\nsources, e.g., different types of diseases. Second, we fit this tensor into a\nPoisson regression model, and then we further decompose the infectious rate\ninto two components: smooth global trend and local hot-spots. Third, we detect\nwhen hot-spots occur by building a cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart and\nlocalize where hot-spots occur by their LASSO-type sparse estimation.

Nevertheless, the dynamics\nof training of these neural networks lie still elusive: it is hard and\ncomputationally expensive to train them. A myriad of architectures and training\nstrategies have been proposed to overcome this challenge and address several\nproblems in image processing such as speech, image and action recognition as\nwell as object detection. In this article, we propose a novel Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) based training for ConvNets. In such framework, the vector\nof weights of each ConvNet is typically cast as the position of a particle in\nphase space whereby PSO collaborative dynamics intertwines with Stochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD) in order to boost training performance and\ngeneralization. Our approach goes as follows: i) [regular phase] each ConvNet\nis trained independently via SGD; ii) [collaborative phase] ConvNets share\namong themselves their current vector of weights (or particle-position) along\nwith their gradient estimates of the Loss function. Distinct step sizes are\ncoined by distinct ConvNets. By properly blending ConvNets with large (possibly\nrandom) step-sizes along with more conservative ones, we propose an algorithm\nwith competitive performance with respect to other PSO-based approaches on\nCifar-10 (accuracy of 98.31%).

The trade-off between\nrobustness and standard accuracy is common for DNN models.

The SRO model\ncoordinates hardening and system operational measures for smart power\ndistribution systems equipped with distributed generation units and switches.\nTo capture the uncertainty in the incurred damage by extreme events, an\nuncertainty set is developed by integrating probabilistic information of\nhurricanes with the performance of overhead structures.

Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we\nobserve spontaneous O$_2$ loss from the (012) surface of delithiated LiNiO$_2$,\nsinglet oxygen forming in the process. We find that the origin of the\ninstability lies in the pronounced oxidation of O during delithiation, i.e., O\nplays a central role in Ni O redox in LiNiO$_2$. For LiNiO$_2$, NiO$_2$, and\nthe prototype rock salt NiO, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field\ntheory calculations based on maximally localised Wannier functions yield a Ni\ncharge state of ca. +2, with O varying between -2 (NiO), -1.5 (LiNiO$_2$) and\n-1 (NiO$_2$).

Some works have reported substantial negative performance\neffects of this repeated data. In this paper we attempt to study repeated data\nsystematically and to understand its effects mechanistically. To do this, we\ntrain a family of models where most of the data is unique but a small fraction\nof it is repeated many times. We find a strong double descent phenomenon, in\nwhich repeated data can lead test loss to increase midway through training. A\npredictable range of repetition frequency leads to surprisingly severe\ndegradation in performance.

We had previously studied this\nproblem using numerical simulations of adaptive social network models and found\nthat two individual behavioral traits, homophily and attention to novelty, had\nthe most statistically significant impact on the outcomes of social network\nevolution. However, our previous study was limited in terms of the range of\nparameter values examined, and possible interactions between multiple\nbehavioral traits were largely ignored. In this study, we conducted a\nsubstantially larger-scale parameter sweep numerical experiment of the same\nmodel with expanded parameter ranges by an order of magnitude in each parameter\ndimension, resulting in a total of 116,640 simulation runs. To capture\nnontrivial interactions among behavioral parameters, we modeled and visualized\nthe dependence of outcome measures on the model parameters using artificial\nneural networks. Results show that, while the competition between homophily and\nattention to novelty is still the primary determinant of social fragmentation,\nanother transition plane emerges when individuals have strong social conformity\nbehavior, which was not previously known. This implies that social\nfragmentation transition can also occur in the homophily-social conformity\ntrade-off, the two behavioral traits that have very similar microscopic\nindividual-level effects but produce very different macroscopic\ncollective-level outcomes, illustrating the nontrivial macroscopic dynamics of\ncomplex collective systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 02:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 20:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

As a result, the goal of this study is to use\nGraph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to assist paratransit operators in\nresearching various operational scenarios in a strategic setting in order to\noptimize routing, minimize operating costs and minimize their users' travel\ntime. The study was carried out by using a randomized simulated dataset to help\ndetermine the decision to make in terms of fleet composition and capacity under\ndifferent situations. For the various scenarios investigated, the GCN assisted\nin determining the minimum optimal gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 05:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Yet claims regarding AGI must rely upon mathematical\nformalisms -- theoretical agents we may analyse or attempt to build. AIXI\nappears to be the only such formalism supported by proof that its behaviour is\noptimal, a consequence of its use of compression as a proxy for intelligence.\nUnfortunately, AIXI is incomputable and claims regarding its behaviour highly\nsubjective. We argue that this is because AIXI formalises cognition as taking\nplace in isolation from the environment in which goals are pursued (Cartesian\ndualism). We propose an alternative, supported by proof and experiment, which\novercomes these problems. Integrating research from cognitive science with AI,\nwe formalise an enactive model of learning and reasoning to address the problem\nof subjectivity. This allows us to formulate a different proxy for\nintelligence, called weakness, which addresses the problem of incomputability.\nWe prove optimal behaviour is attained when weakness is maximised. This proof\nis supplemented by experimental results comparing weakness and description\nlength (the closest analogue to compression possible without reintroducing\nsubjectivity). Weakness outperforms description length, suggesting it is a\nbetter proxy. Furthermore we show that, if cognition is enactive, then\nminimisation of description length is neither necessary nor sufficient to\nattain optimal performance, undermining the notion that compression is closely\nrelated to intelligence. However, there remain open questions regarding the\nimplementation of scale-able AGI. In the short term, these results may be best\nutilised to improve the performance of existing systems.

To avoid this bother, one sometimes adopts an approximation,\nwhere the eigenvalue is in one-dimensional parameter space. In this study,\nfirst, we show the accuracy of the zero-damping approximation, which is one of\nthe one-dimensional approximations, for the fundamental and 1st pressure modes.\nBut, this approximation is not applicable to the spacetime mode, because the\ndamping rate of the spacetime mode is generally comparable to the oscillation\nfrequency. Nevertheless, we find the empirical relation for the ratio of the\nimaginary part to the real part of the eigenfrequency, which is expressed as a\nfunction of the steller compactness almost independently of the adopted\nequations of state for neutron star matter. Adopting this empirical relation,\none can express the eigenfrequency in terms of just the real part, i.e., the\nproblem to solve becomes an eigenvalue problem with a one-dimensional\neigenvalue. Then, we find that the frequencies are estimated with good accuracy\neven with such approximations even for the 1st spacetime mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 07:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Our approach is based on density\nmodels and is versatile enough to cope with many different ones, including some\ndensity models for which the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE for short) does\nnot exist. We mainly illustrate the properties of our estimator on models of\ndensities on the line that satisfy a shape constraint. We show that it\npossesses some similar optimality properties, with regard to some global rates\nof convergence, as the MLE does when it exists. It also enjoys some adaptation\nproperties with respect to some specific target densities in the model for\nwhich our estimator is proven to converge at parametric rate. More important is\nthe fact that our estimator is robust, not only with respect to model\nmisspecification, but also to contamination, the presence of outliers among the\ndataset and the equidistribution assumption. This means that the estimator\nperforms almost as well as if the data were i.i.d. with density $p$ in a\nsituation where these data are only independent and most of their marginals are\nclose enough in total variation to a distribution with density $p$. We also\nshow that our estimator converges to the average density of the data, when this\ndensity belongs to the model, even when none of the marginal densities belongs\nto it. Our main result on the risk of the estimator takes the form of an\nexponential deviation inequality which is non-asymptotic and involves explicit\nnumerical constants. We deduce from it several global rates of convergence,\nincluding some bounds for the minimax $\\mathbb{L}_{1}$-risks over the sets of\nconcave and log-concave densities. These bounds derive from some specific\nresults on the approximation of densities which are monotone, convex, concave\nand log-concave.

We\nfind that magnetic reconnection occurs in the accretion flow, likely due to the\nturbulent motion and differential rotation of the accretion flow, resulting in\nflares and formation of flux ropes. Flux ropes formed inside of 10-15\ngravitational radii are found to mainly stay within the accretion flow, while\nflux ropes formed beyond this radius are ejected outward by magnetic forces and\nform the episodic jets.

Second, while we find no difference in the R&D\nelasticity of productivity for the entrants and incumbents, the impact of\ninnovation output - many of which are a result of 'doing, using and\ninteracting' (DUI) mode of innovation - is found to be higher for the entrants.\nEntrants who innovate are 21% to 30% more productive than entrants who do not;\nthe corresponding figures for the incumbents are 10% to 13%. Third, despite the\nadverse sectoral composition typical of catching-up economies, Estonian\nincumbents, who are the primary carriers of 'scientific and\ntechnologically-based innovative' (STI) activities, are comparable to their\ncounterparts in developed economies in translating STI activities into\nproductivity gains. Fourth, while embodied technological change through capital\naccumulation is found to be more effective in generating productivity growth\nthan R&D, the effectiveness is higher for firms engaging in R&D. Finally, our\nresults suggest that certain policy recommendations for spurring productivity\ngrowth in technologically advanced economies may not be applicable for\ncatching-up economies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 09:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

We found the following three main directions for MIM to be improved.\nFirst, since both encoders and decoders contribute to representation learning,\nMIM uses only encoders for downstream tasks, which ignores the impact of\ndecoders on representation learning. Although the MIM paradigm already employs\nsmall decoders with asymmetric structures, we believe that continued reduction\nof decoder parameters is beneficial to improve the representational learning\ncapability of the encoder . Second, MIM solves the image prediction task by\ntraining the encoder and decoder together , and does not design a separate task\nfor the encoder . To further enhance the performance of the encoder when\nperforming downstream tasks, we designed the encoder for the tasks of\ncomparative learning and token position prediction. Third, since the input\nimage may contain background and other objects, and the proportion of each\nobject in the image varies, reconstructing the tokens related to the background\nor to other objects is not meaningful for MIM to understand the main object\nrepresentations. Therefore we use ContrastiveCrop to crop the input image so\nthat the input image contains as much as possible only the main objects. Based\non the above three improvements to MIM, we propose a new model, Contrastive\nMasked AutoEncoders (CMAE). We achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 65.84% on\ntinyimagenet using the ViT-B backbone, which is +2.89 outperforming the MAE of\ncompeting methods when all conditions are equal.

Each of the\nsystems hosts a hot Jupiter, except for HAT-P-26 which hosts a Neptune-mass\nplanet. Methods: We observed transit events of these planets with the HARPS-N\nspectrograph, obtaining high-precision radial velocity measurements that allow\nus to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for each of the target systems. We\nused these new HARPS-N spectra and archival data, including those from Gaia, to\nbetter characterise the stellar atmospheric parameters.

However, the\ntask of dialog generation poses unique challenges for CE loss. This is because\nCE loss assumes that, for any given input, the only possible output is the one\navailable as the ground truth in the training dataset. But, in dialog\ngeneration, there can be multiple valid responses (for a given context) that\nnot only have different surface forms but can also be semantically different.\nFurthermore, CE loss computation for the dialog generation task does not take\nthe input context into consideration and, hence, it grades the response\nirrespective of the context. To grade the generated response for qualities like\nrelevance, engagingness, etc., the loss function should depend on both the\ncontext and the generated response. To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes CORAL, a novel loss function based on a reinforcement learning (RL)\nview of the dialog generation task with a reward function that estimates human\npreference for generated responses while considering both the context and the\nresponse. Furthermore, to overcome challenges such as high sample complexity of\nRL training and a large action space, we propose a mix-policy training\nalgorithm.

Here, we utilise precision\nneuroengineering to manipulate cultured neuronal networks and show that a\nmodular architecture facilitates desynchronization upon asynchronous\nstimulation, making external noise a control parameter of synchrony. Using\nspiking neuron models, we then demonstrate that external noise can reduce the\nlevel of available synaptic resources, which make intermodular interactions\nmore stochastic and thereby facilitates the breakdown of synchrony. Finally,\nthe phenomenology of stochastic intermodular interactions is formulated into a\nmesoscopic model that incorporates a state-dependent gating mechanism for\nsignal propagation.

In this paper, we design a deep multi-feature co-learning\nnetwork for image inpainting, which includes Soft-gating Dual Feature Fusion\n(SDFF) and Bilateral Propagation Feature Aggregation (BPFA) modules. To be\nspecific, we first use two branches to learn structure features and texture\nfeatures separately.

The recurrent processing makes the human tired and helpless,\nbut it is just the advantage of the transformer with global search ability.\nTherefore, a dual-task interactive transformer is proposed to detect both\naccurate position of the camouflaged object and its detailed boundary. The\nboundary feature is considered as Query to improve the camouflaged object\ndetection, and meanwhile the object feature is considered as Query to improve\nthe boundary detection.

Both near-term NISQ\nquantum computers and relatively long-term scalable quantum architectures do\nnot offer full connectivity. As a result, quantum circuits may not be directly\nexecuted on quantum hardware, and a quantum compiler needs to perform qubit\nrouting to make the circuit compatible with the device layout. During the qubit\nrouting step, the compiler inserts SWAP gates and performs circuit\ntransformations. Given the connectivity topology of the target hardware, there\nare typically multiple qubit routing candidates. The state-of-the-art compilers\nuse a cost function to evaluate the number of SWAP gates for different routes\nand then select the one with the minimum number of SWAP gates. After qubit\nrouting, the quantum compiler performs gate optimizations upon the circuit with\nthe newly inserted SWAP gates.\n  In this paper, we observe that the aforementioned qubit routing is not\noptimal, and qubit routing should \\textit{not} be independent on subsequent\ngate optimizations. We find that with the consideration of gate optimizations,\nnot all of the SWAP gates have the same basis-gate cost. These insights lead to\nthe development of our qubit routing algorithm, NASSC (Not All Swaps have the\nSame Cost). NASSC is the first algorithm that considers the subsequent\noptimizations during the routing step. Our optimization-aware qubit routing\nleads to better routing decisions and benefits subsequent optimizations. We\nalso propose a new optimization-aware decomposition for the inserted SWAP\ngates.

However, we notice that a standard\nfringe-region technique excites spurious gravity waves when stratified\natmospheres are considered, therefore enhancing the amount of energy reflected\nfrom the top of the domain and perturbing the velocity and pressure fields\ndownstream. In this work, we develop a new fringe-region method that imposes\nthe inflow conditions while limiting spurious effects on the surrounding flow.\nThis is achieved by locally damping the convective term in the vertical\nmomentum equation. We first apply the standard and wave-free fringe-region\ntechniques to two-dimensional inviscid-flow simulations subjected to 169\ndifferent atmospheric states. A similar study is performed on a\nthree-dimensional domain using a couple of atmospheric states. In all cases,\nthe new fringe-region technique outperforms the standard method, imposing the\ninflow conditions with a minimal impact on the surrounding flow.

Our study thus makes\nclear that the designation of Bohmian trajectories as surreal is based on\nmisconceptions concerning the limitations of classical dynamics and a lack of\nfamiliarity with pilot-wave hydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 15:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}
