These approaches are different from the traditional iterative\noptimization methods in that they usually require only one intensity\nmeasurement and can reconstruct phase images in real-time. However, because of\ntremendous domain discrepancy, the quality of the reconstructed images given by\nthese approaches still has much room to improve to meet the general application\nrequirements. In this paper, we design a novel deep neural network structure\nnamed SiSPRNet for phase retrieval based on a single Fourier intensity\nmeasurement. To effectively utilize the spectral information of the\nmeasurements, we propose a new feature extraction unit using the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) as the front end. It allows all pixels of the input intensity\nimage to be considered together for exploring their global representation. The\nsize of the MLP is carefully designed to facilitate the extraction of the\nrepresentative features while reducing noises and outliers. A dropout layer is\nalso equipped to mitigate the possible overfitting problem in training the MLP.\nTo promote the global correlation in the reconstructed images, a self-attention\nmechanism is introduced to the Up-sampling and Reconstruction (UR) blocks of\nthe proposed SiSPRNet. These UR blocks are inserted into a residual learning\nstructure to prevent the weak information flow and vanishing gradient problems\ndue to their complex layer structure. Extensive evaluations of the proposed\nmodel are performed using different testing datasets of phase-only images and\nimages with linearly related magnitude and phase.

Although efficient, this container reuse has security implications\nfor functions that are invoked on behalf of differently privileged users or\nadministrative domains: bugs in a function's implementation, third-party\nlibrary, or the language runtime may leak private data from one invocation of\nthe function to subsequent invocations of the same function.\n  Groundhog isolates sequential invocations of a function by efficiently\nreverting to a clean state, free from any private data, after each invocation.\nThe system exploits two properties of typical FaaS platforms: each container\nexecutes at most one function at a time and legitimate functions do not retain\nstate across invocations.

A major\nchallenge in LiDAR data analysis arises from the irregular nature of LiDAR data\nthat forces practitioners to either regularize the data using some form of\ngridding or utilize a triangular mesh such as triangulated irregular network\n(TIN). While there have been a handful applications using LiDAR data as a\nconnected graph, a principled treatment of utilizing graph-theoretical approach\nfor LiDAR data modelling is still lacking. In this paper, we try to bridge this\ngap by utilizing graphical approach for normal estimation from LiDAR point\nclouds. We formulate the normal estimation problem in an optimization\nframework, where we find the corresponding normal vector for each LiDAR point\nby utilizing its nearest neighbors and simultaneously enforcing a graph\nsmoothness assumption based on point samples. This is a non-linear constrained\nconvex optimization problem which can then be solved using projected conjugate\ngradient descent to yield an unique solution. As an enhancement to our\noptimization problem, we also provide different weighted solutions based on the\ndot product of the normals and Euclidean distance between the points.

When the lens is massive\nenough and the source aligns closely with the line-of-sight to the lens, the\nwave undergoes strong lensing, leading to several images with the same\nfrequency evolution. These images are separated in time, magnified, and can\nundergo an overall phase shift. Searches for strongly-lensed gravitational\nwaves are already ongoing. In essence, such searches look for events\noriginating from the same sky location and having the same detector frame\nparameters. However, the agreement between these quantities can also happen by\nchance, leading to an important confusion background. To reduce the overlap\nbetween background and foreground, one can include lensing models, enforcing\nthe lensing parameters to also be consistent with our expectations. In\nprinciple, such models should decrease the confusion background. However, when\ndoing realistic searches, one does not know which model is the correct one. The\nuse of an incorrect model could lead to the non-detection of genuinely lensed\nevents.

Specifically, our\nmethod first uses zero-shot or few-shot prompting to obtain a set of candidate\ngenerations in the target style, and then re-ranks these candidates according\nto a combination of the three components above. Empirically, our method enables\nsmall pre-trained language models to perform on par with state-of-the-art\nlarge-scale models while consuming two orders of magnitude less compute and\nmemory.

In this paper, we present a different approach, based on\nBayesian reasoning. Our starting point is the master equation governing vacuum\ndynamics, which describes a random walk on the network of vacua. Our\nprobabilities require two pieces of prior information, both pertaining to\ninitial conditions: a prior density $\\rho(t)$ for the time of nucleation, and a\nprior probability $p_\\alpha$ for the ancestral vacuum. For ancestral vacua, we\nadvocate the uniform prior as a conservative choice, though our conclusions are\nfairly insensitive to this choice. For the time of nucleation, we argue that a\nuniform prior is consistent with the time-translational invariance of the\nmaster equation and represents the minimally-informative choice. The resulting\npredictive probabilities coincide with Bousso's \"holographic\" prior\nprobabilities and are closely related to Garriga and Vilenkin's \"comoving\"\nprobabilities. Despite making the least informative priors, these probabilities\nare surprisingly predictive. They favor vacua whose surrounding landscape\ntopography is that of a deep funnel, akin to the folding funnels of\nnaturally-occurring proteins. They predict that we exist during the approach to\nnear-equilibrium, much earlier than the mixing time for the landscape. We also\nconsider a volume-weighted $\\rho(t)$, which amounts to weighing vacua by\nphysical volume. The predictive probabilities in this case coincide with the\nGSVW measure. The Bayesian framework allows us to compare the plausibility of\nthe uniform-time and volume-weighted hypotheses to explain our data by\ncomputing the Bayesian evidence for each.

It is\nwell-known that kinetic mixing of the right magnitude can be generated at one\nloop by the inclusion of \"portal matter\" fields which are charged under both\nthe dark $U(1)$ and the SM hypercharge, and it has been previously argued on\nphenomenological grounds that fermionic portal matter fields must exhibit a\nspecific set of characteristics: They must be vector-like and have the same\nStandard Model group representations as existing SM fermions. A natural\nexplanation for the presence of dark $U(1)$-charged copies of SM fermions would\nbe to enlarge the dark gauge group and embed the SM and the portal matter into\na single dark multiplet, however, previous works in this direction require\nsignificant ad hoc additions to ensure that the portal matter fields are\nvector-like while the SM fields are chiral, and rely on complicated dark Higgs\nsectors to realize the appropriate symmetry breaking.

Similar to previous studies on frictional granular matter with only\ncompressive forces and without any rolling torque, the full stress\nautocorrelation matrix is dictated by the pressure and torque autocorrelations\ndue to mechanical balance and material isotropy constraints. Surprisingly, it\nis observed that the gel materials do not behave as a normal elastic solid\nclose to the gel point as assumed loosely in the literature because the real\nspace pressure fluctuations decay slower than the normal. We also demonstrate\nthat at low pressure the fractal like structural correlation determines the\npressure fluctuations and this is manifested in the real space in terms of\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic force networks formed due to large voids. Far\naway from the gel point, as the voids collapse under compression, the force\nchain network becomes homogeneous and isotropic and the pressure fluctuations\nbecome normal leading to normal elastic decay at long range, behaving similar\nto frictionless granular matter and glass.

A similar dependence on high capital is also found in inter-bank\npayment settlements, where the so-called netting technique is used to mitigate\nliquidity demands.\n  In this work, we alleviate this limitation by introducing the notion of\ntransaction aggregation: instead of executing transactions sequentially through\na PCN, we enable senders to aggregate multiple transactions and execute them\nsimultaneously to benefit from several amounts that may \"cancel out\". Two\ndirect advantages of our proposal is the decrease in intermediary fees paid by\nsenders as well as the obfuscation of the transaction data from the\nintermediaries.\n  We formulate the transaction aggregation as a computational problem, a\ngeneralization of the Bank Clearing Problem.

To overcome\nthe NP-hardness of the transaction aggregation problem, in Wiser we propose a\nfixed-parameter linear algorithm for a special case of transaction aggregation\nas well as the Bank Clearing Problem.

In many such cases,\nthe finite dimension is selected by a preferred curvature of the monomers,\nwhich leads to self-closure of the assembly. In this article, we study an\nexample class of self-closing assemblies: cylindrical tubules that assemble\nfrom triangular monomers. By combining kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, free\nenergy calculations, and simple theoretical models, we show that a range of\nprogrammable size scales can be targeted by controlling the intricate balance\nbetween the preferred curvature of the monomers and their interaction\nstrengths. However, their assembly is kinetically controlled - the tubule\nmorphology is essentially fixed shortly after closure, resulting in a\ndistribution of tubule widths that is significantly broader than the\nequilibrium distribution. We develop a simple kinetic model based on this\nobservation and the underlying free-energy landscape of assembling tubules that\nquantitatively describes the distributions. Our results are consistent with\nrecent experimental observations of tubule assembly from triangular DNA origami\nmonomers.

Over the years, the SCHA has successfully applied to investigate\nferro and antiferromagnetism in a wide range of scenarios. The main point of\nthe SCHA formalism involves the adoption of a quadratic model for which\ncorrections are included through temperature-dependent renormalization\nparameters. Therefore, the SCHA is an efficient method for determining the\nproperties of magnetically ordered phases. Using the SCHA, we obtained the\ntemperature dependence of FMR-driven spin pumping.

Recent advancements such as the Tensor Algebra\nCompiler (TACO) greatly generalize and automate the code generation for tensor\nalgebra expressions. However, the code generated by TACO for many important\ntensor computations remains suboptimal due to the absence of a scheduling\ndirective to support transformations such as distribution/fusion.\n  This paper extends TACO's scheduling space to support kernel\ndistribution/loop fusion in order to reduce asymptotic time complexity and\nimprove locality of complex tensor algebra computations.

Most state-of-the-art methods\nleverage transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) or their variants. Training such\nmodels and exploring their hyperparameter space, however, is computationally\nexpensive. Prior work proposes several neural architecture search (NAS) methods\nthat employ performance predictors (e.g., surrogate models) to address this\nissue; however, analysis has been limited to homogeneous models that use fixed\ndimensionality throughout the network. This leads to sub-optimal architectures.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a suite of heterogeneous and flexible\nmodels, namely FlexiBERT, that have varied encoder layers with a diverse set of\npossible operations and different hidden dimensions. For better-posed surrogate\nmodeling in this expanded design space, we propose a new graph-similarity-based\nembedding scheme. We also propose a novel NAS policy, called BOSHNAS, that\nleverages this new scheme, Bayesian modeling, and second-order optimization, to\nquickly train and use a neural surrogate model to converge to the optimal\narchitecture. A comprehensive set of experiments shows that the proposed\npolicy, when applied to the FlexiBERT design space, pushes the performance\nfrontier upwards compared to traditional models. FlexiBERT-Mini, one of our\nproposed models, has 3% fewer parameters than BERT-Mini and achieves 8.9%\nhigher GLUE score. A FlexiBERT model with equivalent performance as the best\nhomogeneous model achieves 2.6x smaller size.

Nevertheless, the over-stacked architecture of\ndeep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or\nembedded systems. To compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a\nteacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the\nkey step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks\nwith predefined distance functions. However, using the same distance for graphs\nof various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is\nhard to determine. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which\nadversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and\ndecrease the discrepancy. Specifically, noticing that the well-captured\ninter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs, we\npropose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level\nviews with a trainable discriminator. The discriminator distinguishes between\nteacher knowledge and what the student inherits, while the student GNN works as\na generator and aims to fool the discriminator. To our best knowledge, GraphAKD\nis the first to introduce adversarial training to knowledge distillation in\ngraph domains. Experiments on node-level and graph-level classification\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a\nlarge margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge\nfrom a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 00:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Examples\ninclude rankings of colleges or academic journals. The foundation of our\nranking method is that alternatives that an agent desires, those that they have\nbeen rejected by, should be ranked higher than the one they receive. We provide\na mechanism to produce a social ranking given any preference profile and\noutcome assignment, and characterize this ranking as the unique one that\nsatisfies certain desirable axioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 00:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

However, we propose a new formulation for deriving such a vector\nincorporating both binary and discrete features simultaneously. We refer to\nthis noble definition as compound conditional vector and employ it for training\nthe generator network. The core architecture of this network is a three-layered\ndeep residual neural network with skip connections. For improving the stability\nof such complex architecture, we present a regularization scheme towards\nlimiting unprecedented variations on its weight vectors during training. This\nregularization approach is quite compatible with the nature of adversarial\ntraining and it is not computationally prohibitive in runtime. Furthermore, we\nconstantly monitor the variation of the weight vectors for identifying any\npotential instabilities or irregularities to measure the strength of our\nproposed regularizer. Toward this end, we also develop a new metric for\ntracking sudden perturbation on the weight vectors using the singular value\ndecomposition theory. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed\nsynthesis approach on six benchmarking tabular databases, namely Adult, Census,\nHCDR, Cabs, News, and King.

The proposed\nscheme employs delayed encoding and non-iterative detection and decoding\nstrategies to manage the transmission of multiple codewords in a linear code.\nIn the DC scheme, a channel input sequence consists of subblocks of multiple\ncodewords from the previous to current time instances. At the receiver side,\nthe maximum a posteriori detection applies to the received sequences that\ncontain information of the codeword at the current time instance, where priorly\ndecoded codewords aid the detection.

However, the\nphenomenon of robust overfitting, i.e., the robustness will drop sharply at a\ncertain stage, always exists during AT. It is of great importance to decrease\nthis robust generalization gap in order to obtain a robust model. In this\npaper, we present an in-depth study towards the robust overfitting from a new\nangle. We observe that consistency regularization, a popular technique in\nsemi-supervised learning, has a similar goal as AT and can be used to alleviate\nrobust overfitting. We empirically validate this observation, and find a\nmajority of prior solutions have implicit connections to consistency\nregularization. Motivated by this, we introduce a new AT solution, which\nintegrates the consistency regularization and Mean Teacher (MT) strategy into\nAT. Specifically, we introduce a teacher model, coming from the average weights\nof the student models over the training steps. Then we design a consistency\nloss function to make the prediction distribution of the student models over\nadversarial examples consistent with that of the teacher model over clean\nsamples. Experiments show that our proposed method can effectively alleviate\nrobust overfitting and improve the robustness of DNN models against common\nadversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 03:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Extraction is typically conducted in commercial\nsoil analysis laboratories and university plant diagnostic clinics and involves\nrepeated steps of sieving, washing, collecting, grinding, and cleaning. Here we\npresent a robotic instrument to reproduce and automate the functions of the\nconventional methods to extract nematode cysts from soil and subsequently\nextract eggs from the recovered nematode cysts. We incorporated mechanisms to\nactuate the stage system, manipulate positions of individual sieves using the\ngripper, recover cysts and cyst-sized objects from soil suspended in water, and\ngrind the cysts to release their eggs. All system functions are controlled and\noperated by a touchscreen interface software. The performance of the robotic\ninstrument is evaluated using soil samples infested with SCN from two farms at\ndifferent locations and results were comparable to the conventional technique.\nOur new technology brings the benefits of automation to SCN soil diagnostics, a\nstep towards long-term integrated pest management of this serious soybean pest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 03:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

A series of UNet-like networks\nwith encoder-decoder architecture has achieved extraordinary success, in which\nUNet2+ and UNet3+ redesign skip connections, respectively proposing dense skip\nconnection and full-scale skip connection and dramatically improving compared\nwith UNet in medical image segmentation. However, UNet2+ lacks sufficient\ninformation explored from the full scale, which will affect the learning of\norgans' location and boundary. Although UNet3+ can obtain the full-scale\naggregation feature map, owing to the small number of neurons in the structure,\nit does not satisfy the segmentation of tiny objects when the number of samples\nis small. This paper proposes a novel network structure combining dense skip\nconnections and full-scale skip connections, named UNet-sharp (UNet\\#) for its\nshape similar to symbol \\#. The proposed UNet\\# can aggregate feature maps of\ndifferent scales in the decoder sub-network and capture fine-grained details\nand coarse-grained semantics from the full scale, which benefits learning the\nexact location and accurately segmenting the boundary of organs or lesions. We\nperform deep supervision for model pruning to speed up testing and make it\npossible for the model to run on mobile devices; furthermore, designing two\nclassification-guided modules to reduce false positives achieves more accurate\nsegmentation results. Various experiments of semantic segmentation and instance\nsegmentation on different modalities (EM, CT, MRI) and dimensions (2D, 3D)\ndatasets, including the nuclei, brain tumor, liver, and lung, demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 03:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

They learn the\nclassification subnetwork by processing each sample separately and neglect the\nrelationship among positive and negative samples. Moreover, such tracking\nparadigm takes only the classification confidence of proposals for the final\nprediction, which may yield the misalignment between classification and\nlocalization. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a ranking-based\noptimization algorithm to explore the relationship among different proposals.\nTo this end, we introduce two ranking losses, including the classification one\nand the IoU-guided one, as optimization constraints. The classification ranking\nloss can ensure that positive samples rank higher than hard negative ones,\ni.e., distractors, so that the trackers can select the foreground samples\nsuccessfully without being fooled by the distractors. The IoU-guided ranking\nloss aims to align classification confidence scores with the Intersection over\nUnion(IoU) of the corresponding localization prediction for positive samples,\nenabling the well-localized prediction to be represented by high classification\nconfidence. Specifically, the proposed two ranking losses are compatible with\nmost Siamese trackers and incur no additional computation for inference.\nExtensive experiments on seven tracking benchmarks, including OTB100, UAV123,\nTC128, VOT2016, NFS30, GOT-10k and LaSOT, demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed ranking-based optimization algorithm.

To address this issue, here we\nrevisit the MaxCut problem via the divide-and-conquer heuristic: seek the\nsolutions of subgraphs in parallel and then merge these solutions to obtain the\nglobal solution.

Our approach is based\non a flexible and differentiable fit to the stream in phase-space, enabling a\ndirect estimate of the acceleration vector along the stream. Reconstruction of\nthe local acceleration field can be applied independently to each of several\nstreams, allowing us to sample the acceleration field due to the underlying\ngalactic potential across a range of scales. Our approach is methodologically\ndifferent from previous works, since a model for the gravitational potential\ndoes not need to be adopted beforehand. Instead, our flexible\nneural-network-based model treats the stream as a collection of orbits with a\nlocally similar mixture of energies, rather than assuming that the stream\ndelineates a single stellar orbit. Accordingly, our approach allows for\ndistinct regions of the stream to have different mean energies, as is the case\nfor real stellar streams. Once the acceleration vector is sampled along the\nstream, standard analytic models for the galactic potential can then be rapidly\nconstrained. We find our method recovers the correct parameters for a\nground-truth triaxial logarithmic halo potential when applied to simulated\nstellar streams. Alternatively, we demonstrate that a flexible potential can be\nconstrained with a neural network, though standard multipole expansions can\nalso be constrained.

One of the oldest ways to construct a monotonic fully connected neural\nnetwork is to constrain signs on its weights.

However, the tradeoff\nis that its worst case global convergence is comparatively slow, and\nimportantly, is fundamentally slower than its flow rate--that is to say, the\nconvergence rate is throttled by discretization error. In this work, we\nconsider a modified Frank-Wolfe where the step direction is a simple weighted\naverage of past oracle calls. This method requires very little memory and\ncomputational overhead, and provably decays this discretization error term.\nNumerically, we show that this method improves the convergence rate over\nseveral problems, especially after the sparse manifold has been detected.\nTheoretically, we show the method has an overall global convergence rate of\n$O(1/k^p)$, where $0< p < 1$; after manifold identification, this rate speeds\nto $O(1/k^{3p/2})$. We also observe that the method achieves this accelerated\nrate from a very early stage, suggesting a promising mode of acceleration for\nthis family of methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 05:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Despite the growing interest in HM technologies,\nsoftware tools for process planning have not caught up with advances in\nhardware and typically impose restrictions that limit the design and\nmanufacturing engineers' ability to systematically explore the full design and\nprocess planning spaces. We present a general framework for identifying AM/SM\nactions that make up an HM process plan based on accessibility and support\nrequirements, using morphological operations that allow for arbitrary part and\ntool geometries to be considered. To take advantage of multi-modality, we\ndefine the actions to allow for temporary excessive material deposition or\nremoval, with an understanding that subsequent actions can correct for them,\nunlike the case in unimodal (AM-only or SM-only) process plans that are\nmonotonic.

Such methods require\npartitioning key space for a better approximation. Although lots of heuristics\nare proposed to improve the approximation quality, the bottleneck is that the\nsegmentation overheads could hinder the overall performance. This paper tackles\nthe approximation problem by applying a \\textit{distribution transformation} to\nthe keys before constructing the learned index. A two-stage\nNormalizing-Flow-based Learned index framework (NFL) is proposed, which first\ntransforms the original complex key distribution into a near-uniform\ndistribution, then builds a learned index leveraging the transformed keys. For\neffective distribution transformation, we propose a Numerical Normalizing Flow\n(Numerical NF). Based on the characteristics of the transformed keys, we\npropose a robust After-Flow Learned Index (AFLI). To validate the performance,\ncomprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic and real-world\nworkloads, which shows that the proposed NFL produces the highest throughput\nand the lowest tail latency compared to the state-of-the-art learned indexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 06:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

However, nodes may\nbelong to several communities in the network, and detecting all the communities\nfor the query node set, termed as the multiple local community detection\n(MLCD), is more important as it could uncover more potential information. MLCD\nis also more challenging because when a query node belongs to multiple\ncommunities, it always locates in the complicated overlapping region and the\nmarginal region of communities. Accordingly, detecting multiple communities for\nsuch nodes by applying seed expansion methods is insufficient.\n  In this work, we address the MLCD based on higher-order structural importance\n(HoSI). First, to effectively estimate the influence of higher-order\nstructures, we propose a new variant of random walk called Active Random Walk\nto measure the HoSI score between nodes. Then, we propose two new metrics to\nevaluate the HoSI score of a subgraph to a node and the HoSI score of a node,\nrespectively. Based on the proposed metrics, we present a novel algorithm\ncalled HoSIM to detect multiple local communities for a single query node.\nHoSIM enforces a three-stage processing, namely subgraph sampling, core member\nidentification, and local community detection. The key idea is utilizing HoSI\nto find and identify the core members of communities relevant to the query node\nand optimize the generated communities.

The\ntemperature range covered is log$_{10}(T)=5.5-6.3$. The circular polarization\nsignal due to longitudinal Zeeman effect is estimated for spectral lines in the\nwavelength range of 500 to 1600 \\r{A}. The Stokes $V/I$ signal for a FUV line\nis found to be in the order of 10$^{-4}$ for a longitudinal field strength of\n10 Gauss, which further reduces to 10$^{-5}$ for wavelengths below 1200 \\r{A}.\nDue to such low signals, the present study aims to find combination of spectral\nlines having different Hanle sensitivity but with identical peak formation\ntemperature to probe coronal magnetic field vector. The combination of Hanle\nsensitive lines is better suited because the Hanle signals are stronger by at\nleast an order of magnitude compared to Zeeman signals. The linear polarization\nsignals due to Hanle effect from at least two spectral lines are required to\nderive information on the full vector. It is found from this study that there\nis always a pair of Hanle sensitive lines for a given temperature range\nsuitable for probing coronal vector magnetic field and they are located in\nclose proximity with each other in terms of their wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Although knowledge distillation (KD) is a feasible\nsolution for compression, its requirement on the original dataset raises\nprivacy concerns. In addition, it is common to integrate multiple pretrained\nmodels to achieve satisfactory performance. How to compress multiple models\ninto a tiny model is challenging, especially when the original data are\nunavailable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework termed\ncollaborative data-free knowledge distillation via multi-level feature sharing\n(CDFKD-MFS), which consists of a multi-header student module, an asymmetric\nadversarial data-free KD module, and an attention-based aggregation module. In\nthis framework, the student model equipped with a multi-level feature-sharing\nstructure learns from multiple teacher models and is trained together with a\ngenerator in an asymmetric adversarial manner. When some real samples are\navailable, the attention module adaptively aggregates predictions of the\nstudent headers, which can further improve performance. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three popular computer visual datasets. In particular, compared\nwith the most competitive alternative, the accuracy of the proposed framework\nis 1.18\\% higher on the CIFAR-100 dataset, 1.67\\% higher on the Caltech-101\ndataset, and 2.99\\% higher on the mini-ImageNet dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

However, information sharing among vehicle\nand infrastructures in predefined communication schemes may result in\ncommunication congestion and/or bring limited performance improvement. To this\nend, we propose a novel collaborative 3D object detection framework that\nconsists of three components: feature learning networks that map point clouds\ninto feature maps; an efficient communication block that propagates compact and\nfine-grained query feature maps from vehicle to support infrastructures and\noptimizes attention weights between query and key to refine support feature\nmaps; a region proposal network that fuses local feature maps and weighted\nsupport feature maps for 3D object detection.

In the restricted\nNim considered in this study, two players take turns and remove stones from the\npiles. In each turn, when the number of stones is m, each player is allowed to\nremove at least one stone and at most the ceiling of m/2 stones from a pile of\nm stones. The standard rules of the game are modified to allow a one-time pass,\nthat is, a pass move that may be used at most once in the game and not from a\nterminal position. Once a pass has been used by either player, it is no longer\navailable. It is well-known that in classical Nim, the introduction of the pass\nalters the underlying structure of the game, significantly increasing its\ncomplexity. In the restricted Nim considered in this study, the pass move was\nfound to have a minimal impact. There is a simple relationship between the\nGrundy numbers of restricted Nim and the Grundy numbers of restricted Nim with\na pass, where the number of piles can be any natural number. Therefore, the\nauthors address a longstanding open question in combinatorial game theory: the\nextent to which the introduction of a pass into a game affects its behavior.\nThe game that we developed appears to be the first variant of Nim that is fully\nsolvable when a pass is not allowed and remains fully solvable following the\nintroduction of a pass move.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We\ncharacterize the electronic structure and rovibrational branching of several\nprototypical candidates using ab initio quantum chemical methods. Despite\nincreased internal complexity and challenging design parameters, we find\nseveral molecules possessing quasi-closed photon cycling schemes with highly\ndiagonal, visible and near-infrared transitions. Furthermore, we identify new\nheuristics for engineering optically controllable and laser-coolable polyatomic\nmolecules with multi-electron cycling centers. Our results help elucidate the\ninterplay between hybridization, repulsion, and ionicity in optically active\nspecies and provide a first step towards using polyatomic molecules with\ncomplex electronic structure as a resource for quantum science and measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

In this work, we\npropose a flavour-aware infrared-safe modification of the anti-$k_T$ jet\nalgorithm that is easy to implement within perturbative Monte Carlo frameworks\nand has minor impact on jet phenomenology when flavour tagging is not required.\nBesides the numerical verification of the infrared safety of the proposed\nalgorithm at next-to-next-to-leading order, we also present results for the\nhadro-production of a lepton pair in association with a $b$-jet, and of a\ntop-quark pair decaying into $b$-jets and leptons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 09:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

The base layer consists of a\nset of sparse diffusion curves (DC) which characterize salient geometric\nfeatures and low-frequency colors and provide means for semantic color transfer\nand facial expression editing. The middle level encodes specular highlights and\nshadows to large and editable Poisson regions (PR) and allows the user to\ndirectly adjust illumination via tuning the strength and/or changing shape of\nPR. The top level contains two types of pixel-sized PRs for high-frequency\nresiduals and fine details such as pimples and pigmentation. We also train a\ndeep generative model that can produce high-frequency residuals automatically.\nThanks to the meaningful organization of vector primitives, editing portraits\nbecomes easy and intuitive. In particular, our method supports color transfer,\nfacial expression editing, highlight and shadow editing and automatic\nretouching. Thanks to the linearity of the Laplace operator, we introduce alpha\nblending, linear dodge and linear burn to vector editing and show that they are\neffective in editing highlights and shadows. To quantitatively evaluate the\nresults, we extend the commonly used FLIP metric (which measures differences\nbetween two images) by considering illumination. The new metric, called\nillumination-sensitive FLIP or IS-FLIP, can effectively capture the salient\nchanges in color transfer results, and is more consistent with human perception\nthan FLIP and other quality measures on portrait images. We evaluate our method\non the FFHQR dataset and show that our method is effective for common portrait\nediting tasks, such as retouching, light editing, color transfer and expression\nediting. We will make the code and trained models publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

A key in this campaign relies upon aligning the distributions of\nsource and target domain. One common attempt is to enforce the global alignment\nbetween two domains, which, however, ignores the fatal local-imbalance domain\ngap problem, i.e., some local features with larger domain gap are harder to\ntransfer. Recently, some methods conduct alignment focusing on local regions to\nimprove the efficiency of model learning. While this operation may cause a\ndeficiency of critical information from contexts. To tackle this limitation, we\npropose a novel strategy to alleviate the domain gap imbalance considering the\ncharacteristics of medical images, namely Global-Local Union Alignment.\nSpecifically, a feature-disentanglement style-transfer module first synthesizes\nthe target-like source-content images to reduce the global domain gap. Then, a\nlocal feature mask is integrated to reduce the 'inter-gap' for local features\nby prioritizing those discriminative features with larger domain gap. This\ncombination of global and local alignment can precisely localize the crucial\nregions in segmentation target while preserving the overall semantic\nconsistency. We conduct a series of experiments with two cross-modality\nadaptation tasks, i,e. cardiac substructure and abdominal multi-organ\nsegmentation.

In this context, the fluids are governed by\nrotational, weak compressibility and stratification effects, whose importance\nis measured by adimensional numbers: the Rossby, Mach and Froude numbers. The\nfirst part of the thesis is dedicated to the analysis of a 3D multi-scale\nproblem called the full Navier-Stokes-Fourier system where variations in\ndensity and temperature are considered and in addition we take into account the\nCoriolis, centrifugal and gravitational forces. We study, in the framework of\nweak solutions, the combined incompressible and fast rotation limits in the\nregime of small Mach, Froude and Rossby numbers and for general ill-prepared\ninitial data. In the case when the Mach number is of higher order than the\nRossby number, we prove that the limit dynamics is described by an\nincompressible Oberbeck-Boussinesq type system. Conversely, when the Mach and\nRossby numbers have the same order of magnitude, we show convergence towards a\nquasi-geostrophic type equation. Following \"le fil rouge\" of the asymptotic\nanalysis, in the second part of the thesis, we examine the effects of high\nrotation for the 2D incompressible density-dependent Euler system. Now, the\nmain goal is to perform the singular limit in the fast rotation regime, showing\nthe convergence of the Euler equations to a quasi-homogeneous type system. The\nproof of convergence of the two primitive problems towards the reduced models\nis based on a compensated compactness argument. The key point is to use the\nstructure of the underlying system of Poincar\\'e waves in order to identify\nsome compactness properties for suitable quantities. Compared to previous\nresults, our method enables to treat the whole range of parameters in the\nmulti-scale problem, and also to reach and go beyond the critical choice\n$Fr=\\sqrt{Ma}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 08:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

The QPO\nfrequency is found to also correlate with the scattering fraction (i.e. the\nfraction of the soft photons Comptonized) and its dependence on the accretion\nrate and inner disc radii is consistent with it being the dynamical frequency.\nThe time-lag between the hard and soft photons is negative for QPO frequency >\n2.2 Hz and is positive for lesser values, making this the second black hole\nsystem to show this behaviour after GRS 1915+105.

Thermomechanical noise, intrinsic to the resonator, sets the ultimate\nsensor performance when all other noise sources have been eliminated. For\nlinear resonators, the sensing resolution can always be further improved by\nincreasing the driving power. However, this trend cannot continue indefinitely,\nsince at sufficiently high driving powers non-linear effects emerge and\ninfluence the noise performance. As a consequence, the resonator's non-linear\ncharacteristics play an inextricable role in determining its ultimate\nresolution limits. Recently, several works have studied the characteristic\nperformance of non-linear resonators as sensors, with the counter intuitive\nconclusion that increasing the quality factor of a resonator does not improve\nits sensing resolution at the thermomechanical limit. In this work we further\nanalyze the ultimate resolution limits, and describe different regimes of\nperformance at integration times below and above the resonator's decay time. We\nprovide an analytical model to elucidate the effects of Duffing non-linearity\non the resolution of closed-loop sensors, and validate it using numerical\nsimulations. In contrast to previous works, our model and simulations show that\nunder certain conditions the ultimate sensing resolution of a Duffing resonator\ncan be improved by maximizing its quality factor.

Notably, chain of thought (CoT)\nprompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning\nthrough step-by-step answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art\nperformances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks\nthat do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes\nare often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs\nare decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding \"Let's think step by step\"\nbefore each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT,\nusing the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM\nperformances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics\n(MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin\nFlip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled\nObjects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the\naccuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with\nlarge InstructGPT model (text-davinci-002), as well as similar magnitudes of\nimprovements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The\nversatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at\nuntapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs,\nsuggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted\nby simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest\nzero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also\nhighlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous\nzero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or\nfew-shot exemplars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 09:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 09:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 07:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 05:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

TL allows to transfer knowledge from a general domain\nto a specific target one. However, such a knowledge transfer may put privacy at\nrisk when it comes to sensitive or private data. With CryptoTL we introduce a\nsolution to this problem, and show for the first time a cryptographic\nprivacy-preserving TL approach based on homomorphic encryption that is\nefficient and feasible for real-world use cases. We achieve this by carefully\ndesigning the framework such that training is always done in plain while still\nprofiting from the privacy gained by homomorphic encryption. To demonstrate the\nefficiency of our framework, we instantiate it with the popular CKKS HE scheme\nand apply CryptoTL to classification tasks with small datasets and show the\napplicability of our approach for sentiment analysis and spam detection.\nAdditionally, we highlight how our approach can be combined with differential\nprivacy to further increase the security guarantees.

Both temperature\nprogrammed desorption (TPD) laboratory experiments and quantum chemistry\ncomputations have often provided, so far, only single values of the BE for each\nmolecule. This is a severe limitation, as the ices enveloping the grain mantles\nare structurally amorphous, giving rise to a manifold of possible adsorption\nsites, each with different BEs. However, the ice amorphous nature prevents the\nknowledge of structural details, hindering the development of a common accepted\natomistic icy model. In this work, we propose a computational framework that\nclosely mimics the formation of the interstellar grain mantle through a water\nby water accretion. On that grain, an unbiased random (but well reproducible)\npositioning of the studied molecule is then carried out. Here we present the\ntest case of NH$_3$, an ubiquitous species in the molecular ISM. We provide the\nBE distribution computed by a hierarchy approach, using the semiempirical\nxTB-GFN2 as low-level method to describe the whole icy cluster combined with\nthe B97D3 DFT functional as high-level method on the local zone of the NH$_3$\ninteraction. The final ZPE corrected BE is computed at\nONIOM(DLPNO-CCSD(T)//B97D3:xTB-GFN2) level, ensuring the best cost/accuracy\nratio. The main peak of the predicted NH$_3$ BE distribution is in agreement\nwith experimental TPD and literature computed data. A second broad peak at very\nlow BE values is also present, never detected before. It may provide the\nsolution to a long-standing puzzle about the presence of gaseous NH$_3$\nobserved also in cold ISM objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 10:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

This limitation is especially pronounced in\nnon-ECG-synchronized CT where lesions are more impacted by cardiac motion and\npartial volume effects. Therefore, we propose a CAC quantification method that\ndoes not require a threshold for segmentation of CAC.

We explore how the cooling influences the growth rate\nof unstable RWI modes in terms of the linear perturbation analysis. The cooling\nassociated with the energy equation is treated in two different ways. The first\none we adopt is a simple cooling law. The perturbed thermal state relaxes to\nthe initial thermal state on a prescribed cooling timescale. In the second, we\ntreat the cooling as a thermal diffusion process. The difference in the growth\nrate between the adiabatic and isothermal modes becomes more pronounced for\ndiscs with smaller sound speed. For the simple cooling law, the growth rates of\nunstable modes monotonically decrease with the shorter cooling timescale in\nbarotropic discs. But the dependence of growth rate with the cooling timescale\nbecomes non-monotonic in non-baratopic discs. The RWI might even be enhanced in\nnon-barotropic discs during the transition from the adiabatic state to the\nisothermal state. When the cooling is treated as the thermal diffusion, even in\nbarotropic disc, the variation of growth rate with thermal diffusivity becomes\nnon-monotonic. Further more, a maximum growth rate may appear with an\nappropriate value of thermal diffusivity. The angular momentum flux (AMF) is\ninvestigated to understand the angular momentum transport by RWI with cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 11:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

A majority of labels only have a few training instances due to large label\ndimensionality in XMTC. To solve this data sparsity issue, most existing XMTC\nmethods take advantage of fixed label clusters obtained in early stage to\nbalance performance on tail labels and head labels. However, such label\nclusters provide static and coarse-grained semantic scope for every text, which\nignores distinct characteristics of different texts and has difficulties\nmodelling accurate semantics scope for texts with tail labels. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel framework TReaderXML for XMTC, which adopts dynamic and\nfine-grained semantic scope from teacher knowledge for individual text to\noptimize text conditional prior category semantic ranges. TReaderXML\ndynamically obtains teacher knowledge for each text by similar texts and\nhierarchical label information in training sets to release the ability of\ndistinctly fine-grained label-oriented semantic scope. Then, TReaderXML\nbenefits from a novel dual cooperative network that firstly learns features of\na text and its corresponding label-oriented semantic scope by parallel Encoding\nModule and Reading Module, secondly embeds two parts by Interaction Module to\nregularize the text's representation by dynamic and fine-grained label-oriented\nsemantic scope, and finally find target labels by Prediction Module.\nExperimental results on three XMTC benchmark datasets show that our method\nachieves new state-of-the-art results and especially performs well for severely\nimbalanced and sparse datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 11:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

In mandarin scenarios, the Chinese characters represent meaning\nbut are not directly related to the pronunciation. Thus only considering the\nwriting of Chinese characters as modeling units is insufficient to capture\nspeech features. In this paper, we present a novel method involves with\nmulti-level modeling units, which integrates multi-level information for\nmandarin speech recognition. Specifically, the encoder block considers\nsyllables as modeling units and the decoder block deals with character-level\nmodeling units. To facilitate the incremental conversion from syllable features\nto character features, we design an auxiliary task that applies cross-entropy\n(CE) loss to intermediate decoder layers. During inference, the input feature\nsequences are converted into syllable sequences by the encoder block and then\nconverted into Chinese characters by the decoder block.

In a large-scale network, the information of agents in a\ncluster can not be available immediately for agents beyond this cluster, which\nraise challenges to the existing Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms. Hence, we\nconsider a partial-decision information scenario in generalized Nash\nequilibrium seeking for multi-cluster games in a distributed manner.

By\nconstruction the latter manifold is furnished with a natural foliation.\nHeuristically, its leaves are interpreted as physical spacetime observed on\ndifferent scales of the experimental resolution. Generalizing earlier work on\nthe embedding of $d$-dimensional Euclidean QEG spacetimes in $(d +\n1)$-dimensional flat or Ricci flat manifolds, we admit Lorentzian signature in\nthis paper and we consider embeddings in arbitrary $(d + 1)$-dimensional\nEinstein spaces. Special attention is paid to the sector of maximally symmetric\nmetrics, and the fundamental definition of QEG in $d = 4$ that employs the\ncross-over trajectory connecting the non-Gaussian to the Gaussian RG fixed\npoint.

To arrive at this result essential use is made of the\nmonotone scale dependence of the running cosmological constant featured by the\ngravitational effective average action. We show that if the scale invariance of\nthe QEG fixed points extends to full conformal invariance, the 5D picture of\nthe resulting geometric and field theoretic structure displays a novel kind of\n\"AdS/CFT correspondence\".

By modeling the relativistic reflection in\ndetail, we find that the inner radius $R_{\\rm{in}}$ is relatively stable with\n$R_{\\rm{in}}\\lesssim 1.55 R_{\\rm{g}}$ during the three states, which implies\nthat the inner radius likely extends to the innermost stable circular orbit\neven in the bright hard state. When adopting $R_{\\rm{in}} = R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$, the\nspin parameter is constrained to be $0.985_{-0.004}^{+0.002}$ at 90% confidence\n(statistical only). The best-fitting results reveal that the inclination of the\ninner accretion disc is $\\sim70-74$ degrees, which notably conflicts with the\napparent orientation of the ballistic jet ($\\leqslant$45 degrees). In addition,\nboth the photon index and the electron temperature increase during the\ntransition from hard to soft state. It seems that the corona evolves from dense\nlow-temperature in the LHS to tenuous high-temperature after the state\ntransition, which indicates that the state transition is accompanied by the\nevolution of the coronal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 13:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 08:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The reliability of the software was then estimated and\ncompared to existing operational data of the sensor device.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a new class of assumptions for compositional\nsynthesis, which we call information flow assumptions. Such assumptions capture\nan essential aspect of distributed computing, because components often need to\nact upon information that is available only in other components. The presence\nof a certain flow of information is therefore often a necessary requirement,\nwhile the actual behavior that establishes the information flow is\nunconstrained. In contrast to behavioral assumptions, which are properties of\nindividual computation traces, information flow assumptions are\nhyperproperties, i.e., properties of sets of traces. We present a method for\nthe automatic derivation of information-flow assumptions from a temporal logic\nspecification of the system.

First, we derive a normalized gradient flow for three-layer ReLU NNs and\nobtain two key independent quantities to distinguish different dynamical\nregimes for common initialization methods. With carefully designed experiments\nand a large computation cost, for both synthetic datasets and real datasets, we\nfind that the dynamics of each layer also could be divided into a linear regime\nand a condensed regime, separated by a critical regime. The criteria is the\nrelative change of input weights (the input weight of a hidden neuron consists\nof the weight from its input layer to the hidden neuron and its bias term) as\nthe width approaches infinity during the training, which tends to $0$,\n$+\\infty$ and $O(1)$, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that\ndifferent layers can lie in different dynamical regimes in a training process\nwithin a deep NN.

Through experiments under\nthree-layer condition, our phase diagram suggests a complicated dynamical\nregimes consisting of three possible regimes, together with their mixture, for\ndeep NNs and provides a guidance for studying deep NNs in different\ninitialization regimes, which reveals the possibility of completely different\ndynamics emerging within a deep NN for its different layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 14:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 16:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Under pressure, the singlet state does not\ndevelop the expected excitonic magnetism but experiences two successive\ntransitions to other nonmagnetic phases, first to an intermediate phase with\nmoderate distortion of honeycomb lattice, and eventually to a high-pressure\nphase with very short Ru-Ru dimer bonds. While the strong dimerization in the\nhigh-pressure phase originates from a molecular orbital formation as in the\nsister compound Li$_2$RuO$_3$, the intermediate phase represents a\nspin-orbit-coupled $J$-dimer state which is stabilized by the admixture of\nupper-lying $J_{\\rm eff} = 1$-derived states.

The sparse expert is designed based on\nhand-crafted rules which is suboptimal but provides a risk-averse strategy by\nenforcing experience for critical scenarios such as pedestrian and vehicle\navoidance, and traffic light detection. As it has been demonstrated, training a\nRL agent from scratch is data-inefficient and time consuming particularly for\nthe urban driving task, due to the complexity of situations stemming from the\nvast size of state space. Our SIRL strategy provides a solution to solve these\nproblems by fusing the output distribution of the sparse expert policy and the\nRL policy to generate a composite driving policy. With the guidance of the\nsparse expert during the early training stage, SIRL strategy accelerates the\ntraining process and keeps the RL exploration from causing a catastrophe\noutcome, and ensures safe exploration. To some extent, the SIRL agent is\nimitating the driving expert's behavior.

To reach this objective, these techniques are\ndeeply rooted on principles and theoretical constraints. Restricting the\ninterest on the IQA of the set of natural images, it is first recognized that\napplication of estimation theory and psycho physical principles to images\ndegraded by Gaussian blur leads to a so-called canonical IQA method, whose\nestimates are not only highly linearly correlated to subjective scores, but are\nalso straightforwardly related to the Viewing Distance (VD).

We then perform a limited number\nof finer simulations with transport and collision dynamics to correct the bias.\nThe efficiency of the multilevel method depends on being able to perform\ncorrelated simulations of particles on a hierarchy of discretization levels. We\npresent a method for correlating particle trajectories and present both an\nanalysis and numerical experiments. We demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces the cost of particle simulations in high-collisional\nregimes, compared with prior work, indicating significant potential for\nadopting these schemes in various areas of active research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 15:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 22:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 23:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

These maps are not typically available at less than annual intervals\ndue to persistent cloud cover in many parts of the world, especially the\ntropics where most of the world's forest biomass is concentrated. Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR) can fill this gap as it penetrates clouds.

This\nmethod achieves a change detection sensitivity (producer's accuracy) of 96.5%\nin the study area, although false positives lead to a lower user's accuracy of\nabout 75.7%, with a total balanced accuracy of 90.4%.

Although in general the origin of the\nemission is robustly identified as synchrotron radiation from the\nshock-accelerated electrons, many aspects remain poorly constrained, such as\nthe role of inverse Compton emission, the particle acceleration mechanism, the\nproperties of the environment and of the GRB jet itself. The extension of the\nafterglow emission into the TeV band has been discussed and theorized for\nyears, but has eluded for a long time the observations. Recently the Cherenkov\ntelescopes MAGIC and H.E.S.S. have unequivocally proven that afterglow\nradiation is produced also above $100$\\,GeV, up to at least a few TeV. The\naccessibility of the TeV spectral window will largely improve with the upcoming\nfacility CTA ({the} Cherenkov Telescope Array). In this review article, we\nfirst revise the current model for afterglow emission in GRBs, its limitations\nand open issues. Then we describe the recent detections of very high energy\nemission from GRBs and the origin of this radiation. Implications on the\nunderstanding of afterglow radiation and constraints on the physics of the\ninvolved processes will be deeply investigated, showing how future\nobservations, especially {by} the CTA Observatory, are expected to give a key\ncontribution in improving our comprehension of such elusive sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 15:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

We make two contributions that collectively aim to\naddress these difficulties. Firstly, we develop a novel adaptive assembly free\nimpl-exp (AAF-IE) temporal integration scheme for nonlinear constitutive\nmodels. This scheme prevents the convergence issues that arise when implicit\nalgorithms are employed to model softening. Our AAF-IE scheme autonomously\nadjusts step sizes to capture intricate history dependent deformations. It also\ndispenses with reassembling the stiffness matrices amid runtime for\nelasto-plasticity and damage models which, in turn, dramatically reduces memory\nfootprints. Secondly, we propose an adaptive clustering-based domain\ndecomposition strategy to dramatically reduce the spatial degrees of freedom by\nagglomerating close-by finite element nodes into a limited number of clusters.\nOur adaptive clustering scheme has static and dynamic stages that are carried\nout during offline and online analyses, respectively. The adaptive strategy\ndetermines the cluster density based on spatial discontinuity and controls\nadaptive clusters via field estimations. As demonstrated by numerical\nexperiments the proposed adaptive method strikes a good balance between\nefficiency and accuracy for fracture simulations.

Typical localisation methods make use of the time of arrival\nof waves emitted or reflected from the damage, the simplest of which involves\ntriangulation. It is useful to decompose the measured signal into the expected\nwaves propagating directly from the actuation source in the absence of damage,\nand for this paper referred to as nominal waves. This decomposition allows for\ndetermination of waves reflected from damage, boundaries or other local\ninhomogeneities. Previous decomposition methods make use of accurate analytical\nmodels, but there is a gap in methods of decomposition for complex materials\nand structures. A new method is shown here which uses a Bayesian approach to\ndecompose single-source signals, which has the advantage of quantification of\nthe uncertainty of the expected signal. Furthermore, the approach produces\ninherent parametric features which correlate to known physics of guided waves.\nIn this paper, the decomposition method is demonstrated on data from a\nsimulation of guided wave propagation in a small aluminium plate, using the\nlocal interaction simulation approach, for a damaged and undamaged case.\nAnalysis of the decomposition method is done in three ways; inspect individual\ndecomposed signals, track the inherently produced parametric features along\npropagation distance, and use method in a localisation strategy. The Bayesian\ndecomposition was found to work well for the assessment criteria mentioned\nabove. The use of these waves in the localisation method returned estimates\naccurate to within 1mm in many sensor configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 15:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

We postulate that such systems need to jointly\noptimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target\ndomain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained\nnetwork to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided\nAttention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, HAL. The\nGATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target\nnetwork, complemented with the target samples mined by HAL using\ntransfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it\nis task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as\nclassification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output\nlabel space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it\ndoes not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive\nexperiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN,\nVISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document\nlayout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach,\nSALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3%(across datasets and tasks) over\nprior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated\nsource data for adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 05:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 09:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 11:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

We use three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical\nsimulations to study the interaction of coronal magnetic fields with emerging\nflux and determine the conditions that lead to eruptive activity. A simple\nparameter study is performed, varying the relative angle between emerging\nmagnetic flux and a pre-existing coronal dipole field. We find that in all\ncases, the emergence results in a sheared magnetic arcade that transitions to a\ntwisted coronal flux rope via low-lying magnetic reconnection. This structure,\nhowever, is constrained by its own outer field, and so is non-eruptive in the\nabsence of reconnection with the overlying coronal field. The amount of this\noverlying reconnection is determined by the relative angle between the emerged\nand pre-existing fields. The reconnection between emerging and pre-existing\nfields is necessary to generate sufficient expansion of the emerging structure\nso that flare-like reconnection below the coronal flux rope becomes strong\nenough to trigger its release. Our results imply that the relative angle is the\nkey parameter in determining whether the resultant active regions exhibit\neruptive behavior, and is thus a potentially useful candidate for predicting\neruptions in newly emerging active regions. More generally, our results\ndemonstrate that the detailed interaction between the convection\nzone/photosphere and the corona must be calculated self-consistently in order\nto model solar eruptions accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 16:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The myriad of options, however, has\nalso brought along a new layer of complexity. When it comes to procuring cloud\ncomputing resources, consumers can purchase their virtual machines from\ndifferent providers on different marketspaces to form so called cloud\nportfolios: a bundle of virtual machines whereby the virtual machines have\ndifferent technical characteristics and pricing mechanisms. Thus, selecting the\nright server instances for a given set of applications such that the\nallocations are cost efficient is a non-trivial task. In this paper we propose\na formal specification of the cloud portfolio management problem that takes an\napplication-driven approach and incorporates the nuances of the commonly\nencountered reserved, on-demand and spot market types. We present two distinct\ncost optimization heuristics for this stochastic temporal bin packing problem,\none taking a naive first fit strategy, while the other is built on the concepts\nof genetic algorithms. The results of the evaluation show that the former\noptimization approach significantly outperforms the latter, both in terms of\nexecution speeds and solution quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 09:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

The development of such general representations is essential,\nparticularly in domains such as manufacturing which intelligent processes and\nadaptive education can enhance. Despite the continuous accumulation of text in\nthese domains, the lack of structured data has created information extraction\nand knowledge transfer barriers. In this paper, we report on work towards\ndeveloping robust knowledge graphs based upon entity and relation data for both\ncommercial and educational uses. To create the FabKG (Manufacturing knowledge\ngraph), we have utilized textbook index words, research paper keywords, FabNER\n(manufacturing NER), to extract a sub knowledge base contained within Wikidata.\nMoreover, we propose a novel crowdsourcing method for KG creation by leveraging\nstudent notes, which contain invaluable information but are not captured as\nmeaningful information, excluding their use in personal preparation for\nlearning and written exams. We have created a knowledge graph containing 65000+\ntriples using all data sources. We have also shown the use case of\ndomain-specific question answering and expression/formula-based question\nanswering for educational purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 02:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

This system is\ndeveloped as a bio-physiological sensor in precise agriculture, as a tool in\nplant research and environmental biology, and for plant enthusiasts in smart\nhome or entertainment applications. The phytosentor measures main physiological\nparameters such as the leaf transpiration rate, sap flow, tissue conductivity\nand frequency response, biopotentials (action potentials and variation\npotentials), and can conduct electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with\norganic tissues. Soil moisture and temperature, air quality (CO2, NO2, O3 and\nother sensors on I2C bus), and general environmental parameters (light,\ntemperature, humidity, air pressure, electromagnetic and magnetic fields) are\nalso recorded in real time. In addition to phytosensing, the device can also\nperform phytoactuation, i.e. execute electrical or light stimulation of plants,\ncontrol irrigation and lighting modes, conduct fully autonomous experiments\nwith complex feedback-based and adaptive scenarios in robotic or biohybrid\nsystems. This article represents the revised and extended version of original\npaper and includes some descriptions and images from the FloraRobotica and\nBioHybrids projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 08:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}
