Predicting the 3D lane\nlayout is thus necessary and enables effective and safe driving. However,\nexisting 3D lane detection datasets are either unpublished or synthesized from\na simulated environment, severely hampering the development of this field. In\nthis paper, we take steps towards addressing these issues.

Using\nthese scores, we systematically evaluate different fusion methods on different\nmulti-modal datasets for different tasks. Our experiments suggest that for some\ntasks where different modalities are complementary, the multi-modal models\nstill tend to use the dominant modality alone and ignore the cooperation across\nmodalities. On the other hand, models learn to exploit cross-modal cooperation\nwhen different modalities are indispensable for the task. In this case, the\nscores indicate it is better to fuse different modalities at relatively early\nstages. We hope our scores can help improve the understanding of how the\npresent multi-modal models operate on different modalities and encourage more\nsophisticated methods of integrating multiple modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 16:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

In the case of a\ntraveling instability such a steady state is not possible and the fault only\nregains part of its frictional strength, depending on the seismic slip velocity\nand the traveling velocity of the shear band.

Currently, the\nstate-of-the-art performance in the such problems is achieved by nonparametric\nempirical Bayes methods. However, these approaches still suffer from two major\nissues. First, they solve a frequentist problem but do so by following Bayesian\nreasoning, posing a philosophical dilemma that has contributed to somewhat\nuneasy attitudes toward empirical Bayes methodology. Second, their computation\nrelies on certain density estimates that become extremely unreliable in some\ncomplex simultaneous estimation problems. In this paper, we study these issues\nin the context of the canonical Gaussian sequence problem. We propose an\nentirely frequentist alternative to nonparametric empirical Bayes methods by\nestablishing a connection between simultaneous estimation and penalized\nnonparametric regression. We use flexible regularization strategies, such as\nshape constraints, to derive accurate estimators without appealing to Bayesian\narguments. We prove that our estimators achieve asymptotically optimal regret\nand show that they are competitive with or can outperform nonparametric\nempirical Bayes methods in simulations and an analysis of spatially resolved\ngene expression data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 19:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 04:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

However, the determination of companion\nplants requires meticulous monitoring of plant growth. The technique of ocular\nmonitoring is often laborious and error prone. The availability of image\nprocessing techniques can be used to address the challenge of plant growth\nmonitoring and provide robust solutions that assist plant scientists to\nidentify companion plants. This paper presents a new image processing algorithm\nto determine the amount of vegetation cover present in a given area, called\nfractional vegetation cover. The proposed technique draws inspiration from the\ntrusted Daubenmire method for vegetation cover estimation and expands upon it.\nBriefly, the idea is to estimate vegetation cover from images containing\nmultiple rows of plant species growing in close proximity separated by a\nmulti-segment PVC frame of known size. The proposed algorithm applies a Hough\nTransform and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) to estimate the amount\nof vegetation cover within each segment of the PVC frame. The analysis when\nrepeated over images captured at regular intervals of time provides crucial\ninsights into plant growth.

The dependence of\nquantum yield in NADH on alcohol concentration was found to be similar in\nmethanol and ethanol and different from that in propylene glycol. The behavior\nof quantum yield in FAD was found to be almost independent of the type of\nalcohol and exhibited a dramatic 5--6 times increase with alcohol\nconcentration. A model describing molecular excited state relaxation dynamics\nin pico- and nanosecond time domain was developed on the basis on the quantum\nmechanical theory and used for analysis of the experimental results. In\nparticular, the model provided a new insight into the nature of the Decay\nAssociated Spectra (DAS) phenomenon. The analysis of the role of pico- and\nnanosecond quenching in NADH suggested that the picosecond decay in methanol\nand ethanol likely does not occur through electron transfer in the stacking\nconfiguration of the nicotinamide and adenine moieties, but through other\nmechanisms. However in propylene glycol the picosecond quenching in NADH\ndepended strongly on propylene glycol concentration and sharp increase of the\nmeasured quantum yield was associated with the contribution of both picosecond\nand nanosecond quenching mechanisms. The picosecond quenching to FAD was found\nto depend significantly on the any alcohol concentration suggesting that it\ngives a profound contribution to the rise of the measured quantum yield with\nalcohol concentration.

Some\nproposed methods require large amounts of mass transported from the Earth,\nothers require high energy consumption on the lunar surface, and others have a\nlong construction time. Each of these factors contributes direct and indirect\ncosts to lunar activities. The most important economic variables turn out to be\nthe transportation cost to the lunar surface and the magnitude of the program\ndelay cost imposed by a construction method. The cost of a landing pad depends\nsensitively on the optimization of the mass and speed of the construction\nequipment, so a minimum-cost set of equipment exists for each construction\nmethod within a specified economic scenario. Several scenarios have been\nanalyzed across a range of transportation costs with both high and low program\ndelay costs. It is found that microwave sintering is currently the most\nfavorable method to build the inner, high temperature zone of a lunar landing\npad, although other methods are within the range of uncertainty. The most\nfavorable method to build the outer, low temperature zone of the landing pad is\nalso sintering when transportation costs are high, but it switches to polymer\ninfusion when transportation costs drop below about \\$110K/kg to the lunar\nsurface. It is estimated that the Artemis Basecamp could build a landing pad\nwith a budgeted line-item cost of \\$229M assuming that transportation costs\nwill be reduced modestly from the current rate \\$1M/kg to the lunar surface to\n\\$300K/kg. A landing pad drops to \\$130M when the transportation cost drops\nfurther to \\$100K/kg, or to \\$47M if transportation costs fall below \\$10K/kg.\nUltimately, landing pads can be built around the Moon at very low cost, due to\neconomies of scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 01:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Instead, the facial landmark is a\nlow-dimensional and compact modality, which achieves lower computational cost\nand potentially concentrates on ME-related movement features. However, the\ndiscriminability of facial landmarks for MER is unclear. Thus, this paper\nexplores the contribution of facial landmarks and proposes a novel framework to\nefficiently recognize MEs. Firstly, a geometric two-stream graph network is\nconstructed to aggregate the low-order and high-order geometric movement\ninformation from facial landmarks to obtain discriminative ME representation.\nSecondly, a self-learning fashion is introduced to automatically model the\ndynamic relationship between nodes even long-distance nodes.

Apart from event extraction, we place\nspecial emphasis on event properties (Polarity, Modality, and Intensity)\nclassification to determine the factual certainty of each event.

However, its mechanism remains ambiguous yet and the\neffect is thus uncontrollable.

In this system, masses of\nWeyl nodes existing near the Fermi level, revealed by theoretical calculations,\nserve as Berry-curvature monopoles and low-effective-mass carriers. Based on\nthe Weyl picture, we propose a relation \\[\\text{MR}=\\frac{e}{\\hbar }B{{\\Omega\n}_{\\text{F}}}\\], with B being the applied magnetic field and \\[{{\\Omega\n}_{\\text{F}}}\\] the average Berry curvature near the Fermi surface, and further\nintroduce temperature factor to both MR/B slope (MR per unit field) and\nanomalous Hall conductivity, which establishes the connection between the model\nand experimental measurements.

Trust helps to resolve choices into a decision.\nHowever, the trust calculation depends on the amount of uncertainty present in\ndata sources. Trust in an IoT network is proportional to the amount of\nuncertainty generated by such sources as hardware malfunctions, network\nstability, adversarial issues, and the nature of data exchanged between the\nentities. The relationship between trust and uncertainty warrants approaches\ndesigned to maximize the former quality whilst minimizing the latter.\nUnfortunately, there is no consensus on an approach to ensure the\ntrustworthiness of IoT networks, in particular, addressing the uncertainty\nissues in a fine-grained way. This paper aims to explore a generalized\nframework designed to manage trust in IoT networks of varying scales. In the\nproposed framework, several sources of uncertainty are expressed as quantities,\ntrust ratings are calculated for individual entities in an IoT network, and a\nnetwork model capable of effectively distributing workloads to trustworthy\nnodes is proposed. We consider a practical use case of smart vehicular\nnetworks.

Most RL studies have focused on improving the efficiency of\nlearning to achieve the final goal faster.

That is, the agent cannot be under control to achieve other sub-goals in\nthe existing studies. If the agent can go through the sub-goals on the way to\nthe destination, the RL can be applied and studied in various fields.

The most popular approaches to\nestimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine\npredictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks\n(BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time,\nindustrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all\nthe issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study\nprincipled approaches to improve uncertainty property of a single network,\nbased on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty\nquantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance\nawareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing\nexample from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve\nhigh-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose\nSpectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that\nimproves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes:\n(1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz\nsmoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a\nGaussian process layer.

Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated\npilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the\ntransmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading.\nCPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink\ntransmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel\nstate information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss\ntwo specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based\nphase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control\nused by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse\npower control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if\ntheir corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level\ndetector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer\ndetection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous\nreal domain followed by a rounding operation.

However, as the generation mix shifts from synchronous generators to\nrenewable resources, power systems experience larger and faster frequency\nfluctuations due to the loss of inertia, which adversely impacts the frequency\nstability. This has motivated active research in algorithms that jointly\naddress frequency degradation and economic efficiency in a fast timescale,\namong which the distributed averaging-based integral (DAI) control is a notable\none that sets controllable power injections directly proportional to the\nintegrals of frequency deviation and economic inefficiency signals.\nNevertheless, DAI do not typically consider the transient performance of the\nsystem following power disturbances and has been restricted to quadratic\noperational cost functions. This manuscript aims to leverage nonlinear optimal\ncontrollers to simultaneously achieve optimal transient frequency control and\nfind the most economic power dispatch for frequency restoration. To this end,\nwe integrate reinforcement learning (RL) to the classic DAI, which results in\nRL-DAI. Specifically, we use RL to learn a neural network-based control policy\nmapping from the integral variables of DAI to the controllable power injections\nwhich provides optimal transient frequency control, while DAI inherently\nensures the frequency restoration and optimal economic dispatch.

In this work, we propose TinyLight, the first DRL-based ATSC model\nthat is designed for devices with extremely limited resources. TinyLight first\nconstructs a super-graph to associate a rich set of candidate features with a\ngroup of light-weighted network blocks. Then, to diminish the model's resource\nconsumption, we ablate edges in the super-graph automatically with a novel\nentropy-minimized objective function. This enables TinyLight to work on a\nstandalone microcontroller with merely 2KB RAM and 32KB ROM.

We\nprovide a detailed analysis of a computer-free, all-optical imaging method for\nseeing through random, unknown phase diffusers using diffractive neural\nnetworks, covering different deep learning-based training strategies. By\nanalyzing various diffractive networks designed to image through random\ndiffusers with different correlation lengths, a trade-off between the image\nreconstruction fidelity and distortion reduction capability of the diffractive\nnetwork was observed. During its training, random diffusers with a range of\ncorrelation lengths were used to improve the diffractive network's\ngeneralization performance. Increasing the number of random diffusers used in\neach epoch reduced the overfitting of the diffractive network's imaging\nperformance to known diffusers.

Based on the\ndecisions of all the players, each player receives a reward as per his/her\nutility function. However, classical models of BNPG game do not consider\naltruism, which players often exhibit and can significantly affect equilibrium\nbehavior. Yu et al. [24] extended the classical BNPG game to capture the\naltruistic aspect of the players. We, in this paper, first study the problem of\ndeciding the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) in a BNPG\ngame with altruism. This problem is already known to be NP-complete. We\ncomplement this hardness result by showing that the problem admits efficient\nalgorithms when the input network is either a tree or a complete graph. We\nfurther study the Altruistic Network Modification problem, where the task is to\ncompute if a target strategy profile can be made a PSNE by adding or deleting a\nfew edges. This problem is also known to be NP-complete. We strengthen this\nhardness result by exhibiting intractability results even for trees. A perhaps\nsurprising finding of our work is that the above problem remains NP-hard even\nfor bounded degree graphs when the altruism network is undirected, but becomes\npolynomial-time solvable when the altruism network is directed. We also show\nsome results on computing an MSNE and some parameterized complexity results. In\nsummary, our results show that it is much easier to predict how the players in\na BNPG game will behave compared to how the players in a BNPG game can be made\nto behave in a desirable way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 10:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

However, these methods rely on a critical assumption that\nthere is no treatment leakage: that is, the text only contains information\nabout the confounder and no information about treatment assignment. When this\nassumption does not hold, methods that control for text to adjust for\nconfounders face the problem of post-treatment (collider) bias. However, the\nassumption that there is no treatment leakage may be unrealistic in real-world\nsituations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible. Language\nappearing in a public policy document or health records may refer to the future\nand the past simultaneously, and thereby reveal information about the treatment\nassignment.\n  In this article, we define the treatment-leakage problem, and discuss the\nidentification as well as the estimation challenges it raises. Second, we\ndelineate the conditions under which leakage can be addressed by removing the\ntreatment-related signal from the text in a pre-processing step we define as\ntext distillation. Lastly, using simulation, we show how treatment leakage\nintroduces a bias in estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) and how\ntext distillation can mitigate this bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 13:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Researchers\nhave resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related\nquestions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun.\nNevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose\nunique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Here we\npropose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely Pressure-based Soft Agents\n(PSAs): they are bodies of gas enveloped by a chain of springs and masses, with\npressure pushing on the masses from inside the body. Pressure endows the agents\nwith structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents\nto assume a large gamut of shapes. Actuation takes place by changing the length\nof springs or modulating global pressure. We optimize the controller of PSAs\nfor a locomotion task on hilly terrain and an escape task from a cage; the\nlatter is particularly suitable for soft-bodied agents, as it requires the\nagent to contort itself to squeeze through a small aperture. Our results\nsuggest that PSAs are indeed effective at those tasks and that controlling\npressure is fundamental for shape-changing. Looking forward, we envision PSAs\nto play a role in the modeling of soft-bodied agents, including soft robots and\nbiological cells.

The methodologies employed involved\nthe analysis of the Jesuit churches that currently exist in this region,\nnamely, the on-site measurements of the orientations of eight churches\ncurrently standing and the ruins of a ninth church of which only a\nfree-standing bell tower and parts of the side walls remain preserved.

In this research, we address the question to which\nextent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through\nreward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of\ninstitutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL\nwith a Shapley value approximation method. In a second step, we design\ndifferent reward systems incentivizing contributions toward high predictive\nperformance or low bias.

In a typical document, most entity pairs do\nnot express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as \"none\" or \"no\nrelation\". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish\nsuch none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes\n(relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of\npre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of \"no\nrelation\". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations\nbetween the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal\npredictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that\nencourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined\nclass and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and\ncontext-dependent thresholding for label prediction.

A metasurface aperture consists of an array of subwavelength\nmetamaterial elements, each of which can be conceptualized as a radiating,\npolarizable dipole. An ideal polarizability distribution can be determined by\nusing a holographic approach to first obtain the necessary aperture fields,\nwhich can then be converted to a polarizability distribution using equivalence\nprinciples. To achieve this ideal distribution, the polarizability of each\nelement would need to have unconstrained magnitude and phase; however, for a\nsingle, passive, metamaterial resonator the magnitude and phase of the\neffective polarizability are inextricably linked through the properties of the\nLorentzian resonance, with the range of phase values restricted to a span of at\nmost 180 degrees. Here, we introduce a family of mappings from the ideal to the\navailable polarizability distributions, easily visualized by plotting both\npolarizabilities in the complex plane. Using one of these mappings it is\npossible to achieve highly optimized beam patterns from a metasurface antenna,\ndespite the inherent resonator limitations. We introduce the mapping technique\nand provide several specific examples, with numerical simulations used to\nconfirm the design approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 14:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

On the contrary, human and animal\nbrains are much less vulnerable. In contrast to the one-shot inference\nperformed by most deep neural networks, the brain often solves decision-making\nwith an evidence accumulation mechanism that may trade time for accuracy when\nfacing noisy inputs. The mechanism is well described by the Drift-Diffusion\nModel (DDM). In the DDM, decision-making is modeled as a process in which noisy\nevidence is accumulated toward a threshold. Drawing inspiration from the DDM,\nwe propose the Dropout-based Drift-Diffusion Model (DDDM) that combines\ntest-phase dropout and the DDM for improving the robustness for arbitrary\nneural networks. The dropouts create temporally uncorrelated noises in the\nnetwork that counter perturbations, while the evidence accumulation mechanism\nguarantees a reasonable decision accuracy. Neural networks enhanced with the\nDDDM tested in image, speech, and text classification tasks all significantly\noutperform their native counterparts, demonstrating the DDDM as a task-agnostic\ndefense against adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2022 06:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

Significant advances in 3D map-aided GNSS use\ngrid-based GNSS shadow matching alongside AI-driven line-of-sight (LOS)\nclassifiers and server-based processing to improve localization accuracy,\nespecially in the cross-street direction. Our prior work introduces a new\nparadigm for shadow matching that proposes set-valued localization with\ncomputationally efficient zonotope set representations. While existing\nliterature improved accuracy and efficiency, the current state of shadow\nmatching theory does not address the needs of risk-aware autonomous systems. We\nextend our prior work to propose Mosaic Zonotope Shadow Matching (MZSM) that\nemploys a classifier-agnostic polytope mosaic architecture to provide\nrisk-awareness and certifiable guarantees on urban positioning.

We weight the tree branches with the probability that the user\nis in line of sight of the satellite and expand the tree with each new\nsatellite observation. Our method yields an exact shadow matching distribution\nfrom which we guarantee uncertainty bounds on the user localization.
