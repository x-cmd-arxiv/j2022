Thus,\nwe will study a more generalized model of Stochastic Matching in which vertices\nand edges are both realized independently with some probabilities p_v, p_e,\nrespectively, which more accurately fits important applications than the\npreviously studied model.\n  We will discuss the first algorithms and analysis for this generalization of\nthe Stochastic Matching model and prove that they achieve good approximation\nratios. In particular, we show that the approximation factor of a natural\nalgorithm for this problem is at least $0.6568$ in unweighted graphs, and $1/2\n+ \\epsilon$ in weighted graphs for some constant $\\epsilon > 0$. We further\nimprove our result for unweighted graphs to $2/3$ using edge degree constrained\nsubgraphs (EDCS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 17:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Since the running\ntime of algorithms is a key resource in these fields, it is crucial in the\ncorresponding arguments to consider time-bounded variants of Kolmogorov\ncomplexity. While fruitful interactions between time-bounded Kolmogorov\ncomplexity and different areas of theoretical computer science have been known\nfor quite a while (e.g., [Sip83, Ko91, ABK+06, AF09], to name a few), the\naforementioned results have led to a renewed interest in this topic.\n  The theory of Kolmogorov complexity is well understood, but many useful\nresults and properties of Kolmogorov complexity are not known to hold in\ntime-bounded settings. This creates technical difficulties or leads to\nconditional results when applying methods from time-bounded Kolmogorov\ncomplexity to algorithms and complexity theory. Perhaps even more importantly,\nin many cases it is necessary to consider randomised algorithms. Since random\nstrings have high complexity, the classical theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov\ncomplexity might be inappropriate in such contexts.\n  To mitigate these issues and develop a theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov\ncomplexity that survives in the setting of randomised computations, some recent\npapers [Oli19, LO21, LOS21, GKLO22, LOZ22] have explored probabilistic notions\nof time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, such as $\\mathsf{rKt}$ complexity\n[Oli19], $\\mathsf{rK}^t$ complexity [LOS21], and $\\mathsf{pK}^t$ complexity\n[GKLO22]. These measures consider different ways of encoding an object via a\nprobabilistic representation.

On average red galaxies in the\nhigh-density environment are larger by 28% than the ones in low-density\nenvironments. In particular, we find one group of galaxies, subclass C3, whose\nincrease of size with time can be explained mainly as the result of mergers;\nfor other red subclasses, mergers would not seem to play a major role (subclass\nC2) or play a negligible role (subclass C1). The properties of the green\ngalaxies (subclasses C4-6) depend on whether their stellar mass is above or\nbelow a transition mass.

However, prejudices,\nmisconceptions, and lack of awareness reduce the diffusion of DC, hindering\ndigital transformation and preventing countries and people from realising their\nfull potential. Teaching Informatics in the curriculum is increasingly\nsupported by the institutions but faces serious challenges, such as teacher\nupskilling and support, and will require several years to observe sizeable\noutcomes. In response, grassroots movements promoting computing literacy in an\ninformal setting have grown, including EU Code Week, whose vision is to develop\ncomputing skills while promoting diversity and raising awareness of the\nimportance of digital skills. Code Week participation is a form of public\nengagement that could be affected by socio-economic and demographic factors, as\nany other form of participation. The aim of the manuscript is twofold: first,\nto offer a detailed and comprehensive statistical description of Code Week's\nparticipation in the EU Member States in terms of penetration, retention,\ndemographic composition, and spatial distribution in order to inform more\neffective awareness-raising campaigns; second, to investigate the impact of\nsocio-economic factors on Code Week involvement.

The rapid spread of the\nvirus, with its early-stage exponential growth and subsequent 'waves', caught\nmany medical professionals and decision-makers unprepared. Even though\nepidemiological models have been known for almost a century (since the 'Spanish\nInfluenza' pandemic of 1918-20), the real-life spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\noften confounded the modelers. While the general framework of epidemiological\nmodels like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) or SIR\n(susceptible-exposed-infected) was not in question, the behavior of model\nparameters turned out to be unpredictable and complicated. In particular, while\nthe 'basic' reproduction number, R0, can be considered a constant (for the\noriginal SARS-CoV-2 virus, prior to the emergence of variants, R0 is between\n2.5 and 3.0), the 'effective' reproduction number, R(t), was a complex function\nof time, influenced by human behavior in response to the pandemic (e.g.,\nmasking, lockdowns, transition to remote work, etc.) To better understand these\nphenomena, we model the first year of the pandemic (between February 2020 and\nFebruary 2021) for a number of localities (fifty US states, as well as several\ncountries) using a simple SIR model. We show that the evolution of the pandemic\ncan be described quite successfully by assuming that R(t) behaves in a\n'viscoelastic' manner, as a sum of two or three 'damped oscillators' with\ndifferent natural frequencies and damping coefficients. These oscillators\nlikely correspond to different sub-populations having different reactions to\nproposed mitigation measures. The proposed approach can offer future data\nmodelers new ways to fit the reproduction number evolution with time (as\ncompared to the purely data-driven approaches most prevalent today).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 19:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Effective synthesis\nfor expressions using given characteristics can make great contributions to\nhealth risk management and medical decision-making. For example, predicting the\nresulting physiological symptoms on patients from given treatment\ncharacteristics is helpful for the disease prevention and personalized\ntreatment strategy design. Therefore, the objective of this study is to\neffectively synthesize the expressions based on given characteristics. However,\nthe mapping from characteristics to expressions is usually from a relatively\nlow dimension space to a high dimension space, but most of the existing methods\nsuch as regression models could not effectively handle such mapping. Besides,\nthe relationship between characteristics and expressions may contain not only\ndeterministic patterns, but also stochastic patterns. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposed a novel selective ensemble\ncharacteristic-to-expression synthesis (SE-CTES) approach inspired by\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN). The novelty of the proposed method can be\nsummarized into three aspects: (1) GAN-based architecture for deep neural\nnetworks are incorporated to learn the relatively low dimensional mapping to\nhigh dimensional mapping containing both deterministic and stochastic patterns;\n(2) the weights of the two mismatching errors in the GAN-based architecture are\nproposed to be different to reduce the learning bias in the training process;\nand (3) a selective ensemble learning framework is proposed to reduce the\nprediction bias and improve the synthesis stability. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive numerical simulation studies\nand a real-world healthcare case study were applied and the results\ndemonstrated that the proposed method is very promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 19:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

However, in contrast to direct bandgap TMDs monolayers, bulk\nsamples have an indirect bandgap that restricts their application as light\nemitters. On the other hand, the high refractive index of these materials seems\nideal for creating high-quality nanophotonic resonators with a strong Purcell\neffect. In this work, we fabricate Whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators\nfrom bulk (i.e., indirect bandgap) MoSe$_2$ using resistless scanning probe\nlithography and study their optical properties.\nMicro-photoluminescence($\\mu$-PL) investigation revealed WGM spectra of\nresonators with an enhancement factor of 100 compared to pristine flake.\nScattering experiments and modeling also confirm the WGM nature of spectra\nobserved. Temperature dependence of PL revealed two components of\nphotoluminescence. The first one quenches with decreasing temperature, the\nsecond one does not and becomes dominant. Therefore, this suggests that\nresonators amplify both direct and temperature-activated indirect PL. Thus,\nhere we demonstrated the novel approach to fabricating nanophotonic resonators\nfrom bulk TMDs and obtaining PL from indirect bandgap materials. We believe\nthat the suggested approach and structures have great prospects in\nnanophotonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 19:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 08:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 11:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

This separation\npresents an opportunity for automated approaches to generate instance data that\ndefine instances that are graded (solvable at a certain difficulty level for a\nsolver) or can discriminate between two solving approaches. In this paper, we\nintroduce a framework that combines these two properties to generate a large\nnumber of benchmark instances, purposely generated for effective and\ninformative benchmarking. We use five problems that were used in the MiniZinc\ncompetition to demonstrate the usage of our framework.

The prompt detection of ransomware attacks is required to minimize\nfurther damage, particularly during the encryption stage. However, the\nfrequency and structure of the observed ransomware attack data makes this task\ndifficult to accomplish in practice. The data corresponding to ransomware\nattacks represents temporal, high-dimensional sparse signals, with limited\nrecords and very imbalanced classes. While traditional deep learning models\nhave been able to achieve state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of\ndomains, Bayesian Neural Networks, which are a class of probabilistic models,\nare better suited to the issues of the ransomware data.

Our 2d\nsimulated system consists of soft particles and fixed \"pins\", both of which\nharmonically repel overlaps. On one hand, we find that many of the critical\nscalings associated with jamming in the absence of pins continue to hold in the\npresence of even dense pin latices. On the other hand, the presence of pins\nlowers the jamming threshold, in a universal way at low pin densities and a\ngeometry-dependent manner at high pin densities, producing packings with lower\ndensities and fewer contacts between particles. The onset of strong lattice\ndependence coincides with the development of bond-orientational order.\nFurthermore, the presence of pins dramatically modifies the network of forces,\nwith both unusually weak and unusually strong forces becoming more abundant.\nThe spatial organization of this force network depends on pin geometry and is\ndescribed in detail. Using persistent homology we demonstrate that pins modify\nthe topology of the network. Finally, we observe clear signatures of this\ndeveloping bond-orientational order and broad force distribution in the elastic\nmoduli which characterize the linear response of these packings to strain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 23:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 19:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive\nbias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for\nattention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more\ncompressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization,\nas a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and\nwill contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression\nof representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution\nwhich divides computation into two streams.

It is well known that an epoch of cosmic\ninflation, in the very early universe, can produce PGWs, which leave an imprint\non the CMB in form of odd parity $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we study\nthe performance of the component separation and parameter estimation pipelines\nin context of constraining the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Based on\nthe simulated data for one observation season, we compare five different\npipelines with different working principles. Three pipelines perform component\nseparation at map or spectra level before estimating $r$ from the cleaned\nspectra, while the other two pipelines performs a global fit for both\nforeground parameters and $r$.

As it is expensive to record binaural audio from the\nreal world, synthesizing them from mono audio has attracted increasing\nattention. This synthesis process involves not only the basic physical warping\nof the mono audio, but also room reverberations and head/ear related\nfiltrations, which, however, are difficult to accurately simulate in\ntraditional digital signal processing. In this paper, we formulate the\nsynthesis process from a different perspective by decomposing the binaural\naudio into a common part that shared by the left and right channels as well as\na specific part that differs in each channel. Accordingly, we propose\nBinauralGrad, a novel two-stage framework equipped with diffusion models to\nsynthesize them respectively. Specifically, in the first stage, the common\ninformation of the binaural audio is generated with a single-channel diffusion\nmodel conditioned on the mono audio, based on which the binaural audio is\ngenerated by a two-channel diffusion model in the second stage. Combining this\nnovel perspective of two-stage synthesis with advanced generative models (i.e.,\nthe diffusion models),the proposed BinauralGrad is able to generate accurate\nand high-fidelity binaural audio samples. Experiment results show that on a\nbenchmark dataset, BinauralGrad outperforms the existing baselines by a large\nmargin in terms of both object and subject evaluation metrics (Wave L2: 0.128\nvs. 0.157, MOS: 3.80 vs. 3.61).

An\neffective remedy is adversarial weight perturbation, which injects the\nworst-case weight perturbation during network training by maximizing the\nclassification loss on adversarial examples. Adversarial weight perturbation\nhelps reduce the robust generalization gap; however, it also undermines the\nrobustness improvement. A criterion that regulates the weight perturbation is\ntherefore crucial for adversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a\ncriterion, namely Loss Stationary Condition (LSC) for constrained perturbation.\nWith LSC, we find that it is essential to conduct weight perturbation on\nadversarial data with small classification loss to eliminate robust\noverfitting. Weight perturbation on adversarial data with large classification\nloss is not necessary and may even lead to poor robustness. Based on these\nobservations, we propose a robust perturbation strategy to constrain the extent\nof weight perturbation. The perturbation strategy prevents deep networks from\noverfitting while avoiding the side effect of excessive weight perturbation,\nsignificantly improving the robustness of adversarial training. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the\nstate-of-the-art adversarial training methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 03:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

In\ntheory, neutrinos having masses could result in lepton flavour not being a\nsymmetry called Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV). While SM theory extensions\nallowed LFV processes, their branching fractions are too small, making them\nunobservable even with the strongest equipment up-to-date. With that,\nscientists in recent years have generated LFV-like processes from the combined\nLHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated data in an attempt to identify LFV using\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep\nLearning (DL). In this paper, the performance of several algorithms in AI has\nbeen presented, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, custom 1-D Dense Block Neural\nNetworks (DBNNs), and custom 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in\nidentifying LFV signals, specifically $\\tau^{-} \\rightarrow\n\\mu^{-}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}$ decay from the combined LHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated\ndata that imitates the signatures of the said decay.

Most existing sequential\nrecommendation methods only exploit the local context information of an\nindividual interaction sequence and learn model parameters solely based on the\nitem prediction loss.

This paper proposes a novel recommendation framework, namely\nGraph Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation (GCL4SR).\nSpecifically, GCL4SR employs a Weighted Item Transition Graph (WITG), built\nbased on interaction sequences of all users, to provide global context\ninformation for each interaction and weaken the noise information in the\nsequence data. Moreover, GCL4SR uses subgraphs of WITG to augment the\nrepresentation of each interaction sequence. Two auxiliary learning objectives\nhave also been proposed to maximize the consistency between augmented\nrepresentations induced by the same interaction sequence on WITG, and minimize\nthe difference between the representations augmented by the global context on\nWITG and the local representation of the original sequence. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GCL4SR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 03:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 01:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In each of 2851 $^{12}$CO clouds with\n$^{13}$CO gas structures, the $^{13}$CO emission area generally does not exceed\n70$\\%$ of the $^{12}$CO emission area, and the $^{13}$CO integrated flux does\nnot exceed 20$\\%$ of the $^{12}$CO integrated flux.

For efficiently training\nrecommender retrievers on modern hardwares, inbatch sampling, where the items\nin the mini-batch are shared as negatives to estimate the softmax function, has\nattained growing interest. However, existing inbatch sampling based strategies\njust correct the sampling bias of inbatch items with item frequency, being\nunable to distinguish the user queries within the mini-batch and still\nincurring significant bias from the softmax. In this paper, we propose a\nCache-Augmented Inbatch Importance Resampling (XIR) for training recommender\nretrievers, which not only offers different negatives to user queries with\ninbatch items, but also adaptively achieves a more accurate estimation of the\nsoftmax distribution. Specifically, XIR resamples items for the given\nmini-batch training pairs based on certain probabilities, where a cache with\nmore frequently sampled items is adopted to augment the candidate item set,\nwith the purpose of reusing the historical informative samples. XIR enables to\nsample query-dependent negatives based on inbatch items and to capture dynamic\nchanges of model training, which leads to a better approximation of the softmax\nand further contributes to better convergence. Finally, we conduct experiments\nto validate the superior performance of the proposed XIR compared with\ncompetitive approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 05:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

These observations are confirmed by\nthe new experimental results reported in this paper. We investigate several\nmechanisms of decoherence and dissipation by using a combination of numerical\nand analytical techniques. The first microscopic model describes a magnetic\nmoment in external magnetic fields, interacting with a bath of two-level\nsystems acting as a source of decoherence and dissipation. The second model\ndescribes a collection of the identical, interacting magnetics moments, all\nsubject to the same magnetic fields. In this case, the many-body interactions\ncauses a decay of the Rabi oscillations. In addition, we also study the effect\nof the inhomogeneity of the microwave radiation on the decay of the Rabi\noscillations. Our simulation results show that the dynamics of a magnetic\nmoment subject to the two microwave fields with different frequencies and in\ncontact with an environment is highly nontrivial. We show that under\nappropriate conditions, and in particular at the Floquet resonance, the\nmagnetization exhibits sustained Rabi oscillations, in some cases with\nadditional beatings. Although these two microscopic models separately describe\nthe experimental data well, a simulation study that simultaneously accounts for\nboth types of interactions is currently prohibitively costly. To gain further\ninsight into the microscopic dynamics of these two different models, we study\nthe time dependence of the bath and system energy and of the correlations of\nthe spins, data that is not readily accessible experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 05:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Barriers to voting\nhave taken many forms over the decades. A history of violent explicit\ndiscouragement has shifted to more subtle access limitations that can include\nlong lines and wait times, long travel times to reach a polling station, and\nother logistical barriers to voting. Our focus in this work is on quantifying\ndisparities in voting access pertaining to the overall time-to-vote, and how\nthey could be remedied via a better choice of polling location or provisioning\nmore sites where voters can cast ballots. However, appropriately calibrating\naccess disparities is difficult because of the need to account for factors such\nas population density and different community expectations for reasonable\ntravel times.\n  In this paper, we quantify access to polling locations, developing a\nmethodology for the calibrated measurement of racial disparities in polling\nlocation \"load\" and distance to polling locations. We apply this methodology to\na study of real-world data from Florida and North Carolina to identify\ndisparities in voting access from the 2020 election. We also introduce\nalgorithms, with modifications to handle scale, that can reduce these\ndisparities by suggesting new polling locations from a given list of identified\npublic locations (including schools and libraries). Applying these algorithms\non the 2020 election location data also helps to expose and explore tradeoffs\nbetween the cost of allocating more polling locations and the potential impact\non access disparities. The developed voting access measurement methodology and\nalgorithmic remediation technique is a first step in better polling location\nassignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 06:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Following this,\nPadmanabhan proposed a novel idea that the expansion of the universe can be\ninterpreted as equivalent to the emergence of space with the progress of cosmic\ntime. In this approach, the expansion of the universe is described by what is\nknown as the law of emergence, which states that the expansion of the universe\nis driven by the difference between the number of bulk and surface degrees of\nfreedom in a region bounded by the Hubble radius. This principle correctly\nreproduces the standard evolution of a Friedmann universe. We establish the\nconnection of the law of emergence, which is conceptually different from the\nconventional paradigm to describe cosmology, with other well-established\nresults in thermodynamics. It has been shown that the law of emergence can be\nderived from the unified first law of thermodynamics, which can then be\nconsidered as the backbone of the law. However, the law of emergence is rich in\nstructure than implied by the First law thermodynamics alone. It further\nexplains the evolution of the universe towards a state of maximum horizon\nentropy. Following this, it can be considered that the first law of\nthermodynamics, along with the additional constraints imposed by the\nmaximisation of the horizon entropy, can together lead to the law of emergence.\nIn the present article, we first make a brief review of Padmanabhan's proposal\nand then studies its connection with the thermodynamics of the horizon in the\ncontext of Einstein's, Gauss-Bonnet, and more general Lovelock gravity\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 06:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, its implicit\nrepresentation causes difficulty in manipulating the models like the explicit\nmesh representation. Several recent advances in NeRF manipulation are usually\nrestricted by a shared renderer network, or suffer from large model size. To\ncircumvent the hurdle, in this paper, we present an explicit neural field\nrepresentation that enables efficient and convenient manipulation of models. To\nachieve this goal, we learn a hybrid tensor rank decomposition of the scene\nwithout neural networks. Motivated by the low-rank approximation property of\nthe SVD algorithm, we propose a rank-residual learning strategy to encourage\nthe preservation of primary information in lower ranks. The model size can then\nbe dynamically adjusted by rank truncation to control the levels of detail,\nachieving near-optimal compression without extra optimization. Furthermore,\ndifferent models can be arbitrarily transformed and composed into one scene by\nconcatenating along the rank dimension. The growth of storage cost can also be\nmitigated by compressing the unimportant objects in the composed scene. We\ndemonstrate that our method is able to achieve comparable rendering quality to\nstate-of-the-art methods, while enabling extra capability of compression and\ncomposition.

In these graphs, reachability among the nodes relies on paths that\ntraverse edges in chronological order (\\emph{temporal paths}). Unlike standard\npaths, temporal paths are not always composable, thus the reachability relation\nis \\emph{not transitive} and connected components do not form equivalence\nclasses.\n  We investigate the evolution of connected components in a simple model of\nrandom temporal graphs. In this model, a random temporal graph is obtained by\npermuting uniformly at random the edges of an Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graph and\ninterpreting the positions in this permutation as presence times. Phase\ntransitions for several reachability properties were recently characterized in\nthis model [Casteigts et al., FOCS 2021], in particular for one-to-one,\none-to-all, and all-to-all reachability. The characterization of similar\ntransitions for the existence of giant components was left open.\n  In this paper, we develop a set of new techniques and use them to\ncharacterize the emergence of giant components in random temporal graphs. Our\nresults imply that the growth of temporal components departs significantly from\nits classical analog. In particular, the largest component transitions abruptly\nfrom containing almost no vertices to almost all vertices at $p = \\log n / n$,\nwhereas in static random graphs (directed or not), a giant component of\nintermediate size arises first, and keeps steadily growing afterwards.

Such study can broaden the application of the\n$\\mu(I)$ rheology in natural and engineering systems and help establish a more\ngeneral constitutive model for complex granular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 07:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

However, the prior seq2seq pretraining models\ngenerally focus on reconstructive objectives on the decoder side and neglect\nthe effect of encoder-side supervision, which we argue may lead to sub-optimal\nperformance. To verify our hypothesis, we first empirically study the\nfunctionalities of the encoder and decoder in seq2seq pretrained language\nmodels, and find that the encoder takes an important but under-exploitation\nrole than the decoder regarding the downstream performance and neuron\nactivation. Therefore, we propose an encoding-enhanced seq2seq pretraining\nstrategy, namely E2S2, which improves the seq2seq models via integrating more\nefficient self-supervised information into the encoders. Specifically, E2S2\nadopts two self-supervised objectives on the encoder side from two aspects: 1)\nlocally denoising the corrupted sentence (denoising objective); and 2) globally\nlearning better sentence representations (contrastive objective). With the help\nof both objectives, the encoder can effectively distinguish the noise tokens\nand capture high-level (i.e. syntactic and semantic) knowledge, thus\nstrengthening the ability of seq2seq model to accurately achieve the\nconditional generation. On a large diversity of downstream natural language\nunderstanding and generation tasks, E2S2 dominantly improves the performance of\nits powerful backbone models, e.g. BART and T5.

In this paper, we argue that simply changing this\nmap representation can bring notable benefits to graph learning tasks. Drawing\ninspiration from recent progress in geometry processing, we introduce a\nspectral representation for maps that is easy to integrate into existing graph\nlearning models.

Area-preserved branching conflicts with energy minimization and hence the\nleast-work principle. Additionally, while Kleiber's law is the dominant rule\nfor both animals and plants, small animals are observed to follow the 2/3-power\nlaw, large animals have larger than 3/4 scaling exponents, and small plants\nhave near-linear scaling behaviors. No known theory explains all the\nobservations. Here, I show that animals' metabolism is determined by their\nMurray's vascular systems. For plants, the scaling is determined by the trunks'\nhydraulic conductance and the leaves' photosynthesis. Both analyses agree with\ndata of various body sizes. Animals' scaling has a concave curvature while\nplants have a convex one. The empirical power laws are approximations within\nselected mass ranges. Generally, the 3/4-power law applies to animals of ~15 g\nto 10,000 kg and the 2/3-power law to those of ~1 g to 10 kg.

The online questionnaire\nconsisted of 39 questions addressing various aspects of RBE consideration in\nclinical practice, including treatment planning, patient follow-up and future\ndemands. Results: All 25 proton therapy centres responded. All centres\nprescribed a constant RBE of 1.1, but also applied measures (except for one eye\ntreatment centre) to counteract variable RBE effects such as avoiding beams\nstopping inside or in front of an organ at risk and putting restrictions on the\nminimum number and opening angle of incident beams for certain treatment sites.\nFor the future, most centres (16) asked for more retrospective or prospective\noutcome studies investigating the potential effect of the effect of a variable\nRBE.

A key idea of efficient\nimplementation is to discard the masked image patches (or tokens) throughout\nthe target network (encoder), which requires the encoder to be a plain vision\ntransformer (e.g., ViT), albeit hierarchical vision transformers (e.g., Swin\nTransformer) have potentially better properties in formulating vision inputs.\nIn this paper, we offer a new design of hierarchical vision transformers named\nHiViT (short for Hierarchical ViT) that enjoys both high efficiency and good\nperformance in MIM. The key is to remove the unnecessary \"local inter-unit\noperations\", deriving structurally simple hierarchical vision transformers in\nwhich mask-units can be serialized like plain vision transformers. For this\npurpose, we start with Swin Transformer and (i) set the masking unit size to be\nthe token size in the main stage of Swin Transformer, (ii) switch off\ninter-unit self-attentions before the main stage, and (iii) eliminate all\noperations after the main stage. Empirical studies demonstrate the advantageous\nperformance of HiViT in terms of fully-supervised, self-supervised, and\ntransfer learning.

People discover that fusing these two modalities can\nsignificantly boost the performance of 3D perception models as each modality\nhas complementary information to the other. However, we observe that current\ndatasets are captured from expensive vehicles that are explicitly designed for\ndata collection purposes, and cannot truly reflect the realistic data\ndistribution due to various reasons. To this end, we collect a series of\nreal-world cases with noisy data distribution, and systematically formulate a\nrobustness benchmark toolkit, that simulates these cases on any clean\nautonomous driving datasets.

A natural follow-up question is how\nto abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the\nprosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture\nnamed Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is\nto map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our\ngoal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of\nmodern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an\nencoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage\ndecomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a\nsequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity\nfor multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic\nperformance improvement guarantee.

Aims: We analyse emission\nmaps of cyclopropenylidene, c-C$_3$H$_2$, to study the distribution of the\ndeuteration throughout the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. Methods: We use\nsingle-dish observations of c-C$_3$H$_2$, c-H$^{13}$CC$_2$H, c-C$_3$HD, and\nc-C$_3$D$_2$ towards the pre-stellar core L1544, performed at the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. We derive the column density and deuterium fraction maps, and\ncompare these observations with non-LTE radiative transfer simulations.\nResults: The highest deuterium fractions are found close to the dust peak at\nthe centre of L1544, where the increased abundance of H$_2$D$^+$ ions drives\nthe deuteration process. The peak values are\nN(c-C$_3$HD)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.17\\pm0.01$,\nN(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2)=0.025\\pm0.003$ and\nN(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD$)=0.16\\pm0.03$, which is consistent with previous\nsingle point observations. The distributions of c-C$_3$HD and c-C$_3$D$_2$\nindicate that the deuterated forms of c-C$_3$H$_2$ in fact trace the dust peak\nand not the c-C$_3$H$_2$ peak. Conclusions: The N(c-C$_3$D$_2$)/N(c-C$_3$HD)\nmap confirms that the process of deuteration is more efficient towards the\ncentre of the core and demonstrates that carbon-chain molecules are still\npresent at high densities. This is likely caused by an increased abundance of\nHe$^+$ ions destroying CO, which increases the amount of carbon atoms in the\ngas phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 10:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Indeed, a recent\nstudy by B\\\"ohme and Zhu shows that four in every five bugs have been\nintroduced by recent code changes (i.e. regressions). In this paper, we take a\nclose look at the integration of fuzzers to CI/CD pipelines from both automated\nsoftware testing and continuous development angles.

Secondly, we investigate the impact of fuzzing campaign duration on\nthe CI/CD process: A shorter fuzzing campaign such as 15 minutes (as opposed to\nthe wisdom of 24 hours in the field) facilitates a faster pipeline and can\nstill uncover important bugs, but may also reduce its capability to detect\nsophisticated bugs. Lastly, we discuss a prioritization strategy that\nautomatically assigns resources to fuzzing campaigns based on a set of\npredefined priority strategies.

PSNet performs\nfeature transformation pointwise while the existing methods uses the spatial\nrelationship among the points as the reference for grouping.

Specifically, the algorithm completes in $\\widetilde{O}(D)$ rounds on\n(weighted) planar graphs or, more generally, any (weighted) excluded-minor\nfamily.\n  We obtain this result by designing an aggregation-based algorithm: each node\nreceives only an aggregate of the messages sent to it.

A limitation of QR is that it is only\ndefined for scalar target variables, due to the formulation of its objective\nfunction, and since the notion of quantiles has no standard definition for\nmultivariate distributions. Recently, vector quantile regression (VQR) was\nproposed as an extension of QR for vector-valued target variables, thanks to a\nmeaningful generalization of the notion of quantiles to multivariate\ndistributions via optimal transport.

This has motivated the research in\nself-supervised transformer pretraining, which does not need to decode the\nsemantic information conveyed by labels to link it to the image properties, but\nrather focuses directly on extracting a concise representation of the image\ndata that reflects the notion of similarity, and is invariant to nuisance\nfactors. The key vehicle for the self-learning process used by the majority of\nself-learning methods is the generation of multiple views of the training data\nand the creation of pretext tasks which use these views to define the notion of\nimage similarity, and data integrity. However, this approach lacks the natural\npropensity to extract contextual information. We propose group masked model\nlearning (GMML), a self-supervised learning (SSL) mechanism for pretraining\nvision transformers with the ability to extract the contextual information\npresent in all the concepts in an image. GMML achieves this by manipulating\nrandomly groups of connected tokens, ensuingly covering a meaningful part of a\nsemantic concept, and then recovering the hidden semantic information from the\nvisible part of the concept. GMML implicitly introduces a novel data\naugmentation process. Unlike most of the existing SSL approaches, GMML does not\nrequire momentum encoder, nor rely on careful implementation details such as\nlarge batches and gradient stopping, which are all artefacts of most of the\ncurrent self-supervised learning techniques.

In particular, the abnormal signals may emulate the normal signals,\nwhich makes it very challenging for abnormal signal recognition. In this paper,\nwe propose a new abnormal signal recognition scheme, which combines\ntime-frequency analysis with deep learning to effectively identify synthetic\nabnormal communication signals. Firstly, we emulate synthetic abnormal\ncommunication signals including seven jamming patterns. Then, we model an\nabnormal communication signals recognition system based on the communication\nprotocol between the transmitter and the receiver. To improve the performance,\nwe convert the original signal into the time-frequency spectrogram to develop\nan image classification algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can effectively recognize the abnormal signals under various\nparameter configurations, even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low\njamming-to-signal ratio (JSR) conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 11:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

In this work, crystal structure search algorithms are\nemployed to explore the possibility of forming new electrides in the As-Li\nsystem, where interstitial electrons behave as 1D electron chains (1D\nelectride) in Pmmm phase of AsLi$_7$ and transform into 0D electron clusters\n(0D electride) in P6/mmm phase at 80 GPa.

Webpage fingerprinting, an attack that analyzes encrypted traffic,\ncan identify the webpages visited by a user in a given website. Recent research\nworks have been successful in demonstrating webpage fingerprinting attacks on\nindividual users, but have been unsuccessful in extending their attack for\nmass-surveillance. The key challenges in performing mass-scale webpage\nfingerprinting arises from (i) the sheer number of combinations of user\nbehavior and preferences to account for, and; (ii) the bound on the number of\nwebsite queries imposed by the defense mechanisms (e.g., DDoS defense) deployed\nat the website.

In this work, we propose Snoopy, a\nfirst-of-its-kind framework, that performs webpage fingerprinting for a large\nnumber of users visiting a website. Snoopy caters to the generalization\nrequirements of mass-surveillance while complying with a bound on the number of\nwebsite accesses (finite query model) for traffic sample collection. For this,\nSnoopy uses a feature (i.e., sequence of encrypted resource sizes) that is\neither unaffected or predictably affected by different browsing contexts (OS,\nbrowser, caching, cookie settings). Snoopy uses static analysis techniques to\npredict the variations caused by factors such as header sizes, MTU, and User\nAgent String that arise from the diversity in browsing contexts. We show that\nSnoopy achieves approximately 90% accuracy when evaluated on most websites,\nacross various browsing contexts.

It is well known that XC functionals must\nsatisfy several exact conditions and physical constraints, such as density\nscaling, spin scaling, and derivative discontinuity. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that contrastive learning is a computationally efficient and\nflexible method to incorporate a physical constraint in ML-based density\nfunctional design. We propose a schematic approach to incorporate the uniform\ndensity scaling property of electron density for exchange energies by adopting\ncontrastive representation learning during the pretraining task. The pretrained\nhidden representation is transferred to the downstream task to predict the\nexchange energies calculated by DFT. The electron density encoder transferred\nfrom the pretraining task based on contrastive learning predicts exchange\nenergies that satisfy the scaling property, while the model trained without\nusing contrastive learning gives poor predictions for the scaling-transformed\nelectron density systems. Furthermore, the model with pretrained encoder gives\na satisfactory performance with only small fractions of the whole augmented\ndataset labeled, comparable to the model trained from scratch using the whole\ndataset. The results demonstrate that incorporating exact constraints through\ncontrastive learning can enhance the understanding of density-energy mapping\nusing neural network (NN) models with less data labeling, which will be\nbeneficial to generalizing the application of NN-based XC functionals in a wide\nrange of scenarios that are not always available experimentally but\ntheoretically justified. This work represents a viable pathway toward the\nmachine learning design of a universal density functional via representation\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 12:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

However, the market mechanisms for the\nintegration of the EHs into the energy markets are not sufficiently elaborated.\nThis paper proposes a flow-based two-level distributed trading mechanism in the\nregional electricity market with EH. At the lower level, the regional system\noperator coordinates the regional grids transactions in two markets, the local\nenergy market with EH and the wholesale market of the upstream grid. Every\nnodal agent as an independent stakeholder leverages price discrepancy to cross\narbitrage from different markets. At the upper level, the EH is a third player\nintending to maximize profit from trading in the regional electricity market\nand gas market. The regional electricity market clearing problem is formulated\nas a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, for which we develop an\nADMM-based distributed algorithm to obtain the equilibrium solution. The DC\npower flow is decomposed into optimization problems for the regional system\noperator and agents at different nodes, which can be solved in a distributed\nmanner to achieve global optimality without violating the privacy of players.\nCase studies based on a realistic regional grid verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm and show that the mechanism is effective in decomposing\npower flow and increasing energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 13:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Further, we allocate the novel\nunbiased estimators of explained variation to specific contributions of\ncovariates associated with fixed and random effects within a single model fit.\nThese parameter-wise explained variations constitute easily interpretable\nquantities, assessing dispersion relevance of covariates associated with both\nfixed and random effects on a common scale, thus allowing for a covariate\nranking.\n  For illustration, we contrast the variation explained by subjects and time in\nthe longitudinal sleep deprivation study. By comparing the dispersion relevance\nof population characteristics and spatial levels, we determine literacy as a\nmajor driver of income inequality in Burkina Faso. Finally, we develop a novel\nrelevance plot to visualize the dispersion relevance of high-dimensional\ngenomic markers in Arabidopsis thaliana.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 13:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 14:22:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

We characterize\nthe continuum and associated molecular line emission towards the most luminous\nprotostars, i.e., IRS1 and IRS3, on ~100 au (0. 2\") scales. IRS1 is partly\nresolved in millimeter and centimeter continuum, which shows a potential disk.\nIRS3 has a well resolved disk appearance in millimeter continuum and is further\nresolved into a close binary system separated by ~40 au at 9 mm. Both sources\nexhibit clear velocity gradients across their disk major axes in multiple\nspectral lines including C18O, H2CO, SO, SO2, and complex organic molecules\nlike CH3OH, 13CH3OH and CH3OCHO. We use an analytic method to fit the Keplerian\nrotation of the disks, and give constraints on physical parameters with a MCMC\nroutine. The IRS3 binary system is estimated to have a total mass of\n1.4-1.5$M_\\odot$. IRS1 has a central mass of 3-5$M_\\odot$ based on both\nkinematic modeling and its spectral energy distribution, assuming that it is\ndominated by a single protostar. For both IRS1 and IRS3, the inferred ejection\ndirections from different tracers, including radio jet, water maser, molecular\noutflow, and H2 emission, are not always consistent, and for IRS1, these can be\nmisaligned by ~50$^{\\circ}$. IRS3 is better explained by a single precessing\njet. A similar mechanism may be present in IRS1 as well but an unresolved\nmultiple system in IRS1 is also possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 13:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

An expected\nconsequence of fast rotation is strong internal mixing that deeply affects\ntheir evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and hence their\nionising power. aims: We investigate the impact on the ionising power of Pop\nIII stars in an extreme case of internal mixing, the one leading to chemically\nhomogeneous evolution (CHE). In that situation, during the main sequence phase,\nthe star keeps the same chemical composition from its center to its surface.\nHomogeneous stars have larger effective temperatures and luminosities than\nstars evolving non-homogeneously and thus are stronger ionising sources.\nMethods: The stellar evolution models are based on $n=3$ polytropes with a time\nvarying hydrogen mass fraction. The ionisation model employs the self-similar\nchampagne flow solution from Shu et al. (2002), as well as numerical\nsimulations for the stochastic treatment of star clusters over a grid of\nredshifts and halo masses. Results: We find that haloes containing chemically\nhomogeneous stars have an escape fraction of ionising photons about twice that\nof haloes containing classical Pop III stars.

State abstraction is a popular technique\nthat reduces the state space complexity. However, current state abstraction\nmethods for games depend on domain knowledge, making their application to new\ngames expensive. State abstraction methods that require no domain knowledge are\nstudied extensively in the planning domain. However, no evidence shows they\nscale well with the complexity of strategy games. In this paper, we propose\nElastic MCTS, an algorithm that uses state abstraction to play strategy games.\nIn Elastic MCTS, the nodes of the tree are clustered dynamically, first grouped\ntogether progressively by state abstraction, and then separated when an\niteration threshold is reached. The elastic changes benefit from efficient\nsearching brought by state abstraction but avoid the negative influence of\nusing state abstraction for the whole search. To evaluate our method, we make\nuse of the general strategy games platform Stratega to generate scenarios of\nvarying complexity. Results show that Elastic MCTS outperforms MCTS baselines\nwith a large margin, while reducing the tree size by a factor of $10$.

Among all the attempts to prevent over-smoothing, residual\nconnection is one of the promising methods due to its simplicity.

In this paper, we investigate the forward and backward behavior\nof GNNs with residual connections from a novel path decomposition perspective.\nWe find that the recursive aggregation of the median length paths from the\nbinomial distribution of residual connection paths dominates output\nrepresentation, resulting in over-smoothing as GNNs go deeper. Entangled\npropagation and weight matrices cause gradient smoothing and prevent GNNs with\nresidual connections from optimizing to the identity mapping.

In this paper, we propose to generate RealAEs in the feature space,\nleading to a simpler and more efficient solution. Our approach is driven by a\nnovel interpretation of Android malware properties in the feature space. More\nconcretely, we extract feature-space domain constraints by learning meaningful\nfeature dependencies from data and applying them by constructing a robust\nfeature space. Our experiments on DREBIN, a well-known Android malware\ndetector, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\ndefense, Sec-SVM, against realistic gradient- and query-based attacks.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that generating feature-space RealAEs is faster\nthan generating problem-space RealAEs, indicating its high applicability in\nadversarial training.

In\nthe analysis of such systems two aspects are of particular interest: 1) the\ntemporal patterns along which they evolve and 2) the underlying causal\nmechanisms. Time-series representations like discrete Fourier and wavelet\ntransforms have been widely applied in order to obtain insights on the temporal\nstructure of complex dynamical systems. Questions of cause and effect can be\nformalized in the causal inference framework. We propose an elementary and\nsystematic approach to combine time-series representations with causal\ninference.

To correctly\nidentify the global optimum rather than being trapped in an undesired local\noptimum, grid search is recommended for optimization. Unfortunately, the grid\nsearch method requires a pre-specified search interval that contains the\nunknown global optimum, yet no guideline is available for providing this\ninterval. As a result, practitioners have to find it by trial and error. To\novercome such difficulty, we develop novel algorithms to automatically find\nthis interval. Our automatic search interval has four advantages. (i) It\nspecifies a smoothing parameter range where the associated penalized least\nsquares problem is numerically solvable. (ii) It is criterion-independent so\nthat different criteria, such as GCV and REML, can be explored on the same\nparameter range. (iii) It is sufficiently wide to contain the global optimum of\nany criterion, so that for example, the global minimum of GCV and the global\nmaximum of REML can both be identified.

An actuator with\nmultiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing\nan effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having\ndiscrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and\nplanning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select\nboth the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to:\nfirst derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the\nbest actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to\nextract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple\npractical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a\nquadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global\nstability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 15:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

In order to investigate this\nlink, we have combined mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope\nwith a published star cluster candidates catalog for the Local Group galaxy\nM33. M33 is sufficiently close that the Spitzer's 8 micron images resolve\nindividual regions of star formation. Star clusters represent almost-single-age\nstellar populations, which are significantly easier to model than more complex\nmixtures of stars. We find a decrease in the 8 micron luminosity per unit\nstellar mass as a function of age of the star clusters, with a large scatter\nthat is consistent with varying fractions of stellar light absorbed by dust.\nThe decrease and scatter both confirm findings based on more distant galaxies\nand are well described by simple models for the dust emission of a young\nstellar population. We conclude that the dust emission at 8 micron depends\nsensitively on the age of the stellar population, out to at least the oldest\nage analyzed here, ~400 Myr.

The comparison of chiral potentials to the\nmeasured $\\rm{K}^{-}$p interaction indicates that, while the\n$\\pi\\Sigma-\\rm{K}^{-}$p dynamics is well reproduced by the model, the coupling\nto the ${\\rm \\overline{K}^0}$n channel in the model is currently\nunderestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 15:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 13:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

The method is free from the\nlimitations of other approaches since it does not require an assumption of the\nconstant mobility and the knowledge of the gate capacitance. Studies of a few\nsets of GFETs in the wide range of transverse magnetic fields indicate that the\ngMR effect dominates up to approximately 0.55 T. In higher fields, the physical\nmagnetoresistance effect starts to contribute. The advantages of the gMR\napproach allowed us to interpret the measured dependencies of mobility on the\ngate voltage, i.e., carrier concentration, and identify the corresponding\nscattering mechanisms. In particular, the range of the fairly constant mobility\nis associated with the dominating Coulomb scattering. The decrease in mobility\nat higher carrier concentrations is associated with the contribution of the\nphonon scattering. Analysis shows that the gMR mobility is typically 2-3 times\nhigher than that found via the commonly used drain resistance model. The latter\nunderestimates the mobility since it does not take the interfacial capacitance\ninto account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 15:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 17:51:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 01:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

This is achieved by generating a\nsmall yet representative sample of configurations for a system, which\ncircumvents testing the entire solution space. However, by design, most recent\napproaches for t-wise interaction sampling only consider combinations of\nconfiguration options from a configurable system's variability model and do not\ntake into account their mapping onto the solution space, thus potentially\nleaving critical implementation artifacts untested. Tartler et al. address this\nproblem by considering presence conditions of implementation artifacts rather\nthan pure configuration options, but do not consider the possible interactions\nbetween these artifacts. In this paper, we introduce t-wise presence condition\ncoverage, which extends the approach of Tartler et al. by using presence\nconditions extracted from the code as basis to cover t-wise interactions. This\nensures that all t-wise interactions of implementation artifacts are included\nin the sample and that the chance of detecting combinations of faulty\nconfiguration options is increased. We evaluate our approach in terms of\ntesting efficiency and testing effectiveness by comparing the approach to\nexisting t-wise interaction sampling techniques.

Algorithms that cluster time series can be classified into\ntwo groups: those that employ a time series specific distance measure; and\nthose that derive features from time series. Both approaches usually rely on\ntraditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-means. Our focus is on distance\nbased time series that employ elastic distance measures, i.e. distances that\nperform some kind of realignment whilst measuring distance. We describe nine\ncommonly used elastic distance measures and compare their performance with\nk-means and k-medoids clustering. Our findings are surprising. The most popular\ntechnique, dynamic time warping (DTW), performs worse than Euclidean distance\nwith k-means, and even when tuned, is no better. Using k-medoids rather than\nk-means improved the clusterings for all nine distance measures. DTW is not\nsignificantly better than Euclidean distance with k-medoids. Generally,\ndistance measures that employ editing in conjunction with warping perform\nbetter, and one distance measure, the move-split-merge (MSM) method, is the\nbest performing measure of this study. We also compare to clustering with DTW\nusing barycentre averaging (DBA). We find that DBA does improve DTW k-means,\nbut that the standard DBA is still worse than using MSM.

To this aim, a thermodynamic theory\nfor irreversible processes [referred to as the Thermodynamical Field Theory\n(TFT)] has been developed. The TFT rests upon the concept of equivalence\nbetween thermodynamic systems: \"The equivalent character of two alternative\ndescriptions of a thermodynamic system is ensured if, and only if, the entropy\nproduction and the Glansdorff-Prigogine dissipative quantity remain unaltered\nunder the thermodynamic forces transformation\". The TCT leads naturally to the\n\"Thermodynamic Covariance Principle\" (TCP) stating that \"The nonlinear closure\nequations, i.e., the flux-force relations, must be covariant under TCT\". In\nthis work, we provide the explicit expression of the nonlinear PDEs, subjected\nto the appropriate boundary conditions, which have to be satisfied by transport\ncoefficients when the skew-symmetric piece is absent.

This study presents a predictive model to predict\nthe mechanical and physical properties of PC using Extreme Gradient Boost\n(XGBoost). The compressive strength, tensile strength, density and porosity of\nPC was predicted using four models evaluated using different statistical\nparameters. These statistical measures are the root mean squared error (RMSE),\nsquare of correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE). The estimation of these properties by the\nXGBoost models were in agreement with the experimental measurements. The\nperformance of XGBoost is further validated by comparing its estimations to\nthose obtained from four corresponding support vector regression (SVR) models.\nThe comparison showed that XGBoost generally outperformed SVR with lower RMSE\nof 0.58, 0.17, 0.98 and 34.97 compared to 0.74, 0.21, 1.28 and 44.06 in SVR for\ncompressive strength, tensile strength, porosity, and density estimation\nrespectively.
