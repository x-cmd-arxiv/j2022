In this work, we explore how to extend\nself-attention modules to better learn subtle feature embeddings for\nrecognizing fine-grained objects, e.g., different bird species or person\nidentities. To this end, we propose a dual cross-attention learning (DCAL)\nalgorithm to coordinate with self-attention learning. First, we propose\nglobal-local cross-attention (GLCA) to enhance the interactions between global\nimages and local high-response regions, which can help reinforce the\nspatial-wise discriminative clues for recognition. Second, we propose pair-wise\ncross-attention (PWCA) to establish the interactions between image pairs. PWCA\ncan regularize the attention learning of an image by treating another image as\ndistractor and will be removed during inference.

Adopting the state-of-the-art description of primordial black hole\nmerger rates, we compare various signals with currently operating and planned\ndetectors. As already noted in the literature, our findings confirm that\ndetecting individual primordial black hole mergers with currently existing and\noperating proposals remains difficult. Current proposals involving\ngravitational wave to electromagnetic wave conversion in a static magnetic\nfield and microwave cavities feature a technology gap with respect to the\nloudest gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes of various\norders of magnitude.

In the same\nfrequency range, we note that alternative setups involving resonant cavities,\nwhose concept is currently under development, might represent a promising\ntechnology to detect individual merger events. We also show that a detection of\nthe stochastic gravitational wave background produced by unresolved binaries is\npossible only if the theoretical sensitivity of the proposed Gaussian beam\ndetector is achieved. Such a detector, whose feasibility is subject to various\ncaveats, may be able to rule-out some scenarios for asteroidal mass primordial\nblack hole dark matter.

Here I organize the policy\nimplications of economic complexity in a framework grounded on 4 Ws: \"what\"\napproaches, focused on identifying target activities and/or locations; \"when\"\napproaches, focused on when to time support for developing related and\nunrelated activities; \"where\" approaches, focused on the geographic diffusion\nof knowledge; and \"who\" approaches, focused on the role played by agents of\nstructural change. The goal of this framework is to clarify the policy\nimplications of recent work in economic complexity and to facilitate its\ncontinued use in regional and international development efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 16:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

We extended the analysis to a sample of 35 globular clusters, 20\nof them with observed tidal tails. We found that if the stellar density profile\nfollows a power law ~ r**(-alpha), the alpha slope correlates with the globular\ncluster present mass, in the sense that, the more massive the globular cluster\nthe smaller the alpha value. This trend is not found in globular clusters\nwithout observed tidal tails. The origin of such a phenomenon could be related,\namong other reasons, to the proposed so-called potential escapers or to the\nformation of globular clusters within dark matter mini-haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 16:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Ranking\nprediction models learn based on ordinal relationships, making them suitable\nfor integrating assay data from various environments. Existing studies of rank\nprediction in compound screening have generally used a learning-to-rank method\ncalled RankSVM. However, they have not been compared with or validated against\nthe gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based learning-to-rank methods that\nhave gained popularity recently. Furthermore, although the ranking metric\ncalled Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is widely used in\ninformation retrieval, it only determines whether the predictions are better\nthan those of other models. In other words, NDCG is incapable of recognizing\nwhen a prediction model produces worse than random results. Nevertheless, NDCG\nis still used in the performance evaluation of compound screening using\nlearning-to-rank. This study used the GBDT model with ranking loss functions,\ncalled lambdarank and lambdaloss, for ligand-based virtual screening; results\nwere compared with existing RankSVM methods and GBDT models using regression.\nWe also proposed a new ranking metric, Normalized Enrichment Discounted\nCumulative Gain (NEDCG), which aims to properly evaluate the goodness of\nranking predictions. Results showed that the GBDT model with learning-to-rank\noutperformed existing regression methods using GBDT and RankSVM on diverse\ndatasets.

This calls for fine-tuning methods robust to overfitting on small\ndatasets. In addition, generically pre-trained models are often not accustomed\nto the specifics of customer reviews and, after fine-tuning, yield summaries\nwith disfluencies and semantic mistakes. To address these problems, we utilize\nan efficient few-shot method based on adapters which, as we show, can easily\nstore in-domain knowledge. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, we add\nadapters and pre-train them in a task-specific way on a large corpus of\nunannotated customer reviews, using held-out reviews as pseudo summaries. Then,\nfine-tune the adapters on the small available human-annotated dataset. We show\nthat this self-supervised adapter pre-training improves summary quality over\nstandard fine-tuning by 2.0 and 1.3 ROUGE-L points on the Amazon and Yelp\ndatasets, respectively. Finally, for summary personalization, we condition on\naspect keyword queries, automatically created from generic datasets.

While most observed non-thermal long-wavelength\nspectra are associated with binarity, synchroton emission can have only a mild\ninfluence on single-star SEDs, requiring finer levels of wavelength sampling\nfor detection of the effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 16:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In classical linear panel models, this\ntrade-off concerns the homogeneity of slope parameters, and a large body of\ntests has been developed to validate this assumption. Yet, such tests can\ndetect inconsiderable deviations from slope homogeneity, discouraging pooling,\neven when practically beneficial. In order to permit a more pragmatic analysis,\nwhich allows pooling when individual heterogeneity is sufficiently small, we\npresent in this paper the concept of approximate slope homogeneity.

Importantly, RSG winds are too weak to drive the production of\nWolf-Rayets (WRs) and stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) at initial masses\nof roughly 20--40$M_{\\odot}$. If single-stars are to make WRs and SE-SNe, this\nshifts the burden of mass-loss to rare dust-enshrouded RSGs (DE-RSGs), objects\nclaimed to represent a short-lived high mass-loss phase. Here, we take a fresh\nlook at the purported DE-RSGs. By modeling the mid-IR excesses of the full\nsample of RSGs in the LMC, we find that only one RSG has both a high mass-loss\nrate (\\mdot $\\ge$ 10$^{-4}$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and a high optical\ncircumstellar dust extinction (7.92 mag). This one RSG is WOH G64, and it is\nthe only one of the 14 originally proposed DE-RSGs that is actually dust\nenshrouded. The rest appear to be either normal RSGs without strong\ninfrared-excess, or lower-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.

Whereas numerical studies have already\nestablished that in most practical settings binary power control is close to\noptimal, the extremal analysis shows not only that there exist settings where\nthe gain from optimal power control can be quite significant, but also bounds\nthe extremal values of such gains from a GDoF perspective. As its main\ncontribution, this work explicitly characterizes the extremal GDoF gain of\noptimal over binary power control as $\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{K}\\right)$ for all $K$.\nIn particular, the extremal gain is bounded between $\\lfloor \\sqrt{K}\\rfloor$\nand $2.5\\sqrt{K}$ for every $K$. For $K=2,3,4,5,6$ users, the precise extremal\ngain is found to be $1, 3/2, 2, 9/4$ and $41/16$, respectively. Networks shown\nto achieve the extremal gain may be interpreted as multi-tier heterogeneous\nnetworks. It is worthwhile to note that because of their focus on asymptotic\nanalysis, the sharp characterizations of extremal gains are valuable primarily\nfrom a theoretical perspective, and not as contradictions to the conventional\nwisdom that binary power control is generally close to optimal in practical,\nnon-asymptotic settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 17:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 18:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

Previous literature has\ndiscussed the potential issues of using the hazard ratio as a marginal causal\neffect measure due to its noncollapsibility property. In this paper, we\nadvocate using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) difference as the\nmarginal causal effect measure, which is collapsible and has a simple\ninterpretation as the difference of area under survival curves over a certain\ntime horizon. To address both measured and unmeasured confounding, a matched\ndesign with sensitivity analysis is proposed. Matching is used to pair similar\ntreated and untreated subjects together, which is more robust to outcome model\nmisspecification. Our propensity score matched RMST difference estimator is\nshown to be asymptotically unbiased and the corresponding variance estimator is\ncalculated by accounting for the correlation due to matching. The simulation\nstudy also demonstrates that our method has adequate empirical performance and\noutperforms many competing methods used in practice. To assess the impact of\nunmeasured confounding, we develop a sensitivity analysis strategy by adapting\nthe E-value approach to matched data.

In this\nwork we calculate the ionizing escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}$) of\nreionization-era galaxies from the state-of-the-art THESAN simulations, which\ncombine an accurate radiation-hydrodynamic solver AREPO-RT with the well-tested\nIllustrisTNG galaxy formation model to self-consistently simulate both\nsmall-scale galaxy physics and large-scale reionization throughout a large\npatch of the universe ($L_{\\rm box} = 95.5\\,\\rm cMpc$). This allows the\nformation of numerous massive haloes ($M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{10}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$), which are often statistically underrepresented in previous\nstudies but are believed to be important to achieve rapid reionization.

The variation in halo escape fractions\ndecreases for higher-mass haloes, which can be understood from the more settled\ngalactic structure, SFR stability, and fraction of sightlines within each halo\nsignificantly contributing to the escaped flux. We show that dust is capable of\nreducing the escape fractions of massive galaxies, but the impact on the global\n$f_{\\rm esc}$ depends on the dust model.

Previous hydrodynamic studies of ODDC\nhave shown that the basic instability saturates into a state of weak wave-like\nconvection, but that a secondary instability can sometimes transform it into a\nstate of layered convection, where layers then rapidly merge and grow until the\nentire region is fully convective. We find that magnetized ODDC has very\nsimilar properties overall, with some important quantitative differences. A\nlinear stability analysis reveals that the fastest-growing modes are unaffected\nby the field, but that other modes are. Numerically, the magnetic field is seen\nto influence the saturation of the basic instability, overall reducing the\nturbulent fluxes of temperature and composition.

Famous\nexamples are the nematic order in Fe-based superconductors and the\nstar-of-David charge density order in kagome metals. Such exotic symmetry\nbreaking in metals is a central issue of modern condensed matter physics, while\nits theoretical foundation is still unclear in comparison with the\nwell-established theory of superconductivity. To overcome this difficulty, here\nwe introduce the \"form factor\" that generalizes the nonlocal order parameter\ninto the Luttinger-Ward (LW) Fermi liquid theory. We then construct a rigorous\nformalism of the \"density-wave equation\" that gives the thermodynamically\nstable form factor, similarly to the superconducting-gap equation. In addition,\na rigorous expression of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy for the unconventional\norder is presented to calculate various thermodynamic properties. In the next\nstage, we apply the derived formalism to a typical Fe-based superconductor\nFeSe, by using the one-loop LW function that represents the free-energy gain\ndue to the interference among paramagnons. The following key experiments are\nnaturally explained: (i) Lifshitz transition (=disappearance of an\nelectron-pocket) due to the bond+orbital order below $T_c$. (ii) Curie-Weiss\nbehavior of the nematic susceptibility at higher T, and the deviation from the\nCurie-Weiss behavior at lower T near the nematic quantum-critical-point. (iii)\nScaling relation of the specific heat jump at $T_c$, $\\Delta C/T_c \\propto\nT_c^b$ with $b \\sim 3$. (Note that b=0 in the BCS theory.) These results lead\nto a conclusion that the nematicity in FeSe is the bond+orbital order due to\nthe \"paramagnon interference mechanism\".

Consequently, researchers can\nassess the plausibility of any exogeneity assumption by studying the\ndistributions of treatment given the unobservables that are consistent with\nthat assumption. We use this approach to study two common exogeneity\nassumptions: quantile and mean independence. We show that both assumptions\nrequire a kind of non-monotonic relationship between treatment and the\npotential outcomes. We discuss how to assess the plausibility of this kind of\ntreatment selection. We also show how to define a new and weaker version of\nquantile independence that allows for monotonic treatment selection. We then\nshow the implications of the choice of exogeneity assumption for\nidentification. We apply these results in an empirical illustration of the\neffect of child soldiering on wages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 18:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

The proposed method\nsubstantially reduces the computational requirements for runtime and memory.\nSimulated and in-vivo balanced MR-STAT experiments show similar reconstruction\nresults using the proposed algorithm compared to the previous sparse Hessian\nmethod, and the reconstruction times are at least 40 times shorter.\nIncorporating sensitivity encoding and regularization terms is straightforward,\nand allows for better image quality with a negligible increase in\nreconstruction time.

The technique involves adaptive spatiotemporal tracking of propagating\nintensity gradients and their characterization in terms of time-evolving\nKeplerian areas swept out by the position vectors of moving plasma blobs.\nWhereas gravity induces purely ballistic motions consistent with Kepler's\nsecond law, non-central forces such as the Lorentz force introduce non-zero\ntorques resulting in more complex motions. KODA algorithms enable direct\nevaluation of the line-of-sight component of the net torque density from the\nimage-plane projection of the areal acceleration. The method is applied to the\nprominence eruption of 2011 June 7, observed by the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Results obtained include\nquantitative estimates of the magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob\nmasses and energies across a vast region impacted by the post-reconnection\nredistribution of the prominence material. The magnetic pressure and energy are\nstrongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while the\ndynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the\nsubsequent falling phases.

This dispersion relation describes the zonal and radial\npropagation of acoustic waves and gravito-inertial waves. Thermal Rossby waves\nare just one class of prograde-propagating gravito-inertial wave that manifests\nwhen the buoyancy frequency is small compared to the rotation rate of the star.\nFrom this dispersion relation, we identify the radii at which waves naturally\nreflect and demonstrate how thermal Rossby waves can be trapped radially in a\nwaveguide that permits free propagation in the longitudinal direction.

Then, the\nprivacy-preserving local item patterns and biases from each client are shared\nwith the processor to perform joint factorization in order to extract the\nglobal item patterns. Extracted patterns are then aggregated to each client to\nbuild the local models via knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our approach with standard recommendation\ndatasets. FedSPLIT can obtain similar results than the state of the art (and\neven outperform it in certain situations) with a substantial decrease in the\nnumber of communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 23:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

To resolve the nonlocal pseudodifferential operator\nwith weakly singular symbol, CHASM further adopts the truncated kernel method\nto attain a highly efficient approximation.

As a topological wave, the TLCW propagates\nunidirectionally without scattering in complex boundaries. The TLCW is studied\ntheoretically as a spectral flow of the Hamiltonian\nPseudo-Differential-Operator (PDO) $\\hat{H}$ for waves in an inhomogeneous\nplasma. The semi-classical parameter of the Weyl quantization for plasma waves\nis identified to be the ratio between electron gyro-radius and the\ninhomogeneity scale length of the system. Hermitian eigenmode bundles of the\nbulk Hamiltonian symbol H for plasma waves are formally defined. Because\nmomentum space in classical continuous media is contractible in general, the\ntopology of the eigenmode bundles over momentum space is trivial. This is in\nstark contrast to condensed matters. Nontrivial topology of the eigenmode\nbundles in classical continuous media only exists over phase space. A boundary\nisomorphism theorem is established to facilitate the calculation of Chern\nnumbers of eigenmode bundles over non-contractible manifolds in phase space. It\nalso defines a topological charge of an isolated Weyl point in phase space\nwithout adopting any connection. Using these algebraic topological techniques\nand an index theorem formulated by Faure, it is rigorously proven that the\nnontrivial topology at the Weyl point of the Langmuir wave-cyclotron wave\nresonance generates the TLCW as a spectral flow. It is shown that the TLCW can\nbe faithfully modeled by a tilted Dirac cone in phase space. An analytical\nsolution of the entire spectrum of the PDO of a generic tilted phase space\nDirac cone, including its spectral flow, is given. The spectral flow index of a\ntilted Dirac cone is one, and its mode structure is a shifted Gaussian\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 01:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The typical way of conducting knowledge\ndistillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the\nteacher network to harness the knowledge at one or multiple spots (i.e.,\nlayers) in the teacher network. The distillation spots, once specified, will\nnot change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation\nprocess. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to\ntraining samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation\nstrategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the\ndistillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training\niteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on\n\"where to distill\" instead of \"what to distill\" that is widely investigated by\nmost existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation\nmethods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10\nstate-of-the-art distillers are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nSAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous distillation settings.

We conduct thorough empirical studies by comparing existing methods\non the constructed benchmark, and pay special attention on robustness of\nexisting methods against various scanning imperfections; we also study how\ndifferent methods generalize in terms of reconstructing complex surface shapes.\nOur studies help identify the best conditions under which different methods\nwork, and suggest some empirical findings. For example, while deep learning\nmethods are increasingly popular, our systematic studies suggest that,\nsurprisingly, a few classical methods perform even better in terms of both\nrobustness and generalization; our studies also suggest that the practical\nchallenges of misalignment of point sets from multi-view scanning, missing of\nsurface points, and point outliers remain unsolved by all the existing surface\nreconstruction methods. We expect that the benchmark and our studies would be\nvaluable both for practitioners and as a guidance for new innovations in future\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 03:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

A key research area that enables this transition is semantic\ncommunications, whereby the communication process conveys the meaning of\nmessages instead of being a mere reconstruction process of raw, naive data\nbits. In this paper, a novel quantum semantic communications (QSC) framework is\nproposed to develop reasoning-based future communication systems with quantum\nsemantic representations that are characterized with minimalism, efficiency,\nand accuracy. In particular, the concepts of quantum embedding and\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert spaces are exploited so as to extract the meaning of\nclassical data.

Quantum clustering enables extraction of\ncontextual information and distinct characterization of the semantics of the\nmessage to be conveyed. Subsequently, to successfully transmit the constructed\nsemantic representations, quantum communication links are used to transfer the\nquantum states. This new QSC framework exploits unique quantum principles such\nas the minimalism of entangled photons, quantum-semantic entropy of noise, and\nquantum fidelity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can save\naround 85\\% of quantum communication resources, i.e., entangled photons,\ncompared to semantic-agnostic quantum communication schemes.

Under this setting, we theoretically\ncharacterize the powers of both the iid sampling procedure and the adaptive\nsampling procedure and empirically find that the ART can uniformly outperform\nthe CRT that pulls all arms independently with equal probability. We also\nsurprisingly find that the ART can be more powerful than even the CRT that uses\nan oracle iid sampling procedure when the signal is relatively strong. We\nbelieve that the proposed adaptive procedure is successful because it takes\narms that may initially look like \"fake\" signals due to random chance and\nstabilizes them closer to \"null\" signals. We additionally showcase the ART to a\npopular factorial survey design setting known as conjoint analysis. We find\nsimilar results through simulations and a recent application concerning the\nrole of gender discrimination in political candidate evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 04:10:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 20:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Methods: 23 HE-patients and\n23 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Motor evoked potential (MEP)\namplitudes were assessed as measure for cortical excitability. Time courses of\nMEP amplitude changes after the PAS25 intervention were compared between both\ngroups. Results: MEP-amplitudes increased after PAS25 in the control group,\nindicating PAS25-induced synaptic plasticity in healthy controls, as expected.\nIn contrast, MEP-amplitudes within the HE group did not change and were lower\nthan in the control group, indicating no induction of plasticity. Conclusion:\nOur study revealed reduced synaptic plasticity of the primary motor cortex in\nHE. Significance: Reduced synaptic plasticity in HE provides a link between\npathological changes on the molecular level and early clinical symptoms of the\ndisease. This decrease may be caused by disturbances in the glutamatergic\nneurotransmission due to the known hyperammonemia in HE patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 06:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 06:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

We\nfound that $\\approx 30-40 \\%$ of the active regions are located far from disk\ncenter for all the bursts. It is found that most of the active regions\nassociated with stationary type IV bursts are close to disk center ($\\approx\n60-70 \\%$). The active regions associated with moving type IV bursts are more\nevenly distributed across the surface, i.e $\\approx 56 \\%$ and $\\approx 44 \\%$,\nclose to disk center and far from disk center regions, respectively. Most of\nthe burst having active region close to disk center indicate that these bursts\ncan be used to obtain physical properties such as electron density and magnetic\nfields of the coronal mass ejections responsible for geomagnetic storms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

In Twitter, users can connect\nwith other users by following them, who in turn can follow back. In recent\nyears, researchers studied several properties of social networks and designed\nrandom graph models to describe them. Many of these approaches either focus on\nthe generation of undirected graphs or on the creation of directed graphs\nwithout modeling the dependencies between reciprocal (i.e., two directed edges\nof opposite direction between two nodes) and directed edges. We propose an\napproach to generate directed social network graphs that creates reciprocal and\ndirected edges and considers the correlation between the respective degree\nsequences.\n  Our model relies on crawled directed graphs in Twitter, on which information\nw.r.t. a topic is exchanged or disseminated. While these graphs exhibit a high\nclustering coefficient and small average distances between random node pairs\n(which is typical in real-world networks), their degree sequences seem to\nfollow a $\\chi^2$-distribution rather than power law. To achieve high\nclustering coefficients, we apply an edge rewiring procedure that preserves the\nnode degrees.\n  We compare the crawled and the created graphs, and simulate certain\nalgorithms for information dissemination and epidemic spreading on them. The\nresults show that the created graphs exhibit very similar topological and\nalgorithmic properties as the real-world graphs, providing evidence that they\ncan be used as surrogates in social network analysis. Furthermore, our model is\nhighly scalable, which enables us to create graphs of arbitrary size with\nalmost the same properties as the corresponding real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

However, most existing methods pay less attention to the\nefficiency, making it still challenging to quickly extract relations from\nmassive or streaming text data in realistic scenarios. The main efficiency\nbottleneck is that these methods use a Transformer-based pre-trained language\nmodel for encoding, which heavily affects the training speed and inference\nspeed. To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model\n(FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging\nframework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to\nimprove efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE\nadopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated\nconvolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces\nthe computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the\nsatisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging\nframework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to\naccelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then\nutilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher\ntagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance,\nand achieves 3-10x training speed, 7-15x inference speed faster, and 1/100\nparameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is\nstill competitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 May 2022 01:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

The analysis uses data collected in\n$pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV during Run 2 of the LHC, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Both FCNC top-quark production\nand decay are considered. The final state consists of a charged lepton, missing\ntransverse momentum, a $b$-tagged jet, one high-momentum photon and possibly\nadditional jets. A multiclass deep neural network is used to classify events\neither as signal in one of the two categories, FCNC production or decay, or as\nbackground. No significant excess of events over the background prediction is\nobserved and 95% CL upper limits are placed on the strength of left- and\nright-handed FCNC interactions.

This raises the need for digital retouching of\nportraits in videos. However, applying portrait image editing directly on\nportrait video frames cannot generate smooth and stable video sequences. To\nthis end, we present a robust and easy-to-use parametric method to reshape the\nportrait in a video to produce smooth retouched results. Given an input\nportrait video, our method consists of two main stages: stabilized face\nreconstruction, and continuous video reshaping. In the first stage, we start by\nestimating face rigid pose transformations across video frames. Then we jointly\noptimize multiple frames to reconstruct an accurate face identity, followed by\nrecovering face expressions over the entire video. In the second stage, we\nfirst reshape the reconstructed 3D face using a parametric reshaping model\nreflecting the weight change of the face, and then utilize the reshaped 3D face\nto guide the warping of video frames. We develop a novel signed distance\nfunction based dense mapping method for the warping between face contours\nbefore and after reshaping, resulting in stable warped video frames with\nminimum distortions. In addition, we use the 3D structure of the face to\ncorrect the dense mapping to achieve temporal consistency. We generate the\nfinal result by minimizing the background distortion through optimizing a\ncontent-aware warping mesh. Extensive experiments show that our method is able\nto create visually pleasing results by adjusting a simple reshaping parameter,\nwhich facilitates portrait video editing for social media and visual effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 09:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

To this end, we propose a new real-time transition\nmethod to address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach consists of two\nkey components: motion manifold and conditional transitioning. The former\nlearns the important low-level motion features and their dynamics; while the\nlatter synthesizes transitions conditioned on a target frame and the desired\ntransition duration. We first learn a motion manifold that explicitly models\nthe intrinsic transition stochasticity in human motions via a multi-modal\nmapping mechanism.

We validate our method\non different datasets in tasks where no post-processing or offline computation\nis allowed.

The main contribution of our work is a new method called ICLL\nfor tackling IBC tasks which is not based on resampling training observations.\nInstead, ICLL follows a layered learning paradigm to model the data in two\nstages. In the first layer, ICLL learns to distinguish cases close to the\ndecision boundary from cases which are clearly from the majority class, where\nthis dichotomy is defined using a hierarchical clustering analysis. In the\nsubsequent layer, we use instances close to the decision boundary and instances\nfrom the minority class to solve the original predictive task.

For training efficiency and scalability, most of the\nMARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network.\nHowever, in many complex multi-agent tasks, different agents are expected to\npossess specific abilities to handle different subtasks. In those scenarios,\nsharing parameters indiscriminately may lead to similar behavior across all\nagents, which will limit the exploration efficiency and degrade the final\nperformance. To balance the training complexity and the diversity of agent\nbehavior, we propose a novel framework to learn dynamic subtask assignment\n(LDSA) in cooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoder\nto construct a vector representation for each subtask according to its\nidentity. To reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose an\nability-based subtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agents\nwith similar abilities into the same subtask. In this way, agents dealing with\nthe same subtask share their learning of specific abilities and different\nsubtasks correspond to different specific abilities. We further introduce two\nregularizers to increase the representation difference between subtasks and\nstabilize the training by discouraging agents from frequently changing\nsubtasks, respectively. Empirical results show that LDSA learns reasonable and\neffective subtask assignment for better collaboration and significantly\nimproves the learning performance on the challenging StarCraft II\nmicromanagement benchmark and Google Research Football.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 10:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 03:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 07:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Recent iris PAD solutions achieved good performance by\nleveraging deep learning techniques.

These PAD methods run the risk of\noverfitting because of the binary label supervision during the network\ntraining, which serves global information learning but weakens the capture of\nlocal discriminative features. This chapter presents a novel attention-based\ndeep pixel-wise binary supervision (A-PBS) method.

In this complementary\narticle, we propose a stochastic forward-looking methodology to calibrate\nclimate macro-correlation evolution from scientific climate data, for physical\nand transition efforts specifically. We assume a global physical and transition\nrisk, likened to persistent greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the\natmosphere. The economic risk is considered stationary and can therefore be\ncalibrated with a backward-looking methodology.

These parameters can be\ncalibrated using public data.

Inspired by the prominent success of a proportional-integral (PI)\ncontroller in various applications, this paper proposes a\nProportional-Integral-incorporated Non-negative Latent Factor (PI-NLF) model\nwith two-fold ideas: a) establishing an Increment Refinement (IR) mechanism via\nconsidering the past update increments following the principle of a PI\ncontroller; and b) designing an IR-based SLF-NMU (ISN) algorithm to accelerate\nthe convergence rate of a resultant model. Empirical studies on four HDI\ndatasets demonstrate that a PI-NLF model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmodels in both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy for missing\ndata of an HDI matrix. Hence, this study unveils the feasibility of boosting\nthe performance of a non-negative learning algorithm through an error feedback\ncontroller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 12:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2022 01:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Stellar parameters are among the most important characteristics in\nstudies of stars, which are based on atmosphere models in traditional methods.\nHowever, time cost and brightness limits restrain the efficiency of spectral\nobservations.

Recently, a few works showed inherent bias\nassociated with such attack (robustness bias), where certain subgroups in a\ndataset (e.g. based on class, gender, etc.) are less robust than others. This\nbias not only persists even after adversarial training, but often results in\nsevere performance discrepancies across these subgroups. Existing works\ncharacterize the subgroup's robustness bias by only checking individual\nsample's proximity to the decision boundary. In this work, we argue that this\nmeasure alone is not sufficient and validate our argument via extensive\nexperimental analysis. It has been observed that adversarial attacks often\ncorrupt the high-frequency components of the input image. We, therefore,\npropose a holistic approach for quantifying adversarial vulnerability of a\nsample by combining these different perspectives, i.e., degree of model's\nreliance on high-frequency features and the (conventional) sample-distance to\nthe decision boundary. We demonstrate that by reliably estimating adversarial\nvulnerability at the sample level using the proposed holistic metric, it is\npossible to develop a trustworthy system where humans can be alerted about the\nincoming samples that are highly likely to be misclassified at test time. This\nis achieved with better precision when our holistic metric is used over\nindividual measures.

A circuit permits the\ninstantaneous transmission of signals between the connected amoebots.

Second, we consider the global maximum problem, which identifies an\namoebot at the highest possible position with respect to some direction in some\ngiven amoebot (sub)structure. A solution to this problem can then be used to\nsolve the skeleton problem, where a (not necessarily simple) cycle of amoebots\nhas to be found in the given amoebot structure which contains all boundary\namoebots. A canonical solution to that problem can then be used to come up with\na canonical path, which provides a unique characterization of the shape of the\ngiven amoebot structure. Constructing canonical paths for different directions\nwill then allow the amoebots to set up a spanning tree and to check symmetry\nproperties of the given amoebot structure.\n  The problems are important for a number of applications like rapid shape\ntransformation, energy dissemination, and structural monitoring.

The semantic rate is considered for measuring\nthe performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge is that\nthere is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the\nsemantic similarity, which characterizes the sentence similarity between an\noriginal sentence and the corresponding recovered sentence. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose a data regression method, where the semantic similarity\nis approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained\ntractable function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication\nframework, where an access point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit\nstreams to one semantics-interested user (S-user) and one bit-interested user\n(B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission in\nmulti-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple\naccess (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More\nspecifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA is split into two streams, one is\ntransmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency sub-band and the\nother is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study\nthe fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the\nsemantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An\noptimal resource allocation procedure is then derived for characterizing the\nboundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved by each MA\nscheme.

A\nparticularly promising approach to overcome those difficulties is reduced\ndensity matrix functional theory (RDMFT): It abandons the complexity of the\n$N$-particle wave function and at the same time explicitly allows for\nfractional occupation numbers. It is the goal of this thesis to initiate and\nestablish a bosonic RDMFT for both ground state and excited state energy\ncalculations. Motivated by the Onsager and Penrose criterion which identifies\nRDMFT as a particularly suitable approach to describe Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs), we derive the universal functional for a homogeneous BEC in the\nBogoliubov regime. Remarkably, the gradient of the universal functional is\nfound to diverge repulsively in the regime of complete condensation. This\nintroduces the new concept of a BEC force, which provides a universal\nexplanation for quantum depletion since it is merely based on the geometry of\nquantum states. In the second part of the thesis, we propose and work out an\nensemble RDMFT targeting excitations in bosonic quantum systems. This endeavour\nfurther highlights the potential of convex analysis for the development of\nfunctional theories in the future. Indeed by resorting to several concepts from\nconvex analysis, we succeeded to provide a comprehensive foundation of\n$\\boldsymbol{w}$-ensemble RDMFT for bosons which is further based on a\ngeneralization of the Ritz variational principle and a constrained search\nformalism. In particular, we solve the emerging $N$-representability problem\nleading to a generalization of Pauli's famous exclusion principle to bosonic\nmixed states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 13:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) are a popular modelling framework to model\ndynamics with intrinsic randomness. Here, we focus on the inverse question: If\none has empirically measured time-series data from some system of interest, is\nit possible to discover the SDE model that best describes the data. Here, we\npresent PyDaddy (PYthon library for DAta Driven DYnamics), a toolbox to\nconstruct and analyze interpretable SDE models based on time-series data. We\ncombine traditional approaches for data-driven SDE reconstruction with an\nequation learning approach, to derive symbolic equations governing the\nstochastic dynamics. The toolkit is presented as an open-source Python library,\nand consists of tools to construct and analyze SDEs. Functionality is included\nfor visual examination of the stochastic structure of the data, guided\nextraction of the functional form of the SDE, and diagnosis and debugging of\nthe underlying assumptions and the extracted model. Using simulated time-series\ndatasets, exhibiting a wide range of dynamics, we show that PyDaddy is able to\ncorrectly identify underlying SDE models. We demonstrate the applicability of\nthe toolkit to real-world data using a previously published movement data of a\nfish school. Starting from the time-series of the observed polarization of the\nschool, pyDaddy readily discovers the SDE model governing the dynamics of group\npolarization. The model recovered by PyDaddy is consistent with the previous\nstudy. In summary, stochastic and noise-induced effects are central to the\ndynamics of many biological systems.

In this model, vertices are either susceptible,\ninfected, or recovered. Each infected vertex becomes recovered at rate 1 and\ninfects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\\lambda$, and\neach recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\\varrho$, which we assume\nto be independent of the graph size. A central quantity of the SIRS process is\nthe time until no vertex is infected, known as the survival time. Surprisingly\nthough, rigorous theoretical results exist only for the related SIS model so\nfar.\n  We address this imbalance by conducting theoretical analyses of the SIRS\nprocess via their expansion properties. We prove that the expected survival\ntime of the SIRS process on stars is at most polynomial in the graph size for\nany value of $\\lambda$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the SIS\nprocess, where the expected survival time is exponential already for small\ninfection rates.\n  Our main result is an exponential lower bound of the expected survival time\nof the SIRS process on expander graphs. Specifically, we show that on expander\ngraphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, degree close to $d$, and sufficiently small\nspectral expansion, the SIRS process has expected survival time at least\nexponential in $n$ when $\\lambda \\geq c/d$ for a constant $c > 1$. Previous\nresults on the SIS process show that this bound is almost tight. Additionally,\nour result holds even if $G$ is a subgraph. Notably, our result implies an\nalmost-tight threshold for Erdos-R\\'enyi graphs and a regime of exponential\nsurvival time for hyperbolic random graphs. The proof of our main result draws\ninspiration from Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory to devise a\ntwo-dimensional potential function and applying a negative-drift theorem to\nshow that the expected survival time is exponential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 13:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 15:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Recently, the spin precession\nequations were derived up to second order in spin for dynamical Chern-Simons\ngravity, a parity violating modified theory of gravity.

The adopted\nmethod is the numerical simulation of the problem with a finite element code\nbased upon the FEniCS library. For the swimmer executing the optimal locomotion\ngait, we report the Sherwood number as a function of Pe in homogeneous fluids\nand confirm that little gain in solute flux is achieved by swimming unless Pe\nis significantly larger than 10. We also consider the swimmer as an learning\nagent moving inside a fluid that has a concentration gradient. The outcomes of\nQ-learning processes show that learning locomotion (with the displacement as\nreward) is significantly easier than learning chemotaxis (with the increase of\nsolute flux as reward). The chemotaxis problem, even at low Pe, has a varying\nenvironment that renders learning more difficult. Further, the learning\ndifficulty increases severely with the P\\'eclet number. The results demonstrate\nthe challenges that natural and artificial swimmers need to overcome to migrate\nefficiently when exposed to chemical inhomogeneities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 14:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

But more importantly, such predictions\nare hard to {\\it assess}: depending on the choice of what to predict, the\nresults can be very different and not easily compared. Furthermore, forecasting\nmodels may be trained with various generic metrics which ignore some important\nspecificities of the problem at hand, in our case seismic risk. Finally, these\nmodels often do not provide a clear strategy regarding the best way to use\nthese predictions in practice. Here we introduce a framework that allows to\ndesign, evaluate and compare not only predictors but also decision-making\npolicies: a model seismically active {\\it city} subjected to the crackling\ndynamics observed in the mechanical response of knitted fabric. We thus proceed\nto study the population of KnitCity, introducing a policy through which the\nmayor of the town can decide to either keep people in, which in case of large\nevents cause human loss, or evacuate the city, which costs a daily fee.

The main challenge in FMIM compared to the general case\nof CBIR, is that the subject to whom a query image belongs may be affected by\naging and progressive degenerative disorders, making it difficult to match data\non a subject level. CBIR with DNNs is generally solved by minimizing a ranking\nloss, such as Triplet loss (TL), computed on image representations extracted by\na DNN from the original data. TL, in particular, operates on triplets: anchor,\npositive (similar to anchor) and negative (dissimilar to anchor). Although TL\nhas been shown to perform well in many CBIR tasks, it still has limitations,\nwhich we identify and analyze in this work.

When\nconsidered concurrently, they give rise to a set of optimal trade-off\nsolutions, also known as efficient solutions. These solutions have the property\nthat neither objective can be improved without deteriorating another objective.\nMotivated by the success of matheuristics in the single-objective domain, we\npropose a linear programming-based matheuristic for tri-objective binary\ninteger programming. To achieve a high-quality approximation of the optimal set\nof trade-off solutions, a lower bound set is first obtained using the vector\nlinear programming solver Bensolve. Then, feasibility pump-based ideas in\ncombination with path relinking are applied in novel ways so as to obtain a\nhigh quality upper bound set. Our matheuristic is compared to a\nrecently-suggested algorithm that is, to the best of our knowledge, the only\nexisting matheuristic method for tri-objective integer programming. In an\nextensive computational study, we show that our method generates a better\napproximation of the true Pareto front than the benchmark method on a large set\nof tri-objective benchmark instances. Since the developed approach starts from\na potentially fractional lower bound set, it may also be used as a primal\nheuristic in the context of linear relaxation-based multi-objective\nbranch-and-bound algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

Experimental results show that SUGER significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both the basic and the transfer\nbundle recommendation problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 07:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

As AI changes our daily lives at an\nincreasingly fast pace, we are challenged with preparing our society for an\nAI-driven future. To this end, a critical step is to ensure an AI-ready\nworkforce through education.

In this complementary perspective, we discuss why learning AI is\nbeneficial for motivating students and promoting creative thinking, and how to\ndevelop a module-based approach that optimizes learning outcomes.

A range of\npermeability contrasts, correlation lengths, and P\\'eclet numbers are studied\nto characterise the transition to non-Fickian transport behaviour. This is\ntriggered by high permeability contrasts between different zones and is\nenhanced by the presence of connected higher permeability channels, which are\ncharacterised by high advective flow velocities. In this case, the overall\ntransport behaviour deviate from the macroscopic advection-dispersion model\nbased on a Fickian analogy. The numerical experiments are run with an Eulerian\napproach using a novel unified numerical framework based on the finite-volume\nlibrary \\of, for i) generating random pluri-Gaussian porous media, ii) solving\nthe steady state Darcy-scale flow, iii) solving the advection diffusion\nequation, iv) computing post-processing quantities such as first order\nstatistics, spatial probability density functions and breakthrough curves. We\nidentify a hierarchy of non-Fickian transport triggering factors, the strength\nof permebility contrast being the pivotal driver. The P\\'eclet number and the\ncharacteristic length at which facies transitions are observed as secondary\nfactors. Transport remains Fickian when the facies conductivities differ by up\nto one order of magnitude. Greater permeability contrasts act strengthen the\nemergence of fast flow channels leading to non-Fickian transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 09:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}
