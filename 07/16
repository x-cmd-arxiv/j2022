Because each view encodes data from a particular perspective,\nanalysts often use a set of views laid out in 2D space to link and synthesize\ninformation. The difficulty of this process is impacted by the spatial\norganization of these views. For instance, connecting information from views\nfar from each other can be more challenging than neighboring ones. However,\nmost visual analysis tools currently either fix the positions of the views or\ncompletely delegate this organization of views to users (who must manually drag\nand move views). This either limits user involvement in managing the layout of\nMV or is overly flexible without much guidance. Then, a key design challenge in\nMV layout is determining the factors in a spatial organization that impact\nunderstanding. To address this, we review a set of MV-based systems and\nidentify considerations for MV layout rooted in two key concerns: perception,\nwhich considers how users perceive view relationships, and content, which\nconsiders the relationships in the data.

In particular, we propose a\nspatial-temporal feature learning scheme towards a set of more representative\nfeatures for perception, prediction and planning tasks simultaneously, which is\ncalled ST-P3. Specifically, an egocentric-aligned accumulation technique is\nproposed to preserve geometry information in 3D space before the bird's eye\nview transformation for perception; a dual pathway modeling is devised to take\npast motion variations into account for future prediction; a temporal-based\nrefinement unit is introduced to compensate for recognizing vision-based\nelements for planning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\nsystematically investigate each part of an interpretable end-to-end\nvision-based autonomous driving system. We benchmark our approach against\nprevious state-of-the-arts on both open-loop nuScenes dataset as well as\nclosed-loop CARLA simulation. The results show the effectiveness of our method.\nSource code, model and protocol details are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/ST-P3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 16:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Existing healthcare\nprovider profiling approaches typically assume that the risk adjustment is\nperfect and the between-provider variation in quality measures is entirely due\nto the quality of care. However, in practice, even with very good models for\nrisk adjustment, some between-provider variation will be due to incomplete risk\nadjustment, which should be recognized in assessing and monitoring providers.\nOtherwise, conventional methods disproportionately identify larger providers as\noutliers, even though their provider effects need not be \"extreme.'' Motivated\nby efforts to evaluate the quality of care provided by transplant centers, we\ndevelop a composite evaluation score based on a novel individualized empirical\nnull method, which robustly accounts for overdispersion due to unobserved risk\nfactors, models the marginal variance of standardized scores as a function of\nthe effective center size, and only requires the use of publicly-available\ncenter-level statistics.

When subject to an\nexternal magnetic flux, they exhibit the Little-Parks (LP) phenomenon of\nflux-modulated superconductivity, an effect connected to the physics of\nAbrikosov vortex lines in type-II superconductors. We show theoretically that\nfull-shell nanowires can host subgap states that are a variant of the Caroli-de\nGennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in vortices. These CdGM analogs are shell-induced\nVan Hove singularities in core subbands. We elucidate their structure,\nparameter dependence and behavior in tunneling spectroscopy through a series of\nmodels of growing complexity. Using microscopic numerical simulations, we show\nthat CdGM analogs exhibit a characteristic skewness towards higher flux values\ninside non-zero LP lobes resulting from the interplay of three ingredients.\nFirst, the orbital coupling to the field shifts the energy of the CdGM analogs\nproportionally to the flux and to their generalized angular momentum. Second,\nCdGM analogs coalesce into degeneracy points at flux values for which their\ncorresponding radial wavefunctions are threaded by an integer multiple of the\nflux quantum. And third, the average radii of all CdGM-analog wavefunctions\ninside the core are approximately equal and are controlled by the electrostatic\nband bending at the core/shell interface. As the average radius moves away from\nthe interface, the degeneracy points shift towards larger fluxes from the\ncenter of the LP lobes, causing the skewness. This analysis provides a\ntransparent interpretation of the nanowire spectrum that allows to extract\nmicroscopic information by measuring the number and skewness of CdGM analogs.\nMoreover, it allows to derive an efficient Hamiltonian of the full-shell\nnanowire in terms of a modified hollow-core model at the average radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 17:04:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 13:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

As a new generation of instruments comes online,\nit is important to continually assess the underlying assumptions of models to\nensure robust and accurate inferences. We analyze bulk samples of known\ntransiting planets and calculate their expected signal strength if they were to\nbe oblate. We find that for noise levels below 100ppm, as many as 100 planets\ncould have detectable oblateness. We also investigate the effects of fitting\nspherical planet models to synthetic oblate lightcurves. We find that this\nbiases the retrieved parameters by several standard deviations for oblateness\nvalues > 0.1-0.2. When attempting to fit an oblateness model to both spherical\nand oblate lightcurves, we find that the sensitivity of such fits is correlated\nwith both the SNR as well as the time sampling of the data, which can mask the\noblateness signal. For typical values of these quantities for Kepler\nobservations, it is difficult to rule out oblateness values less than ~0.25.\nThis results in an accuracy wall of 10-15% for the density of planets which may\nbe oblate.

By self-consistently inferring\nall model parameters, from high-level hyper-parameters to SPS parameters of\nindividual galaxies, one can separate sources of bias and uncertainty in the\ndata.We demonstrate the strengths and flexibility of this approach by deriving\naccurate photometric redshifts for a sample of spectroscopically-confirmed\ngalaxies in the COSMOS field, all with 26-band photometry and spectroscopic\nredshifts. We achieve a performance competitive with publicly-released\nphotometric redshift catalogs based on the same data.

A vast majority of the\nproposed approaches fall under one of two categories: (1) imposing algorithmic\nfairness constraints on predictive models, and (2) collecting additional\ntraining samples. Most recently and at the intersection of these two\ncategories, methods that propose active learning under fairness constraints\nhave been developed. However, proposed bias mitigation strategies typically\noverlook the bias presented in the observed labels. In this work, we study\nfairness considerations of active data collection strategies in the presence of\nlabel bias. We first present an overview of different types of label bias in\nthe context of supervised learning systems. We then empirically show that, when\noverlooking label bias, collecting more data can aggravate bias, and imposing\nfairness constraints that rely on the observed labels in the data collection\nprocess may not address the problem. Our results illustrate the unintended\nconsequences of deploying a model that attempts to mitigate a single type of\nbias while neglecting others, emphasizing the importance of explicitly\ndifferentiating between the types of bias that fairness-aware algorithms aim to\naddress, and highlighting the risks of neglecting label bias during data\ncollection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 19:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Here we propose methods to initialize on a gate-based quantum\ncomputer a general class of quantum spin wave functions, the so-called\nValence-Bond-Solid (VBS) states, that are important for two reasons. First, VBS\nstates are the exact ground states of a class of interacting quantum spin\nmodels introduced by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT). Second, the\ntwo-dimensional VBS states are universal resource states for measurement-based\nquantum computing. We find that schemes to prepare VBS states based on their\ntensor-network representations yield quantum circuits that are too deep to be\nwithin reach of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

Shallow\nquantum circuits of depth independent of the lattice size are explicitly\nderived for both cases, making use of optimization schemes that outperform\nstandard basis gate decomposition methods. Given the probabilistic nature of\nthe proposed routine, two strategies that achieve a quadratic reduction of the\nrepetition overhead for any VBS state defined on a bipartite lattice are\ndevised.

However, classical approaches, such as sum-of-squares\nmethods and quadratic approximation, for finding a Lyapunov function either do\nnot scale to large systems or give very conservative estimates for the\nstability region. In this context, we propose a new distributed learning based\napproach by exploiting the dissipativity structure of the subsystems.

This work focuses on the\neffects of an external perturbation due to a third body around an EMRI system.\nThis perturbation will affect the orbit most significantly when the inner body\ncrosses a resonance with the outer body, and result in a change of the\nconserved quantities (energy, angular momentum, and Carter constant) or\nequivalently of the actions, which results in a subsequent phase shift of the\nwaveform that builds up over time.

We show that these changes are related to the gravitational\nwaveforms emitted by the two bodies (quantified by the amplitudes of the Weyl\nscalar $\\psi_4$ at the horizon and at $\\infty$) at the frequency corresponding\nto the resonance. This allows us to compute changes in the action variables for\neach body, without directly computing the explicit metric perturbations, and\ntherefore we can carry out the computation by calling an existing black hole\nperturbation theory code.

A\ntridiagonal pair is an ordered pair of diagonalizable linear maps $A, A^*$ on a\nnonzero, finite-dimensional vector space $V$, that each act in a (block)\ntridiagonal fashion on the eigenspaces of the other one. Let $A$, $A^*$ denote\na tridiagonal pair on $V$. Associated with this pair are six well-known direct\nsum decompositions of $V$; these are the eigenspace decompositions of $A$ and\n$A^*$, along with four decompositions of $V$ that are often called split.\n  In our main results, we assume that $A$, $A^*$ has $q$-Serre type. Under this\nassumption $A$, $A^*$ satisfy the $q$-Serre relations, and $V$ becomes an\nirreducible $U^+_q$-module on which $W_0=A$ and $W_1=A^*$. We describe how the\nalternating elements of $U^+_q$ act on the above six decompositions of $V$. We\nshow that for each decomposition, every alternating element acts in either a\n(block) diagonal, (block) upper bidiagonal, (block) lower bidiagonal, or\n(block) tridiagonal fashion. We investigate two special cases in detail. In the\nfirst case the eigenspaces of $A$ and $A^*$ all have dimension one. In the\nsecond case $A$ and $A^*$ are obtained by adjusting the adjacency matrix and a\ndual adjacency matrix of a distance-regular graph that has classical parameters\nand is formally self-dual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 20:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Such structures in\nturn yield additional storage overhead and take a toll on index maintenance.\nRecently, there has been a flurry on works attempting to leverage\nmachine-Learning(ML) models to simplify the index structures. Some follow-up\nworks extend the idea to support geospatial point data. These approaches\npartition the multidimensional space to cells and assign IDs to these cells\nusing space-filling curve(e.g., Z-order curve) or mathematical equations. These\napproaches work well for geospatial points but are not able to handle complex\ngeometries such as polygons and trajectories which are widely available in\ngeospatial data.\n  This paper introduces GLIN, a lightweight learned index for spatial range\nqueries on complex geometries. To achieve that, GLIN transforms geometries to\nZ-address intervals, and builds a hierarchical model to learn the cumulative\ndistribution function between these intervals and the record positions. The\nlightweight hierarchical model greatly shortens the index probing time.\nFurthermore, GLIN augments spatial query windows using an add-on function to\nguarantee the query accuracy for both Contains and Intersects spatial\nrelationships. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that\nGLIN occupies 40-70 times less storage overhead than popular spatial indexes\nsuch as Quad-Tree while still showing similar query response time in medium\nselectivity queries.

For example, entangled blends of ring and linear\npolymers have been shown to exhibit enhanced shear thinning and viscosity, as\nwell as prolonged relaxation timescales, compared to pure solutions of rings or\nlinear chains. These emergent properties arise in part from the synergistic\nthreading of rings by linear polymers. Topology has also been shown to play an\nimportant role in composites of flexible (e.g., DNA) and stiff (e.g.,\nmicrotubules) polymers, whereby rings promote mixing while linear polymers\ninduce de-mixing and flocculation of stiff polymers, with these\ntopology-dependent interactions giving rise to highly distinct rheological\nsignatures.

In\nparticular, autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) discriminates the\nautofluorescence properties of normal (green) and diseased tissue (reddish\nbrown) with different colors.

The main challenge in\nportfolio construction with illiquid asset classes is that we do not have\ndirect control over our positions, as we do in liquid asset classes. Instead we\ncan only make commitments; the position builds up over time as capital calls\ncome in, and reduces over time as distributions occur, neither of which the\ninvestor has direct control over. The effect on positions of our commitments is\nsubject to a delay, typically of a few years, and is also unknown or\nstochastic. A further challenge is the requirement that we can meet the capital\ncalls, with very high probability, with our liquid assets.\n  We formulate the illiquid dynamics as a random linear system, and propose a\nconvex optimization based model predictive control (MPC) policy for allocating\nliquid assets and making new illiquid commitments in each period.

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, called\nBDPC (Bounded Delay Packet Control) to tackle this challenge. BDPC combines the\nknowledge of a node's traffic delay to the destination (root) with the time\nbudget of a data packet traversing the industrial IoT network, to allocate\nnetwork resources to comply the system maximum delay requirements using an\nadaptive and distributed algorithm. Unlike the general aim to minimze\nend-to-end delay, we propose that data packets must arrive before the deadline,\nbut not faster. Our results show, for example, that by using BDPC, the number\nof packets arriving before the deadline can be improved more than 2.6 times\ncompared to the case when using the default Minimal Scheduling Function from\nthe standard. As a further advantage, BDPC involves minor modifications to the\n6TiSCH protocol stack, which makes it compatible with current implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 22:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 01:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Federated learning typically requires the utilization of\nmulti-party computation techniques to provide strong privacy guarantees by\nensuring that an untrusted or curious aggregator cannot obtain isolated replies\nfrom parties involved in the training process, thereby preventing potential\ninference attacks. Until recently, it was thought that some of these secure\naggregation techniques were sufficient to fully protect against inference\nattacks coming from a curious aggregator. However, recent research has\ndemonstrated that a curious aggregator can successfully launch a disaggregation\nattack to learn information about model updates of a target party. This paper\npresents DeTrust-FL, an efficient privacy-preserving federated learning\nframework for addressing the lack of transparency that enables isolation\nattacks, such as disaggregation attacks, during secure aggregation by assuring\nthat parties' model updates are included in the aggregated model in a private\nand secure manner. DeTrust-FL proposes a decentralized trust consensus\nmechanism and incorporates a recently proposed decentralized functional\nencryption (FE) scheme in which all parties agree on a participation matrix\nbefore collaboratively generating decryption key fragments, thereby gaining\ncontrol and trust over the secure aggregation process in a decentralized\nsetting. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DeTrust-FL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art FE-based secure multi-party aggregation solutions in terms of\ntraining time and reduces the volume of data transferred. In contrast to\nexisting approaches, this is achieved without creating any trust dependency on\nexternal trusted entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 23:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

We solve the LP\nproblem by maximizing the Q-values of actions learned from the RL model given\nthe budget constraints. During deployment, we combine the offline RL model with\nthe LP model to generate a robust policy under the budget constraints. Using\nboth online and offline experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach by showing that BCRLSP achieves a higher long-term customer retention\nrate and a lower cost than various baselines. Taking advantage of the near\nreal-time cost control method, the proposed framework can easily adapt to data\nwith a noisy behavioral policy and/or meet flexible budget constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

The spatial covariates used in this study are related to road\nnetwork coverage, population density, and the socio-economic status of the\npopulation in Skellefte{\\aa}, Sweden. A new heuristic algorithm has been\ndeveloped to select an optimal estimate of the kernel bandwidth in order to\nobtain the non-parametric intensity estimate of the events and to generate\nother covariates.

However, the\nrapidly growing needs for DL also led to communication- and resource-intensive\ndistributed training jobs for large-scale DL training, which are typically\ndeployed over GPU clusters. To sustain the ever-increasing demand for DL\ntraining, the so-called \"ring-all-reduce\" (RAR) technologies have recently\nemerged as a favorable computing architecture to efficiently process network\ncommunication and computation load in GPU clusters. The most salient feature of\nRAR is that it removes the need for dedicated parameter servers, thus\nalleviating the potential communication bottleneck. However, when multiple\nRAR-based DL training jobs are deployed over GPU clusters, communication\nbottlenecks could still occur due to contentions between DL training jobs. So\nfar, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding on how to design\ncontention-aware resource scheduling algorithms for RAR-based DL training jobs,\nwhich motivates us to fill this gap in this work. Our main contributions are\nthree-fold: i) We develop a new analytical model that characterizes both\ncommunication overhead related to the worker distribution of the job and\ncommunication contention related to the co-location of different jobs; ii)\nBased on the proposed analytical model, we formulate the problem as a\nnon-convex integer program to minimize the makespan of all RAR-based DL\ntraining jobs.

Thus\nonly the discriminative locations are activated when feeding pixel-level\nfeatures into this classifier. To solve this issue, this paper elaborates a\nplug-and-play mechanism called BagCAMs to better project a well-trained\nclassifier for the localization task without refining or re-training the\nbaseline structure.

However, in many problem domains, an\nagent may suffer from noisy observations or random times until its subsequent\ndecision. While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have\ndealt with noisy observations, they have yet to deal with the unknown time\naspect. Of course, one could discretize the time, but this leads to Bellman's\nCurse of Dimensionality. To incorporate continuous sojourn-time distributions\nin the agent's decision making, we propose that partially observable\nsemi-Markov decision processes (POSMDPs) can be helpful in this regard. We\nextend \\citet{Spaan2005a} randomized point-based value iteration (PBVI)\n\\textsc{Perseus} algorithm used for POMDP to POSMDP by incorporating continuous\nsojourn time distributions and using importance sampling to reduce the solver\ncomplexity.

This further allows for compressed complex\nPOMDPs requiring temporal state information by moving this information into\nstate sojourn time of a POMSDP. The second insight is that keeping a set of\nsampled times and weighting it by its likelihood can be used in a single\nbackup; this helps further reduce the algorithm complexity.

However, further Dice\nloss improvements are still possible. In this study, we reconsidered the use of\nDice loss and discovered that Dice loss can be rewritten in the loss function\nusing the cosine similarity through a simple equation transformation. Using\nthis knowledge, we present a novel t-vMF Dice loss based on the t-vMF\nsimilarity instead of the cosine similarity. Based on the t-vMF similarity, our\nproposed Dice loss is formulated in a more compact similarity loss function\nthan the original Dice loss. Furthermore, we present an effective algorithm\nthat automatically determines the parameter $\\kappa$ for the t-vMF similarity\nusing a validation accuracy, called Adaptive t-vMf Dice loss. Using this\nalgorithm, it is possible to apply more compact similarities for easy classes\nand wider similarities for difficult classes, and we are able to achieve an\nadaptive training based on the accuracy of the class. Through experiments\nconducted on four datasets using a five-fold cross validation, we confirmed\nthat the Dice score coefficient (DSC) was further improved in comparison with\nthe original Dice loss and other loss functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 05:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Current analytical modeling\ntechniques for these systems are numerically cumbersome, and assume an\ninfinitely periodic plate. We present an approximate two-dimensional analytical\nmodel that can be used to directly calculate scattering coefficients for finite\nlength plates. This model is shown to predict a band diagram that compares well\nwith diagrams obtained from finite element analysis (FEA).

As the main memory is\nusually DRAM in many systems, a highly parallel multiply-accumulate (MAC) array\nwithin the DRAM can maximize the benefit of AiM by reducing both the distance\nand amount of data movement between the processor and the main memory. This\npaper presents an analog MAC array based AiM architecture named MAC-DO. In\ncontrast with previous in-DRAM accelerators, MAC-DO makes an entire DRAM array\nparticipate in MAC computations simultaneously without idle cells, leading to\nhigher throughput and energy efficiency. This improvement is made possible by\nexploiting a new analog computation method based on charge steering. In\naddition, MAC-DO innately supports multi-bit MACs with good linearity. MAC-DO\nis still compatible with current 1T1C DRAM technology without any modifications\nof a DRAM cell and array.

However, previous studies reveal that\none-shot performance estimations of architectures might not be well correlated\nwith their performances in stand-alone training because of the excessive\nsharing of operation parameters (i.e., large sharing extent) between\narchitectures. Thus, recent methods construct even more over-parameterized\nsupernets to reduce the sharing extent. But these improved methods introduce a\nlarge number of extra parameters and thus cause an undesirable trade-off\nbetween the training costs and the ranking quality. To alleviate the above\nissues, we propose to apply Curriculum Learning On Sharing Extent (CLOSE) to\ntrain the supernet both efficiently and effectively.

Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CLOSE can obtain a better ranking quality across different computational\nbudget constraints than other one-shot supernets, and is able to discover\nsuperior architectures when combined with various search strategies.

The time-scale of the remnant phase and AGN duty cycle are vital to\nunderstanding the evolution of radio galaxies. In this paper, we report new\nband-3 observations with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT)\nfor five remnant radio galaxies.

We train NeFSAC to predict the probability of a minimal sample leading\nto an accurate relative pose, only based on the pixel coordinates of the image\ncorrespondences. Our neural filtering model learns typical motion patterns of\nsamples which lead to unstable poses, and regularities in the possible motions\nto favour well-conditioned and likely-correct samples.

Among the\nresearch on local observability of nonlinear systems, approaches based on\ndifferential geometry have attracted much attention for the solid theoretic\nfoundation and suitability to automated deduction. Such approaches usually work\nwith a system model of unconstrained control inputs and assume that the control\ninputs and observation outputs are timestamped by the same clock. To our\nknowledge, it has not been shown how to conduct the observability analysis with\nadditional constraints enforced on the system's observations or control inputs.\nTo this end, we propose procedures to convert a system model of affine control\ninputs with linear constraints into a constraint-free standard model which is\napt to be analyzed by the classic observability analysis procedure. Then, the\nwhole analysis procedure is illustrated by applying to the well-studied visual\ninertial odometry (VIO) system which estimates the camera-IMU relative pose and\ntime offset.

While, from the theoretical\nviewpoint, most GNNs can operate on graphs of any size, it is empirically\nobserved that their classification performance degrades when they are applied\non graphs with sizes that differ from those in the training data. Previous\nworks have tried to tackle this issue in graph classification by providing the\nmodel with inductive biases derived from assumptions on the generative process\nof the graphs, or by requiring access to graphs from the test domain. The first\nstrategy is tied to the quality of the assumptions made for the generative\nprocess, and requires the use of specific models designed after the explicit\ndefinition of the generative process of the data, leaving open the question of\nhow to improve the performance of generic GNN models in general settings. On\nthe other hand, the second strategy can be applied to any GNN, but requires\naccess to information that is not always easy to obtain. In this work we\nconsider the scenario in which we only have access to the training data, and we\npropose a regularization strategy that can be applied to any GNN to improve its\ngeneralization capabilities from smaller to larger graphs without requiring\naccess to the test data. Our regularization is based on the idea of simulating\na shift in the size of the training graphs using coarsening techniques, and\nenforcing the model to be robust to such a shift.

To this end, this paper first revisits FPN in the detection\nframework and reveals the nature of the success of FPN from the perspective of\noptimization. Then, we point out that the degraded performance of large-scale\nobjects is due to the arising of improper back-propagation paths after\nintegrating FPN. It makes each level of the backbone network only has the\nability to look at the objects within a certain scale range. Based on these\nanalysis, two feasible strategies are proposed to enable each level of the\nbackbone to look at all objects in the FPN-based detection frameworks.\nSpecifically, one is to introduce auxiliary objective functions to make each\nbackbone level directly receive the back-propagation signals of various-scale\nobjects during training. The other is to construct the feature pyramid in a\nmore reasonable way to avoid the irrational back-propagation paths.

A naive way is\nto accomplish them independently in a sequential or parallel manner, but there\nare many drawbacks, i.e., 1) the depth and VO results suffer from the inherent\nscale ambiguity issue; 2) the BEV layout is directly predicted from the\nfront-view image without using any depth-related information, although the\ndepth map contains useful geometry clues for inferring scene layouts. In this\npaper, we address these issues by proposing a novel joint perception framework\nnamed JPerceiver, which can simultaneously estimate scale-aware depth and VO as\nwell as BEV layout from a monocular video sequence. It exploits the cross-view\ngeometric transformation (CGT) to propagate the absolute scale from the road\nlayout to depth and VO based on a carefully-designed scale loss. Meanwhile, a\ncross-view and cross-modal transfer (CCT) module is devised to leverage the\ndepth clues for reasoning road and vehicle layout through an attention\nmechanism. JPerceiver can be trained in an end-to-end multi-task learning way,\nwhere the CGT scale loss and CCT module promote inter-task knowledge transfer\nto benefit feature learning of each task. Experiments on Argoverse, Nuscenes\nand KITTI show the superiority of JPerceiver over existing methods on all the\nabove three tasks in terms of accuracy, model size, and inference speed.

By contrast, the bottom-up methods enjoy low\ncomputational costs as they are less affected by the number of humans. However,\nmost existing bottom-up methods treat camera-centric 3D human pose estimation\nas two unrelated subtasks: 2.5D pose estimation and camera-centric depth\nestimation. In this paper, we propose a unified model that leverages the mutual\nbenefits of both these subtasks. Within the framework, a robust structured 2.5D\npose estimation is designed to recognize inter-person occlusion based on depth\nrelationships. Additionally, we develop an end-to-end geometry-aware depth\nreasoning method that exploits the mutual benefits of both 2.5D pose and\ncamera-centric root depths. This method first uses 2.5D pose and geometry\ninformation to infer camera-centric root depths in a forward pass, and then\nexploits the root depths to further improve representation learning of 2.5D\npose estimation in a backward pass. Further, we designed an adaptive fusion\nscheme that leverages both visual perception and body geometry to alleviate\ninherent depth ambiguity issues.

As\na result, it is hard to directly learn a promising SR mapping from such a large\nspace. Second, it is often inevitable to develop very large models with\nextremely high computational cost to yield promising SR performance. In\npractice, one can use model compression techniques to obtain compact models by\nreducing model redundancy.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual\nknowledge-enhanced generative pretrained language model for multimodal\ntask-oriented dialog systems (DKMD), consisting of three key components: dual\nknowledge selection, dual knowledge-enhanced context learning, and\nknowledge-enhanced response generation. To be specific, the dual knowledge\nselection component aims to select the related knowledge according to both\ntextual and visual modalities of the given context. Thereafter, the dual\nknowledge-enhanced context learning component targets seamlessly integrating\nthe selected knowledge into the multimodal context learning from both global\nand local perspectives, where the cross-modal semantic relation is also\nexplored. Moreover, the knowledge-enhanced response generation component\ncomprises a revised BART decoder, where an additional dot-product\nknowledge-decoder attention sub-layer is introduced for explicitly utilizing\nthe knowledge to advance the text response generation.

The bounds\nare universal in the sense that they are a convex combination of potential\nfunction evaluations with nodes and weights independent of the class of\npotentials. As a consequence of our lower bounds, we obtain the\nFazekas-Levenshtein bounds on the covering radius of spherical designs.\nUtilizing the existence of spherical designs, our polarization bounds are\nextended to general configurations. As examples we completely solve the min-max\npolarization problem for $120$ points on $\\mathbb{S}^3$ and show that the\n$600$-cell is universally optimal for that problem.

In this paper we present a novel model for ultra\nhigh-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise\nGenerative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy\ninvolving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway.\nThe local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained\nmanner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway\nperforms image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to\nprovide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and\nnoise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways,\nour GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects\nin terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and\nhigh-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work,\nwe also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both\nreflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and\nsynthetic images.

The interdependencies on incident\nevolution in the environment, including those between incident occurrences, and\nthose between resource availability in near-future requests and the anticipated\nduration of the immediate incident request, should be considered through a\nlook-ahead model when making current-stage deployment decisions.

Most pieces of work in the area of PINNs tackle non-linear PDEs.\nNevertheless, many interesting problems involving linear PDEs may benefit from\nPINNs; these include parametric studies, multi-query problems, and parabolic\n(transient) PDEs. The purpose of this paper is to explore PINNs for linear PDEs\nwhose solutions may present one or more boundary layers. More specifically, we\nanalyze the steady-state reaction-advection-diffusion equation in regimes in\nwhich the diffusive coefficient is small in comparison with the reactive or\nadvective coefficients. We show that adding information about these\ncoefficients as predictor variables in a PINN results in better prediction\nmodels than in a PINN that only uses spatial information as predictor\nvariables. This finding may be instrumental in multiscale problems where the\ncoefficients of the PDEs present high variability in small spatiotemporal\nregions of the domain, and therefore PINNs may be employed together with domain\ndecomposition techniques to efficiently approximate the PDEs locally at each\npartition of the spatiotemporal domain, without resorting to different learned\nPINN models at each of these partitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 21:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}
