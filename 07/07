The\nsuccess of these web applications largely depends on the ability of the\nemployed machine learning model to accurately distinguish influential features\nfrom all the predetermined features in tabular data. Intuitively, in practical\nbusiness scenarios, different instances should correspond to different sets of\ninfluential features, and the set of influential features of the same instance\nmay vary in different scenarios. However, most existing methods focus on global\nfeature selection assuming that all instances have the same set of influential\nfeatures, and few methods considering instance-wise feature selection ignore\nthe variability of influential features in different scenarios. In this paper,\nwe first introduce a new perspective based on the influence function for\ninstance-wise feature selection, and give some corresponding theoretical\ninsights, the core of which is to use the influence function as an indicator to\nmeasure the importance of an instance-wise feature. We then propose a new\nsolution for discovering instance-wise influential features in tabular data\n(DIWIFT), where a self-attention network is used as a feature selection model\nand the value of the corresponding influence function is used as an\noptimization objective to guide the model. Benefiting from the advantage of the\ninfluence function, i.e., its computation does not depend on a specific\narchitecture and can also take into account the data distribution in different\nscenarios, our DIWIFT has better flexibility and robustness. Finally, we\nconduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our DIWIFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 16:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 04:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Despite\ntheir widescale use in biosensors and photovoltaic materials, studies have yet\nto establish the important link between the electronic structure of the\nspecific TDPP and the critical optical properties. To bridge this gap,\nultrafast transient absorption with 22 fs time resolution has been used to\nexplore the photophysics of three prototypical TDPP molecules: a monomer, dimer\nand polymer in solution. These studies show that the photophysics of these\nmolecular prototypes under visible photoexcitation are determined by just two\nexcited electronic states, having very different electronic characters (one is\noptically bright, the other dark), their relative energetic ordering and the\ntimescales for internal conversion from one to the other and/or to the ground\nstate. The underlying difference in electronic structure alters the branching\nbetween these excited states and their associated dynamics. In turn, these\nfactors dictate the fluorescence quantum yields, which are shown to vary by\n~1-2 orders of magnitude across the TDPP prototypes investigated here. The fast\nnon-radiative transfer of molecules from the bright to dark states is mediated\nby conical intersections.

However,\nmodels of stars with masses higher than about 1.2Msun predict unrealistic\nvariations at the stellar surface. This indicates the need for competing\ntransport processes that are mostly computationally expensive for large grids\nof stellar models. The purpose of this study is to implement turbulent mixing\nin stellar models and assess the possibility of reproducing the effect of\nradiative accelerations with turbulent mixing for elements like iron in order\nto make the computation of large grids possible. We computed stellar models\nwith MESA and assessed the effects of atomic diffusion (with radiative\nacceleration) in the presence of turbulent mixing. We parametrised the effect\nof radiative accelerations on iron with a turbulent diffusion coefficient.\nFinally, we tested this parametrisation by modelling two F-type stars of the\nKepler Legacy sample. We found that, for iron, a parametrisation of turbulent\nmixing that simulates the effect of radiative acceleration is possible. This\nleads to an increase in the efficiency of the turbulent mixing to counteract\nthe effect of gravitational settling. This approximation does not affect\nsignificantly the surface abundances of the other elements we studied, except\nfor oxygen and calcium. We demonstrate that this parametrisation has a\nnegligible impact on the accuracy of the seismic properties inferred with these\nmodels.

Yet, today's solutions are unable to deliver robust\nand high tracking accuracies across multiple agents in practical, everyday\nenvironments - a feature central to the future of immersive and collaborative\napplications. This can be attributed to the limited scope of diversity\nleveraged by these fusion solutions, preventing them from catering to the\nmultiple dimensions of accuracy, robustness (diverse environmental conditions)\nand scalability (multiple agents) simultaneously. In this work, we take an\nimportant step towards this goal by introducing the notion of dual-layer\ndiversity to the problem of sensor fusion in multi-agent tracking. We\ndemonstrate that the fusion of complementary tracking modalities, -\npassive/relative (e.g., visual odometry) and active/absolute tracking (e.g.,\ninfrastructure-assisted RF localization) offer a key first layer of diversity\nthat brings scalability while the second layer of diversity lies in the\nmethodology of fusion, where we bring together the complementary strengths of\nalgorithmic (for robustness) and data-driven (for accuracy) approaches. RoVaR\nis an embodiment of such a dual-layer diversity approach that intelligently\nattends to cross-modal information using algorithmic and data-driven techniques\nthat jointly share the burden of accurately tracking multiple agents in the\nwild.

Intrinsic dataset\nmanifolds and their relationship to learning difficulty have recently begun to\nbe studied for the common domain of natural images, but little such research\nhas been attempted for radiological images. We address this here. First, we\ncompare the intrinsic manifold dimensionality of radiological and natural\nimages. We also investigate the relationship between intrinsic dimensionality\nand generalization ability over a wide range of datasets. Our analysis shows\nthat natural image datasets generally have a higher number of intrinsic\ndimensions than radiological images. However, the relationship between\ngeneralization ability and intrinsic dimensionality is much stronger for\nmedical images, which could be explained as radiological images having\nintrinsic features that are more difficult to learn. These results give a more\nprincipled underpinning for the intuition that radiological images can be more\nchallenging to apply deep learning to than natural image datasets common to\nmachine learning research. We believe rather than directly applying models\ndeveloped for natural images to the radiological imaging domain, more care\nshould be taken to developing architectures and algorithms that are more\ntailored to the specific characteristics of this domain.

For example, theta-gamma coupling is\nassumed to be generated by specialized cell pairs (PING and ING mechanisms), or\nspecial cells (e.g., fast bursting neurons). However, this implies that the\ngenerating mechanisms is uniquely specific to the brain. In fact, cross-scale\ncoupling is a phenomenon encountered in the physics of all large, multi-scale\nsystems: phase and amplitude correlations between components of different\nscales arise as a result of nonlinear interaction. Because the brain is a\nmulti-scale system too, a similar mechanism must be active in the brain. Here,\nwe represent brain activity as a superposition of nonlinearly interacting\npatterns of spatio-temporal activity (collective activity), supported by\npopulations of neurons. Cross-frequency coupling is a direct consequence of the\nnonlinear interactions, and does not require specialized cells or cell pairs.\nIt is therefore universal, and must be active in neural fields of any\ncomposition. To emphasize this, we demonstrate the phenomenon in excitatory\nfields. While there is no doubt that specialized cells play a role in\ntheta-gamma coupling, our results suggest that the coupling mechanism is at the\nsame time simpler and richer: simpler because it involves the universal\nprinciple of nonlinearity; richer, because nonlinearity of collective activity\nis likely modulated by specialized-cell populations in ways to be yet\nunderstood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 17:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

We\naim to estimate the temporal evolution of the radiative losses in the\nchromosphere at the footpoints of a C-class flare, in order to set\nobservational constraints on the electron beam parameters of a RADYN flare\nsimulation. We estimated the radiative losses from hydrogen, and singly ionized\nCa and Mg using semi-empirical model atmospheres. To estimate the integrated\nradiative losses in the chromosphere the net cooling rates were integrated\nbetween the temperature minimum and the height where the temperature reaches 10\nkK. The stratification of the net cooling rate suggests that the Ca IR triplet\nlines are responsible for most of the radiative losses in the flaring\natmosphere. During the flare peak time, the contribution from Ca II H & K and\nMg II h & k lines are strong and comparable to the Ca IR triplet ($\\sim$32 kW\nm$^{-2}$). Since our flare is a relatively weak event the chromosphere is not\nheated above 11 kK, which in turn yields a subdued Ly{\\alpha} contribution\n($\\sim$7 kW m$^{-2}$). The temporal evolution of total integrated radiative\nlosses exhibits sharply-rising losses (0.4 kW m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and a\nrelatively slow decay (0.23 kW~m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). The maximum value of total\nradiative losses is reached around the flare peak time, and can go up to 175 kW\nm$^{-2}$ for a single pixel located at footpoint. After a small parameter\nstudy, we find the best model-data consistency in terms of the amplitude of\nradiative losses and the overall atmospheric structure with a RADYN flare\nsimulation in the injected energy flux of $5\\times10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 17:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 15:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The soft functions are\nuniversal, and describe radiative corrections to the Reggeized gluon states\nexchanged by the collinear projectiles. Remarkably, we find that the one-loop\nsoft function for the single Reggeized gluon state is given to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ in terms of the two-loop cusp and two-loop rapidity\nanomalous dimensions. We argue that this iterative structure follows from the\nsimple action of crossing symmetry in the forward scattering limit, which in\nthe EFT allows us to replace the divergent part of a soft loop by a much\nsimpler Glauber loop.

In\naddition, the scattering of slow-moving DM can give rise to a sizable energy\ndeposit if the underlying dark-sector model allows for a large mass difference\nbetween the initial and final state particles, and the neutrino experiments\nwith large volume detectors are well suited for exploring these opportunities.\n  This White Paper is devoted to discussing the scientific importance of the\ncosmogenic dark matter and exotic particle searches, not only overviewing the\nrecent efforts in both the theory and the experiment communities but also\nproviding future perspectives and directions on this research branch. A\nlandscape of technologies used in neutrino detectors and their complementarity\nis discussed, and the current and developing analysis strategies are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 18:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 01:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

The recent development of \"non-parametric\" SFH models promises the\nflexibility required to make these measurements. However, model and prior\nchoices significantly affect derived SFHs, particularly for post-starburst\ngalaxies (PSBs) which have sharp changes in their recent SFH. In this paper, we\ncreate mock PSBs, then use the Prospector SED fitting software to test how well\nfour different SFH models recover key properties. We find that a two-component\nparametric model performs well for our simple mock galaxies, but is sensitive\nto model mismatches. The fixed- and flexible-bin non-parametric models included\nin Prospector are able to rapidly quench a major burst of star formation, but\nsystematically underestimate the post-burst age by up to 200 Myr. We develop a\ncustom SFH model that allows for additional flexibility in the recent SFH. Our\nflexible non-parametric model is able to constrain post-burst ages with no\nsignificant offset and just ~90 Myr of scatter. Our results suggest that while\nstandard non-parametric models are able to recover first-order quantities of\nthe SFH (mass, SFR, average age), accurately recovering higher-order quantities\n(burst fraction, quenching time) requires careful consideration of model\nflexibility. These mock recovery tests are a critical part of future SFH\nstudies. Finally, we show that our new, public SFH model is able to accurately\nrecover the properties of mock star-forming and quiescent galaxies and is\nsuitable for broader use in the SED fitting community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

The enantiomeric\ncomposition of ISM propylene-oxide may be probed through circular polarization\nmeasurements, but accurate estimates of the circular dichroism properties of\nthe microwave transitions of propylene-oxide are not available. We develop a\nmodel of the circular dichroic activity in torsion-rotation transitions of\nclosed-shell chiral molecules, such as propylene-oxide. With this model, we\nestimate the viability, and optimize observation strategies, of enantiomeric\nexcess detection in ISM propylene-oxide.

Due to the low predicted circular\npolarization fractions, we conclude that enantiomeric characterization of\npropylene-oxide in the gas phase of the ISM is impossible with current\nastronomical observation techniques.

More formally,\nuniversal causal models are defined as categories consisting of objects and\nmorphisms between them representing causal influences, as well as structures\nfor carrying out interventions (experiments) and evaluating their outcomes\n(observations). Functors map between categories, and natural transformations\nmap between a pair of functors across the same two categories. Abstract causal\ndiagrams in our framework are built using universal constructions from category\ntheory, including the limit or co-limit of an abstract causal diagram, or more\ngenerally, the Kan extension. We present two foundational results in universal\ncausal inference. The first result, called the Universal Causality Theorem\n(UCT), pertains to the universality of diagrams, which are viewed as functors\nmapping both objects and relationships from an indexing category of abstract\ncausal diagrams to an actual causal model whose nodes are labeled by random\nvariables, and edges represent functional or probabilistic relationships. UCT\nstates that any causal inference can be represented in a canonical way as the\nco-limit of an abstract causal diagram of representable objects. UCT follows\nfrom a basic result in the theory of sheaves. The second result, the Causal\nReproducing Property (CRP), states that any causal influence of a object X on\nanother object Y is representable as a natural transformation between two\nabstract causal diagrams. CRP follows from the Yoneda Lemma, one of the deepest\nresults in category theory. The CRP property is analogous to the reproducing\nproperty in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces that served as the foundation for\nkernel methods in machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 18:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

However, in many scenarios, the use of multiple\ninformation maps that encode different types of relevant information is common.\nErgodic search methods currently do not possess the ability for simultaneous\nnor do they have a way to balance which information gets priority. This leads\nus to formulate a Multi-Objective Ergodic Search (MOES) problem, which aims at\nfinding the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions, for the purpose of providing\nhuman decision makers various solutions that trade off between conflicting\ncriteria. To efficiently solve MOES, we develop a framework called Sequential\nLocal Ergodic Search (SLES) that converts a MOES problem into a \"weight space\ncoverage\" problem. It leverages the recent advances in ergodic search methods\nas well as the idea of local optimization to efficiently approximate the\nPareto-optimal front. Our numerical results show that SLES runs distinctly\nfaster than the baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 19:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

As a start towards increasing transparency, AI researchers have\nappropriated the use of the Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) from a measure of\npatient photosensitivity to a measure for estimating skin tone in algorithmic\naudits of computer vision applications including facial recognition and\ndermatology diagnosis. In order to understand the variability of estimated FST\nannotations on images, we compare several FST annotation methods on a diverse\nset of 460 images of skin conditions from both textbooks and online dermatology\natlases.

This framework incorporates a\nvirtual-autofocusing neural network to digitally refocus the defocused images\nand then transforms the refocused images into virtually stained images using a\nsuccessive network. These cascaded networks form a collaborative inference\nscheme: the virtual staining model regularizes the virtual-autofocusing network\nthrough a style loss during the training. To demonstrate the efficacy of this\nframework, we trained and blindly tested these networks using human lung\ntissue. Using 4x fewer focus points with 2x lower focusing precision, we\nsuccessfully transformed the coarsely-focused autofluorescence images into\nhigh-quality virtually stained H&E images, matching the standard virtual\nstaining framework that used finely-focused autofluorescence input images.\nWithout sacrificing the staining quality, this framework decreases the total\nimage acquisition time needed for virtual staining of a label-free whole-slide\nimage (WSI) by ~32%, together with a ~89% decrease in the autofocusing time,\nand has the potential to eliminate the laborious and costly histochemical\nstaining process in pathology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 19:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-31"}

In addition,\nthe distance metric in the latent space is learned to preserve the similarity\nbetween grasps across different robotic hands, where the similarity of grasps\nis defined according to contact regions of the robotic hands. This property\nenables our method to transfer grasps between different grippers including a\nhuman hand, and grasp transfer has the potential to share grasping skills\nbetween robots and enable robots to learn grasping skills from humans.\nFurthermore, the encoded signed distance functions of objects and grasps in our\nimplicit representation can be used for 6D object pose estimation with grasping\ncontact optimization from partial point clouds, which enables robotic grasping\nin the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 20:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Advanced computer vision object detection\ntechniques have demonstrated great success in identifying objects of interest\nsuch as ships, automobiles, and aircraft from satellite and drone imagery. Yet\nrelying on computer vision opens up significant vulnerabilities, namely, the\nsusceptibility of object detection algorithms to adversarial attacks. In this\npaper we explore the efficacy and drawbacks of adversarial camouflage in an\noverhead imagery context. While a number of recent papers have demonstrated the\nability to reliably fool deep learning classifiers and object detectors with\nadversarial patches, most of this work has been performed on relatively uniform\ndatasets and only a single class of objects. In this work we utilize the\nVisDrone dataset, which has a large range of perspectives and object sizes. We\nexplore four different object classes: bus, car, truck, van. We build a library\nof 24 adversarial patches to disguise these objects, and introduce a patch\ntranslucency variable to our patches. The translucency (or alpha value) of the\npatches is highly correlated to their efficacy. Further, we show that while\nadversarial patches may fool object detectors, the presence of such patches is\noften easily uncovered, with patches on average 24% more detectable than the\nobjects the patches were meant to hide. This raises the question of whether\nsuch patches truly constitute camouflage.

As the quantization error caused by weights binarization has been\nreduced in earlier works, the activations binarization becomes the major\nobstacle for further improvement of the accuracy. BNN characterises a unique\nand interesting structure, where the binary and latent FP activations exist in\nthe same forward pass (i.e., $\\text{Binarize}(\\mathbf{a}_F) = \\mathbf{a}_B$).\nTo mitigate the information degradation caused by the binarization operation\nfrom FP to binary activations, we establish a novel contrastive learning\nframework while training BNNs through the lens of Mutual Information (MI)\nmaximization.

Currently, change point detection\nmethods for multivariate high-dimensional data are scarce, with even less\navailable in high-level, easily accessible software packages. To this end, we\nintroduce the R package fabisearch, available on the Comprehensive R Archive\nNetwork (CRAN), which implements the factorized binary search (FaBiSearch)\nmethodology.

Here, we investigate\nthe effects of the surface termination and the oxygen vacancy position on the\nelectronic properties and vacancy energetics of LaNiO$_3$ ultra-thin films\nusing density functional theory plus U (DFT+U). We find that oxygen vacancies\ncan be easily formed in the Ni layers with the NiO$_2$ terminated surface (0.5\nu.c. and 1.5 u.c. thickness) compared to the structures with the LaO terminated\nsurface and the in-plane vacancy is energetically favored than the out-of-plane\nvacancy. When two vacancy sites are allowed, the Ni square plane geometry is\nenergetically more stable in most cases as two oxygen vacancies tend to stay\nnear a Ni ion. The in-plane vacancy of the NiO$_2$ terminated structure is\nfavored since the released charge due to the oxygen vacancy can be easily\naccommodated in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which is less occupied than the\n$d_{z^2}$ orbital. Remarkably, the oxygen vacancy structure containing the Ni\nsquare-plane geometry becomes an insulating state in DFT+U with a sizable band\ngap of 1.2eV because the large crystal field splitting between $d_{z^2}$ and\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in the square-plane favors an insulating state and the\nMott insulating state is induced in other Ni sites due to strong electronic\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 21:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Here, we propose a\nnovel axiomatic method to match similar regions across shapes. Matching similar\nregions is formulated as the alignment of the spectra of operators closely\nrelated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO). The main novelty of the\nproposed approach is the consideration of differential operators defined on a\nmanifold with multiple metrics. The choice of a metric relates to fundamental\nshape properties while considering the same manifold under different metrics\ncan thus be viewed as analyzing the underlying manifold from different\nperspectives. Specifically, we examine the scale-invariant metric and the\ncorresponding scale-invariant Laplace-Beltrami operator (SI-LBO) along with the\nregular metric and the regular LBO. We demonstrate that the scale-invariant\nmetric emphasizes the locations of important semantic features in articulated\nshapes. A truncated spectrum of the SI-LBO consequently better captures locally\ncurved regions and complements the global information encapsulated in the\ntruncated spectrum of the regular LBO. We show that matching these dual spectra\noutperforms competing axiomatic frameworks when tested on standard benchmarks.\nWe introduced a new dataset and compare the proposed method with the\nstate-of-the-art learning based approach in a cross-database configuration.\nSpecifically, we show that, when trained on one data set and tested on another,\nthe proposed axiomatic approach which does not involve training, outperforms\nthe deep learning alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 00:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

However, due to a\ntarget selection bias in favor of main-sequence stars, only a handful of\ntransiting planets have been found orbiting evolved hosts. These planets, most\nof which are giants, hold important information regarding the formation and\nevolution of planetary systems. In this thesis, I sought to increase the sample\nof known giant planets orbiting red-giant stars, focusing on data from NASA's\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, and to improve their\ncharacterization. Specifically, I focused on close-in giant planets orbiting\n(preferably) oscillating low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars. To\nimprove characterization, I developed a method to model planetary transits and\nstellar signals simultaneously, implementing Gaussian processes to model\nstellar granulation and the oscillations envelope in the time domain. My\nresults show that the model enables time-domain asteroseismology, inferring the\nfrequency of maximum oscillation amplitude, $\\nu_\\text{max}$, to within 1\\%.\nThe method's implementation is open-source and available to the community.\nRegarding the planet search, I assembled a pipeline, mostly comprised of\nthird-party open-source software and explored a sample of $\\sim$40,000 bright\nLLRGB stars in the southern hemisphere of TESS's field of view. The search\nidentified four planet candidates, two of which are not currently known planets\nand orbit red-giant stars. Radial-velocity follow-up observations of both these\ncandidates have tentatively confirmed their planetary nature. Finally, I also\nconfirmed the planetary nature of an additional candidate, not part of the\nabove sample, through RV observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 00:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

While much work has been done\nto provide adaptive assistance when students seek help, they may not seek help\noptimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive\nassistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of\nstruggle or unproductivity. Determining when and whether to provide\npersonalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance dilemma.\nAddressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains,\nwhere there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored\nmethods to determine when to proactively help students, but few of these\nmethods have taken prior hint usage into account. In this paper, we present a\nnovel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting\ntheir need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals\nwith the open-ended and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a\ncontrolled study to investigate the impact of an adaptive hint policy based on\npredictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage. We show\nempirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a\nsignificant amount of time in training, and lead to improved posttest results,\nwhen compared to a control without proactive interventions. We also show that\nincorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the adaptive hint\npolicy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training\nunproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help\nappropriateness (a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be\nneeded). We conclude with suggestions on the domains that can benefit from this\napproach as well as the requirements for adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 00:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

When the Bernstein-von\nMises theorem is applied to construct credible sets, in addition to the usual\nform there will be an additional bias term on the left endpoint closely related\nto the number of atoms of the true distribution when it is discrete. We also\ndiscuss the affect of the estimators for the model parameters of the NGGP under\nthe Bernstein-von Mises convergences. Finally, to further explain the necessity\nof adding the bias correction in constructing credible sets, we illustrate\nnumerically how the bias correction affects the coverage of the true value by\nthe credible sets when the true distribution is discrete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 01:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 21:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

When these nanoscale features are disordered, but still\ncorrelated, the photonic balls can show structural color with low\nangle-dependence. Their colors, combined with the ability to add them to a\nliquid formulation, make photonic balls a promising new type of pigment\nparticle for paints, coatings, and other applications. However, it is\nchallenging to predict the color of materials made from photonic balls, because\nthe sphere geometry and multiple scattering must be accounted for. To address\nthese challenges, we develop a multiscale modeling approach involving Monte\nCarlo simulations of multiple scattering at two different scales: we simulate\nmultiple scattering and absorption within a photonic ball and then use the\nresults to simulate multiple scattering and absorption in a film of photonic\nballs. After validating against experimental spectra, we use the model to show\nthat films of photonic balls scatter light in fundamentally different ways than\ndo homogeneous films of nanopores or nanoparticles, because of their increased\nsurface area and refraction at the interfaces of the balls. Both effects tend\nto sharply reduce color saturation relative to a homogeneous nanostructured\nfilm. We show that saturated colors can be achieved by placing an absorber\ndirectly in the photonic balls and mitigating surface roughness. With these\ndesign rules, we show that photonic-ball films have an advantage over\nhomogeneous nanostructured films: their colors are even less dependent on the\nangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 01:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 17:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 20:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

In this paper, we show,\nfor the first time, that accuracy-driven multi-view environment lighting can\nreveal out-of-camera scene information and compromise privacy. We present a\nsimple yet effective privacy attack that extracts sensitive scene information\nsuch as human face and text information from the rendered objects, under a\nnumber of application scenarios.\n  To defend against such attacks, we develop a novel $IPC^{2}S$ defense and a\nconditional $R^2$ defense.

SkeleMixCLR leverages the trimmed and truncated\nviews to provide abundant hard contrastive pairs since they involve some\ncontext information from each other due to the graph convolution operations,\nwhich allows the model to learn better motion representations for action\nrecognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD\ndatasets show that SkeleMixCLR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Although the existing psychometric-based\nlearning diagnosis methods provide some domain interpretation through cognitive\nparameters, they have insufficient modeling capability with a shallow structure\nfor large-scale learning data. While the deep learning-based learning diagnosis\nmethods have improved the accuracy of learning performance prediction, their\ninherent black-box properties lead to a lack of interpretability, making their\nresults untrustworthy for educational applications. To settle the above\nproblem, the proposed unified interpretable intelligent learning diagnosis\nframework, which benefits from the powerful representation learning ability of\ndeep learning and the interpretability of psychometrics, achieves a better\nperformance of learning prediction and provides interpretability from three\naspects: cognitive parameters, learner-resource response network, and weights\nof self-attention mechanism.

To\nsolve this problem, we propose a novel style interleaved learning (IL)\nframework.

Labels for the Cartesian velocities or contiguous sequences, which are\nexpensive to obtain, are not required. The general idea is to pre-train an\nobject detection network without velocities using single-frame OBB labels, and\nthen exploit the network's OBB predictions on unlabelled data for velocity\ntraining. In detail, the network's OBB predictions of the unlabelled frames are\nupdated to the timestamp of a labelled frame using the predicted velocities and\nthe distances between the updated OBBs of the unlabelled frame and the OBB\npredictions of the labelled frame are used to generate a self-supervised\ntraining signal for the velocities. The detection network architecture is\nextended by a module to account for the temporal relation of multiple scans and\na module to represent the radars' radial velocity measurements explicitly. A\ntwo-step approach of first training only OBB detection, followed by training\nOBB detection and velocities is used. Further, a pre-training with\npseudo-labels generated from radar radial velocity measurements bootstraps the\nself-supervised method of this paper. Experiments on the publicly available\nnuScenes dataset show that the proposed method almost reaches the velocity\nestimation performance of a fully supervised training, but does not require\nexpensive velocity labels.

This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to\nimprove ranking performance on smaller datasets using supervised contrastive\nlearning for the document ranking problem. We perform data augmentation by\ncreating training data using parts of the relevant documents in the\nquery-document pairs. We then use a supervised contrastive learning objective\nto learn an effective ranking model from the augmented dataset. Our experiments\non subsets of the TREC-DL dataset show that, although data augmentation leads\nto an increasing the training data sizes, it does not necessarily improve the\nperformance using existing pointwise or pairwise training objectives. However,\nour proposed supervised contrastive loss objective leads to performance\nimprovements over the standard non-augmented setting showcasing the utility of\ndata augmentation using contrastive losses. Finally, we show the real benefit\nof using supervised contrastive learning objectives by showing marked\nimprovements in smaller ranking datasets relating to news (Robust04), finance\n(FiQA), and scientific fact checking (SciFact).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 08:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Observational verification is scarce. We review and\ndiscuss recent results from various instruments and spectral domains. In SDO\nand TRACE images spicules appear in emission in the 1600, 1700 and 304 A bands\nand in absorption in the EUV bands; the latter is due to photo-ionization of H\nand He I. At the shortest available AIA wavelength and taking into account that\nthe photospheric limb is $\\sim0.34$Mm above the $\\tau_{5000}=1$ level, we found\nthat CCTR emission starts at $\\sim3.7$Mm; extrapolating to $\\lambda=0$, where\nthere is no chromospheric absorption, we deduced a height of $3.0\\pm 0.5$Mm,\nabove the value of 2.14Mm of the Avrett & Loeser model. Another indicator of\nthe extent of the chromosphere is the height of the network structures. Height\ndifferences produce a limbward shift of features with respect to their\ncounterparts in magnetograms. Using this approach, we measured heights of\n$0.14\\pm0.04$Mm (at 1700 A), $0.31\\pm0.09$Mm (at 1600 A) and $3.31\\pm 0.18$Mm\n(at 304 A) for the center of the solar disk. A previously reported possible\nsolar cycle variation is not confirmed. A third indicator is the position of\nthe limb in the UV, where IRIS observations of the Mg II triplet lines show\nthat they extend up to $\\sim2.1$Mm above the 2832 A limb, while AIA/SDO images\ngive a limb height of $1.4 \\pm 0.2$Mm (1600 A) and $5.7\\pm 0.2$Mm (304 A).\nFinally, ALMA mm-$\\lambda$ full-disk images provide useful diagnostics, though\nnot very accurate; values of $2.4\\pm0.7$Mm at 1.26mm and $4.2\\pm2.5$Mm at 3mm\nwere obtained.

The problem is challenging on real-world datasets,\nespecially with under-sampling data, and we find that previous methods perform\npoorly in this case. Generally, ML methods first transform input data into a\nlow-dimensional embedding space to maintain the data's geometric structure and\nsubsequently perform downstream tasks therein. The poor local connectivity of\nunder-sampling data in the former step and inappropriate optimization\nobjectives in the latter step leads to two problems: structural distortion and\nunderconstrained embedding. This paper proposes a novel ML framework named Deep\nLocal-flatness Manifold Embedding (DLME) to solve these problems. The proposed\nDLME constructs semantic manifolds by data augmentation and overcomes the\nstructural distortion problem using a smoothness constrained based on a local\nflatness assumption about the manifold. To overcome the underconstrained\nembedding problem, we design a loss and theoretically demonstrate that it leads\nto a more suitable embedding based on the local flatness. Experiments on three\ntypes of datasets (toy, biological, and image) for various downstream tasks\n(classification, clustering, and visualization) show that our proposed DLME\noutperforms state-of-the-art ML and contrastive learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 08:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

To Harness\nOOD data, this paper proposes a HOOD method that can leverage the content and\nstyle from each image instance to identify benign and malign OOD data.\nParticularly, we design a variational inference framework to causally\ndisentangle content and style features by constructing a structural causal\nmodel. Subsequently, we augment the content and style through an intervention\nprocess to produce malign and benign OOD data, respectively. The benign OOD\ndata contain novel styles but hold our interested contents, and they can be\nleveraged to help train a style-invariant model. In contrast, the malign OOD\ndata inherit unknown contents but carry familiar styles, by detecting them can\nimprove model robustness against deceiving anomalies. Thanks to the proposed\nnovel disentanglement and data augmentation techniques, HOOD can effectively\ndeal with OOD examples in unknown and open environments, whose effectiveness is\nempirically validated in three typical OOD applications including OOD\ndetection, open-set semi-supervised learning, and open-set domain adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 08:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 02:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

In this study, we propose an end-to-end model that takes speech as\ninput and outputs punctuated texts. This model is expected to predict\npunctuation robustly against speech recognition errors while using acoustic\ninformation. We also propose to incorporate an auxiliary loss to train the\nmodel using the output of the intermediate layer and unpunctuated texts.\nThrough experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed model to that\nof a cascaded system. The proposed model achieves higher punctuation prediction\naccuracy than the cascaded system without sacrificing the speech recognition\nerror rate. It is also demonstrated that the multi-task learning using the\nintermediate output against the unpunctuated text is effective. Moreover, the\nproposed model has only about 1/7th of the parameters compared to the cascaded\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 08:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Under the indirect evolutionary approach, agents make\ndecisions by optimizing a subjective utility function. Evolution may select for\nsubjective preferences that differ from the fitness function, and in\nparticular, subjective preferences for increasing or reducing other agents'\nfitness. However, indirect evolutionary models typically artificially restrict\nthe space of strategies that agents might use (assuming that agents always play\na Nash equilibrium under their subjective preferences), and dropping this\nrestriction can undermine the finding that other-regarding preferences are\nselected for. Can the indirect evolutionary approach still be used to explain\nthe apparent existence of other-regarding preferences, like altruism, in\nhumans?

In contrast, most training-oriented platforms use at\nleast 16-bit floating-point (FP) formats. Lower-precision data types such as\n8-bit FP formats and mixed-precision techniques have only recently been\nexplored in hardware implementations. We present MiniFloat-NN, a RISC-V\ninstruction set architecture extension for low-precision NN training, providing\nsupport for two 8-bit and two 16-bit FP formats and expanding operations. The\nextension includes sum-of-dot-product instructions that accumulate the result\nin a larger format and three-term additions in two variations: expanding and\nnon-expanding. We implement an ExSdotp unit to efficiently support in hardware\nboth instruction types.

Currently, two\npopular loss functions are widely used to optimize recommender systems: the\npointwise and the pairwise. Although these loss functions are widely used,\nhowever, there are two problems. (1) These traditional loss functions do not\nfit the goals of recommendation systems adequately and utilize prior knowledge\ninformation sufficiently. (2) The slow convergence speed of these traditional\nloss functions makes the practical application of various recommendation models\ndifficult.\n  To address these issues, we propose a novel loss function named Supervised\nPersonalized Ranking (SPR) Based on Prior Knowledge.

Unlike BPR, instead of\nconstructing <user, positive item, negative item> triples, the proposed SPR\nconstructs <user, similar user, positive item, negative item> quadruples.\nAlthough SPR is very simple, it is very effective.

In our first application for floor plan reconstruction from\npoint clouds, our method selects and refines the room proposals, modelled as 2D\npolygons, by optimizing on an objective function combining the fitness as\npredicted by a deep network and regularizing terms on the room shapes. We also\nintroduce a novel differentiable method for rendering the polygonal shapes of\nthese proposals. Our evaluations on the recent and challenging Structured3D and\nFloor-SP datasets show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art,\nwithout imposing hard constraints nor assumptions on the floor plan\nconfigurations. In our second application, we extend our approach to\nreconstruct general 3D room layouts from a color image and obtain accurate room\nlayouts.

Therefore,\nhow to distinguish the computer-generated graphics (CG) from the photographs\n(PG) has become an important topic in the field of digital image forensics.\nThis paper proposes a dual stream convolutional neural network based on channel\njoint and softpool. The proposed network architecture includes a residual\nmodule for extracting image noise information and a joint channel information\nextraction module for capturing the shallow semantic information of image. In\naddition, we also design a residual structure to enhance feature extraction and\nreduce the loss of information in residual flow. The joint channel information\nextraction module can obtain the shallow semantic information of the input\nimage which can be used as the information supplement block of the residual\nmodule. The whole network uses SoftPool to reduce the information loss of\ndown-sampling for image. Finally, we fuse the two flows to get the\nclassification results.

Patches with high entropy are being processed by the encoder with\nthe largest number of parameters, patches with moderate entropy are processed\nby the encoder with a moderate number of parameters, and patches with low\nentropy are processed by the smallest encoder.

The proposed MaRS keeps the radar advantages of constant modulus,\nzero auto-correlation, and simple SIC.

The\nmain subtlety lies in proving AB4, which is that coproducts indexed by\narbitrary sets are left-exact. To prove this, we replace a set with its strict\ncategory of (ordered) finite sub-multisets. From showing that the latter is\nfiltered, we deduce left-exactness of the coproduct. More generally, we show\nthat exactness of filtered colimits (AB5) implies AB4 for any abelian category\nin HoTT. Our approach is heavily inspired by Roswitha Harting's construction of\nthe internal coproduct of abelian groups in an elementary topos with a natural\nnumbers object [Har82].\n  To state the AB axioms we define and study filtered (and sifted)\nprecategories in HoTT. A key result needed is that filtered colimits commute\nwith finite limits of sets. This is a familiar classical result, but has not\npreviously been checked in our setting.\n  Finally, we interpret our most central results into an $\\infty$-topos\n$\\mathscr{X}$.

In\nparticular, we propose three growth operations, full doubling, RC doubling and\ndoubling, and explore the algorithmic and structural properties of their\nresulting processes under a geometric setting. In terms of modeling, our system\nruns on a 2-dimensional grid and operates in discrete time-steps. The process\nbegins with an initial shape $S_I=S_0$ and, in every time-step $t \\geq 1$, by\napplying (in parallel) one or more growth operations of a specific type to the\ncurrent shape-instance $S_{t-1}$, generates the next instance $S_t$, always\nsatisfying $|S_t| > |S_{t-1}|$. Our goal is to characterize the classes of\nshapes that can be constructed in $O(\\log n)$ or polylog $n$ time-steps and\ndetermine whether a final shape $S_F$ can be constructed from an initial shape\n$S_I$ using a finite sequence of growth operations of a given type, called a\nconstructor of $S_F$.\n  For full doubling, in which, in every time-step, every node generates a new\nnode in a given direction, we completely characterize the structure of the\nclass of shapes that can be constructed from a given initial shape. For RC\ndoubling, in which complete columns or rows double, our main contribution is a\nlinear-time centralized algorithm that for any pair of shapes $S_I$, $S_F$\ndecides if $S_F$ can be constructed from $S_I$ and, if the answer is yes,\nreturns an $O(\\log n)$-time-step constructor of $S_F$ from $S_I$. For the most\ngeneral doubling operation, where up to individual nodes can double, we show\nthat some shapes cannot be constructed in sub-linear time-steps and give two\nuniversal constructors of any $S_F$ from a singleton $S_I$, which are efficient\n(i.e., up to polylogarithmic time-steps) for large classes of shapes. Both\nconstructors can be computed by polynomial-time centralized algorithms for any\nshape $S_F$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 13:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

The increasing\npenetration of distributed renewable energy not only brings clean power but\nalso challenges the voltage regulation and energy-saving performance of CVR by\nintroducing high uncertainties to distribution systems. In most cases, the\nconventional robust optimization methods for CVR only provide conservative\nsolutions. To better consider the impacts of load and PV generation\nuncertainties on CVR implementation in distribution systems and provide less\nconservative solutions, this paper develops a data-based DRCC-CVR model with\ntractable reformulation and data enrichment method. Even though the\nuncertainties of load and photovoltaic (PV) can be captured by data, the\navailability of smart meters (SMs) and micro-phasor measurement units (PMUs) is\nrestricted by cost budget.

Previous research has demonstrated that the two\nparadigms have clear complementary advantages, but few models have attempted to\nleverage these advantages in a single NER model as far as we know. In our\nprevious work, we proposed a paradigm known as Bundling Learning (BL) to\naddress the above problem. The BL paradigm bundles the two NER paradigms,\nenabling NER models to jointly tune their parameters by weighted summing each\nparadigm's training loss. However, three critical issues remain unresolved:\nWhen does BL work? Why does BL work? Can BL enhance the existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) NER models? To address the first two issues, we\nimplement three NER models, involving a sequence labeling-based model--SeqNER,\na span-based NER model--SpanNER, and BL-NER that bundles SeqNER and SpanNER\ntogether. We draw two conclusions regarding the two issues based on the\nexperimental results on eleven NER datasets from five domains. We then apply BL\nto five existing SOTA NER models to investigate the third issue, consisting of\nthree sequence labeling-based models and two span-based models. Experimental\nresults indicate that BL consistently enhances their performance, suggesting\nthat it is possible to construct a new SOTA NER system by incorporating BL into\nthe current SOTA system.

It leads us to suggest a simple practice to improve the\ninterpretation outcomes: Calibrate to Interpret.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 14:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

We propose a robust\nmodel-based technique to identify the potential by minimizing a regularized\ndata fidelity term, and regularization is taken as the total variation and the\nsquared Laplacian. A split Bregman method is used to solve the regularized\noptimization problem. Our method is robust to noise by utilizing a Successively\nDenoised Differentiation technique. We consider additional constraints such as\ncompact support and symmetry constraints to enhance the performance further. We\nalso apply this method to identify time-varying potentials and identify the\ninteraction kernel in an agent-based system.

Traditionally, the decision-maker's expected performance has been\ncompared to the expected performance of the prophet, i.e., the expected offline\noptimum. We refer to this measure as the Ratio of Expectations (or, in short,\nRoE). However, a major limitation of the RoE measure is that it only gives a\nguarantee against what the optimum would be on average, while, in theory,\nalgorithms still might perform poorly compared to the realized ex-post optimal\nvalue.\n  Hence, we study alternative performance measures. In particular, we suggest\nthe Expected Ratio (or, in short, EoR), which is the expectation of the ratio\nbetween the value of the algorithm and the value of the prophet. This measure\nyields desirable guarantees, e.g., a constant EoR implies achieving a constant\nfraction of the ex-post offline optimum with constant probability. Moreover, in\nthe single-choice setting, we show that the EoR is equivalent (in the worst\ncase) to the probability of selecting the maximum, a well-studied measure in\nthe literature. This is no longer the case for combinatorial constraints\n(beyond single-choice), which is the main focus of this paper.\n  Our main goal is to understand the relation between RoE and EoR in\ncombinatorial settings. Specifically, we establish a two-way black-box\nreduction: for every feasibility constraint, the RoE and the EoR are at most a\nconstant factor apart. This implies a wealth of EoR results in multiple\nsettings where RoE results are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 15:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 16:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 13:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

We find strong evidence for angular structure in\nthe lens; our best model is comprised of a power-law profile plus multipole\nperturbations and external potential, with a Bayes factor of $+14984$ relative\nto the elliptical power-law model. It is noteworthy that the elliptical\npower-law mass distribution is a remarkably good fit on its own, with\nadditional model complexity correcting the deflection angles only at the\n$\\sim5$ mas level. We also consider the effects of added complexity in the lens\nmodel on time-delay cosmography and flux-ratio analyses. We find that an overly\nsimplistic power-law ellipsoid lens model can bias the measurement of $H_0$ by\n$\\sim3$ per cent and mimic flux ratio anomalies of $\\sim8$ per cent. Our\nresults demonstrate the power of high-resolution VLBI observations to provide\nstrong constraints on the inner density profiles of lens galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 15:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 09:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

We present MuRiT, a scalable algorithm\nthat computes the pathwise persistence barcodes of multi-filtered flag\ncomplexes by means of Vietoris-Rips transformations. Moreover, we provide an\nefficient software implementation of the MuRiT algorithm which resorts to\nRipser for the actual computation of Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes. To\ndemonstrate the applicability of MuRiT to real-world datasets, we establish\nMuRiT as part of our CoVtRec pipeline for the surveillance of the convergent\nevolution of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 15:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Traditionally,\ntheoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the\ninteractions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on\nthe evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate\nsociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social\ninteraction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable\npredictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of\nsocial media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models\nfrom a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any\nscientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work,\nwe present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural\nNetwork (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by\ntransporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from\nnatural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social\npsychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that\nsimultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent\nthe social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating\nmatrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information\n(e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the\nsocial interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training\nprocedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include\nstochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in\npredicting opinion dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 05:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

This extremal\ndependence stems from the geometrical characteristics of the observed rainfall,\nwhich is associated with different meteorological processes and is usually\nconsidered to be constant when designing the model for a study. However,\ndepending on the region, this dependence can change throughout the year, as the\nprevailing meteorological conditions that drive the rainfall generation process\nchange with the season. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of the\nseasonal change in extremal dependence for the modeling of annual block maxima\nin the Berlin-Brandenburg region. For this study, two seasons were considered\nas proxies for different dominant meteorological conditions: summer for\nconvective rainfall and winter for frontal/stratiform rainfall. Using maxima\nfrom both seasons, we compared the skill of a linear model with spatial\ncovariates (that assumed spatial independence) with the skill of a\nBrown-Resnick max-stable model. This comparison showed a considerable\ndifference between seasons, with the isotropic Brown-Resnick model showing\nconsiderable loss of skill for the winter maxima. We conclude that the\nassumptions commonly made when using the Brown-Resnick model are appropriate\nfor modeling summer (i.e., convective) events, but further work should be done\nfor modeling other types of precipitation regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 18:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

To address this need, a probabilistic collapse\nassessment framework for steel structures is proposed in this paper. The\nframework is based on the integration of a high-fidelity fiber-based nonlinear\nstructural modeling environment with a wind-tunnel-informed stochastic wind\nload model to perform nonlinear time history analysis. General uncertainty is\npropagated using a stratified sampling scheme enabling the efficient estimation\nof reliabilities associated with rare events. The adopted models for simulating\nhigh-fidelity nonlinear structural behavior were found, in general, to be\nadequate for capturing phenomena, including progressive yielding, buckling, and\nlow-cycle fatigue, that are essential for wind induced collapse analysis. In\nparticular, the adopted fatigue model was found to be capable of predicting\ndamage and potential fiber/section fracture associated with non-fully reversing\nstress-strain cycles that are characteristic of wind loading. Through\nillustration on a 45-story archetype steel building, critical discussions on\nthe types of observed collapse mechanisms, the difference between alongwind and\nacrosswind nonlinear behavior, reliabilities associated with first yield, and\ncollapse are presented. A probabilistic description of the residual and peak\nstory drifts is also provided through development of fragility functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 19:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}
