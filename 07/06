This severely limits its use in\nquantifying the low frequency instrumental noise in the Michelson X\ncombination, which is expected to be dominated by acceleration noise. However,\nwe show that one can still use in-flight noise estimations from $\\zeta$ to put\nan upper bound on the considered noises entering in the X channel, which allows\nto distinguish them from a strong stochastic gravitational wave background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 16:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 14:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 09:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

It involves a bagging application to decision tree\nmodels. One of the primary advantages of the Random Forests model is the\nreduction in the variance of the forecast. In large scale applications of the\nmodel with millions of data points and hundreds of features, the size of the\nfitted objects can get very large and reach the limits on the available space\nin production setups, depending on the number and depth of the trees. This\ncould be especially challenging when trained models need to be downloaded\non-demand to small devices with limited memory. There is a need to approximate\nthe trained RF models to significantly reduce the model size without losing too\nmuch of prediction accuracy. In this project we study methods that approximate\neach fitted tree in the Random Forests model using the multinomial allocation\nof the data points to the leafs.

It can provide effective information for many downstream tasks, such\nas collision avoidance, path planning, and static map construction. How to\neffectively exploit the spatial-temporal information is a critical question for\n3D LiDAR moving object segmentation (LiDAR-MOS). In this work, we propose a\nnovel deep neural network exploiting both spatial-temporal information and\ndifferent representation modalities of LiDAR scans to improve LiDAR-MOS\nperformance. Specifically, we first use a range image-based dual-branch\nstructure to separately deal with spatial and temporal information that can be\nobtained from sequential LiDAR scans, and later combine them using\nmotion-guided attention modules.

In this paper, we\npropose CoBEVT, the first generic multi-agent multi-camera perception framework\nthat can cooperatively generate BEV map predictions. To efficiently fuse camera\nfeatures from multi-view and multi-agent data in an underlying Transformer\narchitecture, we design a fused axial attention module (FAX), which captures\nsparsely local and global spatial interactions across views and agents.

Numerous deepfake detection methods are thus proposed.\nHowever, existing methods only focus on detecting one-step facial manipulation.\nAs the emergence of easy-accessible facial editing applications, people can\neasily manipulate facial components using multi-step operations in a sequential\nmanner. This new threat requires us to detect a sequence of facial\nmanipulations, which is vital for both detecting deepfake media and recovering\noriginal faces afterwards. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need\nand propose a novel research problem called Detecting Sequential DeepFake\nManipulation (Seq-DeepFake). Unlike the existing deepfake detection task only\ndemanding a binary label prediction, detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation\nrequires correctly predicting a sequential vector of facial manipulation\noperations. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first\nSeq-DeepFake dataset, where face images are manipulated sequentially with\ncorresponding annotations of sequential facial manipulation vectors. Based on\nthis new dataset, we cast detecting Seq-DeepFake manipulation as a specific\nimage-to-sequence (e.g. image captioning) task and propose a concise yet\neffective Seq-DeepFake Transformer (SeqFakeFormer). Moreover, we build a\ncomprehensive benchmark and set up rigorous evaluation protocols and metrics\nfor this new research problem.

To analyse the models and observations uniformly, we\nintroduce CENSAT, a new algorithm to define whether a galaxy is a central or a\nsatellite system based on an isolation criterion. We find that the conformity\nsignal is present, up to at least 5 Mpc from the centres of low- and\nintermediate-mass centrals in the latest version of L-GALAXIES (Ayromlou et al.\n2021), IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, as well as in SDSS and DESI observational\nsamples.

However, the recent advent of wide-area deep ground-based imaging\nsurveys now probe volumes large enough to discover AGNs, at depths sensitive\nenough for fainter star-forming galaxies, bridging these two populations. Using\nresults from such surveys as observational constraints, we present a\nmethodology to jointly empirically model the evolution of the rest-UV\nluminosity functions at z=3-9. We assume both populations have a LF\nwell-described by a double power law modified to allow a flattening at the\nfaint-end, and that all LF parameters evolve smoothly with redshift. This\nprovides a good fit to the observations, and makes predictions to volume\ndensities and redshifts not yet observed. We find that the volume density of\nbright (M_UV = -28) AGNs rises by five orders of magnitude from z=9 to z=3,\nwhile modestly bright (M_UV = -21) galaxies rise by only two orders of\nmagnitude across the same epoch. The observed bright-end flattening of the z=9\nLF is unlikely to be due to AGN, and rather is due to a shallowing of the\nbright-end slope, implying reduced feedback in bright galaxies at early times.\nIntegrating our LFs we find that the intrinsic ionizing emissivity is dominated\nby galaxies at all z > 3, and this result holds even after applying a notional\nescape fraction. We compare our AGN LFs to predictions based on different\nblack-hole seeding models, finding decent agreement on average, but that all\nmodels are unable to predict the observed abundance of bright AGNs. We make\npredictions for the upcoming Euclid and Roman observatories, showing that their\nrespective wide-area surveys should be capable of discovering AGNs to z ~ 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 18:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Scientific\nfields like vision science have always leaned heavily on the methods and\nprocedures of psychophysics, but there is now growing appreciation of them by\nmachine learning researchers, sparked by widening overlap between biological\nand artificial perception \\cite{rojas2011automatic,\nscheirer2014perceptual,escalera2014chalearn,zhang2018agil,\ngrieggs2021measuring}. Machine perception that is guided by behavioral\nmeasurements, as opposed to guidance restricted to arbitrarily assigned human\nlabels, has significant potential to fuel further progress in artificial\nintelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 18:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

Video-based assessment allows surgeons to receive feedback on\ntheir technical skills to facilitate learning and development. Currently, this\nfeedback comes primarily from manual video review, which is time-intensive and\nlimits the feasibility of tracking a surgeon's progress over many cases. In\nthis work, we introduce a motion-based approach to automatically assess\nsurgical skills from surgical case video feed. The proposed pipeline first\ntracks surgical tools reliably to create motion trajectories and then uses\nthose trajectories to predict surgeon technical skill levels. The tracking\nalgorithm employs a simple yet effective re-identification module that improves\nID-switch compared to other state-of-the-art methods. This is critical for\ncreating reliable tool trajectories when instruments regularly move on- and\noff-screen or are periodically obscured. The motion-based classification model\nemploys a state-of-the-art self-attention transformer network to capture short-\nand long-term motion patterns that are essential for skill evaluation. The\nproposed method is evaluated on an in-vivo (Cholec80) dataset where an\nexpert-rated GOALS skill assessment of the Calot Triangle Dissection is used as\na quantitative skill measure. We compare transformer-based skill assessment\nwith traditional machine learning approaches using the proposed and\nstate-of-the-art tracking.

The\nA-Phi formulation is immune to low-frequency breakdown and ideal for broadband\nand multi-scale analysis. The generalized Lorenz gauge is used in this paper,\nwhich decouples the A equation and the Phi equation. The A-Phi formulation is\ndiscretized by using the DEC, which is the discretized version of the exterior\ncalculus in differential geometry. In general, DEC can be viewed as a\ngeneralized version of the finite difference method, where Stokes' theorem and\nGauss's theorem are naturally preserved. Furthermore, compared with finite\ndifference method, where rectangular grids are applied, DEC can be implemented\nwith unstructured mesh schemes, such as tetrahedral meshes. Thus, the proposed\nDEC A-Phi solver is inherently stable, free of spurious solutions and can\ncapture highly complex structures efficiently. In this paper, the background\nknowledge about the A-Phi formulation and DEC is introduced, as well as\ntechnical details in implementing the DEC A-Phi solver with different boundary\nconditions.

This raises an important question: how is the\nsurvival of cooperation affected by different topologies? Here, to address this\nquestion, we explore the Focal Public Goods (FPGG) and classic Public Goods\nGames (PGG), and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) on several regular lattices:\nhoneycomb, square (with von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods), kagome,\ntriangular, cubic, and 4D hypercubic lattices using both analytical methods and\nagent-based Monte Carlo simulations. We found that for both Public Goods Games,\na consistent trend appears on all two-dimensional lattices: as the number of\nfirst neighbors increases, cooperation is enhanced. However, this is only\nvisible by analysing the results in terms of the payoff's synergistic factor\nnormalized by the number of connections. Besides this, clustered topologies,\ni.e., those that allow two connected players to share neighbors, are the most\nbeneficial to cooperation for the FPGG. The same is not always true for the\nclassic PGG, where having shared neighbors between connected players may or may\nnot benefit cooperation. We also provide a reinterpretation of the classic PGG\nas a focal game by representing the lattice structure of this category of games\nas a single interaction game with longer-ranged, weighted neighborhoods, an\napproach valid for any regular lattice topology. Finally, we show that\ndepending on the payoff parametrization of the PD, there can be an equivalency\nbetween the PD and the FPGG; when the mapping between the two games is\nimperfect, the definition of an effective synergy parameter can still be useful\nto show their similarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 21:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

They encode contractual agreements on the\nbasis of source code, which else need to be contractualized in natural\nlanguage. While the mediation of contractual agreements via smart contracts is\nseamless in theory, it requires that the conditions of an interaction are\naccurately made available in the blockchain. Time is a prominent such\ncondition. In the paper at hand, we empirically measure the consistency of a\nsmart contract to yield equal results on the basis of the time of an\ninteraction and its potentially inaccurate representation in the blockchain. We\npropose a novel metric called execution accuracy to measure this consistency.\nWe specifically measure the execution accuracy of a time interval-constrained\nsmart contract that executes distinct logic within and without some constraint\ninterval. We run experiments for the local Ganache and Quorum and the public\nG\\\"orli and Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains. Our experiments confirm our intuition\nthat execution accuracy decreases near interval bounds. The novelty of our\nproposed metric resides in its capacity to quantify this decrease and make\ndistinct blockchains comparable with respect to their capacity to accurately\nstipulate time contraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 21:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

In a synthetic data experiment,\nTractoFormer successfully identifies discriminative fibers with simulated group\ndifferences.

It is realized\nnot only in $^4$He and dilute atomic gases, but also in quantum magnets, where\nhardcore bosons, introduced by the Matsubara-Matsuda transformation of spins,\ncondense. In 3D antiferromagnets, an XY-type long-range ordering (LRO) occurs\nnear a magnetic-field-induced transition to a fully polarized state (FP) and\nhas been successfully described as a BEC in the last few decades. An attractive\nextension of the BEC in 3D magnets is to make their 2D analogue. For a strictly\n2D system, BEC cannot take place due to the presence of a finite density of\nstates at zero energy, and a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition\nmay instead emerge. In a realistic quasi-2D magnet consisting of stacked 2D\nmagnets, a small but finite interlayer coupling stabilizes marginal LRO and\nBEC, but such that 2D physics, including BKT fluctuations, is still expected to\ndominate. A few systems were reported to show such 2D-limit BEC, but at very\nhigh magnetic fields that are difficult to access. The honeycomb $S$ = 1/2\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet YbCl$_3$ with an intra-layer coupling $J\\sim$ 5 K\nexhibits a transition to a FP state at a low in-plane magnetic field of $H_{\\rm\ns}$ = 5.93 T. Here, we demonstrate that the LRO right below $H_{\\rm s}$ is a\nBEC in the 2D-limit stabilized by an extremely small interlayer coupling\n$J_{\\perp}$ of 10$^{-5}J$. Reflecting the 2D limit, an extended region of\nthermal fluctuations is observed from the BEC transition temperature $T_{\\rm\nc}$ up to $\\sim 2T_{\\rm c}$, which may carry certain BKT characteristics. At\n$H_{\\rm s}$, we clearly capture 2D-limit quantum fluctuations that can be\ndescribed as the formation of a highly mobile, interacting 2D Bose gas in the\ndilute limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 21:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

First, as the correct definition should necessarily\ninvolve equilibration processes in the initially non-equilibrium system, the\nmean temperature is bounded from below and above via looking at (respectively)\nthe reversible versus fully irreversible extremes of equilibration. Second,\nwithin the thermodynamic approach we assume that the mean temperature is\ndetermined mostly by energy and entropy.

The arrival times of vehicles to the on-ramps, as well as their\ndestinations are modeled by exogenous stochastic processes. Once a vehicle is\nreleased from an on-ramp, it accelerates towards the free flow speed if it is\nnot obstructed by another vehicle; once it gets close to another vehicle, it\nadopts a safe gap vehicle following behavior. The vehicle exits the freeway\nonce it reaches its destination off-ramp. We design traffic-responsive RM\npolicies that maximize the freeway throughput. For a given routing matrix, the\nthroughput of a RM policy is characterized by the set of on-ramp arrival rates\nfor which the queue sizes at all the on-ramps remain bounded in expectation.\nThe proposed RM policies work in synchronous cycles during which an on-ramp\ndoes not release more vehicles than its queue size at the beginning of the\ncycle. Moreover, all the policies operate under vehicle following safety\nconstraints, where new vehicles are released only if there is enough gap on the\nmainline at the moment of release. We provide three policies under which each\non-ramp: (i) pauses release for a time interval at the end of a cycle, or (ii)\nmodulates the release rate during a cycle, or (iii) adopts a conservative safe\ngap criterion for release during a cycle. All the proposed policies are\nreactive, meaning that they only require real-time traffic measurements without\nthe need for demand prediction. The throughput of these policies is\ncharacterized by studying stochastic stability of the induced Markov chains,\nand is proven to be maximized when the merging speed of all the on-ramps equals\nthe free flow speed.

In contrast to methods that use dense correspondence\nground-truths as direct supervision for local feature matching training, we\ntrain 3DG-STFM: a multi-modal matching model (Teacher) to enforce the depth\nconsistency under 3D dense correspondence supervision and transfer the\nknowledge to 2D unimodal matching model (Student). Both teacher and student\nmodels consist of two transformer-based matching modules that obtain dense\ncorrespondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. The teacher model guides the\nstudent model to learn RGB-induced depth information for the matching purpose\non both coarse and fine branches. We also evaluate 3DG-STFM on a model\ncompression task.

In this scheme, controlled rotation gates, i.e., phase shifts\nof the propagating light modes conditioned upon the state of an atom placed in\na cavity, provide a mechanism both for the entangled-state preparations and for\nthe error syndrome identifications. The distributed entangled pairs can then be\nused for quantum key distribution (QKD). In order to assess the performance of\nthis repeater protocol, an explicit instance of RSBC--multi-component cat codes\nare studied quantitatively. A numerical simulation shows that the total\nfidelity and the success probability for quantum communication over a long\ndistance (such as 1000km) both can almost approach unity provided a small\nenough elementary distance between stations (smaller than 0.1km or 0.01km) and\nrather low local losses (up to 0.1%) are considered.

However, clinical decision support (CDS) technologies based on ML\nneed to be portable if they are to be adopted on a broad scale. In this\nrespect, models developed at one institution should be reusable at another. Yet\nthere are numerous examples of portability failure, particularly due to naive\napplication of ML models.

Unlike\npreviously reported transitions, this newly discovered scenario, dubbed vortex\nmerging and splitting (VMS) transition, occurs in the centrifugally unstable\nregime and the mechanisms underlying it are two-dimensional: the flow becomes\nchaotic due to the proliferation of events where axisymmetric vortex pairs may\nbe either created (vortex splitting) or annihilated (vortex merging). In this\npaper, we present direct numerical simulations, using the FENE-P constitutive\nequation to model polymer dynamics, which reproduce the experimental\nobservations with great accuracy and elucidate the reasons for the onset of\nthis surprising dynamics. Starting from the Newtonian limit and increasing\nprogressively the fluid's elasticity, we demonstrate that the VMS dynamics is\nnot associated with the well-known Taylor vortices, but with a steady pattern\nof elastically induced axisymmetric vortex pairs known as diwhirls. The amount\nof angular momentum carried by these elastic vortices becomes increasingly\nsmall as the fluid's elasticity increases and it eventually reaches a marginal\nlevel. When this occurs, the diwhirls become dynamically disconnected from the\nrest of the system and move independently from each other in the axial\ndirection. It is shown that vortex merging and splitting events, along with\nlocal transient chaotic dynamics, result from the interactions among diwhirls,\nand that this complex spatio-temporal dynamics persists even at elasticity\nlevels twice as large as those investigated experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 05:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In this paper, we find that the common\npractice that randomly sampling negative samples from the entire space and\ntreating them equally is not an optimal choice, since the negative samples from\ndifferent sub-spaces at different stages have different importance to a\nmatching model. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Unbiased\nModel-Agnostic Matching Approach (UMA$^2$). It consists of two basic modules\nincluding 1) General Matching Model (GMM), which is model-agnostic and can be\nimplemented as any embedding-based two-tower models; and 2) Negative Samples\nDebias Network (NSDN), which discriminates negative samples by borrowing the\nidea of Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) and re-weighs the loss in GMM.\nUMA$^2$ seamlessly integrates these two modules in an end-to-end multi-task\nlearning framework. Extensive experiments on both real-world offline dataset\nand online A/B test demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 06:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

This gSPT\nphase has an interesting feature that no symmetry forbids the trivial spin gap\nopening but a discrete symmetry, $\\mathbb Z_3\\times\\mathbb Z_2^T$, forbids the\nunique gapped ground state.

Traditional methods such as look-ahead and\nchunk-based methods, usually require information from future frames to advance\nrecognition accuracy, which incurs inevitable latency even if the computation\nis fast enough. A causal model that computes without any future frames can\navoid this latency, but its performance is significantly worse than traditional\nmethods. In this paper, we propose corresponding revision strategies to improve\nthe causal model. Firstly, we introduce a real-time encoder states revision\nstrategy to modify previous states. Encoder forward computation starts once the\ndata is received and revises the previous encoder states after several frames,\nwhich is no need to wait for any right context. Furthermore, a CTC spike\nposition alignment decoding algorithm is designed to reduce time costs brought\nby the revision strategy. Experiments are all conducted on Librispeech\ndatasets.

In order to successfully exploit such observables, a detailed\nfunctional form of the covariance matrix of the one-point PDF is needed. Aims:\nThe objectives are to model the properties of this covariance for general\nstochastic density fields in a cosmological context. Methods: Leading and\nsubleading contributions to the covariance were identified within a large class\nof models, the so-called hierarchical models. The validity of the proposed\nforms for the covariance matrix was assessed with the help of a toy model, the\nminimum tree model, for which a corpus of exact results could be obtained\n(forms of the one- and two-point PDF, large-scale density-bias functions, and\nfull covariance matrix of the one-point PDF). Results: It is first shown that\nthe covariance matrix elements are directly related to the spatial average of\nthe two-point density PDF within the sample. The dominant contribution to this\naverage is explicitly given for hierarchical models, which leads to the\nconstruction of specific density-bias functions. However, this contribution\nalone cannot be used to construct an operational likelihood function. Short\ndistance effects are found to be have an important impact but are more\ndifficult to derive as they depend more on the details of the model.

Then we distinguish the \"unknown things\"\nfrom the background by using the additional object prediction head. To further\nboost performance, we introduce \"unknown things\" pseudo-labels generated from\nup-to-date models to enrich the training set.

We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it\nignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate\nand the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is\nthat techniques to reduce the network's energy consumption in operation will be\nable to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, there are more\nchallenges than just reducing the energy that the network requires to function\nand it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be able to cope with\nincreasing demand. The need for more equipment related to deployment of 5/6G\nnetworks may result in important environmental impacts: i) increased pressures\non material extraction, which imply socio-environmental conflicts, ecosystem\ndestruction and displacement, ii) more manufacturing and shipment, with effects\non greenhouse gas emissions and pollution; iii) increased disposal complexities\nand challenges to recycle components of such equipments.

This is\n$0.7\\%$ for $a^*=-0.7$, $0.3\\%$ for $a^*=0$, and $5\\%$ for $a^*=0.7$ for\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm in} \\sim 100L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$ ($L_{\\rm Edd}$ is Eddington\nluminosity). Also, although the energy is mainly released by radiation when\n$a^* \\sim 0$, the Poynting power increases with $|a^*|$ and exceeds the\nradiative luminosity for models with $a^* \\geq 0.5$ and $a^* \\leq -0.7$. The\nmore the black hole rotates, the larger the power ratio of the kinetic\nluminosity to the isotropic luminosity tends to be. This implies that objects\nwith large (small) power ratio may have rapidly (slowly) rotating black holes.\nAmong ultraluminous X-ray sources, IC342 X-1, is a candidate with a rapidly\nrotating black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 10:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

SimLM only requires\naccess to unlabeled corpus, and is more broadly applicable when there are no\nlabeled data or queries. We conduct experiments on several large-scale passage\nretrieval datasets, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines\nunder various settings. Remarkably, SimLM even outperforms multi-vector\napproaches such as ColBERTv2 which incurs significantly more storage cost.

This cost hinders\nthem from learning better video-quality-related representations via end-to-end\ntraining. Existing approaches typically consider naive sampling to reduce the\ncomputational cost, such as resizing and cropping. However, they obviously\ncorrupt quality-related information in videos and are thus not optimal for\nlearning good representations for VQA. Therefore, there is an eager need to\ndesign a new quality-retained sampling scheme for VQA. In this paper, we\npropose Grid Mini-patch Sampling (GMS), which allows consideration of local\nquality by sampling patches at their raw resolution and covers global quality\nwith contextual relations via mini-patches sampled in uniform grids.

Then, the interaction is modelled\nby a partial information game. Unfortunately, the problem of whether a partial\ninformation game has an NE is not known to be decidable. A particular setting\nof partial information arises naturally when processes are assigned IDs by the\nsystem, but these IDs are not known to the processes.

Moreover, microarchitectural\nfeatures, such as the memory bus and register reuse, may also leak secret\ninformation. These abstractions are not visible at the high-level\nimplementation of the program. Instead, they are decided at compile time. To\nremedy these problems, security engineers often sacrifice code efficiency by\nturning off compiler optimization and/or performing local, post-compilation\ntransformations. This paper proposes Secure by Construction Code Generation\n(SecCG), a constraint-based compiler approach that generates optimized yet\nsecure against power side channels code. SecCG controls the quality of the\nmitigated program by efficiently searching the best possible low-level\nimplementation according to a processor cost model. In our experiments with\ntwelve masked cryptographic functions up to 100 lines of code on Mips32 and ARM\nThumb, SecCG speeds up the generated code from 75% to 8 times compared to\nnon-optimized secure code with an overhead of up to 7% compared to non-secure\noptimized code at the expense of a high compilation cost. In summary, this\npaper proposes a formal model to generate power side channel free low-level\ncode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 12:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 13:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

In\nthis paper, we provide an explanation of this striking phenomenon by relating\nthe particular noise structure of SGD to its \\emph{linear stability} (Wu et\nal., 2018). Specifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with\nsquare loss. We prove that if a global minimum $\\theta^*$ is linearly stable\nfor SGD, then it must satisfy $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F\\leq O(\\sqrt{B}/\\eta)$, where\n$\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F, B,\\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$,\nbatch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from\nthat minimum \\emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD,\nthe sharpness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded\n\\emph{independently} of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining\nthese results is exploiting the particular structure of SGD noise: The noise\nconcentrates in sharp directions of local landscape and the magnitude is\nproportional to loss value. This alignment property of SGD noise provably holds\nfor linear networks and random feature models (RFMs), and is empirically\nverified for nonlinear networks.

The SANS measurements reveal the presence of\npreviously unreported modulation vectors characterizing the ordered spin\nconfiguration which exhibit changes in magnitude and direction that are phase\ndependent. Between 5.9 and 7.6 K the additional modulation vector has a\nmagnitude $Q$ =0.12 \\AA$^{-1}$ and is primarily due to order of the Nd layers\nwhich contain a center of inversion. In this region of the phase diagram, the\nSANS measurements also identify a phase boundary at $\\approx$1 T.

Against this background, our contributions in this\npaper are threefold. First, we show that the complexity of rational\nverification can be greatly reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a\nfragment of LTL that can represent a broad and practically useful class of\nresponse properties of reactive systems.

Slow training increases expenses, hinders product development timescales\nand prevents the model from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user\npreferences. Training such sequential models involves appropriately sampling\npast user interactions to create a realistic training objective. The existing\ntraining objectives have limitations. For instance, next item prediction never\nuses the beginning of the sequence as a learning target, thereby potentially\ndiscarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking used by BERT4Rec\nis only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation; therefore,\nit requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a\nnovel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses\nboth limitations.

Different capillary bridge types were studied, Newtonian liquids,\nviscoelastic liquids and agarose gels. Thus, we compare the cavity formation\nand collapse between a wide range of material properties. Moreover, we model\nthe critical impact velocity for a jet to traverse a capillary bridge type. Our\nresults show that agarose gels with a storage modulus lower that 176 Pa can be\nmodelled as a liquid for this transition.

Spin-orbit\ncoupled Mott insulators with Ising-like magnetic anisotropies, such as Kitaev\nmaterials, are a particularly rich playground to explore this competition. In\nthis work, we use effective field theory methods to show that a direct quantum\nphase transition can occur in two-dimensional (2D) Ising spin systems between a\ntopologically ordered chiral spin liquid and a phase with magnetic long-range\norder. Such a transition can be protected by lattice symmetries and is\ndescribed by a theory of massless Majorana fields coupled to non-Abelian\n$SO(N)$ gauge fields with a Chern-Simons term.

As an efficient method to obtain deep SNN, the\nconversion method has exhibited high performance on various large-scale\ndatasets. However, it typically suffers from severe performance degradation and\nhigh time delays. In particular, most of the previous work focuses on simple\nclassification tasks while ignoring the precise approximation to ANN output. In\nthis paper, we first theoretically analyze the conversion errors and derive the\nharmful effects of time-varying extremes on synaptic currents. We propose the\nSpike Calibration (SpiCalib) to eliminate the damage of discrete spikes to the\noutput distribution and modify the LIPooling to allow conversion of the\narbitrary MaxPooling layer losslessly. Moreover, Bayesian optimization for\noptimal normalization parameters is proposed to avoid empirical settings. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on\nclassification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time to obtain SNN comparable to ANN on these\ntasks simultaneously.

When testing sequentially as data accrue, maximum\nsequential probability ratio testing (MaxSPRT) is a common approach to\nmaintaining nominal type 1 error. However, the true type 1 error may still\ndeviate from the specified one because of systematic error due to the\nobservational nature of the analysis. This systematic error may persist even\nafter controlling for known confounders. Here we propose to address this issue\nby combing MaxSPRT with empirical calibration. In empirical calibration, we\nassume uncertainty about the systematic error in our analysis, the source of\nuncertainty commonly overlooked in practice. We infer a probability\ndistribution of systematic error by relying on a large set of negative\ncontrols: exposure-outcome where no causal effect is believed to exist.\nIntegrating this distribution into our test statistics has previously been\nshown to restore type 1 error to nominal. Here we show how we can calibrate the\ncritical value central to MaxSPRT. We evaluate this novel approach using\nsimulations and real electronic health records, using H1N1 vaccinations during\nthe 2009-2010 season as an example. Results show that combining empirical\ncalibration with MaxSPRT restores nominal type 1 error. In our real-world\nexample, adjusting for systematic error using empirical calibration has a\nlarger impact than, and hence is just as essential as, adjusting for sequential\ntesting using MaxSPRT. We recommend performing both, using the method described\nhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 14:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

The proposed framework is named Variational Flow\nGraphical (VFG) Model. VFGs learn the representation of high dimensional data\nvia a message-passing scheme by integrating flow-based functions through\nvariational inference. By leveraging the expressive power of neural networks,\nVFGs produce a representation of the data using a lower dimension, thus\novercoming the drawbacks of many flow-based models, usually requiring a high\ndimensional latent space involving many trivial variables. Aggregation nodes\nare introduced in the VFG models to integrate forward-backward hierarchical\ninformation via a message passing scheme. Maximizing the evidence lower bound\n(ELBO) of data likelihood aligns the forward and backward messages in each\naggregation node achieving a consistency node state. Algorithms have been\ndeveloped to learn model parameters through gradient updating regarding the\nELBO objective.\n  The consistency of aggregation nodes enable VFGs to be applicable in\ntractable inference on graphical structures. Besides representation learning\nand numerical inference, VFGs provide a new approach for distribution modeling\non datasets with graphical latent structures. Additionally, theoretical study\nshows that VFGs are universal approximators by leveraging the implicitly\ninvertible flow-based structures. With flexible graphical structures and\nsuperior excessive power, VFGs could potentially be used to improve\nprobabilistic inference. In the experiments, VFGs achieves improved evidence\nlower bound (ELBO) and likelihood values on multiple datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 14:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

The human brain can quickly learn various conceptual\nknowledge in a self-organized and unsupervised manner, accomplished through\ncoordinating various learning rules and structures in the human brain.\nSpike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a general learning rule in the\nbrain, but spiking neural networks (SNNs) trained with STDP alone is\ninefficient and perform poorly. In this paper, taking inspiration from\nshort-term synaptic plasticity, we design an adaptive synaptic filter and\nintroduce the adaptive spiking threshold as the neuron plasticity to enrich the\nrepresentation ability of SNNs. We also introduce an adaptive lateral\ninhibitory connection to adjust the spikes balance dynamically to help the\nnetwork learn richer features. To speed up and stabilize the training of\nunsupervised spiking neural networks, we design a samples temporal batch STDP\n(STB-STDP), which updates weights based on multiple samples and moments. By\nintegrating the above three adaptive mechanisms and STB-STDP, our model greatly\naccelerates the training of unsupervised spiking neural networks and improves\nthe performance of unsupervised SNNs on complex tasks.

The coefficient\nof the completely mixed state part is the mixed state measure, formally\nobtained as the determinant of the reduced density operator and it is therefore\ndirectly related to tangle, the square of concurrence of the bipartite system.\nExpressed in various equivalent forms, the mixed state measure provides all the\ncharacteristic elements of state purity or entanglement, such as eigenvalues of\nthe reduced density operator, nonclassicality measures and a state purity\ncomplex amplitude.

Furthermore, mechanical components often fail\nbefore the deterministic failure time is reached. A possibility to overcome\nthese problems is to consider probabilistic failure times. Our approach for\nprobabilistic life prediction is based on the microstructure of the metal.\nSince we focus on nickel-base alloys we consider a coarse grained\nmicrostructure, with random oriented FCC grains. This leads to random\ndistributed Schmid factors and different anisotropic stress in each grain. To\ngain crack initiation times, we use Coffin-Manson- Basquin and Ramberg-Osgood\nequation on stresses corrected with probabilistic Schmid factors.\n  Using these single grain crack initiation times, we have developed an\nepidemiological crack growth model over multiple grains. In this mesoscopic\ncrack percolation model, cracked grains induce a stress increase in neighboring\ngrains. This stress increase is realized using a machine learning model trained\non data generated from finite element simulations. The resulting crack clusters\nare evaluated with a failure criterion based on a multimodal stress intensity\nfactor. From the generated failure times, we calculate surface dependent hazard\nrates using a Monte Carlo framework.

However, such explanations are not robust to certain\nreal-world changes in the underlying model (e.g., retraining the model,\nchanging hyperparameters, etc.), questioning their reliability in several\napplications, e.g., credit lending. In this work, we propose a novel strategy\n-- that we call RobX -- to generate robust counterfactuals for tree-based\nensembles, e.g., XGBoost. Tree-based ensembles pose additional challenges in\nrobust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth and\nnon-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the\nparameter space under retraining on very similar data. We first introduce a\nnovel metric -- that we call Counterfactual Stability -- that attempts to\nquantify how robust a counterfactual is going to be to model changes under\nretraining, and comes with desirable theoretical properties. Our proposed\nstrategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation method (base method) and\nsearches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining the counterfactual\ngenerated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual Stability. We\ncompare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation methods\n(for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate\nthat our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust\n(nearly 100% validity after actual model changes) and also realistic (in terms\nof local outlier factor) over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 15:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 16:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

To both apply\nreplicated writes from the primary and serve read-only transactions, the\nbackups implement a cloned concurrency control protocol. The protocol ensures\nread-only transactions always return a snapshot of state that previously\nexisted on the primary. This compels the backup to exactly copy the commit\norder resulting from the primary's concurrency control. Existing cloned\nconcurrency control protocols guarantee this by limiting the backup's\nparallelism. As a result, the primary's concurrency control executes some\nworkloads with more parallelism than these protocols. In this paper, we prove\nthat this parallelism gap leads to unbounded replication lag, where writes can\ntake arbitrarily long to replicate to the backup and which has led to\ncatastrophic failures in production systems. We then design C5, the first\ncloned concurrency protocol to provide bounded replication lag. We implement\ntwo versions of C5: Our evaluation in MyRocks, a widely deployed database,\ndemonstrates C5 provides bounded replication lag. Our evaluation in Cicada, a\nrecent in-memory database, demonstrates C5 keeps up with even the fastest of\nprimaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 15:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

A central question is whether the resulting\nspin-associated charge currents are robust to structural disorder, which is\ninherent to polycrystalline semiconductors that are desirable for device\napplications. Using femtosecond circular polarization-resolved pump-probe\nmicroscopy on polycrystalline halide perovskite thin films, we observe the\nphotoinduced ultrafast formation of spin-polarized positive and, unexpectedly,\nnegative spin domains on the micron scale formed through lateral currents.\nFurther, the polarization of these domains and lateral transport direction is\nswitched upon switching the polarization of the pump helicity. Micron scale\nvariations in the intensity of optical second-harmonic generation and vertical\npiezoresponse suggest that the spin domain formation is driven by the presence\nof strong local inversion symmetry breaking via inter-grain structural\ndisorder.

GANs has the capability to produce sharper\nimages but lacks the diversity of outputs, whereas VAEs are good at producing a\ndiverse range of outputs, but the images generated are often blurred. Taking\ninto account the relative advantages of both GANs and VAEs, we proposed a new\nstacked Conditional VAE (CVAE) and Conditional GAN (CGAN) network architecture\nfor synthesizing images conditioned on a text description. This study uses\nConditional VAEs as an initial generator to produce a high-level sketch of the\ntext descriptor. This high-level sketch output from first stage and a text\ndescriptor is used as an input to the conditional GAN network. The second stage\nGAN produces a 256x256 high resolution image. The proposed architecture\nbenefits from a conditioning augmentation and a residual block on the\nConditional GAN network to achieve the results. Multiple experiments were\nconducted using CUB and Oxford-102 dataset and the result of the proposed\napproach is compared against state-ofthe-art techniques such as StackGAN. The\nexperiments illustrate that the proposed method generates a high-resolution\nimage conditioned on text descriptions and yield competitive results based on\nInception and Frechet Inception Score using both datasets\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 13:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Clinical diagnosis of\nmonkeypox in an early stage is challenging due to its similarity with\nchickenpox and measles. In cases where the confirmatory Polymerase Chain\nReaction (PCR) tests are not readily available, computer-assisted detection of\nmonkeypox lesions could be beneficial for surveillance and rapid identification\nof suspected cases. Deep learning methods have been found effective in the\nautomated detection of skin lesions, provided that sufficient training examples\nare available. However, as of now, such datasets are not available for the\nmonkeypox disease. In the current study, we first develop the ``Monkeypox Skin\nLesion Dataset (MSLD)\" consisting skin lesion images of monkeypox, chickenpox,\nand measles. The images are mainly collected from websites, news portals, and\npublicly accessible case reports. Data augmentation is used to increase the\nsample size, and a 3-fold cross-validation experiment is set up. In the next\nstep, several pre-trained deep learning models, namely, VGG-16, ResNet50, and\nInceptionV3 are employed to classify monkeypox and other diseases. An ensemble\nof the three models is also developed.

Applications of FL led\nto the development and study of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Few\nworks exist on the topic of FRL applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons. In\naddition, most FRL works choose a single aggregation method (usually weight or\ngradient aggregation). We explore FRL's effectiveness as a means to improve AV\nplatooning by designing and implementing an FRL framework atop a custom AV\nplatoon environment. The application of FRL in AV platooning is studied under\ntwo scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs\nacross different platoons; (2) Intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL) where FRL is\napplied to AVs within a single platoon. Both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL are\napplied to a custom AV platooning environment using both gradient and weight\naggregation to observe the performance effects FRL can have on AV platoons\nrelative to an AV platooning environment trained without FRL. It is concluded\nthat Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best\nperformance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight\naggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative\nto gradient aggregation. Finally, a performance analysis is conducted for\nIntra-FRLWA versus a platooning environment without FRL for platoons of length\n3, 4 and 5 vehicles. It is concluded that Intra-FRLWA largely out-performs the\nplatooning environment that is trained without FRL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 21:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

One reason may be that the information in the\nenvironmental static stage can not be used well in the traditional framework.\nIn this paper, a novel framework based on generational and environmental\nresponse strategies (FGERS) is proposed, in which response strategies are run\nboth in the environmental change stage and the environmental static stage to\nobtain population evolution information of those both stages. Unlike in the\ntraditional framework, response strategies are only run in the environmental\nchange stage. For simplicity, the feed-forward center point strategy was chosen\nto be the response strategy in the novel dynamic framework (FGERS-CPS).\nFGERS-CPS is not only to predict change trend of the optimum solution set in\nthe environmental change stage, but to predict the evolution trend of the\npopulation after several generations in the environmental static stage.\nTogether with the feed-forward center point strategy, a simple memory strategy\nand adaptive diversity maintenance strategy were used to form the complete\nFGERS-CPS. On 13 DMOPs with various characteristics, FGERS-CPS was compared\nwith four classical response strategies in the traditional framework.\nExperimental results show that FGERS-CPS is effective for DMOPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 14:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

These losses would mainly\nresult from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,\nAMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life\nattributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the\ndevelopment of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper\nreviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make\nessential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen\nrapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an\nintegral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has\nremained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,\ndetailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,\nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR\ncontrol approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical\npractice, and in the \"One Health\" context. We discuss the potential impact and\nchallenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income\nas well as in low- and middle-income countries, and recommend concrete actions\nneeded to allow these technologies to be more readily integrated within the\nhealthcare and public health sectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 17:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 16:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

As machine learning\nalgorithms are applied in new contexts, however, the harms or injustices that\nresult are qualitatively different than those presently studied. Existing\nresearch at the level of metrics and definitions cannot measure these\nqualitatively different types of injustice. One example of this is the problem\nof market fairness and algorithmic collusion. Negative consequences of\nalgorithmic collusion affect all consumers, not only particular members of a\nprotected class. Drawing on this case study, I develop an ethical framework for\nfair machine learning research in new domains. This contribution ties the\ndevelopment of fairness metrics to specifically scoped normative principles.\nThis enables fairness metrics to reflect different concerns from\ndiscrimination. I develop this framework and provide the philosophical\nrationale for its structure, ultimately applying it to the case of algorithmic\ncollusion. I conclude with limitations of my proposal and discuss promising\navenues of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 16:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

We propose an alternative approach using forward integration,\nwhich allows to avoid one of the restrictive assumptions, the Jacod density\nhypothesis. We demonstrate that, in the case of logarithmic utility, the weaker\nintensity hypothesis is the appropriate condition for optimality. Furthermore,\nwe establish the semimartingale decomposition of the risky asset in the\nfiltration that is progressively enlarged to accommodate the default process,\nunder the assumption of the existence of the optimal portfolio.
