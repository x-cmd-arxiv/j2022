To compress these models, knowledge distillation was proposed to\ntransfer knowledge from a cumbersome (teacher) network into a lightweight\n(student) network. However, guidance from a teacher does not always improve the\ngeneralization of students, especially when the size gap between student and\nteacher is large. Previous works argued that it was due to the high certainty\nof the teacher, resulting in harder labels that were difficult to fit. To\nsoften these labels, we present a pruning method termed Prediction Uncertainty\nEnlargement (PrUE) to simplify the teacher. Specifically, our method aims to\ndecrease the teacher's certainty about data, thereby generating soft\npredictions for students. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method with experiments on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet.\nResults indicate that student networks trained with sparse teachers achieve\nbetter performance. Besides, our method allows researchers to distill knowledge\nfrom deeper networks to improve students further.

Defect inspection of these components is an efficient\nway to ensure quality. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network, SSD-Faster\nNet, for industrial defect inspection of rails, insulators, commutators etc.\nSSD-Faster Net is a two-stage network, including SSD for quickly locating\ndefective blocks, and an improved Faster R-CNN for defect segmentation. For the\nformer, we propose a novel slice localization mechanism to help SSD scan\nquickly. The second stage is based on improved Faster R-CNN, using FPN,\ndeformable kernel(DK) to enhance representation ability. It fuses multi-scale\ninformation, and self-adapts the receptive field. We also propose a novel loss\nfunction and use ROI Align to improve accuracy. Experiments show that our\nSSD-Faster Net achieves an average accuracy of 84.03%, which is 13.42% higher\nthan the nearest competitor based on Faster R-CNN, 4.14% better than GAN-based\nmethods, more than 10% higher than that of DNN-based detectors.

We develop a decompositional approach and a tool, called\nMeshInsight, to systematically characterize the overhead of service meshes and\nto help developers quantify overhead in deployment scenarios of interest. Using\nMeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead -- up to\n185% higher latency and up to 92% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark\napplications -- but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured\nand the application workload. The primary contributors to overhead vary based\non the configuration too.

Although\ndroplet drag is a classical area of study, there are still theoretical gaps in\nunderstanding the motion of large droplets. In applications like spray\ncombustion, droplets of various sizes are generated and move with the flow.\nLarge droplets tend to deform in the flow, and have complex interactions with\nthe flow because of this deformation. To better model spray, the physical\nunderstanding of droplets need to be improved. Under spray conditions, droplets\nare subjected to a high temperature and pressure environment, and the coupling\nbetween liquid and gas is enhanced. Therefore, the deformation and internal\ncirculation will affect droplet drag coefficient more significantly than in\natmospheric conditions. To study the mechanism on how droplet shape and\ninternal circulation influence droplet dynamics, we will use direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) to simulate a droplet falling at its terminal velocity in high\npressure air. An in-house code developed for interface-capturing DNS of\nmultiphase flows will be employed for the simulation. The drag coefficient is\ncalculated, and the results are consistent with existing literature for\nslightly deformed droplets. The results show that the drag coefficient is\ndirectly related to the droplet deformation and droplet internal circulation.\nThe paper also develops a theory to account the effect of Weber number and\nliquid/gas properties in droplet deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 16:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 19:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

This makes it\npossible i) to train more accurate models due to learning from rich joint\ntraining data, and ii) to improve privacy by not sharing the workers' local\nprivate data with others. However, the distributed nature of FL makes it\nvulnerable to targeted poisoning attacks that negatively impact the integrity\nof the learned model while, unfortunately, being difficult to detect. Existing\ndefenses against those attacks are limited by assumptions on the workers' data\ndistribution, may degrade the global model performance on the main task and/or\nare ill-suited to high-dimensional models. In this paper, we analyze targeted\nattacks against FL and find that the neurons in the last layer of a deep\nlearning (DL) model that are related to the attacks exhibit a different\nbehavior from the unrelated neurons, making the last-layer gradients valuable\nfeatures for attack detection. Accordingly, we propose \\textit{FL-Defender} as\na method to combat FL targeted attacks. It consists of i) engineering more\nrobust discriminative features by calculating the worker-wise angle similarity\nfor the workers' last-layer gradients, ii) compressing the resulting similarity\nvectors using PCA to reduce redundant information, and iii) re-weighting the\nworkers' updates based on their deviation from the centroid of the compressed\nsimilarity vectors. Experiments on three data sets with different DL model\nsizes and data distributions show the effectiveness of our method at defending\nagainst label-flipping and backdoor attacks. Compared to several\nstate-of-the-art defenses, FL-Defender achieves the lowest attack success\nrates, maintains the performance of the global model on the main task and\ncauses minimal computational overhead on the server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 16:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Semi-supervised video object\nsegmentation (VOS) aims at segmenting objects in all target frames of a video,\ngiven annotated object masks of reference frames. Most existing methods build\npixel-wise reference-target correlations and then perform pixel-wise tracking\nto obtain target masks. Due to neglecting object-level cues, pixel-level\napproaches make the tracking vulnerable to perturbations, and even\nindiscriminate among similar objects. Towards robust VOS, the key insight is to\ncalibrate the representation and mask of each specific object to be expressive\nand discriminative. Accordingly, we propose a new deep network, which can\nadaptively construct object representations and calibrate object masks to\nachieve stronger robustness. First, we construct the object representations by\napplying an adaptive object proxy (AOP) aggregation method, where the proxies\nrepresent arbitrary-shaped segments at multi-levels for reference. Then,\nprototype masks are initially generated from the reference-target correlations\nbased on AOP. Afterwards, such proto-masks are further calibrated through\nnetwork modulation, conditioning on the object proxy representations. We\nconsolidate this conditional mask calibration process in a progressive manner,\nwhere the object representations and proto-masks evolve to be discriminative\niteratively. Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard VOS\nbenchmarks, YouTube-VOS-18/19 and DAVIS-17. Our model achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance among existing published works, and also exhibits\nsuperior robustness against perturbations.

Explicit criteria are obtained to define stationary\nconditions: (1) there can be no net change for extensive measures of the system\nstate over the time averaging interval; (2) the net energy inputs into the\nsystem are zero, meaning that the net rate of work done on the system must\nbalance with the heat removed; and (3) there is no net work performed due to\nthe contribution of internal energy fluctuations.

The etched\nTi$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene was first synthesized after HF-treatment followed by\ndelamination process for successful synthesis of free-standing Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$\nfilm. The free-standing film was then exposed to air at room-temperature as\nwell as heated at different temperature to form TiO$_2$ layer derived from the\nTi$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene itself.

Also, the magnetic hysteresis\nwas observed in the film indicating a possibility of coupling between\nferroelectric and ferromagnetic phases at room-temperature.

A Brownian particle is subject to an arbitrary\nconfining potential $v(x)$ which is switched on and off intermittently at fixed\nrates. Motion is constrained between an absorbing wall located at the origin\nand a reflective wall. When the walls are sufficiently far apart, the interplay\nbetween free diffusion during the \"off\" phases and attraction toward the\npotential minimum during the \"on\" phases gives rise to rich behaviours, not\nobserved in ideal resetting models. For potentials of the form\n$v(x)=k|x-x_0|^n/n$, with $n>0$, the switch-on and switch-off rates that\nminimise the mean first passage time (MFPT) to the origin undergo a continuous\nphase transition as the potential stiffness $k$ is varied.

In practical dynamic wireless environments, channel modeling is\nchallenging due to time-varying and multipath effects. In this paper, we\nformulate the beam alignment problem as a non-stationary online learning\nproblem with the objective to maximize the received signal strength under\ninterference constraint. In particular, we employ the non-stationary kernelized\nbandit to leverage the correlation among beams and model the complex\nbeamforming and multipath channel functions. Furthermore, to mitigate\ninterference to other user equipment, we leverage the primal-dual method to\ndesign a constrained UCB-type kernelized bandit algorithm.

This result is of independent interest for applications such as adaptive\npricing and news ranking. In addition, the algorithm assumes the channel is a\nblack-box function and does not require any prior knowledge for dynamic channel\nmodeling, and thus is applicable in a variety of scenarios. We further show\nthat if the information about the channel variation is known, the algorithm\nwill have better theoretical guarantees and performance.

In the reduced-rank\nregression modelling, a central objective is to estimate the rank of the\ncoefficient matrix that represents the number of effective latent factors in\npredicting the multivariate response. Although theoretical results such as rank\nestimation consistency have been established for various methods, in practice\nrank determination still relies on information criterion based methods such as\nAIC and BIC or subsampling based methods such as cross validation.\nUnfortunately, the theoretical properties of these practical methods are\nlargely unknown. In this paper, we present a novel method called StARS-RRR that\nselects the tuning parameter and then estimates the rank of the coefficient\nmatrix for reduced-rank regression based on the stability approach.

Here we examine an understudied\naspect of emotion in such games: how an individual's feelings are shaped by\ntheir partner's expressions. Prior research has tended to focus on other\naspects of emotion. Research on felt-emotion has focused on how an individual's\nfeelings shape how they treat their partner, or whether these feelings are\nauthentically expressed. Research on expressed-emotion has focused on how an\nindividual's decisions are shaped by their partner's expressions, without\nregard for whether these expressions actually evoke feelings. Here, we use\ncomputer-generated characters to examine how an individual's moment-to-moment\nfeelings are shaped by (1) how they are treated by their partner and (2) what\ntheir partner expresses during this treatment. Surprisingly, we find that\npartner expressions are far more important than actions in determining\nself-reported feelings. In other words, our partner can behave in a selfish and\nexploitive way, but if they show a collaborative pattern of expressions, we\nwill feel greater pleasure collaborating with them.

Although\nvast works have been done, controlling the false discoveries remains a\nchallenging task when the corresponding test statistics are dependent. Various\nmethods have been proposed to estimate the false discovery proportion (FDP)\nunder arbitrary dependence among the test statistics. One of the main ideas is\nto reduce arbitrary dependence to weak dependence and then to establish\ntheoretically the strong consistency of the FDP and false discovery rate (FDR)\nunder weak dependence. As a consequence, FDPs share the same asymptotic limit\nin the framework of weak dependence. We observe that the asymptotic variance of\nthe FDP, however, may rely heavily on the dependence structure of the\ncorresponding test statistics even when they are only weakly dependent; and it\nis of great practical value to quantify this variability, as it can serve as an\nindicator of the quality of the FDP estimate from the given data. As far as we\nare aware, the research on this respect is still limited in the literature. In\nthis paper, we first derive the asymptotic expansion of FDP under mild\nregularity conditions and then examine how the asymptotic variance of FDP\nvaries under different dependence structures both theoretically and\nnumerically. With the observations in this study, we recommend that in a\nmultiple testing performed by an FDP procedure, we may report both the mean and\nthe variance estimates of FDP to enrich the study outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 00:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

The data is reconstructed\ninto a dense feature sequence to reduce the overall model computation while\nkeeping the final recognition accuracy loss to a minimum. The continuous sign\nlanguage recognition model(CSLR) via TSRNet mainly consists of three parts:\nframe-level feature extraction, time series feature extraction and TSRNet,\nwhere TSRNet is located between frame-level feature extraction and time-series\nfeature extraction, which mainly includes two branches: detail descriptor and\nrough descriptor. The sparse frame-level features are fused through the\nfeatures obtained by the two designed branches as the reconstructed dense\nframe-level feature sequence, and the connectionist temporal\nclassification(CTC) loss is used for training and optimization after the\ntime-series feature extraction part. To better recover semantic-level\ninformation, the overall model is trained with the self-generating adversarial\ntraining method proposed in this paper to reduce the model error rate. The\ntraining method regards the TSRNet as the generator, and the frame-level\nprocessing part and the temporal processing part as the discriminator.

We train a nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nthat can classify the material of the object about to be grasped through\nrecursive estimation, with increasing confidence as the distance from the\nfinger tips to the object decreases.

The\nprevious works on defect analysis have several limitations, such as low\naccuracy and the need for separate models for classification and segmentation.\nFor analyzing mixed-type defects, some previous works require separately\ntraining one model for each defect type, which is non-scalable. In this paper,\nwe present WaferSegClassNet (WSCN), a novel network based on encoder-decoder\narchitecture. WSCN performs simultaneous classification and segmentation of\nboth single and mixed-type wafer defects. WSCN uses a \"shared encoder\" for\nclassification, and segmentation, which allows training WSCN end-to-end. We use\nN-pair contrastive loss to first pretrain the encoder and then use BCE-Dice\nloss for segmentation, and categorical cross-entropy loss for classification.\nUse of N-pair contrastive loss helps in better embedding representation in the\nlatent dimension of wafer maps. WSCN has a model size of only 0.51MB and\nperforms only 0.2M FLOPS. Thus, it is much lighter than other state-of-the-art\nmodels. Also, it requires only 150 epochs for convergence, compared to 4,000\nepochs needed by a previous work. We evaluate our model on the MixedWM38\ndataset, which has 38,015 images.

Then, an end-to-end task-oriented resource management\napproach is developed by integrating the three processes into a joint design.\nThis integrated sensing, computation, and communication (ISCC) design approach,\nhowever, leads to a challenging non-convex optimization problem, due to the\ncomplicated form of discriminant gain and the device heterogeneity in terms of\nchannel gain, quantization level, and generated feature subsets. Remarkably,\nthe considered non-convex problem can be optimally solved based on the\nsum-of-ratios method. This gives the optimal ISCC scheme, that jointly\ndetermines the transmit power and time allocation at multiple devices for\nsensing and communication, as well as their quantization bits allocation for\ncomputation distortion control. By using human motions recognition as a\nconcrete AI inference task, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the\nperformance of our derived optimal ISCC scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 06:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

As a hybrid neural-physical face model, NARRATE leverages complementary\nbenefits of geometry-aware generative approaches and normal-assisted physical\nface models. In a nutshell, NARRATE first inverts the input portrait to a\ncoarse geometry and employs neural rendering to generate images resembling the\ninput, as well as producing convincing pose changes. However, inversion step\nintroduces mismatch, bringing low-quality images with less facial details. As\nsuch, we further estimate portrait normal to enhance the coarse geometry,\ncreating a high-fidelity physical face model. In particular, we fuse the neural\nand physical renderings to compensate for the imperfect inversion, resulting in\nboth realistic and view-consistent novel perspective images. In relighting\nstage, previous works focus on single view portrait relighting but ignoring\nconsistency between different perspectives as well, leading unstable and\ninconsistent lighting effects for view changes. We extend Total Relighting to\nfix this problem by unifying its multi-view input normal maps with the physical\nface model. NARRATE conducts relighting with consistent normal maps, imposing\ncross-view constraints and exhibiting stable and coherent illumination effects.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that NARRATE achieves more photorealistic,\nreliable results over prior works.

However, NAS is often\ncomputationally expensive because a large number of DNNs require to be trained\nfor obtaining performance during the search process. Performance predictors can\ngreatly alleviate the prohibitive cost of NAS by directly predicting the\nperformance of DNNs. However, building satisfactory performance predictors\nhighly depends on enough trained DNN architectures, which are difficult to\nobtain in most scenarios. To solve this critical issue, we propose an effective\nDNN architecture augmentation method named GIAug in this paper. Specifically,\nwe first propose a mechanism based on graph isomorphism, which has the merit of\nefficiently generating a factorial of $\\boldsymbol n$ (i.e., $\\boldsymbol n!$)\ndiverse annotated architectures upon a single architecture having $\\boldsymbol\nn$ nodes. In addition, we also design a generic method to encode the\narchitectures into the form suitable to most prediction models. As a result,\nGIAug can be flexibly utilized by various existing performance predictors-based\nNAS algorithms. We perform extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet\nbenchmark datasets on small-, medium- and large-scale search space. The\nexperiments show that GIAug can significantly enhance the performance of most\nstate-of-the-art peer predictors. In addition, GIAug can save three magnitude\norder of computation cost at most on ImageNet yet with similar performance when\ncompared with state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 09:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Within the framework of chameleon $f(R)$, we study the\nimpact of the chameleon mechanism on the orbital evolution of binary pulsars,\nand calculate in detail the post-Keplerian (PK) effects (periastron advance,\nEinstein delay, Shapiro delay, orbital period decay and eccentricity decay) of\nbinary orbit. The differences in PK effects between general relativity (GR) and\nchameleon $f(R)$ are elegantly quantified by a combination of star's\ncompactness and theory parameter. We use the mass-radius relation to break the\ndegeneracy between these two parameters, thus allowing us to constrain the\ntheory. We simulate the temporal evolution of the orbital period and\neccentricity of neutron star (NS) - white dwarf (WD) binaries, and the results\nindicate that the orbital evolution is typically faster than in GR due to the\nemission of dipole radiation in chameleon $f(R)$. We use the observables of PK\nparameters from the three NS-WD binary pulsars to place constraints on\nchameleon $f(R)$ and possible deviations from GR by performing Monte-Carlo\nsimulations.

Five distinct intruder shapes were considered\nin this study: a disk (OS1), a square (OS2), two rectangles with aspect ratio >\n1 (OS3) and < 1 (OS4) respectively, and an equilateral triangle (OS5). The\nvertical velocity of the oscillating object was observed to be a function of\namplitude and frequency (f) (inverse of time period (T)) of oscillation, and\nthe shape of the object. The dynamics of the motion are modelled with the help\nof a cavity based model which can empirically produce the regimes observed by\nincorporating the free fall of the particles filling the cavity.The cavity\nbased model assumes that there is a point on the surface of each oscillating\nobject unique to its shape that any grain crossing it will irreversibly reach\nthe bottom of the cavity. This leads to the creation of bed of particles at the\nbottom of the cavity which increases intruder's elevation as it oscillates,\nleading to its vertical rise in the granular medium. When an intruder\noscillates much faster than the falling rate of the grains, the intruder cannot\nrise up and thus sinks due to energy provided by the oscillation to the bottom\nlayer. On the contrary, if the intruder oscillates too slow, the cavity gets\ncompletely filled much before it returns. The maximum rise rate is thus\nobserved at the oscillation time period where the cavity filling time is equal\nto the half time period of oscillation.

The 3D camera was mounted in a mobile robot to obtain a longer\nwalking distance. This study shows an improvement in detection of kinematic\ngait signals and gait descriptors by post-processing the raw estimations of the\ncamera using artificial neural networks trained with the data obtained from a\ncertified Vicon system. To achieve this, 37 healthy participants were recruited\nand data of 207 gait sequences were collected using an Orbbec Astra 3D camera.\nThere are two basic possible approaches for training: using kinematic gait\nsignals and using gait descriptors. The former seeks to improve the waveforms\nof kinematic gait signals by reducing the error and increasing the correlation\nwith respect to the Vicon system. The second is a more direct approach,\nfocusing on training the artificial neural networks using gait descriptors\ndirectly. The accuracy of the 3D camera was measured before and after training.\nIn both training approaches, an improvement was observed. Kinematic gait\nsignals showed lower errors and higher correlations with respect to the ground\ntruth. The accuracy of the system to detect gait descriptors also showed a\nsubstantial improvement, mostly for kinematic descriptors rather than\nspatio-temporal.

Numerical simulations, supported by\nexact results for the large-time behavior of sequences of (slowly varying)\ntransition matrices, confirm previous findings that indicate that de\nBroglie-Bohm-Bell dynamics allows an arbitrary initial probability distribution\nto relax to quantum equilibrium; i.e., there is no need to make the ad-hoc\nassumption that the initial distribution of particle locations has to be\nidentical to the initial probability distribution prescribed by the system's\ninitial wave function.

Most existing research focuses on\nactivities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the\nhackathon code. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of code used in and\ncreated during hackathon events, with a particular focus on the code blobs,\nspecifically, how frequently hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much\nnew code they develop, if that code gets reused afterward, and what factors\naffect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects\nfrom DevPost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project characteristics,\noriginal author, code creation time, language, and size information from World\nof Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by identifying all commits\ncontaining blobs created during hackathons and identifying all projects that\ncontain those commits. We also conducted a series of surveys in order to gain a\ndeeper understanding of hackathon code evolution that we sent out to hackathon\nparticipants whose code was reused, whose code was not reused, and developers\nwho reused some hackathon code. Result: 9.14% of the code blobs in hackathon\nrepositories and 8% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during hackathons\nand around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other projects by both\nblob count and LOC. The number of associated technologies and the number of\nparticipants in hackathons increase the reuse probability. Conclusion: The\nresults of our study demonstrate hackathons are not always \"one-off\" events as\ncommon knowledge dictates and they can serve as a starting point for further\nstudies in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 11:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Previous works usually adopt\nrecognized hypotheses of historical utterances as preceding context, which may\nbias the current recognized hypothesis due to the inevitable\nhistoricalrecognition errors. To avoid this problem, we propose an\naudio-textual cross-modal representation extractor to learn contextual\nrepresentations directly from preceding speech. Specifically, it consists of\ntwo modal-related encoders, extracting high-level latent features from speech\nand the corresponding text, and a cross-modal encoder, which aims to learn the\ncorrelation between speech and text. We randomly mask some input tokens and\ninput sequences of each modality. Then a token-missing or modal-missing\nprediction with a modal-level CTC loss on the cross-modal encoder is performed.\nThus, the model captures not only the bi-directional context dependencies in a\nspecific modality but also relationships between different modalities. Then,\nduring the training of the conversational ASR system, the extractor will be\nfrozen to extract the textual representation of preceding speech, while such\nrepresentation is used as context fed to the ASR decoder through attention\nmechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on several\nMandarin conversation corpora and the highest character error rate (CER)\nreduction up to 16% is achieved on the MagicData dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 13:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In such colourings, one assigns colours to all subsets of vertices\nof cardinality $t$ such that in any hyperedge of cardinality at least $t$ there\nis a uniquely coloured $t$-subset.\n  The case $t=1$, i.e., vertex conflict-free colouring, is a well-studied\nnotion. Already the case $t=2$ (i.e., colouring pairs) seems to present a new\nchallenge. Many of the tools used for conflict-free colouring of geometric\nhypergraphs rely on hereditary properties of the underlying hypergraphs. When\ndealing with subsets of vertices, the properties do not pass to subfamilies of\nsubsets. Therefore, we develop new tools, which might be of independent\ninterest.\n  (i) For any fixed $t$, we show that the $\\binom n t$ $t$-subsets in any set\n$P$ of $n$ points in the plane can be coloured with $O(t^2 \\log^2 n)$ colours\nso that any axis-parallel rectangle that contains at least $t$ points of $P$\nalso contains a uniquely coloured $t$-subset.\n  (ii) For a wide class of \"well behaved\" geometrically defined hypergraphs, we\nprovide near tight upper bounds on their $t$-subset conflict-free chromatic\nnumber.

Our approach allows the efficient\nsimulation of materials with complex underlying microstructures which reveal an\noverall anisotropic and nonlinear behavior on the macroscale. Thereby, we\nrestrict ourselves to finite strain hyperelasticity problems for now. By using\na set of problem specific invariants as the input of the ANN and the Helmholtz\nfree energy density as the output, several physical principles, e.g.,\nobjectivity, material symmetry, compatibility with the balance of angular\nmomentum and thermodynamic consistency are fulfilled a priori. The necessary\ndata for the training of the ANN-based surrogate model, i.e., macroscopic\ndeformations and corresponding stresses, are collected via computational\nhomogenization of representative volume elements (RVEs). Thereby, the core\nfeature of the approach is given by a completely autonomous mining of the\nrequired data set within an overall loop. In each iteration of the loop, new\ndata are generated by gathering the macroscopic deformation states from the\nmacroscopic finite element (FE) simulation and a subsequently sorting by using\nthe anisotropy class of the considered material. Finally, all unknown\ndeformations are prescribed in the RVE simulation to get the corresponding\nstresses and thus to extend the data set. The proposed framework consequently\nallows to reduce the number of time-consuming microscale simulations to a\nminimum. It is exemplarily applied to several descriptive examples, where a\nfiber reinforced composite with a highly nonlinear Ogden-type behavior of the\nindividual components is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 13:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

The main result of this paper is a proof that $o_3(n) \\geq\n\\frac{7n+2}{3}$ together with a construction witnessing that $o_3(n) \\leq \\left\n\\lceil \\frac{5n}{2} \\right \\rceil$ for all $n \\geq 12$. We also give a\nconstruction showing that for all sufficiently large $n$ and all $k\\geq 3$,\n$o_k(n) < (2k-3)n$, disproving a conjecture of Hoshino and Kawarabayashi.\nFinally, we prove that, for all $k\\geq 2$, $o_k(n) \\geq \\pth{ k -\n\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{1}{4k-6}} n + \\frac{3}{4(2k-3)}$, improving the previous best\nknown lower bound of Bang-Jensen, Bellitto, Schweser and Stiebitz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 14:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Benchmark datasets have\ntraditionally served dual purposes: first, benchmarks offer a standard on which\nmachine learning researchers can compare different methods, and second,\nbenchmarks provide a model, albeit imperfect, of the real world. The\nincompleteness of test benchmarks (and the data upon which models are trained)\nhinder robustness in machine learning, enable shortcut learning, and leave\nmodels systematically prone to err on out-of-distribution and adversarially\nperturbed data. The mismatch between a single static benchmark dataset and a\nproduction dataset has traditionally been described as a dataset shift. In an\neffort to clarify how to address the mismatch between test benchmarks and\nproduction data, we introduce context shift to describe semantically meaningful\nchanges in the underlying data generation process. Moreover, we identify three\nmethods for addressing context shift that would otherwise lead to model\nprediction errors: first, we describe how human intuition and expert knowledge\ncan identify semantically meaningful features upon which models systematically\nfail, second, we detail how dynamic benchmarking - with its focus on capturing\nthe data generation process - can promote generalizability through\ncorroboration, and third, we highlight that clarifying a model's limitations\ncan reduce unexpected errors. Robust machine learning is focused on model\nperformance beyond benchmarks, and as such, we consider three model organism\ndomains - facial expression recognition, deepfake detection, and medical\ndiagnosis - to highlight how implicit assumptions in benchmark tasks lead to\nerrors in practice. By paying close attention to the role of context,\nresearchers can design more comprehensive benchmarks, reduce context shift\nerrors, and increase generalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 14:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 19:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

It has long been recognized that these can disrupt the axion\nsolution to the strong CP problem. There have also been suggestions that, under\ncertain circumstances, these can lead to a surprisingly large mass for the\naxion. Two types of corrections to this computation have been widely\nconsidered: higher dimension symmetry breaking operators, in theories where\nthere is a complex field responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the PQ\nsymmetry, and small instantons. Motivated by situations where small instantons\ndominate the $\\theta$ potential of non-abelian gauge theories, we formulate the\nquestion of axion quality in terms of constraints on a Wilsonian effective\naction at scales somewhat above the scale of QCD. In this language, the\nstandard axion mass computation assumes a nearly exact PQ symmetry in this\naction.

Although many methods have been proposed to control false\ndiscoveries, it is still a challenging task when the tests are correlated to\neach other. To overcome this challenge, various methods have been proposed to\nestimate the false discovery rate (FDR) and/or the false discovery proportion\n(FDP) under arbitrary covariance among the test statistics. An interesting\nfinding of these works is that the estimation of FDP and FDR under weak\ndependence is identical to that under independence. However, Mei et al. (2021)\npointed out that unlike FDR, the asymptotic variance of FDP can still differ\ndrastically from that under independence, and the difference depends on the\ncovariance structure among the test statistics. In this paper, we further\nextend this result from $z$-tests to $t$-tests when the marginal variances are\nunknown and need to be estimated. With weakly dependent $t$-tests, we show that\nFDP still converges to a fixed quantity unrelated to the dependence structure,\nand further derive the asymptotic expansion and uncertainty of FDP leading to\nsimilar results as in Mei et al.

We examine how the asymptotic variance of FDP varies as\nwell as the performance of its estimators under different dependence structures\nthrough simulations and a real-data study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 08:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

In particular, gravitational wave\nconstraints on the tidal deformability of a neutron star can be translated into\nconstraints on several neutron star properties using a set of universal\nrelations. Apart from binary neutron star mergers, supernova explosions are\nalso important candidates for the detection of multimessenger signals. Such\nobservations may allow us to impose significant constraints on the binding\nenergy of neutron stars. The purpose of the present study is twofold. Firstly,\nwe investigate the agreement of finite temperature equations of state with\nestablished universal relations. Secondly, we examine the possible existence of\na universal relation between the binding energy and the dimensionless tidal\ndeformability, which are the bulk properties connected to the most promising\nsources for multimessenger signals. We find that hot equations of state are not\nalways compatible with accepted universal relations. Therefore, the use of such\nexpressions for probing general relativity or imposing constraints on the\nstructure of neutron stars would be inconclusive (when thermal effects are\npresent). Additionally, we show that the binding energy and the dimensionless\ntidal deformability exhibit a universal trend at least for moderate neutron\nstar masses. The latter allows us to set bounds on the binding energy of a 1.4\n$M_\\odot$ neutron star using data from the GW170817 event. Finally, we provide\na relation between the compactness, the binding energy and the dimensionless\ntidal deformability of a neutron star that is accurate for cold and hot\nisentropic equations of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 06:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 10:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

Hence, operators face the\nchallenge of X-hauling, i.e., backhauling or fronthauling, their traffic to the\ncore network. Also, SBSs densification will increase the possibility of failure\nof these X-haul links. To cope with this problem, an X-haul outage compensation\nscheme with the assistance of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is\nproposed to mitigate or at least alleviate the effect of X-haul failure. The\nRIS is a newly adopted technology that is able to improve the performance of\nwireless networks. In this paper, we present and evaluate an X-haul outage\ncompensation scheme based on placing a number of RIS panels in pre-planned\nlocations to mitigate the effect of X-haul failure. This evaluation is done\nusing frequencies below and beyond 6 GHz. Based on our analytical results, the\nproposed RIS scheme shows that placing a sufficient number of RIS elements in\nproximity to the failed SBS under certain conditions can help acquire the same\nX-haul rate before the occurrence of the failure. Also, we show that for high\nX-haul spectral density, the RIS-assisted transmission with a certain number of\nelements can be more energy-efficient than line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight\ntransmissions. Finally, the system's energy efficiency is addressed with and\nwithout RIS, and the optimal number of RIS reflecting elements is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 14:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

We also prove its selection and estimation\nconsistency. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate its performance, which is\ncomparable to or better than the alternatives. We apply the proposed method to\nanalyze Lung adenocarcinoma(LUAD) real data set, investigating the G-E\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 21:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The financial services industry makes extensive use of contracts, for\nexample, mortgage agreements, derivatives contracts, arbitration agreements,\netc. Most of these contracts exist as text documents, making it difficult to\nautomatically query, execute and analyze them. In this vision paper, we argue\nthat the use of computable contracts in the financial services industry will\nlead to substantial improvements in customer experience, reductions in the cost\nof doing legal transactions, make it easier to respond to changing laws, and\nprovide a much better framework for making decisions impacted by contracts.\nUsing a simple payment agreement, we illustrate a Contract Definition Language,\nsketch several use cases and discuss their benefits to the financial services\nindustry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 00:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}
