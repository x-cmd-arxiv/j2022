Prior work proposes to use adversarial\ntraining to secure models from adversarial examples that can evade the\nclassification of a model and deteriorate its performance. However, this\nprotection technique affects the model's decision boundary and its prediction\nprobabilities, hence it might raise model privacy risks. In fact, a malicious\nuser using only a query access to the prediction output of a model can extract\nit and obtain a high-accuracy and high-fidelity surrogate model. To have a\ngreater extraction, these attacks leverage the prediction probabilities of the\nvictim model. Indeed, all previous work on extraction attacks do not take into\nconsideration the changes in the training process for security purposes. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework to assess extraction attacks on\nadversarially trained models with vision datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, our work is the first to perform such evaluation. Through an\nextensive empirical study, we demonstrate that adversarially trained models are\nmore vulnerable to extraction attacks than models obtained under natural\ntraining circumstances. They can achieve up to $\\times1.2$ higher accuracy and\nagreement with a fraction lower than $\\times0.75$ of the queries. We\nadditionally find that the adversarial robustness capability is transferable\nthrough extraction attacks, i.e., extracted Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from\nrobust models show an enhanced accuracy to adversarial examples compared to\nextracted DNNs from naturally trained (i.e. standard) models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 16:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Most existing night visibility enhancement methods\nfocus mainly on enhancing low-light regions.

To address this problem, we need to\nsuppress the light effects in bright regions while, at the same time, boosting\nthe intensity of dark regions. With this idea in mind, we introduce an\nunsupervised method that integrates a layer decomposition network and a\nlight-effects suppression network. Given a single night image as input, our\ndecomposition network learns to decompose shading, reflectance and\nlight-effects layers, guided by unsupervised layer-specific prior losses. Our\nlight-effects suppression network further suppresses the light effects and, at\nthe same time, enhances the illumination in dark regions. This light-effects\nsuppression network exploits the estimated light-effects layer as the guidance\nto focus on the light-effects regions. To recover the background details and\nreduce hallucination/artefacts, we propose structure and high-frequency\nconsistency losses.

A lot of possible solutions for it have already been proposed in the\nlast few years, with a lot of them using a lot of new and exotic physics ideas\nto deal with the problem. But it was shown recently that the H0 tension might\nnot require new physics but only a more accurate discussion of measurements and\ninterestingly it was the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which was pivotal for\nthat revelation. Accordingly, if one observed the photon mass beyond the\nindeterminacy through uncertainty then one could in principle reconcile the\ntension. We examine this in a greater detail in this work by taking into\naccount modifications of the Compton wavelength, which was pivotal in the\ninitial discussion on the interconnection between uncertainty and the H0\ntension. We mainly discuss two types of modifications, one based on generalized\nuncertainty principles (GUP) and the other on higher dimensional physics\nconsiderations. We firstly show that both minimal length and maximal momentum\nGUP based modifications do not provide photon mass values on the required\nscales and hence we cannot address the tension in this sense at all in this\ncase. We then show that one can get the photon mass to be on the required\nscales even after incorporating higher dimensional effects, one cannot\nreconcile the Hubble Tension in the same sense as in the (3+1) space-time case.\nIn this way, we show that certain new physics considerations cannot address the\nH0 tension in the same sense as one can using the original Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle in a (3+1) space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 16:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 14:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

The wideband MIMO channel is a vector-valued random process\ncorrelated in time, space (antennas), and frequency (subcarriers). The base\nstation (BS) broadcasts periodically beta_tr pilot symbols from its M antenna\nports to K single-antenna users (UEs). Correspondingly, the K UEs send feedback\nmessages about their channel state using beta_fb symbols in the uplink (UL).\nUsing results from remote rate-distortion theory, we show that, as snr reaches\ninfty, the optimal feedback strategy achieves a channel state estimation mean\nsquared error (MSE) that behaves as Theta(1) if beta_tr < r and as\nTheta(snr^(-alpha)) when beta_tr >=r, where alpha = min(beta_fb/r, 1), where r\nis the rank of the channel covariance matrix. The MSE-optimal rate-distortion\nstrategy implies encoding of long sequences of channel states, which would\nyield completely stale CSI and therefore poor multiuser precoding performance.\nHence, we consider three practical one-shot CSI strategies with minimum\none-slot delay and analyze their large-SNR channel estimation MSE behavior.\nThese are: (1) digital feedback via entropy-coded scalar quantization (ECSQ),\n(2) analog feedback (AF), and (3) local channel estimation at the UEs and\ndigital feedback. These schemes have different requirements in terms of\nknowledge of the channel statistics at the UE and at the BS. In particular, the\nlatter strategy requires no statistical knowledge and is closely inspired by a\nCSI feedback scheme currently proposed in 3GPP standardization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 16:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

We investigate whether the leader can craft a strategy under a\ndynamic information structure that induces a desired behavior among the\nfollowers. For the finite population setting, under sufficient conditions, we\nshow that there exist symmetric incentive strategies for the leader that attain\napproximately optimal performance from the leader's viewpoint and lead to an\napproximate symmetric (pure) Nash best response among the followers. Driving\nthe follower population to infinity, we arrive at the interesting result that\nin this infinite-population regime the leader cannot design a smooth\n\"finite-energy\" incentive strategy, namely, a mean-field limit for such games\nis not well-defined. As a way around this, we introduce a class of stochastic\nStackelberg games with a leader, a major follower, and a finite or infinite\npopulation of minor followers, where the leader provides an incentive only for\nthe major follower, who in turn influences the rest of the followers through\nher strategy. For this class of problems, we are able to establish the\nexistence of an incentive strategy with finitely many minor followers. We also\nshow that if the leader's strategy with finitely many minor followers converges\nas their population size grows, then the limit defines an incentive strategy\nfor the corresponding mean-field Stackelberg game. Examples of quadratic\nGaussian games are provided to illustrate both positive and negative results.\nIn addition, as a byproduct of our analysis, we establish existence of a\nrandomized incentive strategy for the class mean-field Stackelberg games, which\nin turn provides an approximation for an incentive strategy of the\ncorresponding finite population Stackelberg game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 17:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

In the frequently used standard Langevin\nequation, memory effects can be implemented through an additional hidden\ncomponent which functions as correlated noise, thus resulting in a\nnon-Markovian model. It can be seen as part of the model class of partially\nobserved diffusions which are usually adapted to observed data via Bayesian\nestimation, whereby the difficulty of the unknown noise values is solved\nthrough a Gibbs sampler. However, when regarding large data sets with a length\nof $10^6$ or $10^7$ data points, sampling the distribution of the same amount\nof latent variables is unfeasible. For the model discussed in this work, we\nsolve this issue through a direct derivation of the posterior distribution of\nthe Euler-Maruyama approximation of the model via analytical marginalization of\nthe latent variables. Yet, in the case of a nonlinear noise process, the\ninverse problem of model estimation proves to be ill-posed and still\nnumerically expensive. We handle these complications by restricting the noise\nto an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which considerably reduces the ambiguity of\nthe estimation. Further, in this case, the estimation can be performed very\nefficiently if the drift and diffusion functions of the observed component are\napproximated in a piecewise constant manner. We illustrate the resulting\nprocedure of efficient Bayesian estimation of the considered non-Markovian\nLangevin model by an example from turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 17:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Importantly, the number of\nalpha maps can be dynamically adjusted and can differ between training and\ninference, alleviating memory concerns and enabling fast training of GMPIs in\nless than half a day at a resolution of $1024^2$. Our findings are consistent\nacross three challenging and common high-resolution datasets, including FFHQ,\nAFHQv2, and MetFaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 17:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Modeling these affects is essential for scientific remote sensing\nmeasurements of the earth and atmosphere. For example, hyperspectral imagery is\na form of digital imagery collected with many, often hundreds, of wavelengths\nof light in pixel. The amount of light measured at the sensor is the result of\nemitted sunlight, atmospheric radiative transfer, and the reflectance off the\nmaterials on the ground, all of which vary per wavelength resulting from\nmultiple physical phenomena. Therefore measurements of the ground spectra or\natmospheric constituents requires separating these different contributions per\nwavelength. In this paper, we create an autoencoder similar to denoising\nautoencoders treating the atmospheric affects as 'noise' and ground reflectance\nas truth per spectrum. We generate hundreds of thousands of training samples by\ntaking random samples of spectra from laboratory measurements and adding\natmospheric affects using physics-based modelling via MODTRAN\n(http://modtran.spectral.com/modtran\\_home) by varying atmospheric inputs. This\nprocess ideally could create an autoencoder that would separate atmospheric\neffects and ground reflectance in hyperspectral imagery, a process called\natmospheric compensation which is difficult and time-consuming requiring a\ncombination of heuristic approximations, estimates of physical quantities, and\nphysical modelling. While the accuracy of our method is not as good as other\nmethods in the field, this an important first step in applying the growing\nfield of deep learning of physical principles to atmospheric compensation in\nhyperspectral imagery and remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 17:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

However, at\n$z\\gtrsim1$ these studies have been limited by a lack of deep, high-resolution\nrest-frame infrared imaging that accurately traces galaxy stellar mass\ndistributions.

However, online methods have their\ninherent advantage in handling long video sequences and ongoing videos while\noffline models fail due to the limit of computational resources. Therefore, it\nwould be highly desirable if online models can achieve comparable or even\nbetter performance than offline models. By dissecting current online models and\noffline models, we demonstrate that the main cause of the performance gap is\nthe error-prone association between frames caused by the similar appearance\namong different instances in the feature space. Observing this, we propose an\nonline framework based on contrastive learning that is able to learn more\ndiscriminative instance embeddings for association and fully exploit history\ninformation for stability. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms all\nonline and offline methods on three benchmarks. Specifically, we achieve 49.5\nAP on YouTube-VIS 2019, a significant improvement of 13.2 AP and 2.1 AP over\nthe prior online and offline art, respectively.

We also prove a corresponding lower bound on the entropy of optimal\nsolutions for the multiple-choice secretary problem, matching entropy of our\nalgorithm, where no such previous lower bound was known.\n  We obtain our algorithmic results with a host of new techniques, and with\nthese techniques we also improve significantly the previous results of KKN\nabout constructing entropy-optimal distributions for the classic free order\nsecretary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 18:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

In this paper, we introduce an integer\nprogramming model, the drop box location problem (DBLP), to locate drop boxes.\nThe DBLP considers criteria of cost, voter access, and risk. The cost of the\ndrop box system is determined by the fixed cost of adding drop boxes and the\noperational cost of a collection tour by a bipartisan team who regularly\ncollects ballots from selected locations. The DBLP utilizes covering sets to\nensure each voter is in close proximity to a drop box and incorporates a novel\nmeasure of access to measure the ability to use multiple voting pathways to\nvote.

Leveraging a\nmodern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the\nframework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems\nwith a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally\nserves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically\nconstruct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of\nsymmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension.\nThis exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric\nquantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as\nwell as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while\ndualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and\nanalytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of\nthe approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional\ntopological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a\nholographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding.\nWe uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points,\nwhich we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and\ntransitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual\nsystems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like\nsymmetries.

Recently, heterogeneous ensemble methods (HEM),\nincluding stacking, have emerged as more accurate and robust intelligent\ntechniques and are often used to solve pattern recognition problems by\nproviding more reliable and accurate predictions. In this study, we apply one\nof the key HEM methods, Stacking, to model crash frequency on five lane\nundivided segments (5T) of urban and suburban arterials. The prediction\nperformance of Stacking is compared with parametric statistical models (Poisson\nand negative binomial) and three state of the art machine learning techniques\n(Decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting), each of which is termed\nas the base learner. By employing an optimal weight scheme to combine\nindividual base learners through stacking, the problem of biased predictions in\nindividual base-learners due to differences in specifications and prediction\naccuracies is avoided. Data including crash, traffic, and roadway inventory\nwere collected and integrated from 2013 to 2017. The data are split into\ntraining, validation, and testing datasets. Estimation results of statistical\nmodels reveal that besides other factors, crashes increase with density (number\nper mile) of different types of driveways. Comparison of out-of-sample\npredictions of various models confirms the superiority of Stacking over the\nalternative methods considered. From a practical standpoint, stacking can\nenhance prediction accuracy (compared to using only one base learner with a\nparticular specification).

The\nnonlinear evolution of these instabilities generates a state of turbulence with\nsignificantly different spatio-temporal features compared to Newtonian\nturbulence, termed elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). We explore EIT by studying\nthe dynamics of a submerged planar jet of a dilute aqueous polymer solution\ninjected into a quiescent tank of water using a combination of schlieren\nimaging and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). We show how fluid elasticity has a\nnonmonotonic effect on the jet stability depending on its magnitude, creating\ntwo distinct regimes in which elastic effects can either destabilize or\nstabilize the jet. In agreement with linear stability analyses of viscoelastic\njets, an inertio-elastic shear-layer instability emerges near the edge of the\njet for small levels of elasticity, independent of bulk undulations in the\nfluid column. The growth of this disturbance mode destabilizes the flow,\nresulting in a turbulence transition at lower Reynolds numbers and closer to\nthe nozzle compared to the conditions required for the transition to turbulence\nin a Newtonian jet. Increasing the fluid elasticity merges the shear-layer\ninstability into a bulk instability of the jet column. In this regime, elastic\ntensile stresses generated in the shear layer act as an \"elastic membrane\" that\npartially stabilizes the flow, retarding the transition to turbulence to higher\nlevels of inertia and greater distances from the nozzle. In the fully turbulent\nstate far from the nozzle, planar viscoelastic jets exhibit unique\nspatio-temporal features associated with EIT. The time-averaged angle of jet\nspreading, an Eulerian measure of the degree of entrainment, and the centerline\nvelocity of the jets both evolve self-similarly with distance from the nozzle.\nThe autocovariance of the schlieren images in the fully turbulent region of the\njets shows coherent structures that are elongated in the streamwise direction,\nconsistent with the suppression of streamwise vortices by elastic stresses.\nThese coherent structures give a higher spectral energy to small frequency\nmodes in EIT characterized by LDV measurements of the velocity fluctuations at\nthe jet centerline. Finally, our LDV measurements reveal a frequency spectrum\ncharacterized by a $-3$ power-law exponent, different from the well-known\n$-5/3$ power-law exponent characteristic of Newtonian turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 20:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 20:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

In particular, the protoplanetary\ndiscs around the Herbig Ae stars HD 100546 and HD 163296 show opposite trends\nin terms of cold versus hot water emission: in the first case, the ground-state\ntransitions are detected and the high-J lines are undetected, while the trend\nis opposite in HD 163296. We performed a spectral analysis using the\nthermo-chemical model DALI. We find that HD 163296 is characterised by a\nwater-rich (abundance $\\gtrsim 10^{-5}$) hot inner disc (within the snowline)\nand a water-poor ($< 10^{-10}$) outer disc: the relative abundance may be due\nto the thermal desorption of icy grains that have migrated inward. Remarkably,\nthe size of the H$_2$O emitting region corresponds to a narrow dust gap visible\nin the millimeter continuum at $r=10\\,$au with ALMA. The low-J lines detected\nin HD 100546 instead imply an abundance of a few $10^{-9}$ in the cold outer\ndisc ($> 40$ au). The emitting region of the cold H$_2$O transitions is\nspatially coincident with that of the H$_2$O ice previously seen in the\nnear-infrared. Notably, millimetre observations with ALMA reveal the presence\nof a large dust gap between nearly 40 and 150 au, likely opened by a massive\nembedded protoplanet. In both discs, we find that the warm molecular layer in\nthe outer region (beyond the snow line) is highly depleted of water molecules,\nimplying an oxygen-poor chemical composition of the gas. We speculate that\ngas-phase oxygen in the outer disc is readily depleted and its distribution in\nthe disc is tightly coupled to the dynamics of the dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 20:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the\n2-dimension (2D) direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation of the sensing target\nis derived, which is then minimized subject to the minimum communication\nrequirement. A novel approach is proposed to transform the complicated CRB\nminimization problem into a trackable modified Fisher information matrix (FIM)\noptimization problem. Both independent and coupled phase-shift models of STARS\nare investigated: 1) For the independent phase-shift model, to address the\ncoupling of ISAC waveform and STARS coefficient in the modified FIM, an\nefficient double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) framework is conceived; 2) For the coupled phase-shift\nmodel, based on the PDD framework, a low complexity alternating optimization\nalgorithm is proposed to tackle coupled phase-shift constants by alternatively\noptimizing amplitude and phase-shift coefficients in closed-form.

The analysis uses\nflow realizations from published large-eddy simulations (Sullivan et al., J\nAtmos Sci 73(4):1815-1840, 2016) ranging in stability from neutral to nearly\nz-less stratification. The coherent turbulent structure is well approximated as\na series of uniform momentum zones (UMZs) and uniform temperature zones (UTZs)\nseparated by thin layers of intense gradients that are significantly greater\nthan the mean. This pattern yields stairstep-like instantaneous flow profiles\nwhose shape is distinct from the mean profiles that emerge from long-term\naveraging. However, the scaling of the stairstep organization is closely\nrelated to the resulting mean profiles. The differences in velocity and\ntemperature across the thin gradient layers remain proportional to the surface\nmomentum and heat flux conditions regardless of stratification. The vertical\nthickness of UMZs and UTZs is proportional to height above the surface for\nneutral and weak stratification, but becomes thinner and less dependent on\nheight as the stability increases. Deviations from the logarithmic mean\nprofiles for velocity and temperature observed under neutral conditions are\ntherefore predominately due to the reduction in zone size with increasing\nstratification, which is empirically captured by existing Monin-Obukhov\nsimilarity relations for momentum and heat. The zone properties are\nadditionally used to explain trends in the turbulent Prandtl number, thus\nproviding a connection between the eddy organization, mean profiles, and\nturbulent diffusivity in stably stratified conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 21:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

In this letter we extend the Tactile Gym\nsimulator to include three new optical tactile sensors (TacTip, DIGIT and\nDigiTac) of the two most popular types, Gelsight-style (image-shading based)\nand TacTip-style (marker based). We demonstrate that a single sim-to-real\napproach can be used with these three different sensors to achieve strong\nreal-world performance despite the significant differences between real tactile\nimages.

Integrating a significant\namount of renewables into a power grid is probably the most accessible way to\nreduce carbon emissions from power grids and slow down climate change.\nUnfortunately, the most accessible renewable power sources, such as wind and\nsolar, are highly fluctuating and thus bring a lot of uncertainty to power grid\noperations and challenge existing optimization and control policies. The\nchance-constrained alternating current (AC) optimal power flow (OPF) framework\nfinds the minimum cost generation dispatch maintaining the power grid\noperations within security limits with a prescribed probability. Unfortunately,\nthe AC-OPF problem's chance-constrained extension is non-convex,\ncomputationally challenging, and requires knowledge of system parameters and\nadditional assumptions on the behavior of renewable distribution. Known linear\nand convex approximations to the above problems, though tractable, are too\nconservative for operational practice and do not consider uncertainty in system\nparameters. This paper presents an alternative data-driven approach based on\nGaussian process (GP) regression to close this gap. The GP approach learns a\nsimple yet non-convex data-driven approximation to the AC power flow equations\nthat can incorporate uncertainty inputs. The latter is then used to determine\nthe solution of CC-OPF efficiently, by accounting for both input and parameter\nuncertainty. The practical efficiency of the proposed approach using different\napproximations for GP-uncertainty propagation is illustrated over numerous IEEE\ntest cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 23:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

However, the\ndiagnostic accuracy of the biopsy procedure is limited by the\noperator-dependent skills and experience in sampling the targets, a sequential\ndecision making process that involves navigating an ultrasound probe and\nplacing a series of sampling needles for potentially multiple targets. This\nwork aims to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that optimises the\nactions of continuous positioning of 2D ultrasound views and biopsy needles\nwith respect to a guiding template, such that the MR targets can be sampled\nefficiently and sufficiently. We first formulate the task as a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) and construct an environment that allows the targeting actions to\nbe performed virtually for individual patients, based on their anatomy and\nlesions derived from MR images. A patient-specific policy can thus be\noptimised, before each biopsy procedure, by rewarding positive sampling in the\nMDP environment. Experiment results from fifty four prostate cancer patients\nshow that the proposed RL-learned policies obtained a mean hit rate of 93% and\nan average cancer core length of 11 mm, which compared favourably to two\nalternative baseline strategies designed by humans, without hand-engineered\nrewards that directly maximise these clinically relevant metrics. Perhaps more\ninterestingly, it is found that the RL agents learned strategies that were\nadaptive to the lesion size, where spread of the needles was prioritised for\nsmaller lesions. Such a strategy has not been previously reported or commonly\nadopted in clinical practice, but led to an overall superior targeting\nperformance when compared with intuitively designed strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 23:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Thus,\na sealed-bid auction that hides bidding prices is desirable. However, in\nprevious sealed-bid auction protocols, it has been difficult to provide a\n``fund binding'' property, which would guarantee that a bidder has funds more\nthan or equal to the bidding price and that the funds are forcibly withdrawn\nwhen the bidder wins. Thus, such protocols are vulnerable to false bidding. As\na solution, many protocols employ a simple deposit method in which each bidder\nsends a deposit to a smart contract, which is greater than or equal to the\nbidding price, before the bidding phase. However, this deposit reveals the\nmaximum bidding price, and it is preferable to hide this information.\n  In this paper, we propose a sealed-bid auction protocol that provides a fund\nbinding property. Our protocol not only hides the bidding price and a maximum\nbidding price, but also provides fund binding, simultaneously. For hiding the\nmaximum bidding price, we pay attention to the fact that usual Ethereum\ntransactions and transactions for sending funds to a one-time address have the\nsame transaction structure, and it seems that they are indistinguishable. We\ndiscuss how much bidding transactions are hidden. We also employ DECO (Zhang et\nal,. CCS 2020) that proves the validity of the data to a verifier in which the\ndata are taken from a source without showing the data itself. Finally, we give\nour implementation which shows transaction fees required and compare it to a\nsealed-bid auction protocol employing the simple deposit method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Many existing works utilize sophisticated temporal\nmodeling approaches to incorporate with graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\ncapturing short-term and long-term spatio-temporal dependencies. However, these\nseparated modules with complicated designs could restrict effectiveness and\nefficiency of spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, most\nprevious works adopt the fixed graph construction methods to characterize the\nglobal spatio-temporal relations, which limits the learning capability of the\nmodel for different time periods and even different data scenarios. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose an automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous\ngraph network, named Auto-DSTSGN for traffic prediction.

Further,\nwe propose a graph structure search approach to automatically construct the\nspatio-temporal synchronous graph that can adapt to different data scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model\ncan achieve about 10% improvements compared with the state-of-art methods.\nSource codes are available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/Auto-DSTSGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Recent years have\nwitnessed the increasing attentions paid to dynamic graph neural networks for\nmodelling such graph data, where almost all the existing approaches assume that\nwhen a new link is built, the embeddings of the neighbor nodes should be\nupdated by learning the temporal dynamics to propagate new information.\nHowever, such approaches suffer from the limitation that if the node introduced\nby a new connection contains noisy information, propagating its knowledge to\nother nodes is not reliable and even leads to the collapse of the model. In\nthis paper, we propose AdaNet: a robust knowledge Adaptation framework via\nreinforcement learning for dynamic graph neural Networks. In contrast to\nprevious approaches immediately updating the embeddings of the neighbor nodes\nonce adding a new link, AdaNet attempts to adaptively determine which nodes\nshould be updated because of the new link involved. Considering that the\ndecision whether to update the embedding of one neighbor node will have great\nimpact on other neighbor nodes, we thus formulate the selection of node update\nas a sequence decision problem, and address this problem via reinforcement\nlearning. By this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes\nfor learning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our\nknowledge, our approach constitutes the first attempt to explore robust\nknowledge adaptation via reinforcement learning for dynamic graph neural\nnetworks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nAdaNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we perform the\nexperiments by adding different degrees of noise into the dataset,\nquantitatively and qualitatively illustrating the robustness of AdaNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 02:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Therefore, detecting ASR errors is a critical\nfirst step in preventing further error propagation to downstream applications.\nTo this end, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for ASR error detection\nusing audio-transcript entailment. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to frame this problem as an end-to-end entailment task between the audio\nsegment and its corresponding transcript segment.

For graphs (i.e., $2$-uniform\nhypergraphs), a bound tight up to the leading constant was proven in a\nclassical work of Alon, Hoory and Linial [AHL02]. For hypergraphs of uniformity\n$k>2$, an appropriate generalization was conjectured by Feige [Fei08]. The\nconjecture was settled up to an additional $\\log^{4k+1} n$ factor in the size\nin a recent work of Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar [GKM21]. Their argument\nrelies on a connection between the existence of short even covers and the\nspectrum of a certain randomly signed Kikuchi matrix. Their analysis,\nespecially for the case of odd $k$, is significantly complicated.\n  In this work, we present a substantially simpler and shorter proof of the\nhypergraph Moore bound.

To\naddress this problem, we present Geodesic-Former -- the first geodesic-guided\ntransformer for 3D point cloud instance segmentation. The key idea is to\nleverage the geodesic distance to tackle the density imbalance of LiDAR 3D\npoint clouds. The LiDAR 3D point clouds are dense near the object surface and\nsparse or empty elsewhere making the Euclidean distance less effective to\ndistinguish different objects.

Most existing data-driven simulators for\nparticle-based systems adopt graph neural networks (GNNs) as their network\nbackbones, as particles and their interactions can be naturally represented by\ngraph nodes and graph edges. However, while particle-based systems usually\ncontain hundreds even thousands of particles, the explicit modeling of particle\ninteractions as graph edges inevitably leads to a significant computational\noverhead, due to the increased number of particle interactions. Consequently,\nin this paper we propose a novel Transformer-based method, dubbed as\nTransformer with Implicit Edges (TIE), to capture the rich semantics of\nparticle interactions in an edge-free manner. The core idea of TIE is to\ndecentralize the computation involving pair-wise particle interactions into\nper-particle updates. This is achieved by adjusting the self-attention module\nto resemble the update formula of graph edges in GNN. To improve the\ngeneralization ability of TIE, we further amend TIE with learnable\nmaterial-specific abstract particles to disentangle global material-wise\nsemantics from local particle-wise semantics. We evaluate our model on diverse\ndomains of varying complexity and materials.

This $T_c$ is higher\nthan those of 2H-Mo$_2$C (4.3 K), 1T-Mo$_2$N (16.8 K), and other pristine\nMXenes. The material exhibits remarkable enhancement in $\\lambda$ and $T_c$\nwhen subject to compressive and tensile stresses. The obvious strong EPC with\n$\\lambda$ over 2.0 occurs at strains of -4%, -2.5%, and 5%, yielding $T_c$s of\n37.8, 35.4, and 28.9 K, respectively. Our findings suggest that the\nstrain-dependent feature and energy levels of electronic bands play an\nessential role in enhancing EPC. Moreover, the stronger EPC in Mo$_2$N compared\nwith Mo$_2$C is clarified based on lattice vibrations. Therefore, this work\npaves a practical way for designing 2D superconducting materials using tuning\natomic recipes and strain-dependent engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 03:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 07:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

The use of\ntransformers can benefit correlation map aggregation through self-attention\nover a global receptive field. However, the tokenization of a correlation map\nfor transformer processing can be detrimental, because the discontinuity at\ntoken boundaries reduces the local context available near the token edges and\ndecreases inductive bias. To address this problem, we propose a 4D\nConvolutional Swin Transformer, where a high-dimensional Swin Transformer is\npreceded by a series of small-kernel convolutions that impart local context to\nall pixels and introduce convolutional inductive bias. We additionally boost\naggregation performance by applying transformers within a pyramidal structure,\nwhere aggregation at a coarser level guides aggregation at a finer level. Noise\nin the transformer output is then filtered in the subsequent decoder with the\nhelp of the query's appearance embedding. With this model, a new\nstate-of-the-art is set for all the standard benchmarks in few-shot\nsegmentation. It is shown that VAT attains state-of-the-art performance for\nsemantic correspondence as well, where cost aggregation also plays a central\nrole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 04:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Without the\ncapacity to tell the difference between image details and noise, general image\ncompression methods allocate additional bits to explicitly store the undesired\nimage noise during compression and restore the unpleasant noisy image during\ndecompression. Based on the observations, we optimize the image compression\nalgorithm to be noise-aware as joint denoising and compression to resolve the\nbits misallocation problem. The key is to transform the original noisy images\nto noise-free bits by eliminating the undesired noise during compression, where\nthe bits are later decompressed as clean images. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel two-branch, weight-sharing architecture with plug-in feature denoisers to\nallow a simple and effective realization of the goal with little computational\ncost.

After filtering out dominant QNMs, we can visualize the\nexistence of various subdominant effects. For example, by applying our filters\nto a GW150914-like numerical relativity (NR) waveform, we find second-order\neffects in the (l = 4, m = 4), (l = 5, m = 4) and (l = 5, m = 5) harmonics; the\nspherical-spheroidal mixing mode in the (l = 2,m = 2) harmonic; and a mixing\nmode in the (l = 2,m = 1) harmonic due to a gravitational recoil. In another NR\nsimulation where two component spins are anti-aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, we also find retrograde modes. The filters are sensitive to the\nremnant properties (i.e., mass and spin) and thus have a potential application\nto future data analyses and parameter estimations.

Transformer-based representation models have\nrecently made a great leap forward. These models are pre-trained on large\nonline datasets to understand natural language texts effectively. The quality\nof a learning embedding is influenced by how clinical notes are used as input\nto representation models. A clinical note has several sections with different\nlevels of information value. It is also common for healthcare providers to use\ndifferent expressions for the same concept. Existing methods use clinical notes\ndirectly or with an initial preprocessing as input to representation models.\nHowever, to learn a good embedding, we identified the most essential clinical\nnotes section. We then mapped the extracted concepts from selected sections to\nthe standard names in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We used the\nstandard phrases corresponding to the unique concepts as input for clinical\nmodels.

Existing approaches commonly use third-person\nvideos for learning the procedure, making the manipulated object small in\nappearance and often occluded by the actor, leading to significant errors. In\ncontrast, we observe that videos obtained from first-person (egocentric)\nwearable cameras provide an unobstructed and clear view of the action. However,\nprocedure learning from egocentric videos is challenging because (a) the camera\nview undergoes extreme changes due to the wearer's head motion, and (b) the\npresence of unrelated frames due to the unconstrained nature of the videos. Due\nto this, current state-of-the-art methods' assumptions that the actions occur\nat approximately the same time and are of the same duration, do not hold.\nInstead, we propose to use the signal provided by the temporal correspondences\nbetween key-steps across videos. To this end, we present a novel\nself-supervised Correspond and Cut (CnC) framework for procedure learning. CnC\nidentifies and utilizes the temporal correspondences between the key-steps\nacross multiple videos to learn the procedure. Our experiments show that CnC\noutperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark ProceL and CrossTask datasets\nby 5.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Furthermore, for procedure learning using\negocentric videos, we propose the EgoProceL dataset consisting of 62 hours of\nvideos captured by 130 subjects performing 16 tasks.

Correlation Clustering has been used to model\na large number of clustering problems in practice, making it one of the most\nwidely studied clustering formulations. The approximability of Correlation\nClustering has been actively investigated [BBC04, CGW05, ACN08], culminating in\na $2.06$-approximation algorithm [CMSY15], based on rounding the standard LP\nrelaxation. Since the integrality gap for this formulation is 2, it has\nremained a major open question to determine if the approximation factor of 2\ncan be reached, or even breached.\n  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by showing that there\nexists a $(1.994 + \\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm based on\n$O(1/\\epsilon^2$) rounds of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. In order to round a\nsolution to the Sherali-Adams relaxation, we adapt the {\\em correlated\nrounding} originally developed for CSPs [BRS11, GS11, RT12]. With this tool, we\nreach an approximation ratio of $2+\\epsilon$ for Correlation Clustering. To\nbreach this ratio, we go beyond the traditional triangle-based analysis by\nemploying a global charging scheme that amortizes the total cost of the\nrounding across different triangles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 05:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 15:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

The single spin\nasymmetries were extracted as a function of $x$ and $Q^2$, as well as the\nsemi-inclusive variables $z$, and $P_T$. They are obtained in azimuthal moments\nin combinations of the azimuthal angles of the hadron transverse momentum and\ntransverse spin of the nucleon relative to the lepton scattering plane. The\ninitially unpolarized MonteCarlo was re-weighted in the true kinematic\nvariables, hadron types and parton flavors based on global fits of fixed target\nSIDIS experiments and $e^+e^-$ annihilation data. The expected statistical\nprecision of such measurements is extrapolated to 10 fb$^{-1}$ and potential\nsystematic uncertainties are approximated given the deviations between true and\nreconstructed yields. The impact on the knowledge of the Sivers functions,\ntransversity and tensor charges, and the Collins function has then been\nevaluated in the same phenomenological extractions as in the Yellow Report.

A key to domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation is to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features\nwithout target ground-truth labels. To this end, we propose a bi-directional\npixel-prototype contrastive learning framework that minimizes intra-class\nvariations of features for the same object class, while maximizing inter-class\nvariations for different ones, regardless of domains. Specifically, our\nframework aligns pixel-level features and a prototype of the same object class\nin target and source images (i.e., positive pairs), respectively, sets them\napart for different classes (i.e., negative pairs), and performs the alignment\nand separation processes toward the other direction with pixel-level features\nin the source image and a prototype in the target image. The cross-domain\nmatching encourages domain-invariant feature representations, while the\nbidirectional pixel-prototype correspondences aggregate features for the same\nobject class, providing discriminative features. To establish training pairs\nfor contrastive learning, we propose to generate dynamic pseudo labels of\ntarget images using a non-parametric label transfer, that is, pixel-prototype\ncorrespondences across different domains.

However, the RDMA protocol is efficient only on (nearly) lossless\nnetworks, emphasizing the vital role of congestion control on RoCE networks.\nUnfortunately, the native RoCE congestion control scheme, based on Priority\nFlow Control (PFC), suffers from many drawbacks such as unfairness,\nhead-of-line-blocking, and deadlock. Therefore, in recent years many schemes\nhave been proposed to provide additional congestion control for RoCE networks\nto minimize PFC drawbacks. However, these schemes are proposed for general\ndatacenter environments. In contrast to the general datacenters that are built\nusing commodity hardware and run general-purpose workloads, high-performance\ndistributed training platforms deploy high-end accelerators and network\ncomponents and exclusively run training workloads using collectives\n(All-Reduce, All-To-All) communication libraries for communication.\nFurthermore, these platforms usually have a private network, separating their\ncommunication traffic from the rest of the datacenter traffic. Scalable\ntopology-aware collective algorithms are inherently designed to avoid incast\npatterns and balance traffic optimally. These distinct features necessitate\nrevisiting previously proposed congestion control schemes for general-purpose\ndatacenter environments. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze some of the SOTA\nRoCE congestion control schemes vs. PFC when running on distributed training\nplatforms. Our results indicate that previously proposed RoCE congestion\ncontrol schemes have little impact on the end-to-end performance of training\nworkloads, motivating the necessity of designing an optimized, yet\nlow-overhead, congestion control scheme based on the characteristics of\ndistributed training platforms and workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 06:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

A widely used framework is adversarial\ncontrastive learning which couples AT and SSL, and thus constitute a very\ncomplex optimization problem.

The composite is constituted\nby a soft isotropic matrix reinforced with stiff fibres, that can evolve\nindependently from each other. The constitutive equations are provided in terms\nof the free energy density and the dissipation density which are both required\nto be thermodynamically consistent and structurally frame-indifferent, i.e.,\nthey must be independent of a rotation overimposed on the natural state. This\nis in contrast to many of the currently used inelastic models for soft\nfiber-reinforced materials which do not deal with the lack of uniqueness of the\nnatural state. A constraint between the inelastic spin of the matrix and the\nrotation spin of the fibre is introduced to fully determined the natural state.\nThe resulting flow rules of the inelastic processes incorporate some typical\nscenarios including viscoelasticity and growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

It\ninvolves the formation of a bud, i.e. an outgrowth from the cell membrane that\nevolves into an envelope. The largest energetic barrier to bud formation is\nmembrane deflection and is trespassed primarily thanks to nucleocapsid-membrane\nadhesion. Transmembrane proteins (TPs), which later form the virus ligands, are\nthe main promotors of adhesion and can accommodate membrane bending thanks to\nan induced spontaneous curvature. Adhesive TPs must diffuse across the membrane\nfrom remote regions to gather on the bud surface, thus, diffusivity controls\nthe kinetics. This paper proposes a simple model to describe diffusion-mediated\nbudding unraveling important size limitations and size-dependent kinetics. The\npredicted optimal virion radius, giving the fastest budding, is validated\nagainst experiments for Coronavirus, HIV, Flu, and Hepatitis. Assuming\nexponential replication of virions and hereditary size, the model can predict\nthe size distribution of a virus population. This is verified against\nexperiments for SARS-CoV-2. All the above comparisons rely on the premise that\nbudding poses the tightest size constraint. This is true in most cases, as\ndemonstrated in this paper, where the proposed model is extended to describe\nvirus infection via receptor- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and via\nmembrane fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 03:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 18:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

We compute the constraints from LFV\nmuon and tau decays on the new-physics operators that can induce LFV processes\ninvolving $c\\bar c$ and $b\\bar b$ systems, thus providing a comprehensive list\nof indirect upper limits on processes such as $J/\\psi \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime$,\n$\\Upsilon(nS) \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime$, $\\Upsilon(nS) \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime \\gamma$\netc., which can be sought at BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed super tau-charm\nfactory.

In the case of decays\nof quarkonia into $\\ell\\tau$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$), we find that an improvement by 2-3\norders of magnitude on the current sensitivities is in general required in\norder to discover or further constrain new physics.

Allowing for the two\nphase variations to be modelled as general diffeomorphic time warpings, in this\nwork we focus on the hitherto unconsidered setting where phase variation of the\ncomponent functions are spatially correlated. We propose an algorithm to\noptimize a metric-based objective function for registration with a novel\npenalty term that incorporates the spatial correlation between the component\nphase variations through a kriging estimate of an appropriate phase random\nfield. The penalty term encourages the overall phase at a particular location\nto be similar to the spatially weighted average phase in its neighbourhood, and\nthus engenders a regularization that prevents over-alignment. Utility of the\nregistration method, and its superior performance compared to methods that fail\nto account for the spatial correlation, is demonstrated through performance on\nsimulated examples and two multivariate functional datasets pertaining to EEG\nsignals and ozone concentrations. The generality of the framework opens up the\npossibility for extension to settings involving different forms of correlation\nbetween the component functions and their phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Specifically, this work focuses on optimizing the\nplacement of Forcemyography (FMG) sensors for FMG armbands in the application\nof arm movement recognition. Firstly, based on graph theory, the armband is\nmodeled considering sensors' signals and connectivity. Then, a Graph-based\nArmband Modeling Network (GAM-Net) is introduced for arm movement recognition.\nAfterward, the sensor placement optimization for FMG armbands is formulated and\nan optimization algorithm with greedy local search is proposed. To study the\neffectiveness of our optimization algorithm, a dataset for mechanical\nmaintenance tasks using FMG armbands with 16 sensors is collected. Our\nexperiments show that using only 4 sensors optimized with our algorithm can\nhelp maintain a comparable recognition accuracy to using all sensors. Finally,\nthe optimized sensor placement result is verified from a physiological view.\nThis work would like to shed light on the automatic fabrication of wearable\ndevices considering downstream tasks, such as human biological signal\ncollection and movement recognition.

Extending these standard simulation methodologies to the\nnon-spherical cases is non-trivial. To circumvent this problem, non-spherical\nbodies are considered as a collection of constituent spherical objects. As the\nnumber of these constituent objects becomes large, the computational burden to\nsimulate the system also increases. In this article, we propose an alternative\nway to simulate non-circular rigid bodies in two dimensions having pairwise\nrepulsive interactions. Our approach is based on a machine learning (ML) based\nmodel which predicts the overlap between two non-circular bodies. The machine\nlearning model is easy to train and the computation cost of its implementation\nremains independent of the number of constituents disks used to represent a\nnon-circular rigid body. When used in MC simulation, our approach provides\nsignificant speed up in comparison to the standard implementation where overlap\ndetermination between two rigid bodies is done by calculating the distance of\ntheir constituent disks. Our proposed ML based MC method provided very similar\nstructural features (in comparison to standard implementation) of the systems.\nWe believe this work is a very first step towards a time-efficient simulation\nof non-spherical rigid bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

As the core\nof DL-enabled systems, deep neural networks (DNNs) need to be carefully\nevaluated to ensure the produced models match the expected requirements. In\npractice, the \\emph{de facto standard} to assess the quality of DNNs in the\nindustry is to check their performance (accuracy) on a collected set of labeled\ntest data. However, preparing such labeled data is often not easy partly\nbecause of the huge labeling effort, i.e., data labeling is labor-intensive,\nespecially with the massive new incoming unlabeled data every day. Recent\nstudies show that test selection for DNN is a promising direction that tackles\nthis issue by selecting minimal representative data to label and using these\ndata to assess the model. However, it still requires human effort and cannot be\nautomatic. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, named \\textit{Aries},\nthat can estimate the performance of DNNs on new unlabeled data using only the\ninformation obtained from the original test data. The key insight behind our\ntechnique is that the model should have similar prediction accuracy on the data\nwhich have similar distances to the decision boundary. We performed a\nlarge-scale evaluation of our technique on two famous datasets, CIFAR-10 and\nTiny-ImageNet, four widely studied DNN models including ResNet101 and\nDenseNet121, and 13 types of data transformation methods.

We introduce an efficient, iterative\nalgorithm which exploits shared-memory parallelism, as well as an analytic\nexpression of the fitting energy gradient, to ensure fast iterations. Our\napproach also trivially extends to extremum persistence diagrams. Extensive\nexperiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach -\nwith MT-PGA computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples. We\nshow the utility of our contributions by extending to merge trees two typical\nPCA applications. First, we apply MT-PGA to data reduction and reliably\ncompress merge trees by concisely representing them by their first coordinates\nin the MT-PGA basis. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework\nexploiting the first two directions of the MT-PGA basis to generate\ntwo-dimensional layouts of the ensemble. We augment these layouts with\npersistence correlation views, enabling global and local visual inspections of\nthe feature variability in the ensemble. In both applications, quantitative\nexperiments assess the relevance of our framework.

Hip fractures,\nespecially in elderly people, lead to increased morbidity, decreased quality of\nlife and increased mortality. Being a silent disease before fracture,\nosteoporosis often remains undiagnosed and untreated. Areal bone mineral\ndensity (aBMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the\ngold-standard method for osteoporosis diagnosis and hence also for future\nfracture prediction (prognostic). However, the required special equipment is\nnot broadly available everywhere, in particular not to patients in developing\ncountries. We propose a deep learning classification model (FORM) that can\ndirectly predict hip fracture risk from either plain radiographs (X-ray) or 2D\nprojection images of computed tomography (CT) data.

Most existing approaches use the optical flow, RNNs, or\nCNNs to extract temporal features from videos. Despite the positive results of\nthese attempts, most of them only straightforwardly integrate features along\nthe temporal dimension, ignoring temporal correlations between joints. In\ncontrast to previous methods, we propose a plug-and-play kinematics modeling\nmodule (KMM) based on the domain-cross attention mechanism to model the\ntemporal correlation between joints across different frames explicitly.\nSpecifically, the proposed KMM models the temporal correlation between any two\njoints by calculating their temporal similarity. In this way, KMM can learn the\nmotion cues of each joint. Using the motion cues (temporal domain) and\nhistorical positions of joints (spatial domain), KMM can infer the initial\npositions of joints in the current frame in advance. In addition, we present a\nkinematics modeling network (KIMNet) based on the KMM for obtaining the final\npositions of joints by combining pose features and initial positions of joints.\nBy explicitly modeling temporal correlations between joints, KIMNet can infer\nthe occluded joints at present according to all joints at the previous moment.\nFurthermore, the KMM is achieved through an attention mechanism, which allows\nit to maintain the high resolution of features. Therefore, it can transfer rich\nhistorical pose information to the current frame, which provides effective pose\ninformation for locating occluded joints. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on two standard video-based pose estimation\nbenchmarks.

This paper offers a\nforward-looking, BA-focused review of algorithmic fairness. We first review the\nstate-of-the-art research on sources and measures of bias, as well as bias\nmitigation algorithms. We then provide a detailed discussion of the\nutility-fairness relationship, emphasizing that the frequent assumption of a\ntrade-off between these two constructs is often mistaken or short-sighted.\nFinally, we chart a path forward by identifying opportunities for business\nscholars to address impactful, open challenges that are key to the effective\nand responsible deployment of BA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 10:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

In\nthis study, we analyze FORCs computed by micromagnetic simulations of Co cubes\nwith dimensions of 50, 100 and 150 nm and uniaxial magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy. For the larger cubes we observe the formation of a stable\ntwo-domain state. The nucleation of a reversed domain and its subsequent\nannihilation are clearly visible as separate peaks in the FORC diagram. They\nspread out along the coordinate axis in the FORC diagram, which is associated\nwith the bias field $H_U$ of a Preisach hysteron. Based on our findings, we\nstate that a FORC diagram peak spreading along the $H_U$ axis can have its\norigin in the step-wise magnetization reversal driven by nucleation of domains\nin a single particle. This means that we have identified another mechanism\napart from the well-known magnetostatic interaction between a set of particles\nthat leads to features in the FORC diagram extending along the $H_U$-axis.

Typically, this problem is\ntackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. Unfortunately,\nrecent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the\nfollowing two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the\ninherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered\nmuch later than they are introduced. This misleads classifiers as they learn to\nrecognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. To tackle these\nissues, we propose TROVON, a technique that learns from known vulnerable\ncomponents rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as\ntypically performed. We perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and\ntheir respective fixed components. This way, TROVON manages to learn from the\nthings we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and\nunbalanced data.

The clock is created by a superconducting transmon qubit\ndispersively coupled to an open co-planar resonator.

The\nasteroseismic interpretation revealed the presence of radial differential\nrotation in this massive star of $\\sim$9.35 M . The stellar core is indeed\nestimated to spin $\\sim$3.6 times faster than the surface. The surface rotation\nwas consequently derived as $\\sim$2 km/s. This massive star represents an ideal\ncounter-part to the wealth of space-based photometry results for main-sequence\nand evolved low-mass stars. Those latter have revealed a new, and often\nunexpected, picture of the angular momentum transport processes acting in\nstellar interiors. We investigate in a new way the constraints on the internal\nrotation of HD 129929, focusing on their interpretation for the evolution of\nthe internal rotation during the main sequence of a massive star. We test\nseparately hydrodynamic and magnetic instability transport processes of angular\nmomentum. We used the best asteroseismic model obtained in an earlier work. We\ncalibrated stellar models including rotation, with different transport\nprocesses, to reproduce that reference model. We then looked whether one\nprocess is favoured to reproduce the rotation profile of HD 129929, based on\nthe fit of the asteroseismic multiplets. The impact of the Tayler magnetic\ninstability on the angular momentum transport predicts a ratio of the\ncore-to-surface rotation rate of only 1.6, while the recently revised\nprescription of this mechanism predicts solid-body rotation. Both are too low\nin comparison with the asteroseismic inference. The models with only\nhydrodynamic processes are in good agreement with the asteroseismic\nmeasurements. Strikingly, we can also get a constraint on the profile of\nrotation on the zero age main sequence: likely, the ratio between the core and\nsurface rotation was at least $\\sim$1.7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 12:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Aims: In this\npaper, the THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) and the Fourier-transform IR\nspectroscopy (FTIR) are combined to study optical constants of CO and CO$_2$\nices in the broad THz-IR spectral range. Methods: The measured ices are grown\nat cryogenic temperatures by gas deposition on a cold Si window. A method to\nquantify the broadband THz-IR optical constants of ices is developed based on\nthe direct reconstruction of the complex refractive index of ices in the THz\nrange from the TDS data, and the use of the Kramers-Kronig relation in the IR\nrange for the reconstruction from the FTIR data. Uncertainties of the\nKramers-Kronig relation are eliminated by merging the THz and IR spectra. The\nreconstructed THz-IR response is then analyzed using classical models of\ncomplex dielectric permittivity. Results: The complex refractive index of CO\nand CO$_2$ ices deposited at the temperature of $28$ K is obtained in the range\nof 0.3--12.0 THz.

The model provides algebraic expressions\nfor the local grain-boundary-normal stress and the corresponding uncertainties,\nas a function of the grain-boundary type, its inclination with respect to the\ndirection of external loading and material-elasticity parameters. The knowledge\nof intergranular normal stresses is a necessary prerequisite in any local\ndamage modeling approach, e.g., to predict the intergranular stress-corrosion\ncracking, grain-boundary sliding or fatigue-crack-initiation sites in\nstructural materials.\n  The model is derived in a perturbative manner, starting with the exact\nsolution of a simple setup and later successively refining it to account for\nhigher order complexities of realistic polycrystalline materials. In the\nsimplest scenario, a bicrystal model is embedded in an isotropic elastic medium\nand solved for uniaxial loading conditions, assuming 1D Reuss and Voigt\napproximations on different length scales. In the final iteration, the grain\nboundary becomes a part of a 3D structure consisting of five 1D chains with\narbitrary number of grains and surrounded by an anisotropic elastic medium.\nConstitutive equations can be solved for arbitrary uniform loading, for any\ngrain-boundary type and choice of elastic polycrystalline material.

To solve\nthese problems, we propose RealFlow, an Expectation-Maximization based\nframework that can create large-scale optical flow datasets directly from any\nunlabeled realistic videos. Specifically, we first estimate optical flow\nbetween a pair of video frames, and then synthesize a new image from this pair\nbased on the predicted flow.

In the E-step, RIPR renders new images to create a large quantity of\ntraining data. In the M-step, we utilize the generated training data to train\nan optical flow network, which can be used to estimate optical flows in the\nnext E-step. During the iterative learning steps, the capability of the flow\nnetwork is gradually improved, so is the accuracy of the flow, as well as the\nquality of the synthesized dataset.

Therefore, the patches generated by APR tools need to be validated\nby human programmers, which can be very costly, and prevents APR tools adoption\nin practice.Our work aims at increasing developer trust in automated patch\ngeneration by minimizing the number of plausible patches that they have to\nreview, thereby reducing the time required to find a correct patch.

Specifically, these models\nusually aggregate all layer embeddings for node updating and achieve their best\nrecommendation performance within a few layers because of over-smoothing.\nConversely, if we place learnable weights on layer embeddings for node\nupdating, the weight space will always collapse to a fixed point, at which the\nweighting of the ego layer almost holds all.

Obtaining better fibers\nfor the short-wavelength range has been restricted, in all fiber optics, by\nscattering processes. In hollow-core fibers, the scattering loss arises from\nthe core roughness and represents the limiting factor in reducing their loss\nregardless of the fiber cladding confinement power. To attain fibers performing\nat short wavelengths, it is paramount developing means to minimize the height\nvariations on the fiber microstructure boundaries. Here, we report on the\nreduction of the core surface roughness of hollow-core fibers by modifying\ntheir fabrication technique. In the novel process proposed herein, counter\ndirectional gas fluxes are applied within the fiber holes during fabrication to\nattain an increased shear rate on its microstructure.

However, it has mostly focused on input coming from a single RGB\nimage, overlooking the following important factors: a) Nowadays, the vast\nmajority of facial image data of interest do not originate from single images\nbut rather from videos, which contain rich dynamic information. b) Furthermore,\nthese videos typically capture individuals in some form of verbal communication\n(public talks, teleconferences, audiovisual human-computer interactions,\ninterviews, monologues/dialogues in movies, etc). When existing 3D face\nreconstruction methods are applied in such videos, the artifacts in the\nreconstruction of the shape and motion of the mouth area are often severe,\nsince they do not match well with the speech audio.\n  To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present the first method for\nvisual speech-aware perceptual reconstruction of 3D mouth expressions. We do\nthis by proposing a \"lipread\" loss, which guides the fitting process so that\nthe elicited perception from the 3D reconstructed talking head resembles that\nof the original video footage. We demonstrate that, interestingly, the lipread\nloss is better suited for 3D reconstruction of mouth movements compared to\ntraditional landmark losses, and even direct 3D supervision. Furthermore, the\ndevised method does not rely on any text transcriptions or corresponding audio,\nrendering it ideal for training in unlabeled datasets. We verify the efficiency\nof our method through exhaustive objective evaluations on three large-scale\ndatasets, as well as subjective evaluation with two web-based user studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 14:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Latest techniques rely on deep neural\nnetworks to restore the various structures and textures peculiar to SAR images.\nThe availability of time series of SAR images offers the possibility of\nimproving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over\nthe same area. The supervised training of deep neural networks requires\nground-truth speckle-free images. Such images can only be obtained indirectly\nthrough some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are\nimperfect. Given the potential of very high quality restoration reachable by\nmulti-temporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need\nto be circumvented.

Each product has\ntwo distinct supply modes that may be different suppliers or different\ntransport modes from the same supplier. These supply modes differ in terms of\ntheir carbon emissions, speed, and costs. The company needs to decide when to\nship how much using which supply mode such that total holding, backlog, and\nprocurement costs are minimized while the emissions associated with different\nsupply modes across the assortment remains below a certain target level. Since\nthe optimal policy for this inventory system is highly complex, we assume that\nshipment decisions for each product are governed by a dual-index policy.

The first one is based on Quegan filter and replaces the local\nreflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress\nspeckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the\nform of a \"super-image\", i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series.\nExperimental results on Sentinel-1 GRD data show that these two multi-temporal\nstrategies provide improved filtering results while adding a limited\ncomputational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 14:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

A recent DIC work proposes to generate\ndistinctive captions by comparing the target image with a set of\nsemantic-similar reference images, i.e., reference-based DIC (Ref-DIC). It aims\nto make the generated captions can tell apart the target and reference images.\nUnfortunately, reference images used by existing Ref-DIC works are easy to\ndistinguish: these reference images only resemble the target image at\nscene-level and have few common objects, such that a Ref-DIC model can\ntrivially generate distinctive captions even without considering the reference\nimages. To ensure Ref-DIC models really perceive the unique objects (or\nattributes) in target images, we first propose two new Ref-DIC benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we design a two-stage matching mechanism, which strictly controls\nthe similarity between the target and reference images at object-/attribute-\nlevel (vs. scene-level). Secondly, to generate distinctive captions, we develop\na strong Transformer-based Ref-DIC baseline, dubbed as TransDIC. It not only\nextracts visual features from the target image, but also encodes the\ndifferences between objects in the target and reference images. Finally, for\nmore trustworthy benchmarking, we propose a new evaluation metric named\nDisCIDEr for Ref-DIC, which evaluates both the accuracy and distinctiveness of\nthe generated captions. Experimental results demonstrate that our TransDIC can\ngenerate distinctive captions. Besides, it outperforms several state-of-the-art\nmodels on the two new benchmarks over different metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 14:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

In this paper, we will use\ntime-varying Bayesian optimization (TVBO) to tune controllers online in\nchanging environments using appropriate prior knowledge on the control\nobjective and its changes. Two properties are characteristic of many online\ncontroller tuning problems: First, they exhibit incremental and lasting changes\nin the objective due to changes to the system dynamics, e.g., through wear and\ntear. Second, the optimization problem is convex in the tuning parameters.\nCurrent TVBO methods do not explicitly account for these properties, resulting\nin poor tuning performance and many unstable controllers through\nover-exploration of the parameter space. We propose a novel TVBO forgetting\nstrategy using Uncertainty-Injection (UI), which incorporates the assumption of\nincremental and lasting changes. The control objective is modeled as a\nspatio-temporal Gaussian process (GP) with UI through a Wiener process in the\ntemporal domain. Further, we explicitly model the convexity assumptions in the\nspatial dimension through GP models with linear inequality constraints. In\nnumerical experiments, we show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethod in TVBO, exhibiting reduced regret and fewer unstable parameter\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 14:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Studies have found that reinforcement learning (RL) can\nhelp decide the order-splitting sizes. However, a problem remains unsolved: how\nto place limit orders at appropriate limit prices? The key challenge lies in\nthe \"continuous-discrete duality\" of the action space. On the one hand, the\ncontinuous action space using percentage changes in prices is preferred for\ngeneralization. On the other hand, the trader eventually needs to choose limit\nprices discretely due to the existence of the tick size, which requires\nspecialization for every single stock with different characteristics (e.g., the\nliquidity and the price range). So we need continuous control for\ngeneralization and discrete control for specialization. To this end, we propose\na hybrid RL method to combine the advantages of both of them.

Motivated by these practical needs,\nthis paper studies the price-based network revenue management problem with both\ndemand learning and fairness concern about the consumption across different\nresources. We introduce the regularized revenue, i.e., the total revenue with a\nfairness regularization, as our objective to incorporate fairness into the\nrevenue maximization goal. We propose a primal-dual-type online policy with the\nUpper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) demand learning method to maximize the regularized\nrevenue. We adopt several innovative techniques to make our algorithm a unified\nand computationally efficient framework for the continuous price set and a wide\nclass of fairness regularizers. Our algorithm achieves a worst-case regret of\n$\\tilde O(N^{5/2}\\sqrt{T})$, where $N$ denotes the number of products and $T$\ndenotes the number of time periods. Numerical experiments in a few NRM examples\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for balancing revenue and\nfairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 15:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

This paper aims to illuminate and\nbroaden our understanding of multi-objective optimization from the perspective\nof fairness. To this end, we start with a discussion of user preferences in\nmulti-objective optimization and then explore its relationship to fairness in\nmachine learning and multi-objective optimization. Following the above\ndiscussions, representative cases of fairness-aware multiobjective optimization\nare presented, further elaborating the importance of fairness in traditional\nmulti-objective optimization, data-driven optimization and federated\noptimization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in fairness-aware\nmulti-objective optimization are addressed. We hope that this article makes a\nsmall step forward towards understanding fairness in the context of\noptimization and promote research interest in fairness-aware multi-objective\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 06:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Gene set enrichment analysis aims to identify genes\nthat are over-represented in gene sets collections and might be associated with\na specific phenotypic trait. However, as this involves a massive number of\nhypothesis testing, it is often questionable whether a pre-processing step to\nreduce gene sets collections' sizes is helpful. Moreover, the often highly\noverlapping gene sets and the consequent low interpretability of gene sets'\ncollections demand for a reduction of the included gene sets. Inspired by this\nbioinformatics context, we propose a method to rank sets within a family of\nsets based on the distribution of the singletons and their size. We obtain\nsets' importance scores by computing Shapley values without incurring into the\nusual exponential number of evaluations of the value function. Moreover, we\naddress the challenge of including a redundancy awareness in the rankings\nobtained where, in our case, sets are redundant if they show prominent\nintersections. We finally evaluate our approach for gene sets collections; the\nrankings obtained show low redundancy and high coverage of the genes. The\nunsupervised nature of the proposed ranking does not allow for an evident\nincrease in the number of significant gene sets for specific phenotypic traits\nwhen reducing the size of the collections. However, we believe that the\nrankings proposed are of use in bioinformatics to increase interpretability of\nthe gene sets collections and a step forward to include redundancy into Shapley\nvalues computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 08:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The evaluation on real-world datasets of\nFreebase, Yago and NELL shows that the V-Coder is not only able to recover\nlinks from corrupted input data, but also shows that the semantic disclosure of\nrelations in a KG show the tendency to improve link prediction.

We\nhave obtained an average reduction of 11.9% in forecasting Root-Mean Square\nError (RMSE) and 38.7% in bias with our approach. We also obtained an increase\nof Agreement (IOA) in 10 of the 14 combinations of forecasted variables and\nstations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 04:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

However, NAS methods are often complex and\ntend to converge to local minima as soon as generated architectures seem to\nyield good results. This paper proposes GEA, a novel approach for guided NAS.\nGEA guides the evolution by exploring the search space by generating and\nevaluating several architectures in each generation at initialisation stage\nusing a zero-proxy estimator, where only the highest-scoring architecture is\ntrained and kept for the next generation. Subsequently, GEA continuously\nextracts knowledge about the search space without increased complexity by\ngenerating several off-springs from an existing architecture at each\ngeneration. More, GEA forces exploitation of the most performant architectures\nby descendant generation while simultaneously driving exploration through\nparent mutation and favouring younger architectures to the detriment of older\nones. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, and extensive ablation studies evaluate the importance of different\nparameters. Results show that GEA achieves state-of-the-art results on all data\nsets of NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 10:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Second, an\nalgorithm is developed to extract a pitch profile from the road height profile\ndata. The ideal pitch profile is vehicle-independent and only depends on the\nroad. This pitch profile generated from an on-board computer is matched with a\nknown terrain map to achieve real-time positioning. Third, a crowd-sourced map\ncreation algorithm is developed to create and improve the terrain map that\ncontains pitch profile.

Due to limited sensing\nrange of onboard sensors, a merging vehicle can hardly observe main road\nconditions and merge properly. By leveraging the wireless communications\nbetween connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), a merging CAV has potential to\nproactively obtain the intentions of nearby vehicles. However, CAVs can be\nprone to inaccurate observations, such as the noisy basic safety messages (BSM)\nand poor quality surveillance images. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach for Robust on-ramp merge of CAVs via Augmented and Multi-modal\nReinforcement Learning, named by RAMRL. Specifically, we formulate the on-ramp\nmerging problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) by taking driving safety,\ncomfort driving behavior, and traffic efficiency into account. To provide\nreliable merging maneuvers, we simultaneously leverage BSM and surveillance\nimages for multi-modal observation, which is used to learn a policy model\nthrough proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, to improve data\nefficiency and provide better generalization performance, we train the policy\nmodel with augmented data (e.g., noisy BSM and noisy surveillance images).\nExtensive experiments are conducted with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)\nplatform under two typical merging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our robust on-ramp merging design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 16:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Descriptive analysis of spot house price\nestimates, including contemporaneous price uncertainty and 30-day price change\nfor individual properties listed on the online real-estate platform Zillow.com,\ntogether facilitate quantifying both the excess valuation and valuation\nconfidence attributable to this global socio-economic shock. Our\nquasi-experimental pre-/post-COVID-19 design spans several years around 2020\nand leverages contemporaneous price estimates of rental properties - i.e., real\nestate entering the habitation market, just not for purchase and hence free of\nspeculation - as an appropriate counterfactual to properties listed for sale.\nCombining unit-level matching and difference-in-difference approaches, we\nestimate that properties listed for sale after the pandemic featured an excess\nmonthly price growth of roughly 1 percentage points, corresponding to an excess\nannual price growth of roughly 12.7 percentage points, which accounts for more\nthan half of the annual growth observed across those regions in 2021.\nSimultaneously, uncertainty in price estimates decreased, signaling the\nirrational confidence characteristic of prior asset bubbles.

It is rather obvious\nthat if the sun were enclosed inside a thermally conducting sphere surrounded\nby a heat bath kept much hotter than the present central temperature of the\nsun, its nuclear burning would occur faster, so that the sun would last for a\nshorter time. It is less obvious that if the sun were surrounded by a perfectly\nreflecting sphere to prevent its radiation from escaping to cold empty space,\nit could actually last longer. Here I shall show that this is the case for such\na sphere at least somewhat larger than the present solar radius. This naively\nparadoxical result is a consequence of the negative specific heat of many\ngravitating systems, so as the energy emitted by the sun is reflected back to\nincrease the thermal energy, the sun expands and its central temperature goes\ndown rather than up and reduces the nuclear burning rate, so that the sun can\nlast much longer than five billion years, for a lifetime growing roughly\nexponentially with the cube root of the radius of the perfectly reflecting\nsphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}
