Such\nan effect, which has been observed in different physical settings, raised a\nlively debate and some controversies, owing to the correct definition and\ninterpretation of tunneling times and the apparent superluminal transmission. A\nrather open question is whether (and under which conditions) the Hartman effect\npersists for inelastic scattering, i.e. when the potential becomes\nnon-Hermitian and the scattering matrix is not unitary. Here we consider\ntunneling through a heterojunction barrier in the tight-binding picture, where\nthe barrier consists of a generally non-Hermitian finite-sized lattice attached\nto two semi-infinite nearest-neighbor Hermitian lattice leads. We derive a\nsimple and general condition for the persistence of the Hartman effect in\nnon-Hermitian barriers, showing that it can be found rather generally when\nnon-Hermiticity arises from non-reciprocal couplings, i.e. when the barrier\ndisplays the non-Hermitian skin effect, without any special symmetry in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

We present (1) the MATLAB HPC\ncompiler HPC.m, which greatly simplifies the building of parallel high\nperformance applications and (2) parallel algorithms for the 3D simulation of\nstrongly nonlinear processes as mechanical and reactive porosity waves. To\nsimulate mechanical porosity waves we employ a massively parallel algorithm\nthat permits to resolve the deformation of fluid-filled viscoelastic porous\nmedia in 3D. The utilized mathematical model is based on Biot's poroelastic\ntheory, extended to account for viscous deformation and plastic yielding. The\nmodelling results exhibit the impact of decompaction weakening on the formation\nof three-dimensional solitary-wave-like moving porosity channels. To simulate\nreactive porosity waves we use a solver for 3D deformation of fluid-filled\nreactive viscous porous media. The Damk\\\"ohler number (Da) of the simulations\nis varied in order to estimate the respective roles of viscous deformation (low\nDa) and reaction (high Da) on wave propagation. 3D waves are found to propagate\nindependently of their source at constant speed by going through each other for\nall the investigated Da. Soliton-like wave propagation as a result of\nmetamorphic reaction provides an efficient mechanism for fluid flow in the\nEarth's crust. We illustrate the great performance and versatility of HPC.m by\ndeploying it to generate solvers for a variety of physics across multiple Earth\nScience disciplines. All solvers run close to hardware's peak performance and\nwere shown to scale linearly on a institute cluster with 80 GPUs. Moreover, our\nnonlinear poroviscoelastic two-phase flow solver scales close to ideally on Piz\nDaint's 5000 GPUs at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

This regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN given that it is\nless affected by temperature and dust extinction, traces higher ionic species\nand can also provide robust estimations of the chemical abundance ratio N/O. We\npresent a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology to estimate chemical\nabundances from IR emission lines in AGN.

The estimations of the chemical abundances based on IR lines in our\nsample are later compared with the corresponding abundances derived from the\noptical emission lines in the same objects. HII-CHI-Mistry-IR takes advantage\nof photoionization models, characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H\nand N/O and the ionization parameter $U$, to compare their predicted\nemission-line fluxes with a set of observed values. Instead of matching single\nemission lines, the code uses some specific emission-line ratios sensitive to\nthe above free parameters. We report mainly solar and also subsolar abundances\nfor O/H in the nuclear region for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters\naround solar values. We find a discrepancy between the chemical abundances\nderived from IR and optical emission lines, being the latter higher than the\nformer. This discrepancy, also reported by previous studies of the composition\nof the ISM in AGN from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or\nthe incident radiation field to the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

While clinical data have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of selected TCM-based treatments, the mechanistic root of how TCM\nherbs treat diseases remains largely unknown. More importantly, current\napproaches focus on single herbs or prescriptions, missing the high-level\ngeneral principles of TCM. To uncover the mechanistic nature of TCM on a system\nlevel, in this work we establish a generic network medicine framework for TCM\nfrom the human protein interactome. Applying our framework reveals a network\npattern between symptoms (diseases) and herbs in TCM. We first observe that\ngenes associated with a symptom are not distributed randomly in the\ninteractome, but cluster into localized modules; furthermore, a short network\ndistance between two symptom modules is indicative of the symptoms'\nco-occurrence and similarity. Next, we show that the network proximity of a\nherb's targets to a symptom module is predictive of the herb's effectiveness in\ntreating the symptom. We validate our framework with real-world hospital\npatient data by showing that (1) shorter network distance between symptoms of\ninpatients correlates with higher relative risk (co-occurrence), and (2)\nherb-symptom network proximity is indicative of patients' symptom recovery rate\nafter herbal treatment. Finally, we identified novel herb-symptom pairs in\nwhich the herb's effectiveness in treating the symptom is predicted by network\nand confirmed in hospital data, but previously unknown to the TCM community.\nThese predictions highlight our framework's potential in creating herb\ndiscovery or repurposing opportunities.

While the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm is\nvastly discussed in the literature, little attention has been given to the\nrobustness of such centralised implementation, such as the provision of\nredundant control solutions during a communication failure. This paper aims to\nimplement a machine learning-based algorithm at each Intelligent Electronic\nDevice (IED) that mimics the centralised OPF used during communication failures\nusing IEC 61850 data models. Under normal circumstances, the IEDs communicate\nfor centralised OPF. In addition, the system is trained offline for all\noperational conditions and the individual look-up tables linking the actual\nvoltages to the DER setpoints are sent to the respective controllers. The\nregression models allow for the local reconstruction of the DER setpoints,\nemulating the overall OPF, in case of a communication failure. In addition to\nthe regression control, the paper also explains an offline learning approach\nfor periodic re-training of the regression models. The implementation is\nexperimentally verified using a Hardware-in-the-loop test setup. The tests\nshowed promising results compared to conventional control strategies during\ncommunication failures. When properly trained and coordinated, such an\nintuitive local control approach for each DER could be very beneficial for the\nbulk power system. This machine learning-based approach could also replace the\nexisting Q(V) control strategies, to better support the bulk power system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

While many researchers have elaborately\ndesigned various pooling variants in spatial domain to handle these limitations\nwith much progress, the temporal aspect is rarely visited where directly\napplying hand-crafted methods or these specialized spatial variants may not be\noptimal. In this paper, we derive temporal lift pooling (TLP) from the Lifting\nScheme in signal processing to intelligently downsample features of different\ntemporal hierarchies. The Lifting Scheme factorizes input signals into various\nsub-bands with different frequency, which can be viewed as different temporal\nmovement patterns. Our TLP is a three-stage procedure, which performs signal\ndecomposition, component weighting and information fusion to generate a refined\ndownsized feature map. We select a typical temporal task with long sequences,\ni.e. continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), as our testbed to verify the\neffectiveness of TLP. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show TLP\noutperforms hand-crafted methods and specialized spatial variants by a large\nmargin (1.5%) with similar computational overhead. As a robust feature\nextractor, TLP exhibits great generalizability upon multiple backbones on\nvarious datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two large-scale\nCSLR datasets. Visualizations further demonstrate the mechanism of TLP in\ncorrecting gloss borders.

In this\npaper, we present a novel one-shot generative domain adaption method, i.e.,\nDiFa, for diverse generation and faithful adaptation. For global-level\nadaptation, we leverage the difference between the CLIP embedding of reference\nimage and the mean embedding of source images to constrain the target\ngenerator.

Moreover, the time overhead of\nthe traditional sensing algorithm is prohibitive for practical systems. In this\npaper, instead of alleviating the wideband beam squint effect, we take\nadvantage of joint beam squint and beam split effect and propose a novel user\ndirections sensing method integrated with massive MIMO orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, with the beam squint\neffect, the BS utilizes the true-time-delay (TTD) lines to steer the beams of\ndifferent OFDM subcarriers towards different directions simultaneously.

However, these synthetic\nsamples are always unnatural and error-prone. To avoid this issue, a recent DA\nwork composes new augmented samples by randomly pairing pristine images and\nother human-written questions. Unfortunately, to guarantee augmented samples\nhave reasonable ground-truth answers, they manually design a set of heuristic\nrules for several question types, which extremely limits its generalization\nabilities.

In particular, the package includes\nmainly three lines of techniques, among which the following two are already the\nstandard implementations in popular boosted tree platforms:\n  (i) The histogram-based (feature-binning) approach makes the tree\nimplementation convenient and efficient. In Li et al (2007), a simple\nfixed-length adaptive binning algorithm was developed. In this report, we\ndemonstrate that such a simple algorithm is still surprisingly effective\ncompared to more sophisticated variants in popular tree platforms.\n  (ii) The explicit gain formula in Li (20010) for tree splitting based on\nsecond-order derivatives of the loss function typically improves, often\nconsiderably, over the first-order methods. Although the gain formula in Li\n(2010) was derived for logistic regression loss, it is a generic formula for\nloss functions with second-derivatives. For example, the open-source package\nalso includes $L_p$ regression for $p\\geq 1$.\n  The main contribution of this package is the ABC-Boost (adaptive base class\nboosting) for multi-class classification. The initial work in Li (2008) derived\na new set of derivatives of the classical multi-class logistic regression by\nspecifying a \"base class\". The accuracy can be substantially improved if the\nbase class is chosen properly. The major technical challenge is to design a\nsearch strategy to select the base class. The prior published works implemented\nan exhaustive search procedure to find the base class which is computationally\ntoo expensive. Recently, a new report (Li and Zhao, 20022) presents a unified\nframework of \"Fast ABC-Boost\" which allows users to efficiently choose the\nproper search space for the base class.\n  The package provides interfaces for linux, windows, mac, matlab, R, python.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 17:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

A modulo operation prior to sampling can be used to\nenhance the effective dynamic range of the ADC. Further, sampling rate of ADC\ntoo plays a crucial role and it is desirable to reduce it.\nFinite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signal model, which is ubiquitous in many\napplications, can be used to reduce the sampling rate. In the context of modulo\nfolding for FRI sampling, existing works operate at a very high sampling rate\ncompared to the rate of innovation (RoI) and require a large number of samples\ncompared to the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the FRI signal. Moreover, these\napproaches use infinite length filters that are practically infeasible. We\nconsider the FRI sampling problem with a compactly supported kernel under the\nmodulo framework. We derive theoretical guarantees and show that FRI signals\ncould be uniquely identified by sampling above the RoI. The number of samples\nfor identifiability is equal to the DoF.

We collect ISM metal column densities from\nabsorption-line spectroscopy in the literature, and in addition, we determine\nTi and Ni column densities from a sample of 70 damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers\n(DLAs) towards quasars, observed with UVES/VLT.

We observe linear relations between the depletion of each metal and\nthe strength of dust depletion, which we trace with the observed [Zn/Fe]. In\nthe neutral ISM of the MCs we find small deviations from linearity observed as\nan overabundance of the $\\alpha$-elements Ti, Mg, S and an underabundance of\nMn. The deviations disappear if we assume that all OB stars observed towards\nthe MCs in our sample have an $\\alpha$-element enhancement and Mn\nunderabundance. This may imply that the MCs have been recently enriched in\n$\\alpha$-elements, potentially due to recent bursts of star formation. The\nobserved strong correlations of the depletion sequences of the metals all the\nway from low metallicity QSO-DLAs to the Milky Way suggest that cosmic dust has\na common origin, independently of the star formation history, which varies\nsignificantly between these different galaxies. This supports the importance of\ngrain growth in the ISM as a significant process of dust production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 07:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

A more recent protocol to achieve\nconstant-space-overhead FTQC using quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC)\ncodes thus attracts considerable attention but suffers from another drawback:\nit incurs polynomially long time overhead. To address these problems, we here\nintroduce an alternative approach using a concatenation of multiple small-size\nquantum codes for the constant-space-overhead FTQC rather than a single\nlarge-size quantum LDPC code. We develop techniques for concatenating different\nquantum Hamming codes with growing sizes.

The inclination and extreme flaring of the disk make Elias\n2-27 an ideal target to study the vertical distribution of molecules,\nparticularly CN. We directly trace the emission of CN in Elias 2-27 and compare\nit to previously published CO isotopologue data. CN $N = 3-2$ emission is\nanalyzed in two different transitions $J = 7/2 - 5/2$ and $J = 5/2 - 3/2$, for\nwhich we detect two hyperfine group transitions. The vertical location of CN\nemission is traced directly from the channel maps, following geometrical\nmethods that have been previously used to analyze the CO emission of Elias\n2-27. Analytical models are used to parametrize the vertical profile of each\nmolecule and study the extent of each tracer, additionally we compute radial\nprofiles of column density and optical depth. We show that the vertical\nlocation of CN and CO isotopologues in Elias 2-27 is layered and consistent\nwith predictions from thermochemical models. A north/south asymmetry in the\nradial extent of CN is detected and we find that the CN emission is mostly\noptically thin and constrained vertically to a thin slab at $z/r \\sim$0.5.

In Elias 2-27, CN traces a\nvertically elevated region above the midplane, very similar to that traced by\n$^{12}$CO. The inferred CN properties are consistent with thermo-chemical disk\nmodels, in which CN formation is initiated by the reaction of N with UV-pumped\nH$_2$. The observed north/south asymmetry may be caused by either ongoing\ninfall or by a warped inner disk.

Phys., 229: 3091--3120,\n2010], the Zhang--Shu framework has attracted extensive attention and motivated\nmany bound-preserving (BP) high-order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume\nschemes for various hyperbolic equations. A key ingredient in the framework is\nthe decomposition of the cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex\ncombination of the solution values at certain quadrature points, which helps to\nrewrite high-order schemes as convex combinations of formally first-order\nschemes. The classic convex decomposition originally proposed by Zhang and Shu\nhas been widely used over the past decade. It was verified, only for the 1D\nquadratic and cubic polynomial spaces, that the classic decomposition is\noptimal in the sense of achieving the mildest BP CFL condition. Yet, it\nremained unclear whether the classic decomposition is optimal in multiple\ndimensions. In this paper, we find that the classic multidimensional\ndecomposition based on the tensor product of Gauss--Lobatto and Gauss\nquadratures is generally not optimal, and we discover a novel alternative\ndecomposition for the 2D and 3D polynomial spaces of total degree up to 2 and\n3, respectively, on Cartesian meshes. Our new decomposition allows a larger BP\ntime step-size than the classic one, and moreover, it is rigorously proved to\nbe optimal to attain the mildest BP CFL condition, yet requires much fewer\nnodes. The discovery of such an optimal convex decomposition is highly\nnontrivial yet meaningful, as it may lead to an improvement of high-order BP\nschemes for a large class of hyperbolic or convection-dominated equations, at\nthe cost of only a slight and local modification to the implementation code.\nSeveral numerical examples are provided to further validate the advantages of\nusing our optimal decomposition over the classic one in terms of efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 18:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, initial FAT encounters\ncatastrophic overfitting, i.e.,the robust accuracy against adversarial attacks\nsuddenly and dramatically decreases. Though several FAT variants spare no\neffort to prevent overfitting, they sacrifice much calculation cost. In this\npaper, we explore the difference between the training processes of SAT and FAT\nand observe that the attack success rate of adversarial examples (AEs) of FAT\ngets worse gradually in the late training stage, resulting in overfitting. The\nAEs are generated by the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) with a zero or random\ninitialization. Based on the observation, we propose a prior-guided FGSM\ninitialization method to avoid overfitting after investigating several\ninitialization strategies, improving the quality of the AEs during the whole\ntraining process. The initialization is formed by leveraging historically\ngenerated AEs without additional calculation cost. We further provide a\ntheoretical analysis for the proposed initialization method.

In this paper, we address this issue by seeking compensation from\ntarget domain prior knowledge, which is often (partially) available in\npractice, e.g., from human expertise. This leads to a novel yet practical\nsetting where in addition to the training data, some prior knowledge about the\ntarget class distribution are available. We term the setting as\nKnowledge-guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (KUDA). In particular, we\nconsider two specific types of prior knowledge about the class distribution in\nthe target domain: Unary Bound that describes the lower and upper bounds of\nindividual class probabilities, and Binary Relationship that describes the\nrelations between two class probabilities. We propose a general rectification\nmodule that uses such prior knowledge to refine model generated pseudo labels.\nThe module is formulated as a Zero-One Programming problem derived from the\nprior knowledge and a smooth regularizer. It can be easily plugged into\nself-training based UDA methods, and we combine it with two state-of-the-art\nmethods, SHOT and DINE. Empirical results on four benchmarks confirm that the\nrectification module clearly improves the quality of pseudo labels, which in\nturn benefits the self-training stage. With the guidance from prior knowledge,\nthe performances of both methods are substantially boosted. We expect our work\nto inspire further investigations in integrating prior knowledge in UDA.

If\nthe system is of size $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\\epsilon>0$ (the\nintensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the\nextinction time finite almost surely.

Current neural representations can be categorized\nas either overfitting to a single object instance, or representing a collection\nof objects. However, neither allows accurate editing of neural scene\nrepresentations: on the one hand, methods that overfit objects achieve highly\naccurate reconstructions, but do not generalize to unseen object configurations\nand thus cannot support editing; on the other hand, methods that represent a\nfamily of objects with variations do generalize but produce only approximate\nreconstructions. We propose NEUFORM to combine the advantages of both\noverfitted and generalizable representations by adaptively using the one most\nappropriate for each shape region: the overfitted representation where reliable\ndata is available, and the generalizable representation everywhere else. We\nachieve this with a carefully designed architecture and an approach that blends\nthe network weights of the two representations, avoiding seams and other\nartifacts. We demonstrate edits that successfully reconfigure parts of\nhuman-designed shapes, such as chairs, tables, and lamps, while preserving\nsemantic integrity and the accuracy of an overfitted shape representation. We\ncompare with two state-of-the-art competitors and demonstrate clear\nimprovements in terms of plausibility and fidelity of the resultant edits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Multiple-epoch observations needed for exoplanet\ndetection are used to decrease the effects of telluric contamination in 12C/13C\nmeasurements. Due to the prevalence of upper limits, the Li abundance pattern\nis complicated to interpret, but the comparison between RGB and core-He burning\ngiants shows effects of extra-mixing consistent with thermohaline. The most\nLi-enriched giant in the sample, classified as a RGB star close to the RGB\nbump, has low 12C/13C. Given that the 12C/13C should not be affected by planet\nengulfment, this does not seem to be the source of the high Li. There is a\ndecreasing correlation between mass and 12C/13C in the RGB and an increasing\ncorrelation in the horizontal branch, which, once again, is consistent with\nthermohaline mixing.

In this scheme, the\nnonlinear thermoelectric effect, predicted and observed in SIS' junctions is\nnot affected by the competitive effect of the Josephson coupling. From a\nfundamental perspective, the most intriguing feature of this effect is its\nbipolarity. The capability to open and control the BLG gap guarantees improved\nthermoelectric performances, that reach up to 1 mV/K regarding the Seebeck\ncoefficient and a power density of 1 nW/$\\mu$m$^2$ for temperature gradients of\ntens of Kelvins. Furthermore, the externally controlled gating can also dope\nthe BLG, which is otherwise intrinsically PH symmetric, giving us the\nopportunity to investigate the bipolar thermoelectricity even in presence of a\ncontrolled suppression of the PH symmetry. The predicted robustness of this\nsystem could foster further experimental investigations and applications in the\nnear future, thanks to the available techniques of nano-fabrication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 19:54:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 10:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 18:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

One way to develop new\nunderstanding in graph coloring is to study special subclasses of graphs. For\ninstance, Blum studied the 3-coloring of random graphs, and Arora and Ge\nstudied the 3-coloring of graphs with low threshold-rank.\n  In this work, we study graphs which arise from a tensor product, which appear\nto be novel instances of the 3-coloring problem.

Tasks such as object classification are invariant to 3D rotations\nand other such as pose estimation are equivariant.

The only $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$-equivariant models\nthat currently exist require point cloud or voxel input rather than 2D images.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on icosahedral group\nconvolutions that reasons in $\\mathrm{SO(3)}$ by learning a projection of the\ninput image onto an icosahedron. The resulting model is approximately\nequivariant to rotation in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$.

However, their operation and degree of light control is\nmuch more limited than metasurfaces. Metasurfaces integrated on top of guided\nwave photonic systems have been explored to control the scattering of light\noff-chip with enhanced functionalities - namely, point-by-point manipulation of\namplitude, phase or polarization. However, these efforts have so far been\nlimited to controlling one or two optical degrees of freedom at best, and to\ndevice configurations much more complex compared to conventional grating\ncouplers.

The recent\nsuccess of supervised learning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in\nsolving image reconstruction problems suggests that it could be a fruitful\napproach to designing regularizers. Towards this end, we propose to denoise\nsignals using a variational formulation with a parametric, sparsity-promoting\nregularizer, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize\nthe mean squared error of reconstructions on a training set of ground truth\nimage and measurement pairs.

However, depth prediction\nresults are not satisfying in indoor scenes where most of the existing data are\ncaptured with hand-held devices. As compared to outdoor environments,\nestimating depth of monocular videos for indoor environments, using\nself-supervised methods, results in two additional challenges: (i) the depth\nrange of indoor video sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it\ndifficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues for training;\n(ii) the indoor sequences recorded with handheld devices often contain much\nmore rotational motions, which cause difficulties for the pose network to\npredict accurate relative camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework-MonoIndoor++ by giving special considerations to those challenges and\nconsolidating a set of good practices for improving the performance of\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation for indoor environments. First, a\ndepth factorization module with transformer-based scale regression network is\nproposed to estimate a global depth scale factor explicitly, and the predicted\nscale factor can indicate the maximum depth values. Second, rather than using a\nsingle-stage pose estimation strategy as in previous methods, we propose to\nutilize a residual pose estimation module to estimate relative camera poses\nacross consecutive frames iteratively. Third, to incorporate extensive\ncoordinates guidance for our residual pose estimation module, we propose to\nperform coordinate convolutional encoding directly over the inputs to pose\nnetworks. The proposed method is validated on a variety of benchmark indoor\ndatasets, i.e., EuRoC MAV, NYUv2, ScanNet and 7-Scenes, demonstrating the\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 21:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of\nthe video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and\nlast increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal\ncorrelation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this\nprocess. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial)\nresolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized.

The mechanism causing the\nactivity is still debated, and the suggested mechanisms lack clear supporting\nevidence. Phaethon has been identified as the likely parent body of the annual\nGeminid meteor shower, making it one of the few active asteroids associated\nwith a meteoroid stream. Its low albedo and B-type reflectance spectrum\nindicates that Phaethon's composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite\nmeteorites, but a connection to a specific meteorite group is ambiguous due to\nthe lack of diagnostic absorption features. In this study, we analyze the\nmid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it is closely\nassociated with the Yamato-group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY\nchondrites represent primitive carbonaceous material that experienced early\naqueous alteration and subsequent late-stage thermal metamorphism.

We then apply an existing\nprobabilistic trade-off analysis tool to find the set of all optimal trade-offs\nbetween resource consumption and task performance.

In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the\nsize of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle,\nused further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of\nthe iris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to\nbe nonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial\npaths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on the\nbiomechanics of iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep\nautoencoder-based model that can effectively learn complex movements of iris\ntexture features directly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs,\n(a) an ISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b)\nthe binary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the\nnecessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of the\niris in an image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The\nidentity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding\ndeformations that preserve identity and not only the visual realism of the\ngenerated samples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this\nmodel: better compensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition\nalgorithms, compared to linear models, and the creation of a generative\nalgorithm that can aid human forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris\nimages with a large difference in pupil dilation.

Previous studies of\nLHCD using non-Maxwellian full-wave/FP simulations have been performed, but\nthese simulations were not self-consistent and enforced power conservation\nbetween the FP and full-wave code using a numerical rescaling factor. Here we\nhave created a fully-self consistent full-wave/FP model for LHCD that is\nautomatically power conserving.

We performed converged full-wave/FP\nsimulations of Alcator C-Mod discharges and compared them to raytracing. We\nfound that excellent agreement in the power deposition profiles from raytracing\nand TORLH could be obtained, however, TORLH had somewhat lower current drive\nefficiency and broader power deposition profiles in some cases. This\ndiscrepancy appears to be a result of numerical limitations present in the\nTORLH model and a small amount of diffractional broadening of the TORLH wave\nspectrum.

Furthermore, engineers\nrequire fault localization solutions to be actionable and interpretable, which\nexisting research approaches cannot satisfy. Therefore, the common industry\npractice is that, for a specific online service system, its experienced\nengineers focus on localization for recurring failures based on the knowledge\naccumulated about the system and historical failures. Although the above common\npractice is actionable and interpretable, it is largely manual, thus slow and\nsometimes inaccurate. In this paper, we aim to automate this practice through\nmachine learning. That is, we propose an actionable and interpretable fault\nlocalization approach, DejaVu, for recurring failures in online service\nsystems. For a specific online service system, DejaVu takes historical failures\nand dependencies in the system as input and trains a localization model\noffline; for an incoming failure, the trained model online recommends where the\nfailure occurs (i.e., the faulty components) and which kind of failure occurs\n(i.e., the indicative group of metrics) (thus actionable), which are further\ninterpreted by both global and local interpretation methods (thus\ninterpretable). Based on the evaluation on 601 failures from three production\nsystems and one open-source benchmark, in less than one second, DejaVu can on\naverage rank the ground truths at 1.66-th to 5.03-th among a long candidate\nlist, outperforming baselines by at least 51.51%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 01:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 01:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 03:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However,\nthrough our theoretical analysis, we find that for long-tailed data, it fails\nto form a regular simplex which is an ideal geometric configuration for\nrepresentation learning. To correct the optimization behavior of SCL and\nfurther improve the performance of long-tailed visual recognition, we propose a\nnovel loss for balanced contrastive learning (BCL). Compared with SCL, we have\ntwo improvements in BCL: class-averaging, which balances the gradient\ncontribution of negative classes; class-complement, which allows all classes to\nappear in every mini-batch. The proposed balanced contrastive learning (BCL)\nmethod satisfies the condition of forming a regular simplex and assists the\noptimization of cross-entropy. Equipped with BCL, the proposed two-branch\nframework can obtain a stronger feature representation and achieve competitive\nperformance on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT,\nCIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

The challenge of this task is\nthat the model is required not only to learn a discriminative classifier to\nclassify the pre-defined classes with few training data but also to reject\ninputs from unseen classes that never appear at training time. In this paper,\nwe propose to solve the problem from two novel aspects. First, instead of\nlearning the decision boundaries between seen classes, as is done in standard\nclose-set classification, we reserve space for unseen classes, such that images\nlocated in these areas are recognized as the unseen classes. Second, to\neffectively learn such decision boundaries, we propose to utilize the\nbackground features from seen classes. As these background regions do not\nsignificantly contribute to the decision of close-set classification, it is\nnatural to use them as the pseudo unseen classes for classifier learning.

It builds an\ninterpretable and robust model by selecting the features that contribute the\nmost to the prediction target. However, most mature feature selection\nalgorithms, including supervised and semi-supervised, fail to fully exploit the\ncomplex potential structure between features. We believe that these structures\nare very important for the feature selection process, especially when labels\nare lacking and data is noisy.\n  To this end, we innovatively introduce a deep learning-based self-supervised\nmechanism into feature selection problems, namely batch-Attention-based\nSelf-supervision Feature Selection(A-SFS). Firstly, a multi-task\nself-supervised autoencoder is designed to uncover the hidden structure among\nfeatures with the support of two pretext tasks. Guided by the integrated\ninformation from the multi-self-supervised learning model, a batch-attention\nmechanism is designed to generate feature weights according to batch-based\nfeature selection patterns to alleviate the impacts introduced by a handful of\nnoisy data. This method is compared to 14 major strong benchmarks, including\nLightGBM and XGBoost. Experimental results show that A-SFS achieves the highest\naccuracy in most datasets. Furthermore, this design significantly reduces the\nreliance on labels, with only 1/10 labeled data needed to achieve the same\nperformance as those state of art baselines.

Firstly, since the methods used for\nperforming authorship analysis imply that an author can be recognized by the\ncontent he or she creates, we were interested in finding out whether it would\nbe possible for an author identification system to correctly attribute works to\nauthors if in the course of years they have undergone a major psychological\ntransition. Secondly, and from the point of view of the evolution of an\nauthor's ethical values, we checked what it would mean if the authorship\nattribution system encounters difficulties in detecting single authorship. We\nset out to answer those questions through performing a binary authorship\nanalysis task using a text classifier based on a pre-trained transformer model\nand a baseline method relying on conventional similarity metrics. For the test\nset, we chose works of Arata Osada, a Japanese educator and specialist in the\nhistory of education, with half of them being books written before the World\nWar II and another half in the 1950s, in between which he underwent a\ntransformation in terms of political opinions. As a result, we were able to\nconfirm that in the case of texts authored by Arata Osada in a time span of\nmore than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin\nand is substantially lower than for texts by other non-fiction writers,\nconfidence scores of the predictions remain at a similar level as in the case\nof a shorter time span, indicating that the classifier was in many instances\ntricked into deciding that texts written over a time span of multiple years\nwere actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to\nbelieve that such a change can affect authorship analysis, and that historical\nevents have great impact on a person's ethical outlook as expressed in their\nwritings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 05:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

We provide a comprehensive and rigorous privacy\nanalysis of VLR in a class of open-source Federated Learning frameworks, where\nthe protocols might differ between one another, yet a procedure of obtaining\nlocal gradients is implicitly shared. We first consider the honest-but-curious\nthreat model, in which the detailed implementation of protocol is neglected and\nonly the shared procedure is assumed, which we abstract as an oracle. We find\nthat even under this general setting, single-dimension feature and label can\nstill be recovered from the other party under suitable constraints of batch\nsize, thus demonstrating the potential vulnerability of all frameworks\nfollowing the same philosophy. Then we look into a popular instantiation of the\nprotocol based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE). We propose an active attack that\nsignificantly weaken the constraints on batch size in the previous analysis via\ngenerating and compressing auxiliary ciphertext. To address the privacy leakage\nwithin the HE-based protocol, we develop a simple-yet-effective countermeasure\nbased on Differential Privacy (DP), and provide both utility and privacy\nguarantees for the updated algorithm. Finally, we empirically verify the\neffectiveness of our attack and defense on benchmark datasets. Altogether, our\nfindings suggest that all vertical federated learning frameworks that solely\ndepend on HE might contain severe privacy risks, and DP, which has already\ndemonstrated its power in horizontal federated learning, can also play a\ncrucial role in the vertical setting, especially when coupled with HE or secure\nmulti-party computation (MPC) techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 05:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The TAD game consists of an attacker and a\ncooperative target-defender pair. The attacker's objective is to capture the\ntarget, whereas the target-defender team acts together such that the defender\ncan intercept the attacker and ensure target survival. We assume that the\ncooperative target-defender pair do not have perfect knowledge of the attacker\nstates, and hence the states are estimated using an Extended Kalman Filter\n(EKF). The capture analysis based on the Apollonius circles is performed to\nidentify the target survival regions. The efficacy of the NMPC-based solution\nis evaluated through extensive numerical simulations. The results show that the\nNMPC-based solution offers robustness to the different unknown attacker models\nand has better performance than CLOS and A-CLOS based strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 09:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

To tackle this\nchallenge, we present a robust dense indirect structure-from-motion method for\nvideos that is based on dense correspondence initialized from pairwise optical\nflow. Our key idea is to optimize long-range video correspondence as dense\npoint trajectories and use it to learn robust estimation of motion\nsegmentation. A novel neural network architecture is proposed for processing\nirregular point trajectory data. Camera poses are then estimated and optimized\nwith global bundle adjustment over the portion of long-range point trajectories\nthat are classified as static. Experiments on MPI Sintel dataset show that our\nsystem produces significantly more accurate camera trajectories compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our method is able to retain\nreasonable accuracy of camera poses on fully static scenes, which consistently\noutperforms strong state-of-the-art dense correspondence based methods with\nend-to-end deep learning, demonstrating the potential of dense indirect methods\nbased on optical flow and point trajectories.

TNW-CATE uses the\nNadaraya-Watson regression for predicting outcomes of patients from the control\nand treatment groups. The main idea behind TNW-CATE is to train kernels of the\nNadaraya-Watson regression by using a weight sharing neural network of a\nspecific form.

Flow embedding is a commonly used technique\nin scene flow estimation, and it encodes the point motion between two\nconsecutive frames. Thus, it is critical for the flow embeddings to capture the\ncorrect overall direction of the motion. However, previous works only search\nlocally to determine a soft correspondence, ignoring the distant points that\nturn out to be the actual matching ones. In addition, the estimated\ncorrespondence is usually from the forward direction of the adjacent point\nclouds, and may not be consistent with the estimated correspondence acquired\nfrom the backward direction. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel\nall-to-all flow embedding layer with backward reliability validation during the\ninitial scene flow estimation.

It has been widely applied to\nproblems in many fields, including notably in computer science, e.g. in machine\nlearning to optimize hyperparameters of neural networks, and in engineering,\ne.g. in fluid dynamics to optimize control strategies that maximize drag\nreduction. This paper empirically studies and compares the performance and the\nrobustness of common Bayesian optimization algorithms on a range of synthetic\ntest functions to provide general guidance on the design of Bayesian\noptimization algorithms for specific problems. It investigates the choice of\nacquisition function, the effect of different numbers of training samples, the\nexact and Monte Carlo based calculation of acquisition functions, and both\nsingle-point and multi-point optimization. The test functions considered cover\na wide selection of challenges and therefore serve as an ideal test bed to\nunderstand the performance of Bayesian optimization to specific challenges, and\nin general. To illustrate how these findings can be used to inform a Bayesian\noptimization setup tailored to a specific problem, two simulations in the area\nof computational fluid dynamics are optimized, giving evidence that suitable\nsolutions can be found in a small number of evaluations of the objective\nfunction for complex, real problems. The results of our investigation can\nsimilarly be applied to other areas, such as machine learning and physical\nexperiments, where objective functions are expensive to evaluate and their\nmathematical expressions are unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 09:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

However, little is known on the explicit effect of\nrestart on randomness.

For parameters relevant to ice-ocean\ninterfaces in the convection-dominated regime, we observe that the salinity\nfield drives the convection and that heat is essentially transported as a\npassive scalar. By varying the diffusivity ratio of heat and salt (i.e., the\nLewis number $Le$), we identify how the different molecular diffusivities\naffect the scalar fluxes through the system. Away from the walls, we find that\nthe heat transport is determined by a turbulent Prandtl number of $Pr_t\\approx\n1$ and that double-diffusive effects are practically negligible. However, the\ndifference in molecular diffusivities plays an important role close to the\nboundaries. In the (unrealistic) case where salt diffused faster than heat, the\nratio of salt-to-heat fluxes would scale as $Le^{1/3}$, consistent with\nclassical nested scalar boundary layers. However, in the realistic case of\nfaster heat diffusion (relative to salt), we observe a transition towards a\n$Le^{1/2}$ scaling of the ratio of the fluxes. This coincides with the thermal\nboundary layer width growing beyond the thickness of the viscous boundary\nlayer.

Neutrinos can be generated through man-made sources like particle\naccelerators or by natural sources like the sun. Neutrinos only interact via\nthe weak force and gravity. Since gravitational interaction is extremely weak\nand the weak force has a very short range, neutrinos can travel long distances\nunimpeded through matter, reaching places inaccessible to GNSS (Global\nNavigation Satellite System) signals such as underwater locations. The main\nobjective of this work is to sketch an early high-level design of a Neutrino\nPNT (Position, Navigation and Timing) mission and analyze its feasibility for\nsubmarine navigation since there is a need to improve current navigation\ntechnologies for submarines. The high-level preliminary concept proposes\nCyclotrons or Linear Accelerators based on the physical process Pion Decay at\nRest as neutrino sources. For detecting such isotropic neutrino fluxes user\nequipment must be composed of a high-performance clock synchronized with the\nsystem, a detector and possibly additional sensors such as IMU (Inertial\nMeasurement Unit). A feasibility analysis of the recommended system option is\nperformed based on simulations for determining the neutrino detection rate and\non a PNT tool to estimate the PNT performances. Although the submarine\nnavigation application is in the limit of being feasible with current\ntechnology, it could be realized with some important but reasonable progress in\nsource and neutrino detector technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 12:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

In OTA FL, MUs\ntrain their models using local data at every training round and transmit their\ngradients simultaneously using the same frequency band in an uncoded fashion.\nBased on the received signal of the superposed gradients, the PS performs a\nglobal model update. While the OTA FL has a significantly decreased\ncommunication cost, it is susceptible to adverse channel effects and noise.\nEmploying multiple antennas at the receiver side can reduce these effects, yet\nthe path-loss is still a limiting factor for users located far away from the\nPS. To ameliorate this issue, in this paper, we propose a wireless-based\nhierarchical FL scheme that uses intermediate servers (ISs) to form clusters at\nthe areas where the MUs are more densely located. Our scheme utilizes OTA\ncluster aggregations for the communication of the MUs with their corresponding\nIS, and OTA global aggregations from the ISs to the PS. We present a\nconvergence analysis for the proposed algorithm, and show through numerical\nevaluations of the derived analytical expressions and experimental results that\nutilizing ISs results in a faster convergence and a better performance than the\nOTA FL alone while using less transmit power. We also validate the results on\nthe performance using different number of cluster iterations with different\ndatasets and data distributions. We conclude that the best choice of cluster\naggregations depends on the data distribution among the MUs and the clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 12:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Due to the black-box property and\nvarious types of CAVs, how to test and evaluate CAVs adaptively remains a major\nchallenge. Many approaches have been proposed to adaptively generate testing\nscenarios during the testing process. However, most existing approaches cannot\nbe applied to complex scenarios, where the variables needed to define such\nscenarios are high dimensional. Towards filling this gap, the adaptive testing\nwith sparse control variates method is proposed in this paper. Instead of\nadaptively generating testing scenarios, our approach evaluates CAVs'\nperformances by adaptively utilizing the testing results. Specifically, each\ntesting result is adjusted using multiple linear regression techniques based on\ncontrol variates. As the regression coefficients can be adaptively optimized\nfor the CAV under test, using the adjusted results can reduce the estimation\nvariance, compared with using the testing results directly. To overcome the\nhigh dimensionality challenge, sparse control variates are utilized only for\nthe critical variables of testing scenarios. To validate the proposed method,\nthe high-dimensional overtaking scenarios are investigated, and the results\ndemonstrate that our approach can further accelerate the evaluation process by\nabout 30 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 13:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Despite the fact that the gravity field is central, the Earth's\ntrajectory is not closed and the equinoxes drift. Milankovic (1920) argued that\nthe shortest precession period of solstices is 20,7kyr: the Summer solstice in\none hemisphere takes place alternately every 11kyr at perihelion and at\naphelion. We have submitted the time series for the Earth's pole of rotation,\nglobal mean surface temperature and ephemeris to iterative Singular Spectrum\nAnalysis. iSSA extracts from each a trend, a 1yr and a 60yr component. Both the\napparent drift of solstices of Earth around the Sun and the global mean\ntemperature exhibit a strong 60yr oscillation. The \"fixed dates\" of solstices\nactually drift. Comparing the time evolution of the Winter and Summer solstices\npositions of the rotation pole and the first iSSA component (trend) of the\ntemperature allows one to recognize some common features. A basic equation from\nMilankovic links the derivative of heat received at a given location on Earth\nto solar insolation, known functions of the location coordinates, solar\ndeclination and hour angle, with an inverse square dependence on the Sun-Earth\ndistance. We have translated the drift of solstices as a function of distance\nto the Sun into the geometrical insolation theory of Milankovic. Shifting the\ninverse square of the 60yr iSSA drift of solstices by 15 years with respect to\nthe first derivative of the 60yr iSSA trend of temperature, that is exactly a\nquadrature in time, puts the two curves in quasi-exact superimposition. The\nprobability of a chance coincidence appears very low. Correlation does not\nimply causality when there is no accompanying model. Here Milankovic's equation\ncan be considered as a model that is widely accepted. This paper identifies a\ncase of agreement between observations and a mathematical formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 13:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

However, advertisers such as\nCambridge Analytica have maliciously used these targeting features to\nmanipulate users in the context of elections. The European Commission plans to\nrestrict or ban some targeting functionalities in the new European Democracy\nAction Plan act to protect users from such harms. The difficulty is that we do\nnot know the economic impact of these restrictions on regular advertisers. In\nthis paper, to inform the debate, we take a first step by understanding who is\nadvertising on Facebook and how they use the targeting functionalities. For\nthis, we asked 890 U.S. users to install a monitoring tool on their browsers to\ncollect the ads they receive on Facebook and information about how these ads\nwere targeted. By matching advertisers on Facebook with their LinkedIn\nprofiles, we could see that 71% of advertisers are small and medium-sized\nbusinesses with 200 employees or less, and they are responsible for 61% of ads\nand 57% of ad impressions. Regarding micro-targeting, we found that only 32% of\nsmall and medium-sized businesses and 30% of large-sized businesses\nmicro-target at least one of their ads. These results should not be interpreted\nas micro-targeting not being useful as a marketing strategy, but rather that\nadvertisers prefer to outsource the micro-targeting task to ad platforms.\nIndeed, Facebook is employing optimization algorithms that exploit user data to\ndecide which users should see what ads; which means ad platforms are performing\nan algorithmic-driven micro-targeting. Hence, when setting restrictions,\nlegislators should take into account both the traditional advertiser-driven\nmicro-targeting as well as algorithmic-driven micro-targeting performed by ad\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

It consists in the change of the\nabsorption coefficient of the material near the band edge under the application\nof a static electric field, hence producing a direct modulation of the light\nintensity. The use of plasmons allows enhancing the electro-optical effect due\nto the high field confinement. An integrated electro-optical simulation tool\nwas developed to design and optimize the modulator. The designed plasmonic\nmodulator has an extinction ratio of 3.3 dB with insertion losses of 13.2 dB\nand electrical power consumption as low as 20 fJ/bit, i.e. the lowest\nelectrical power consumption reported for silicon photonic modulators.

The Singulation-and-Grasping (SaG) policy is trained through\nend-to-end reinforcement learning.

We propose TD-CARMA, a Bayesian\nmethod to estimate cosmological time delays by modelling the observed and\nirregularly sampled light curves as realizations of a Continuous\nAuto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) process. Our model accounts for\nheteroskedastic measurement errors and microlensing, an additional source of\nindependent extrinsic long-term variability in the source brightness. The\nsemi-separable structure of the CARMA covariance matrix allows for fast and\nscalable likelihood computation using Gaussian Process modeling. We obtain a\nsample from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using a\nnested sampling approach. This allows for ``painless'' Bayesian Computation,\ndealing with the expected multi-modality of the posterior distribution in a\nstraightforward manner and not requiring the specification of starting values\nor an initial guess for the time delay, unlike existing methods. In addition,\nthe proposed sampling procedure automatically evaluates the Bayesian evidence,\nallowing us to perform principled Bayesian model selection.

Recently, several 3D object detection methods adopt IoU-based\noptimization and directly replace the 2D IoU with 3D IoU. However, such a\ndirect computation in 3D is very costly due to the complex implementation and\ninefficient backward operations. Moreover, 3D IoU-based optimization is\nsub-optimal as it is sensitive to rotation and thus can cause training\ninstability and detection performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose\na novel Rotation-Decoupled IoU (RDIoU) method that can mitigate the\nrotation-sensitivity issue, and produce more efficient optimization objectives\ncompared with 3D IoU during the training stage. Specifically, our RDIoU\nsimplifies the complex interactions of regression parameters by decoupling the\nrotation variable as an independent term, yet preserving the geometry of 3D\nIoU. By incorporating RDIoU into both the regression and classification\nbranches, the network is encouraged to learn more precise bounding boxes and\nconcurrently overcome the misalignment issue between classification and\nregression.

Soft robotics is a field that presents\nunique physical challenges for simulating its subjects due to the nonlinearity\nof deformable material components along with other innovative, and often\ncomplex, physical properties. Because of the computational cost of simulating\nsoft and heterogeneous objects with traditional techniques, rigid robotics\nsimulators are not well suited to simulating soft robots. Thus, many engineers\nmust build their own one-off simulators tailored to their system, or use\nexisting simulators with reduced performance. In order to facilitate the\ndevelopment of this exciting technology, this work presents an\ninteractive-speed, accurate, and versatile simulator for a variety of types of\nsoft robots.

Analytical solutions produced by the two systems are\ndifferent. The new model is comprehensive, elegant, and yet an extraordinary\ndevelopment as it reveals serendipitous circumstances resulting in a\npressure-inertia-paradox.

In this work, for the first time we explore the global context\nlearning potentials of ViTs for dense visual prediction (e.g., semantic\nsegmentation). Our motivation is that through learning global context at full\nreceptive field layer by layer, ViTs may capture stronger long-range dependency\ninformation, critical for dense prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that\nencoding an image as a sequence of patches, a vanilla ViT without local\nconvolution and resolution reduction can yield stronger visual representation\nfor semantic segmentation.

For tackling general dense visual\nprediction tasks in a cost-effective manner, we further formulate a family of\nHierarchical Local-Global (HLG) Transformers, characterized by local attention\nwithin windows and global-attention across windows in a pyramidal architecture.\nExtensive experiments show that our methods achieve appealing performance on a\nvariety of dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and instance\nsegmentation and semantic segmentation) as well as image classification.

Even\nthough very broad gain QCLs have been presented, these were not able to improve\nthe comb bandwidth, whose main limitations are variations of the gain and\ndispersion with frequency. A perfectly flat gain spectrum would mitigate this,\nas the dispersion as well as the parametric gain necessary to overcome the\nlosses at gain clamping, vanishes. On the other hand, comb formation rests on\nfour-wave mixing, a third-order nonlinear process, which is very strong in\nQCLs. Due to the subband nature of these devices, this nonlinearity can be\ndesigned and enhanced in order to facilitate comb formation. In this work, we\npresent optimised designs with broad and flat-top gain spectra spanning as much\nas 220 cm$^{-1}$, as well as up to 30 times stronger FWM nonlinearity than a\ntypical bound-to-continuum QCL design.

Furthermore, this tool has the\ncharacteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential to identify\nremediation strategies immediately. The advantages produced by the model were\ncompared with literature studies. In this regard, a feedforward artificial\nneural network, which has been trained to handle different cases, represents\nthe data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the concentration of the pollutant\nat specific observation points in the study area (forward problem); secondly,\nto deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source\nlocation; then, in case of one contaminant source, identifying the release\nhistory and, at the same time, the location of the source in a specific\nsub-domain of the investigated area. At last, the observation error is\ninvestigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved,\nhighlighting the capability of the ANN to deal with multiple scenarios by\napproximating nonlinear functions without the physical point of view that\ndescribes the phenomenon, providing reliable results, with very low\ncomputational burden and uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Conventionally, ITE is\npredicted by modeling the treated and control response functions separately in\ntheir individual sample spaces. However, such an approach usually encounters\ntwo issues in practice, i.e. divergent distribution between treated and control\ngroups due to treatment bias, and significant sample imbalance of their\npopulation sizes. This paper proposes Deep Entire Space Cross Networks (DESCN)\nto model treatment effects from an end-to-end perspective. DESCN captures the\nintegrated information of the treatment propensity, the response, and the\nhidden treatment effect through a cross network in a multi-task learning\nmanner.

Experts in network security need to\nclassify signatures by importance for an IDPS to work. We propose and evaluate\na machine learning signature classification model with a reject option (RO) to\nreduce the cost of setting up an IDPS. To train the proposed model, it is\nessential to design features that are effective for signature classification.\nExperts classify signatures with predefined if-then rules. An if-then rule\nreturns a label of low, medium, high, or unknown importance based on keyword\nmatching of the elements in the signature. Therefore, we first design two types\nof features, symbolic features (SFs) and keyword features (KFs), which are used\nin keyword matching for the if-then rules. Next, we design web information and\nmessage features (WMFs) to capture the properties of signatures that do not\nmatch the if-then rules. The WMFs are extracted as term frequency-inverse\ndocument frequency (TF-IDF) features of the message text in the signatures. The\nfeatures are obtained by web scraping from the referenced external attack\nidentification systems described in the signature. Because failure needs to be\nminimized in the classification of IDPS signatures, as in the medical field, we\nconsider introducing a RO in our proposed model. The effectiveness of the\nproposed classification model is evaluated in experiments with two real\ndatasets composed of signatures labeled by experts: a dataset that can be\nclassified with if-then rules and a dataset with elements that do not match an\nif-then rule. In the experiment, the proposed model is evaluated. In both\ncases, the combined SFs and WMFs performed better than the combined SFs and\nKFs. In addition, we also performed feature analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 06:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

The operating conditions in which a\ngiven system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language.\nThe framework offers an efficient search mechanism that searches for\nadversarial operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way,\nANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing\nadversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test\nthe driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and\nautomatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of\n100% in the CARLA benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 01:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Over a thousand\nhydrodynamic simulations were performed to study the formation of RMI for a\nparameterized high velocity impact. Deep learning was used to learn the\ntemporal mapping of initial geometric perturbations to the full-field\nhydrodynamic solutions of density and velocity. The continuity equation was\nused to include physical information into the loss function, however only\nresulted in very minor improvements at the cost of additional training\ncomplexity. Predictions from the deep learning model appear to accurately\ncapture temporal RMI formations for a variety of geometric conditions within\nthe domain. First principle physical laws were investigated to infer the\naccuracy of the model's predictive capability. While the continuity equation\nappeared to show no correlation with the accuracy of the model, conservation of\nmass and momentum were weakly correlated with accuracy. Since conservation laws\ncan be quickly calculated from the deep learning model, they may be useful in\napplications where a relative accuracy measure is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 02:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

In this\narticle we consider the situation of a large area containing randomly placed\npoints (representing points of interest), as well a number of randomly-placed\ndisks of equal radius in the same region (representing individual sensors'\ncoverage areas). The problem of finding the smallest possible set of disks that\ncover the given points is known to be NP-complete. We show that the\ncomputational complexity may be reduced by classifying the disks into several\ndefinite classes that can be characterized as necessary, excludable, or\nindeterminate. The problem may then be reduced to considering only the\nindeterminate sets and the points that they cover. In addition, indeterminate\nsets and the points that they cover may be divided into disjoint ``islands''\nthat can be solved separately. Hence the actual complexity is determined by the\nnumber of points and sets in the largest island. We run a number of simulations\nto show how the proportion of sets and points of various types depend on two\nbasic scale-invariant parameters related to point and set density. We show that\nenormous reductions in complexity can be achieved even in situations where\npoint and set density is relatively high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}
