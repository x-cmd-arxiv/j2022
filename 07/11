In particular, we study the behaviour\nof total travel time, and consider both self-interested routing paradigms, such\nas User Equilibrium (UE) routing, as well as cooperative paradigms, such as\nclassic Multi-Commodity (MC) network flow and System Optimal (SO) routing. We\nprovide a formal framework for designing transport networks through iterative\npath additions, introducing the concepts of trip spanning tree and trip path\ngraph. Using this formalisation, we prove multiple properties of the objective\nfunction for transport network design. Since the underlying routing problem is\nNP-Hard, we investigate properties that provide guarantees in approximate\nalgorithm design. Firstly, while Braess' paradox has shown that total travel\ntime is not monotonic non-increasing with respect to path additions under\nself-interested routing (UE), we prove that, instead, monotonicity holds for\ncooperative routing (MC and SO). This result has the important implication that\ncooperative agents make the best use of redundant infrastructure. Secondly, we\nprove via a counterexample that the intuitive statement `adding a path to a\ntransport network always grants greater or equal benefit to users than adding\nit to a superset of that network' is false. In other words we prove that, for\nall the routing formulations studied, total travel time is not supermodular\nwith respect to path additions. While this counter-intuitive result yields a\nhardness property for algorithm design, we provide particular instances where,\ninstead, the property of supermodularity holds.

Here we simulate the formation of the TMC from 2P/Encke and\nseveral NEAs. In total, we explored more than a hundred stream formation\nscenarios using clones of 2P/Encke. Each modelled stream was integrated and\ncompared with present-day Taurid observations.

When it comes to random graphs, only the classical binomial random\ngraph $G_{n,p}$ has been analysed and shown to have largest independent sets of\nsize $\\Theta(\\log{n})$ w.h.p. This classical model does not capture any\ndependency structure between edges that can appear in real-world networks. We\ninitiate study in this direction by defining random graphs $G^{r}_{n,p}$ whose\nexistence of edges is determined by a Markov process that is also governed by a\ndecay parameter $r\\in(0,1]$. We prove that w.h.p. $G^{r}_{n,p}$ has independent\nsets of size $(\\frac{1-r}{2+\\epsilon}) \\frac{n}{\\log{n}}$ for arbitrary\n$\\epsilon > 0$, which implies an asymptotic lower bound of $\\Omega(\\pi(n))$\nwhere $\\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function. This is derived using bounds on\nthe terms of a harmonic series, Tur\\'an bound on stability number, and a\nconcentration analysis for a certain sequence of dependent Bernoulli variables\nthat may also be of independent interest. Since $G^{r}_{n,p}$ collapses to\n$G_{n,p}$ when there is no decay, it follows that having even the slightest bit\nof dependency (any $r < 1$) in the random graph construction leads to the\npresence of large independent sets and thus our random model has a phase\ntransition at its boundary value of $r=1$. For the maximal independent set\noutput by a greedy algorithm, we deduce that it has a performance ratio of at\nmost $1 + \\frac{\\log{n}}{(1-r)}$ w.h.p. when the lowest degree vertex is picked\nat each iteration, and also show that under any other permutation of vertices\nthe algorithm outputs a set of size $\\Omega(n^{1/1+\\tau})$, where\n$\\tau=1/(1-r)$, and hence has a performance ratio of $O(n^{\\frac{1}{2-r}})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 18:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 17:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

We introduce Local Area (LA)\nroute relaxations, an alternative/complement to the commonly used ng-route\nrelaxations and Decremental State Space Relaxations (DSSR) inside of CG\nformulations. LA routes are a subset of ng-routes and a super-set of elementary\nroutes. Normally, the pricing stage of CG must produce elementary routes, which\nare routes without repeated customers, using processes which can be\ncomputationally expensive. Non-elementary routes visit at least one customer\nmore than once, creating a cycle. LA routes relax the constraint of being an\nelementary route in such a manner as to permit efficient pricing. LA routes are\nbest understood in terms of ng-route relaxations. Ng-routes are routes which\nare permitted to have non-localized cycles in space; this means that at least\none intermediate customer (called a breaker) in the cycle must consider the\nstarting customer in the cycle to be spatially far away. LA routes are\ndescribed using a set of special indexes corresponding to customers on the\nroute ordered from the start to the end of the route. LA route relaxations\nfurther restrict the set of permitted cycles beyond that of ng-routes by\nadditionally enforcing that the breaker must be a located at a special index\nwhere the set of special indexes is defined recursively as follows. The first\nspecial index in the route is at index 1 meaning that it is associated with the\nfirst customer in the route. The k'th special index corresponds to the first\ncustomer after the k-1'th special index, that is not considered to be a\nneighbor of (considered spatially far from) the customer located at the k-1'th\nspecial index.

This embedding introduces some distortion to\nthe cover object and produces a corresponding stego object. The embedding\ndistortion is measured by a cost function that determines the detection\nprobability of the existence of the embedded secret data. A cost function\nrelated to the maximum embedding rate is typically employed to evaluate a\nsteganographic system. In addition, the distribution of multimedia sources\nfollows the Gibbs distribution which is a complex statistical model that\nrestricts analysis. Thus, previous multimedia steganographic approaches either\nassume a relaxed distribution or presume a proposition on the maximum embedding\nrate and then try to prove it is correct. Conversely, this paper introduces an\nanalytic approach to determining the maximum embedding rate in multimedia cover\nobjects through a constrained optimization problem concerning the relationship\nbetween the maximum embedding rate and the probability of detection by any\nsteganographic detector. The KL-divergence between the distributions for the\ncover and stego objects is used as the cost function as it upper bounds the\nperformance of the optimal steganographic detector. An equivalence between the\nGibbs and correlated-multivariate-quantized-Gaussian distributions is\nestablished to solve this optimization problem. The solution provides an\nanalytic form for the maximum embedding rate in terms of the WrightOmega\nfunction.

Secondly, scaling exponents serve as a benchmark for different\nvariants of polar codes that helps us select the proper variant for real-life\napplications.

The task to do so is the\nmultilateration problem. But when there are several emission events originating\nfrom several sources, the received signals must first be matched in order to\nfind the emission times and source positions.

Supply is uncertain, and is a function of the\norder quantity (due to random yield/capacity, etc). We aim to minimize the\n$T$-period cost, a problem that is known to be computationally intractable even\nunder known distributions of demand and supply. In this paper, we assume that\nboth the demand and supply distributions are unknown and develop a\ncomputationally efficient online learning algorithm. We show that our algorithm\nachieves a regret (i.e. the performance gap between the cost of our algorithm\nand that of an optimal policy over $T$ periods) of $O(L+\\sqrt{T})$ when\n$L\\geq\\log(T)$. We do so by 1) showing our algorithm cost is higher by at most\n$O(L+\\sqrt{T})$ for any $L\\geq 0$ compared to an optimal constant-order policy\nunder complete information (a well-known and widely-used algorithm) and 2)\nleveraging its known performance guarantee from the existing literature. To the\nbest of our knowledge, a finite-sample $O(\\sqrt{T})$ (and polynomial in $L$)\nregret bound when benchmarked against an optimal policy is not known before in\nthe online inventory control literature. A key challenge in this learning\nproblem is that both demand and supply data can be censored; hence only\ntruncated values are observable. We circumvent this challenge by showing that\nthe data generated under an order quantity $q^2$ allows us to simulate the\nperformance of not only $q^2$ but also $q^1$ for all $q^1<q^2$, a key\nobservation to obtain sufficient information even under data censoring. By\nestablishing a high probability coupling argument, we are able to evaluate and\ncompare the performance of different order policies at their steady state\nwithin a finite time horizon.

Technically, DCCL searches for a most\ndomain-challenging direction and exquisitely crafts domain confused\naugmentations as positive pairs, then it contrastively encourages the model to\npull representations towards the other domain, thus learning more stable and\neffective domain invariances. We also investigate whether contrastive learning\nnecessarily helps with UDA when performing other data augmentations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DCCL significantly outperforms baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 23:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Gradual domain\nadaptation (GDA) is one promising way to mitigate such an issue, by leveraging\nadditional unlabeled data that gradually shift from the source to the target.\nThrough sequentially adapting the model along the \"indexed\" intermediate\ndomains, GDA substantially improves the overall adaptation performance. In\npractice, however, the extra unlabeled data may not be separated into\nintermediate domains and indexed properly, limiting the applicability of GDA.\nIn this paper, we investigate how to discover the sequence of intermediate\ndomains when it is not already available.

We propose a low-rank mixture model\n(LrMM), adapted from the classical Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to treat\nmatrix-valued observations, which assumes low-rankness for population center\nmatrices. A computationally efficient clustering method is designed by\nintegrating Lloyd's algorithm and low-rank approximation. Once\nwell-initialized, the algorithm converges fast and achieves an exponential-type\nclustering error rate that is minimax optimal. Meanwhile, we show that a\ntensor-based spectral method delivers a good initial clustering. Comparable to\nGMM, the minimax optimal clustering error rate is decided by the separation\nstrength, i.e., the minimal distance between population center matrices. By\nexploiting low-rankness, the proposed algorithm is blessed with a weaker\nrequirement on the separation strength. Unlike GMM, however, the computational\ndifficulty of LrMM is characterized by the signal strength, i.e., the smallest\nnon-zero singular values of population center matrices. Evidence is provided\nshowing that no polynomial-time algorithm is consistent if the signal strength\nis not strong enough, even though the separation strength is strong. Intriguing\ndifferences between estimation and clustering under LrMM are discussed. The\nmerits of low-rank Lloyd's algorithm are confirmed by comprehensive simulation\nexperiments.

When we train a\nmodel on such data, confounding variables will bias the distribution of the\nlearned features. A recent promising solution, MetaData Normalization (MDN),\nestimates the linear relationship between the metadata and each feature based\non a non-trainable closed-form solution. However, this estimation is confined\nby the sample size of a mini-batch and thereby may cause the approach to be\nunstable during training.

However, when applied to image reconstruction and\nsynthesis tasks, VAE shows the limitation that the generated sample tends to be\nblurry. We observe that a similar problem, in which the generated trajectory is\nlocated between adjacent lanes, often arises in VAE-based trajectory\nforecasting models. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a hierarchical\nlatent structure into the VAE-based forecasting model. Based on the assumption\nthat the trajectory distribution can be approximated as a mixture of simple\ndistributions (or modes), the low-level latent variable is employed to model\neach mode of the mixture and the high-level latent variable is employed to\nrepresent the weights for the modes. To model each mode accurately, we\ncondition the low-level latent variable using two lane-level context vectors\ncomputed in novel ways, one corresponds to vehicle-lane interaction and the\nother to vehicle-vehicle interaction. The context vectors are also used to\nmodel the weights via the proposed mode selection network. To evaluate our\nforecasting model, we use two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental\nresults show that our model is not only capable of generating clear multi-modal\ntrajectory distributions but also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmodels in terms of prediction accuracy.

The usual algorithm for evaluating exchange matrix scales cubically with\nthe system size because one has to perform O(N2) fast Fourier transforms (FFT).\nHere we introduce an algorithm that retains the cubic scaling but reduces the\nprefactor significantly by eliminating the need to do FFTs during each exchange\nbuild. This is accomplished by representing the products of Gaussian basis\nfunction using a linear combination of an auxiliary basis the number of which\nscales linearly with the size of the system. We store the potential due to\nthese auxiliary functions in memory which allows us to obtain the exchange\nmatrix without the need to do FFT, albeit at the cost of additional memory\nrequirement. Although the basic idea of using auxiliary functions is not new,\nour algorithm is cheaper due to a combination of three ingredients: (a) we use\nrobust Pseudospectral method that allows us to use a relatively small number of\nauxiliary basis to obtain high accuracy (b) we use occ-RI exchange which\neliminates the need to construct the full exchange matrix and (c) we use the\n(interpolative separable density fitting) ISDF algorithm to construct these\nauxiliary basis that are used in the robust pseudospectral method. The\nresulting algorithm is accurate and we note that the error in the final energy\ndecreases exponentially rapidly with the number of auxiliary functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 05:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 18:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

However, there still exists a nontrivial\ngap in these efforts towards practicality, giving the challenges of overhead\nreduction and secure inference acceleration in an all-round way.\n  We propose SIMC 2.0, which complies with the underlying structure of SIMC,\nbut significantly optimizes both the linear and non-linear layers of the model.\nSpecifically, (1) we design a new coding method for homomorphic parallel\ncomputation between matrices and vectors. It is custom-built through the\ninsight into the complementarity between cryptographic primitives in SIMC. As a\nresult, it can minimize the number of rotation operations incurred in the\ncalculation process, which is very computationally expensive compared to other\nhomomorphic operations e.g., addition, multiplication). (2) We reduce the size\nof the garbled circuit (GC) (used to calculate nonlinear activation functions,\ne.g., ReLU) in SIMC by about two thirds. Then, we design an alternative\nlightweight protocol to perform tasks that are originally allocated to the\nexpensive GCs.

However, using a single model to adapt to\nvarious data distributions from different sites is extremely challenging.\nPersonalized FL tackles this issue by only utilizing partial model parameters\nshared from global server, while keeping the rest to adapt to its own data\ndistribution in the local training of each site. However, most existing methods\nconcentrate on the partial parameter splitting, while do not consider the\n\\textit{inter-site in-consistencies} during the local training, which in fact\ncan facilitate the knowledge communication over sites to benefit the model\nlearning for improving the local accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\npersonalized federated framework with \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{C}alibration\n(LC-Fed), to leverage the inter-site in-consistencies in both \\textit{feature-\nand prediction- levels} to boost the segmentation. Concretely, as each local\nsite has its alternative attention on the various features, we first design the\ncontrastive site embedding coupled with channel selection operation to\ncalibrate the encoded features. Moreover, we propose to exploit the knowledge\nof prediction-level in-consistency to guide the personalized modeling on the\nambiguous regions, e.g., anatomical boundaries. It is achieved by computing a\ndisagreement-aware map to calibrate the prediction. Effectiveness of our method\nhas been verified on three medical image segmentation tasks with different\nmodalities, where our method consistently shows superior performance to the\nstate-of-the-art personalized FL methods.

In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge\nby first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support\nthrough exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets\nand models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource\nlanguages.

By leveraging IMU during training,\nDynaDepth not only learns an absolute scale, but also provides a better\ngeneralization ability and robustness against vision degradation such as\nillumination change and moving objects.

Among all budget control approaches, throttling stands out as a popular\none, where the buyer participates in only a part of auctions. This paper gives\na theoretical panorama of a single buyer's dynamic budget throttling process in\nrepeated second-price auctions, which is lacking in the literature. We first\nestablish a lower bound on the regret and an upper bound on the asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio for any throttling algorithm, respectively, on whether the\nbuyer's values are stochastic or adversarial. Second, on the algorithmic side,\nwe consider two different information structures, with increasing difficulty in\nlearning the stochastic distribution of the highest competing bid. We further\npropose the OGD-CB algorithm, which is oblivious to stochastic or adversarial\nvalues and has asymptotically equal results under these two information\nstructures. Specifically, with stochastic values, we demonstrate that this\nalgorithm guarantees a near-optimal expected regret. When values are\nadversarial, we prove that the proposed algorithm reaches the upper bound on\nthe asymptotic competitive ratio. At last, we compare throttling with pacing,\nanother widely adopted budget control method, in repeated second-price\nauctions. In the stochastic case, we illustrate that pacing is generally better\nthan throttling for the buyer, which is an extension of known results that\npacing is asymptotically optimal in this scenario. However, in the adversarial\ncase, we give an exciting result indicating that throttling is the\nasymptotically optimal dynamic bidding strategy.

In this work, we present an inverse design method based on\ngradient-descent optimization to encode multiple pieces of holographic\ninformation into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse\ndesign of single-celled metasurfaces without the need for complex meta-atom\ndesign strategies, facilitating high-throughput fabrication using broadband low\nloss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane RGB\ncolor holograms and 3D holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated.\nUp to eighteen distinct metasurface-generated holographic images are\ndemonstrated, achieving the state-of-the-art data capacity of a single\nphase-only metasurface. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first\nexperimental demonstration of metasurface-generated 3D holograms that have\ncompletely independent and distinct images in each plane. By demonstrating the\nhigh-density holographic information of a single metasurface, the current\nresearch findings provide a viable route for practical metasurfaces-generated\nholography, ultimately stepping towards applications in optical storage,\ndisplays, and full-color imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

In this work, we explore the possibility of\nusing a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given\nthe homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in $J$ and/or $H$\nband, plus good $gr$-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak\nmagnitudes in $J$ ($J_{max}$) and $H$ ($H_{max}$) bands. The use of a single\nNIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of $\\sim0.05$ mag for epochs\naround the time of $B$-band peak magnitude ($T_{max}$). We also tested the\neffect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of\n$T_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both\ncadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the\nintroduced scatter of each to $<0.02$ mag in $J_{max}$ and $<0.01$ in\n$H_{max}$.

In this study, we propose a novel Progressive Class-Center\nTriplet (PCCT) framework to alleviate the class imbalance issue particularly\nfor diagnosis of rare diseases, mainly by carefully designing the triplet\nsampling strategy and the triplet loss formation. Specifically, the PCCT\nframework includes two successive stages. In the first stage, PCCT trains the\ndiagnosis system via a class-balanced triplet loss to coarsely separate\ndistributions of different classes. In the second stage, the PCCT framework\nfurther improves the diagnosis system via a class-center involved triplet loss\nto cause a more compact distribution for each class. For the class-balanced\ntriplet loss, triplets are sampled equally for each class at each training\niteration, thus alleviating the imbalanced data issue. For the class-center\ninvolved triplet loss, the positive and negative samples in each triplet are\nreplaced by their corresponding class centers, which enforces data\nrepresentations of the same class closer to the class center. Furthermore, the\nclass-center involved triplet loss is extended to the pair-wise ranking loss\nand the quadruplet loss, which demonstrates the generalization of the proposed\nframework. Extensive experiments support that the PCCT framework works\neffectively for medical image classification with imbalanced training images.\nOn two skin image datasets and one chest X-ray dataset, the proposed approach\nrespectively obtains the mean F1 score 86.2, 65.2, and 90.66 over all classes\nand 81.4, 63.87, and 81.92 for rare classes, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance and outperforming the widely used methods for the class imbalance\nissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

In order\nto minimize the time needed for re-calibration, we analyzed how the calibration\nresult accuracy degrades when fewer calibration orientations are used.

Traditional EM assumes that two tables\nare homogeneous with the aligned schema, while it is common that entity records\nof different formats (e.g., relational, semi-structured, or textual types)\ninvolve in practical scenarios. It is not practical to unify their schemas due\nto the different formats. To support EM on format-different entity records,\nGeneralized Entity Matching (GEM) has been proposed and gained much attention\nrecently. To do GEM, existing methods typically perform in a supervised\nlearning way, which relies on a large amount of high-quality labeled examples.\nHowever, the labeling process is extremely labor-intensive, and frustrates the\nuse of GEM. Low-resource GEM, i.e., GEM that only requires a small number of\nlabeled examples, becomes an urgent need. To this end, this paper, for the\nfirst time, focuses on the low-resource GEM and proposes a novel low-resource\nGEM method, termed as PromptEM. PromptEM has addressed three challenging issues\n(i.e., designing GEM-specific prompt-tuning, improving pseudo-labels quality,\nand running efficient self-training) in low-resource GEM. Extensive\nexperimental results on eight real benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of\nPromptEM in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 03:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, the existing tensor-based methods of hyperspectral\nimage super-resolution like the tensor train and tensor ring decomposition only\nestablish an operation between adjacent two factors and are highly sensitive to\nthe permutation of tensor modes, leading to an inadequate and inflexible\nrepresentation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for hyperspectral\nimage super-resolution by utilizing the specific properties of high-order\ntensors in fully-connected tensor network decomposition. The proposed method\nfirst tensorizes the target HR-HSI into a high-order tensor that has multiscale\nspatial structures. Then, a coupled fully-connected tensor network\ndecomposition model is proposed to fuse the corresponding high-order tensors of\nLR-HSI and HR-MSI. Moreover, a weighted-graph regularization is imposed on the\nspectral core tensors to preserve spectral information. In the proposed model,\nthe superiorities of the fully-connected tensor network decomposition lie in\nthe outstanding capability for characterizing adequately the intrinsic\ncorrelations between any two modes of tensors and the essential invariance for\ntransposition.

We consider an adversary with\ncomplete system knowledge, injecting stealthy false data into an uncertain\ncontrol system. We then use the Value-at-Risk to characterize the risk\nassociated with the attack impact caused by the adversary. The worst-case\nattack impact is characterized by the recently proposed output-to-output gain.\nWe observe that the risk assessment problem corresponds to an infinite\nnon-convex robust optimization problem. To this end, we use dissipative system\ntheory and the scenario approach to approximate the risk-assessment problem\ninto a convex problem and also provide probabilistic certificates on\napproximation. Secondly, we consider the problem of security measure\nallocation. We consider an operator with a constraint on the security budget.\nUnder this constraint, we propose an algorithm to optimally allocate the\nsecurity measures using the calculated risk such that the resulting\nValue-at-risk is minimized. Finally, we illustrate the results through a\nnumerical example.

They are widely used in generative models, fair machine\nlearning algorithms, design of privacy-assuring mechanisms, and appear as\ninformation-theoretic performance bounds in various multi-user communication\nproblems. In this work, we propose a general family of optimization problems,\ntermed as complexity-leakage-utility bottleneck (CLUB) model, which (i)\nprovides a unified theoretical framework that generalizes most of the\nstate-of-the-art literature for the information-theoretic privacy models, (ii)\nestablishes a new interpretation of the popular generative and discriminative\nmodels, (iii) constructs new insights to the generative compression models, and\n(iv) can be used in the fair generative models. We first formulate the CLUB\nmodel as a complexity-constrained privacy-utility optimization problem. We then\nconnect it with the closely related bottleneck problems, namely information\nbottleneck (IB), privacy funnel (PF), deterministic IB (DIB), conditional\nentropy bottleneck (CEB), and conditional PF (CPF). We show that the CLUB model\ngeneralizes all these problems as well as most other information-theoretic\nprivacy models. Then, we construct the deep variational CLUB (DVCLUB) models by\nemploying neural networks to parameterize variational approximations of the\nassociated information quantities. Building upon these information quantities,\nwe present unified objectives of the supervised and unsupervised DVCLUB models.\nLeveraging the DVCLUB model in an unsupervised setup, we then connect it with\nstate-of-the-art generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs),\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN),\nWasserstein auto-encoder (WAE), and adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) models\nthrough the optimal transport (OT) problem.

Our main combinatorial result is a \"vortex-free\" refinement of the\nabove structural theorem as follows: we identify a (parameterized) graph\n$H_{t}$, called shallow vortex grid, and we prove that if in the above\nstructural theorem we replace $K_{t}$ by $H_{t},$ then the resulting\ndecomposition becomes \"vortex-free\". Up to now, the most general classes of\ngraphs admitting such a result were either bounded Euler genus graphs or the so\ncalled single-crossing minor-free graphs. Our result is tight in the sense\nthat, whenever we minor-exclude a graph that is not a minor of some $H_{t},$\nthe appearance of vortices is unavoidable. Using the above decomposition\ntheorem, we design an algorithm that, given an $H_{t}$-minor-free graph $G$,\ncomputes the generating function of all perfect matchings of $G$ in polynomial\ntime. This algorithm yields, on $H_{t}$-minor-free graphs, polynomial\nalgorithms for computational problems such as the {dimer problem, the exact\nmatching problem}, and the computation of the permanent. Our results, combined\nwith known complexity results, imply a complete characterization of\nminor-closed graphs classes where the number of perfect matchings is\npolynomially computable: They are exactly those graph classes that do not\ncontain every $H_{t}$ as a minor.

This is explained theoretically by combining results\nfrom RG and wavelet theories, and verified numerically for the Gaussian and\n$\\varphi^4$ field theories. We show that multiscale WC-RG energy-based models\nare more general than local potential models and can capture the physics of\ncomplex many-body interacting systems at all length scales. This is\ndemonstrated for weak-gravitational-lensing fields reflecting dark matter\ndistributions in cosmology, which include long-range interactions with\nlong-tail probability distributions. WC-RG has a large number of potential\napplications in non-equilibrium systems, where the underlying distribution is\nnot known {\\it a priori}. Finally, we discuss the connection between WC-RG and\ndeep network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 15:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

In cavity quantum electrodynamics for example, when the\ncoupling strength is larger than the loss rate the coupling is termed strong,\nand otherwise it is dubbed weak. Ultrastrong coupling, where the interaction\nenergy is of the same order of magnitude as the bare energies of the uncoupled\nobjects, presents a new paradigm for quantum physics and beyond. As a\nconsequence profound changes to well established phenomena occur, for instance\nthe ground state in an ultrastrongly coupled system is not empty but hosts\nvirtual excitations due to the existence of processes which do not conserve the\ntotal number of excitations. The implications of ultrastrong coupling for\nquantum topological systems, where the number of excitations are typically\nconserved, remain largely unknown despite the great utility of topological\nmatter. Here we reveal how the delicate interplay between ultrastrong coupling\nand topological states manifests in a one-dimensional array. We study\ntheoretically a dimerized chain of twolevel systems within the ultrastrong\ncoupling regime, where the combined saturation and counter-rotating terms in\nthe Hamiltonian are shown to play pivotal roles in the rich, multi-excitation\neffective bandstructure.

In real-world scenarios, new semantic relations\nconstantly emerge and they typically appear with only a few labeled data. Since\na variety of semantic relations exist in multiple heterogeneous graphs, the\ntransferable knowledge can be mined from some existing semantic relations to\nhelp predict the new semantic relations with few labeled data. This inspires a\nnovel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across heterogeneous\ngraphs. However, the existing methods cannot solve this problem because they\nnot only require a large number of labeled samples as input, but also focus on\na single graph with a fixed heterogeneity. Targeting this novel and challenging\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a Meta-learning based Graph neural network\nfor Semantic relation prediction, named MetaGS. Firstly, MetaGS decomposes the\ngraph structure between objects into multiple normalized subgraphs, then adopts\na two-view graph neural network to capture local heterogeneous information and\nglobal structure information of these subgraphs. Secondly, MetaGS aggregates\nthe information of these subgraphs with a hyper-prototypical network, which can\nlearn from existing semantic relations and adapt to new semantic relations.\nThirdly, using the well-initialized two-view graph neural network and\nhyper-prototypical network, MetaGS can effectively learn new semantic relations\nfrom different graphs while overcoming the limitation of few labeled data.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the\nsuperior performance of MetaGS over the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 01:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Universal perturbations present a\nmore realistic case of adversarial attacks, as awareness of the model's exact\ninput is not required. In addition, the universal attack setting raises the\nsubject of generalization to unseen data, where given a set of inputs, the\nuniversal perturbations aim to alter the model's output on out-of-sample data.\nIn this work, we study physical passive patch adversarial attacks on visual\nodometry-based autonomous navigation systems.

The study is based on the\nexperimental data obtained from the STEP-F and the SphinX instruments placed\nclose to each other aboard the low-Earth circular orbit CORONAS-Photon\nsatellite. Data analysis of particle fluencies collected from the highly\nsensitive STEP-F device indicates the presence of a persistent electron belt at\nL = 1.6, i.e., beneath the well-known Van Allen electron inner radiation belt\nof the Earth's magnetosphere. The electron energy spectrum in this 'new' belt\nis much steeper than that of the inner belt so that the electrons with energies\nEe > 400 keV were almost not recorded on L = 1.6 outside the South Atlantic\nAnomaly (SAA). We introduce the concept of effective lowest threshold energies\nfor X-ray detectors used in the solar soft X-ray spectrophotometer SphinX and\ndefine their values for two regions: the SAA and the Van Allen outer belt.\nDifferent values of lowest threshold energies are directly associated with\ndifferent slopes of particle energy spectra. Cross-analyses of data obtained\nfrom the STEP-F and SphinX instruments initially built for various purposes\nmade it possible to detect the highly anisotropic character of the spatial\nelectron distribution in radiation belts in both Southern and northern\nhemispheres. We detected also the presence of low-energy electrons at all\nlatitudes during the main phase of a weak geomagnetic storm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

The specific metasurface array design comprises a\nseries of waveguides, each feeding a sub-array of dynamically tunable\nmetamaterial elements that radiate at microwave (X-band) frequencies. To remain\na one-port device, the composite array requires a power divider that can excite\neach branch waveguide with equal power. Further, the power divider must also\napply a prescribed phase shift to each branch waveguide to mitigate\nmetasurface-specific grating lobes. The presented design features hollow metal\nwaveguides, with a conducting sheet patterned with metamaterial irises serving\nas the upper wall. A single hollow metal main waveguide feed is used to couple\npower to each of the branch waveguide. Carefully oriented slots control both\nthe magnitude and phase of the field distributed from the main feed to each\nbranch. All waveguides can be machined from a single block of metal, with a\nmetamaterial-patterned printed circuit board laminated to the top of the\nassembly. The resulting design is mechanically robust and capable of high power\noperation while retaining the low-cost, low-power consumption, lightweight, and\nlow-profile features common in metasurface antenna designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 15:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

This is a variant of the more general quantum measurement\nproblem. Earlier, we proposed such a mechanism, drawing on quantum-mechanical\nCoulomb scattering and the thermal behavior of supersaturated vapors. Our\nanalysis implied that, in a large enough sample, the probability that a track\noriginates at distance R from the decay source is proportional to 1/R^2, with a\nproportionality constant which we expressed in terms of more fundamental\nparameters involving diverse physical processes, but were unable to estimate at\nthe time. More recently, we tested the 1/R^2 law opportunistically using\npedagogical cloud chamber video posted on the Internet. In the present paper,\nwe draw on the chemical physics literature for an independent estimate of the\nproportionality constant. The estimate is rough, but within about 1.7 orders of\nmagnitude (factor of 50) of a rough value that we derive directly from the\nvideo data. Given the crudeness of the experimental data, the roughness of the\nnumerical estimates, and the extreme spread of concentrations involved (air\nmolecules vs. subcritical vapor clusters of specific sizes), we view this level\nof agreement as significant, at this stage in the theory's development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 20:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}
