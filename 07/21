If the merger remnant is a millisecond magnetar\ninstead of a black hole, a significant proportion of the rotational energy\ndeposited to the emerging ejecta can produce a late-time radio brightening from\nits interaction with the ambient medium. Detection of this late-time radio\nemission from short GRBs can have profound implications for understanding the\nphysics of the progenitor. We report the radio observations of five short GRBs\n- 050709, 061210, 100625A, 140903A, and 160821B using the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 1250, 610, and 325 MHz frequencies after $\\sim$ $2 - 11$\nyears from the time of the burst. The GMRT observations at low frequencies are\nparticularly important to detect the signature of merger ejecta emission at the\npeak. These observations are the most delayed searches associated with some of\nthese GRBs for any late-time low-frequency emission. We find no evidence for\nsuch an emission.

However, how to build direct rotation relationships\nbetween two frames without overlap is still an open topic, which, if solved,\ncould greatly improve the accuracy of visual odometry.\n  In this paper, a new minimal solution is proposed to solve relative rotation\nestimation between two images without overlapping areas by exploiting a new\ngraph structure, which we call Extensibility Graph (E-Graph). Differently from\na co-visibility graph, high-level landmarks, including vanishing directions and\nplane normals, are stored in our E-Graph, which are geometrically extensible.\nBased on E-Graph, the rotation estimation problem becomes simpler and more\nelegant, as it can deal with pure rotational motion and requires fewer\nassumptions, e.g. Manhattan/Atlanta World, planar/vertical motion. Finally, we\nembed our rotation estimation strategy into a complete camera tracking and\nmapping system which obtains 6-DoF camera poses and a dense 3D mesh model.\n  Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 16:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

By making predictions about ongoing processes, bottlenecks can be\nidentified and resources reallocated, as well as insights gained into the state\nof a process instance (case). Traditionally, data is extracted from systems in\nthe form of an event log with a single identifying case notion, such as an\norder id for an Order to Cash (O2C) process.

To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes the locality guidance for improving the performance of VTs\non tiny datasets. We first analyze that the local information, which is of\ngreat importance for understanding images, is hard to be learned with limited\ndata due to the high flexibility and intrinsic globality of the self-attention\nmechanism in VTs. To facilitate local information, we realize the locality\nguidance for VTs by imitating the features of an already trained convolutional\nneural network (CNN), inspired by the built-in local-to-global hierarchy of\nCNN. Under our dual-task learning paradigm, the locality guidance provided by a\nlightweight CNN trained on low-resolution images is adequate to accelerate the\nconvergence and improve the performance of VTs to a large extent. Therefore,\nour locality guidance approach is very simple and efficient, and can serve as a\nbasic performance enhancement method for VTs on tiny datasets.

Among these, two NIRSpec spectra of galaxies at\n$z=7.7$ and one at $z=8.5$ were obtained, revealing for the first time\nrest-frame optical emission line spectra of galaxies in the epoch of\nreionization, including the detection of the important[OIII]4363 auroral line\n(see JWST PR 2022-035). We present an analysis of the emission line properties\nof these galaxies, finding that these galaxies have a high excitation (as\nindicated by high ratios of [OIII]/[OII], [NeIII]/[OII]), strong\n[OIII]4363/H$\\gamma$, high equivalent widths, and other properties which are\ntypical of low-metallicity star-forming galaxies. Using the direct method we\ndetermine oxygen abundances of $12+\\log(O/H)=7.9$ in two $z=7.7$ galaxies, and\na lower metallicity of $12+\\log(O/H)\\approx 7.4-7.5$ in the $z=8.5$ galaxy\nusing different strong line methods. More accurate metallicity determinations\nwill require better data. With stellar masses estimated from SED fits, we find\nthat the three galaxies lie close to or below the $z \\sim 2$ mass-metallicity\nrelation. Overall, these first galaxy spectra at $z \\sim 8$ show a strong\nresemblance of the emission lines properties of galaxies in the epoch of\nreionization with those of relatively rare local analogues previously studied\nfrom the SDSS.

The mainstream 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in\nthe network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and\nspatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range,\nwhich makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient\nlong-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object\ndetector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to\nthe number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon\nthe general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR)\nmodule. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies\ninstance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the\nissue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse\narchitecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR\navoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by\ngrouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nlarge-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and\nstate-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD\nin long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset,\nwhich has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset\n($75m$). On such a large perception range, FSD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and is 2.4$\\times$ faster than the dense counterpart.

The first direct evidence of jet structure near\nthe source in M\\,87 is extreme limb brightening (a double-rail morphology), 0.3\n- 0.6 mas from the source, that is prominent in observations with high\nresolution and sensitivity. Intensity cross-cuts of these images provide three\nstrong, interdependent constraints on the geometry responsible for the\ndouble-rail morphology: the rail to rail separation, the peak to trough\nintensity ratio and the rail widths. Analyzing these constraints indicates that\nhalf or more of the jet volume resides in a thick-walled, tubular, mildly\nrelativistic, protonic jet only $\\sim 0.25$ lt-yr (or $\\sim 300$ M, where M is\nthe central black hole mass in geometrized units) from the source.

We evaluated the detectability\nof these hypothetical planets using (1) a novel approach for estimating the\nmutual inclination dispersion of multi-transiting systems based on transit\nchord length ratios and (2) a model of transit probability and detection\nefficiency that accounts for the impacts of planet multiplicity on\ncompleteness.

Modelling the spectral features due to\nemission and absorption from this very diffuse plasma poses a challenge, as\nboth collisional and photo-ionisation processes must be accounted for. In this\npaper, we study the ionisation by photons emitted by the intra-cluster medium\nin addition to the photo-ionisation by the cosmic UV/X-ray background on gas in\nthe vicinity of galaxy clusters. For near massive clusters such as A2029, the\nionisation parameter can no longer describe the ionisation balance uniquely.\nThe ionisation fractions (in particular of C IV, C V, C VI, N VII, O VI, O VII,\nO VIII, Ne VIII, Ne IX, and Fe XVII) obtained by taking into account the\nphotoionisation by the cosmic background are either an upper or lower limit to\nthe ionisation fraction calculated as a function of distance from the emission\nfrom the cluster. Using a toy model of a cosmic web filament, we predict how\nthe cluster illumination changes the column densities for two different\norientations of the line of sight. For lines of sight passing close to the\ncluster outskirts, O VI can be suppressed by a factor of up to $4.5$, O VII by\na factor of $2.2$, C V by a factor of $3$, and Ne VIII can be boosted by a\nfactor of $2$, for low density gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 17:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The coronal holes act as sources of\nsolar wind that can reach the earth. Thus, coronal holes are used in physical\nmodels for predicting the evolution of solar wind and its potential for\ninterfering with the earth's magnetic field. Due to inherent uncertainties in\nthe physical models, there is a need for a classification system that can be\nused to select the physical models that best match the observed coronal holes.\n  The physical model classification problem is decomposed into three\nsubproblems. First, he thesis develops a method for coronal hole segmentation.\nSecond, the thesis develops methods for matching coronal holes from different\nmaps. Third, based on the matching results, the thesis develops a physical map\nclassification system.\n  A level-set segmentation method is used for detecting coronal holes that are\nobserved in extreme ultra-violet images (EUVI) and magnetic field images. For\nvalidating the segmentation approach, two independent manual segmentations were\ncombined to produce 46 consensus maps. Overall, the level-set segmentation\napproach produces significant improvements over current approaches.\n  Physical map classification is based on coronal hole matching between the\nphysical maps and (i) the consensus maps (semi-automated), or (ii) the\nsegmented maps (fully-automated). Based on the matching results, the system\nuses area differences,shortest distances between matched clusters, number and\nareas of new and missing coronal hole clusters to classify each map. The\nresults indicate that the automated segmentation and classification system\nperforms better than individual humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 17:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

To resolve those problems, we propose Debiasing Alternate Networks\n(DebiAN), which comprises two networks -- a Discoverer and a Classifier. By\ntraining in an alternate manner, the discoverer tries to find multiple unknown\nbiases of the classifier without any annotations of biases, and the classifier\naims at unlearning the biases identified by the discoverer. While previous\nworks evaluate debiasing results in terms of a single bias, we create\nMulti-Color MNIST dataset to better benchmark mitigation of multiple biases in\na multi-bias setting, which not only reveals the problems in previous methods\nbut also demonstrates the advantage of DebiAN in identifying and mitigating\nmultiple biases simultaneously.

However, how this\nenergy is transported and thermalized throughout the Intracluster Medium (ICM)\nremains unclear. In recent work we showed that streaming cosmic rays (CRs)\ndestabilise sound waves in dilute ICM plasmas. Here we show that CR streaming\nin the presence of gravity also destabilises a pressure-balanced wave. We term\nthis new instability the CR buoyancy instability (CRBI). In stark contrast to\nstandard results without CRs, the pressure-balanced mode is highly compressible\nat short wavelengths due to CR streaming. Maximal growth rates are of order\n$(p_c / p_g) \\beta^{1/2} \\omega_{\\rm ff}$, where $p_c/p_g$ is the ratio of CR\npressure to thermal gas pressure, $\\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic\npressure and $\\omega_{\\rm ff}$ is the free-fall frequency. The CRBI operates\nalongside buoyancy instabilities driven by background heat fluxes, i.e. the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the magneto-thermal instability\n(MTI). When the thermal mean free path $l_{\\rm mfp}$ is $\\ll$ the gas scale\nheight $H$, the HBI/MTI set the growth rate on large scales, while the CRBI\nsets the growth rate on small scales. Conversely, when $l_{\\rm mfp} \\sim H$ and\n$(p_c/p_g) \\beta^{1/2} \\gtrsim 1$, CRBI growth rates exceed HBI/MTI growth\nrates even on large scales.

The policy generated can be\nrepresented as a multiway-split tree which is more interpretable and\ninformative than a binary-split tree due to its shorter rules.

The proposed filter propagates a PMB density on\nthe posterior of sets of trajectories through the filtering recursions over\ntime, where the PMB mixture (PMBM) posterior after the update step is\napproximated as a PMB. The efficient PMB approximation relies on several\nimportant theoretical contributions. First, we present a PMBM conjugate prior\non the posterior of sets of trajectories for a generalized measurement model,\nin which each object generates an independent set of measurements. The PMBM\ndensity is a conjugate prior in the sense that both the prediction and the\nupdate steps preserve the PMBM form of the density. Second, we present a factor\ngraph representation of the joint posterior of the PMBM set of trajectories and\nassociation variables for the Poisson spatial measurement model. Importantly,\nleveraging the PMBM conjugacy and the factor graph formulation enables an\nelegant treatment on undetected objects via a Poisson point process and\nefficient inference on sets of trajectories using BP, where the approximate\nmarginal densities in the PMB approximation can be obtained without enumeration\nof different data association hypotheses.

Rhythmic beating and wave propagation by the flagellum propels\nsperm through fluid and enables modulation between penetrative progressive\nmotion, activated side-to-side yaw and hyperactivated motility associated with\ndetachment from epithelial binding. These motility changes occur in response to\nthe properties of the surrounding fluid environment, biochemical activation\nstate, and physiological ligands, however a parsimonious mechanistic\nexplanation of flagellar beat generation that can explain motility modulation\nis lacking.

With the\nenhanced response, exceptional points have been proposed to improve the\nperformance of photonic sensing. Recently, there are intense debate about the\nactual sensing advantage of exceptional points. The major concern is that\nintrinsic noise is also amplified at exceptional points. Here, we aim to\nclarify the contribution of exceptional points for photonic sensing. This is\nachieved by analyzing the condition to realize divergent quantum Fisher\ninformation in linear non-Hermitian photonic systems. We show that the\ndivergence of quantum Fisher information is the result of lasing threshold,\ninstead of exceptional points. However, exceptional points correspond to the\ncondition that lasing threshold is simultaneously achieved across multiple\nphotonic modes. Therefore, exceptional points can further improve the\nsensitivity on top of lasing threshold. On the other hand, exceptional points\nalone cannot provide sensing advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 21:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Due to increasing software and hardware heterogeneity, we\nobserved that there is no single power model that works the best for all server\nconditions. Some complicated machine learning models themselves incur\nperformance and power overheads and hence it is not desirable to use them\nfrequently. There are no power models that consider containerized workload\nexecution. In this paper, we propose a hybrid server power model, Hydra, that\nconsiders both prediction accuracy and performance overhead. Hydra dynamically\nchooses the best power model for the given server conditions.

Different from the horizontal FL\n(HFL) setting where each client has partial data samples, vertical FL (VFL),\nwhich allows each client to collect partial features, has attracted intensive\nresearch efforts recently. In this paper, we identified two challenges that\nstate-of-the-art VFL frameworks are facing: (1) some works directly average the\nlearned feature embeddings and therefore might lose the unique properties of\neach local feature set; (2) server needs to communicate gradients with the\nclients for each training step, incurring high communication cost that leads to\nrapid consumption of privacy budgets. In this paper, we aim to address the\nabove challenges and propose an efficient VFL with multiple linear heads (VIM)\nframework, where each head corresponds to local clients by taking the separate\ncontribution of each client into account. In addition, we propose an\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based method to solve our\noptimization problem, which reduces the communication cost by allowing multiple\nlocal updates in each step, and thus leads to better performance under\ndifferential privacy.

Despite\nthe substantial symmetry of the input, remarkably little is known about the\nsymmetric circulant TSP, and the complexity of the problem has been an\noften-cited open question. Considerable effort has been made to understand the\ncase in which only edges of two lengths are allowed to have finite cost: the\ntwo-stripe symmetric circulant TSP. In this paper, we resolve the complexity of\nthe two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP. To do so, we reduce two-stripe\nsymmetric circulant TSP to the problem of finding certain minimum-cost\nHamiltonian paths on cylindrical graphs. We then solve this Hamiltonian path\nproblem. Our results show that the two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP is in P.\nNote that a two-stripe symmetric circulant TSP instance consists of a constant\nnumber of inputs (including $n$, the number of cities), so that a\npolynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem must run in time\npolylogarithmic in $n$, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the optimization\nproblem cannot output the tour. We address this latter difficulty by showing\nthat the optimal tour must fall into one of two parameterized classes of tours,\nand that we can output the class and the parameters in polynomial time. Thus we\nmake a substantial contribution to the set of polynomial-time solvable special\ncases of the TSP, and take an important step towards resolving the complexity\nof the general symmetric circulant TSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 01:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The second one is splitting the channels into overlapping or\nnon-overlapping segments, with or without shared parameters, and applying our\nproposed channel mixing approaches or 3D convolution to mix channel\ninformation.

We\nshow, both theoretically and experimentally, that SplitMixer performs on par\nwith the state-of-the-art MLP-like models while having a significantly lower\nnumber of parameters and FLOPS.

The Semantic GAN aims to align the semantic feature\ndistribution between the support domain and target domain. Different from the\nconventional image-to-image translation methods that perform at the image\nlevel, the Semantic GAN performs the generation and discrimination on the\nsemantic level with the Semantic Generator Module (SGM) and Semantic\nDiscriminator Module (SDM). For target images (scene text images), the Semantic\nGenerator Module generates simple semantic features that share the same feature\ndistribution with support images (clear text images). The Semantic\nDiscriminator Module is used to distinguish the semantic features between the\nsupport domain and target domain. In addition, a Balanced Attention Module is\ndesigned to alleviate the problem of attention drift. The Balanced Attention\nModule first learns a balancing parameter based on the visual glimpse vector\nand semantic glimpse vector, and then performs the balancing operation for\nobtaining a balanced glimpse vector.

However, due to the heterogeneous nature of local\ndata, it is challenging to optimize or even define fairness of the trained\nglobal model for the agents. For instance, existing work usually considers\naccuracy equity as fairness for different agents in FL, which is limited,\nespecially under the heterogeneous setting, since it is intuitively \"unfair\" to\nenforce agents with high-quality data to achieve similar accuracy to those who\ncontribute low-quality data, which may discourage the agents from participating\nin FL. In this work, we propose a formal FL fairness definition, fairness via\nagent-awareness (FAA), which takes different contributions of heterogeneous\nagents into account. Under FAA, the performance of agents with high-quality\ndata will not be sacrificed just due to the existence of large amounts of\nagents with low-quality data. In addition, we propose a fair FL training\nalgorithm based on agent clustering (FOCUS) to achieve fairness in FL measured\nby FAA.

Since\nadversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity,\nfocusing on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted\nmuch attention. However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g.,\nAuto-Attack. This paper experimentally reveals that the cause of their\nvulnerability is their small margins between logits for the true label and the\nother labels. Since neural networks classify the data points based on the\nlogits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid flipping the largest\nlogit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase logit margins of\nimportant samples but decrease those of less-important samples compared with\ncross-entropy loss.

Derived by applying Onsager's variational principle, the\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model is employed as a minimal model capable of\ndescribing the interfacial motion driven by not only advection but also\ndiffusion.

To\naddress this gap, in this study, we examine the human mobility network in eight\nparishes in Louisiana (USA) impacted by the 2021 Hurricane Ida. We constructed\nhuman mobility networks using location-based data and examined three sets of\nmeasures: (1) macroscopic measures, such as network density, giant component\nsize, and modularity; (2) substructure measures, such motif distribution; and\n(3) microscopic mobility measures, such as the radius of gyration and average\ntravel distance.

To further\nenhance the performance of the constituent methods, we integrate a conditional\nensemble method to aggregate their decisions, with a negligibly limited number\nof encoding passes. The experiment, carried out on the optimized software\nencoder implementation of the VVC standard, called VVenC, shows significant\nperformance improvement. When compared to static bitrate ladder, the proposed\nmethod can offer about 13% bitrate reduction in terms of BD-BR with a\nnegligible additional computational overhead. Conversely, when compared to the\nfully specialized bitrate ladder method, the proposed method can offer about\n86% to 92% complexity reduction, at cost the of only 0.8% to 0.9% coding\nefficiency drop in terms of BD-BR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 06:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 08:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

To obtain the representations, they extract features from\npedestrian proposals, and then project them on a unit hypersphere with L2\nnormalization. These methods also incorporate all positive proposals, that\nsufficiently overlap with the ground truth, equally to learn person\nrepresentations for reID.

We also\nconfirm our results using experiments where the imposed gradients are allowed\nto decay. To achieve this, we use weakly compressible three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations of isotropically forced homogeneous turbulence. We\nfind that the turbulent viscosity and thermal diffusion, as well as their ratio\nthe turbulent Prandtl number, ${\\rm Pr}_{\\rm t} = \\nu_{\\rm t}/\\chi_{\\rm t}$,\napproach asymptotic values at sufficiently high Reynolds and Pecl\\'et numbers.\nWe also do not find a significant dependence of ${\\rm Pr}_{\\rm t}$ on the\nmicroscopic Prandtl number ${\\rm Pr} = \\nu/\\chi$. These findings are in stark\ncontrast to results from the $k-\\epsilon$ model which suggests that ${\\rm\nPr}_{\\rm t}$ increases monotonically with decreasing ${\\rm Pr}$. The current\nresults are relevant for the ongoing debate of, for example, the nature of the\nturbulent flows in the very low ${\\rm Pr}$ regimes of stellar convection zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

UFO aims to benefit each\nsingle task with a large-scale pretraining on all tasks. Compared with the well\nknown foundation model, UFO has two different points of emphasis, i.e.,\nrelatively smaller model size and NO adaptation cost: 1) UFO squeezes a wide\nrange of tasks into a moderate-sized unified model in a multi-task learning\nmanner and further trims the model size when transferred to down-stream tasks.\n2) UFO does not emphasize transfer to novel tasks. Instead, it aims to make the\ntrimmed model dedicated for one or more already-seen task. With these two\ncharacteristics, UFO provides great convenience for flexible deployment, while\nmaintaining the benefits of large-scale pretraining. A key merit of UFO is that\nthe trimming process not only reduces the model size and inference consumption,\nbut also even improves the accuracy on certain tasks. Specifically, UFO\nconsiders the multi-task training and brings two-fold impact on the unified\nmodel: some closely related tasks have mutual benefits, while some tasks have\nconflicts against each other. UFO manages to reduce the conflicts and to\npreserve the mutual benefits through a novel Network Architecture Search (NAS)\nmethod. Experiments on a wide range of deep representation learning tasks\n(i.e., face recognition, person re-identification, vehicle re-identification\nand product retrieval) show that the model trimmed from UFO achieves higher\naccuracy than its single-task-trained counterpart and yet has smaller model\nsize, validating the concept of UFO. Besides, UFO also supported the release of\n17 billion parameters computer vision (CV) foundation model which is the\nlargest CV model in the industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

In this work, to achieve high average bit-reduction with less\naccuracy loss, we propose a novel Content-Aware Dynamic Quantization (CADyQ)\nmethod for SR networks that allocates optimal bits to local regions and layers\nadaptively based on the local contents of an input image. To this end, a\ntrainable bit selector module is introduced to determine the proper bit-width\nand quantization level for each layer and a given local image patch.

This study presents a lightweight and safe\nauthentication strategy for the user-gateway (U GW) IoT network model. The\nproposed system is designed leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). We\nundertake a formal security analysis with both the Automated Validation of\nInternet Security Protocols (AVISPA) and Burrows Abadi Needham (BAN) logic\ntools and an information security assessment with the Delev Yao channel. We use\npublish subscribe based Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for\ncommunication. Additionally, the performance analysis and comparison of\nsecurity features show that the proposed scheme is resilient to well known\ncryptographic threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 08:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Because\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) have an enormous capacity to memorize noisy labels,\na robust training scheme is required to prevent labeling errors from degrading\nthe generalization performance of DNNs. Current state-of-the-art methods\npresent a co-training scheme that trains dual networks using samples associated\nwith small losses. In practice, however, training two networks simultaneously\ncan burden computing resources. In this study, we propose a simple yet\neffective robust training scheme that operates by training only a single\nnetwork. During training, the proposed method generates temporal self-ensemble\nby sampling intermediate network parameters from the weight trajectory formed\nby stochastic gradient descent optimization. The loss sum evaluated with these\nself-ensembles is used to identify incorrectly labeled samples. In parallel,\nour method generates multi-view predictions by transforming an input data into\nvarious forms and considers their agreement to identify incorrectly labeled\nsamples. By combining the aforementioned metrics, we present the proposed {\\it\nself-ensemble-based robust training} (SRT) method, which can filter the samples\nwith noisy labels to reduce their influence on training. Experiments on\nwidely-used public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a\nstate-of-the-art performance in some categories without training the dual\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 08:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Learning-based techniques which solve\nthe ill-posed problem of LF reconstruction from sparse (1, 2 or 4) views have\nsignificantly reduced the requirement for complex hardware. LF video\nreconstruction from sparse views poses a special challenge as acquiring\nground-truth for training these models is hard. Hence, we propose a\nself-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from\nmonocular videos. We use self-supervised geometric, photometric and temporal\nconsistency constraints inspired from a recent self-supervised technique for LF\nvideo reconstruction from stereo video. Additionally, we propose three key\ntechniques that are relevant to our monocular video input. We propose an\nexplicit disocclusion handling technique that encourages the network to inpaint\ndisoccluded regions in a LF frame, using information from adjacent input\ntemporal frames. This is crucial for a self-supervised technique as a single\ninput frame does not contain any information about the disoccluded regions. We\nalso propose an adaptive low-rank representation that provides a significant\nboost in performance by tailoring the representation to each input scene.\nFinally, we also propose a novel refinement block that is able to exploit the\navailable LF image data using supervised learning to further refine the\nreconstruction quality. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates\nthe significance of each of the proposed building blocks and also the superior\nresults compared to previous state-of-the-art monocular LF reconstruction\ntechniques. We further validate our algorithm by reconstructing LF videos from\nmonocular videos acquired using a commercial GoPro camera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 08:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Intrinsic differences in\nthe resulting collateral choice option valuation and its implications for\ncollateral management are presented.

These\nprocedures are computationally expensive due to the large number of flow\nsimulations required for data assimilation and optimization. Existing CLRM\nprocedures are applied asset by asset, without utilizing information that could\nbe useful over a range assets. Here, we develop a CLRM framework for multiple\nassets with varying numbers of wells. We use deep reinforcement learning to\ntrain a single global control policy that is applicable for all assets\nconsidered. The new framework is an extension of a recently introduced control\npolicy methodology for individual assets. Embedding layers are incorporated\ninto the representation to handle the different numbers of decision variables\nthat arise for the different assets. Because the global control policy learns a\nunified representation of useful features from multiple assets, it is less\nexpensive to construct than asset-by-asset training (we observe about 3x\nspeedup in our examples). The production optimization problem includes a\nrelative-change constraint on the well settings, which renders the results\nsuitable for practical use. We apply the multi-asset CLRM framework to 2D and\n3D water-flooding examples. In both cases, four assets with different well\ncounts, well configurations, and geostatistical descriptions are considered.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate that the global control policy provides\nobjective function values, for both the 2D and 3D cases, that are nearly\nidentical to those from control policies trained individually for each asset.\nThis promising finding suggests that multi-asset CLRM may indeed represent a\nviable practical strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 09:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

This paper extends an effect system for verifying temporal,\nvalue-dependent properties on event sequences yielded by programs to the\ndelimited control operators shift0/reset0. While these delimited control\noperators enable useful and powerful programming techniques, they hinder\nreasoning about the behavior of programs because of their ability to suspend,\nresume, discard, and duplicate delimited continuations. This problem is more\nserious in effect systems for temporal properties because these systems must be\ncapable of identifying what event sequences are yielded by captured\ncontinuations. Our key observation for achieving effective reasoning in the\npresence of the delimited control operators is that their use modifies answer\neffects, which are temporal effects of the continuations. Based on this\nobservation, we extend an effect system for temporal verification to\naccommodate answer-effect modification. Allowing answer-effect modification\nenables easily reasoning about traces that captured continuations yield.\nAnother novel feature of our effect system is the support for dependently-typed\ncontinuations, which allows us to reason about programs more precisely.

Adaptive\ninference based efficient video recognition methods typically preview videos\nand focus on salient parts to reduce computation costs. Most existing works\nfocus on complex networks learning with video classification based objectives.\nTaking all frames as positive samples, few of them pay attention to the\ndiscrimination between positive samples (salient frames) and negative samples\n(non-salient frames) in supervisions. To fill this gap, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Non-saliency Suppression Network (NSNet), which effectively\nsuppresses the responses of non-salient frames. Specifically, on the frame\nlevel, effective pseudo labels that can distinguish between salient and\nnon-salient frames are generated to guide the frame saliency learning.

Volvocine algae are models for this\ntransition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas to\nmulticellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on\nthe surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in\nthese species is of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and\nintercellular connections; steering is a consequence of the response of\nindividual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell organism\nwith a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing\nillumination of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time\ntuned to the rotation period of the colony around its primary axis. Here,\ncombining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse with 3D\ntracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies\nphototaxis of Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the\nrotations around an axis perpendicular to the flagellar beat plane that occur\nthrough the adaptive response to oscillating light levels as the organism\nspins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar\nphotoresponse and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that\naccurately describes the observed photoalignment. In showing that the adaptive\ntime scale is tuned to the organisms' rotational period across three orders of\nmagnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis\nin green algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise\nfrom the individual flagella of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium\nand the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 10:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

There are two major issues with the current autonomous\ndriving system: the prediction module is often separated from the planning\nmodule and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a differentiable integrated prediction-planning\nframework (DIPP) that can also learn the cost function from data. Specifically,\nour framework uses a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner,\nwhich takes as input the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents given by\nthe neural network and optimizes the trajectory for the autonomous vehicle,\nenabling all operations to be differentiable, including the cost function\nweights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving\ndataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and\nvalidated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing\nresults reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across\na variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing\nthe planning module to output trajectories close to those of human drivers. In\nclosed-loop testing, the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods,\nshowing the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness\nagainst the distributional shift. Importantly, we find that joint training of\nplanning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with\na separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests.\nMoreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the\nframework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 11:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 06:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In the multi-band radar sensing signal model, there\nare many local optimums in the associated likelihood function due to the\nexistence of high frequency component, which makes it difficult to obtain\nhigh-accuracy parameter estimation. To cope with this challenge, we divide the\nradar target parameter estimation into two stages equipped with different but\nequivalent signal models, where the first-stage coarse estimation is used to\nnarrow down the search range for the next stage, and the second-stage refined\nestimation is based on the Bayesian approach to avoid the convergence to a bad\nlocal optimum of the likelihood function. Specifically, in the coarse\nestimation stage, we employ a weighted root MUSIC algorithm to achieve initial\nestimation. Then, we apply the block stochastic successive convex approximation\n(SSCA) approach to derive a novel stochastic particle-based variational\nBayesian inference (SPVBI) algorithm for the Bayesian estimation of the radar\ntarget parameters in the refined stage. Unlike the conventional particle-based\nVBI (PVBI) in which only the probability of each particle is optimized and the\nper-iteration computational complexity increases exponentially with the number\nof particles, the proposed SPVBI optimizes both the position and probability of\neach particle, and it adopts the block SSCA to significantly improve the\nsampling efficiency by averaging over iterations.

Recent studies leverage the advantage\nof self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active\nsemantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class\nactivation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer\nneglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses\nthe semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization\nresults significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate\nWSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial\nrelationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a\nlearnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial\ncontext intensities for effective information propagation.

This work describes an inner boundary condition for ambient\nsolar wind models based on tomography maps of the coronal plasma density gained\nfrom coronagraph observations, providing a novel alternative to magnetic\nextrapolations. The tomographical density maps provide a direct constraint of\nthe coronal structure at heliocentric distances of 4 to 8Rs, thus avoiding the\nneed to model the complex non-radial lower corona. An empirical inverse\nrelationship converts densities to solar wind velocities which are used as an\ninner boundary condition by the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation (HUXt) model\nto give ambient solar wind velocity at Earth. The dynamic time warping (DTW)\nalgorithm is used to quantify the agreement between tomography/HUXt output and\nin situ data. An exhaustive search method is then used to adjust the lower\nboundary velocity range in order to optimize the model. Early results show up\nto a 32% decrease in mean absolute error between the modelled and observed\nsolar wind velocities compared to that of the coupled MAS/HUXt model. The use\nof density maps gained from tomography as an inner boundary constraint is thus\na valid alternative to coronal magnetic models, and offers a significant\nadvancement in the field given the availability of routine space-based\ncoronagraph observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 13:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The highly heterogeneous appearance of cancer, presence\nof ultrasound artefacts, and noise all contribute to these difficulties.

Our\naim is to investigate the development of a robust deep learning model\nspecifically for micro-ultrasound-guided prostate cancer biopsy. For the model\nto be clinically adopted, a key challenge is to design a solution that can\nconfidently identify the cancer, while learning from coarse histopathology\nmeasurements of biopsy samples that introduce weak labels.

Recent work proposed DNN\nsupervisors to detect high-uncertainty inputs before their possible\nmisclassification leads to any harm. To test and compare the capabilities of\nDNN supervisors, researchers proposed test generation techniques, to focus the\ntesting effort on high-uncertainty inputs that should be recognized as\nanomalous by supervisors. However, existing test generators can only produce\nout-of-distribution inputs.

Furthermore, the so-called unbiased\nchannel estimation in the discrete-Fresnel domain has also been investigated\nfor both communication and sensing systems, however without considering the\neffects of frequency shifts.

Molecular bonds present in the material have vibrational\nfrequencies which affect the amount of light measured at each wavelength.

Spins having more than three components may minimize the energy more\neffectively against frustration by allowing bigger angles between\nnearest-neighbors, leading to ground states in higher than three-dimensional\nspin space. Platonic solids in three and four dimensions, which have equivalent\nsites and consist of only one type of polygon, have lowest-energy\nconfigurations in a number of spin dimensions equal to their real-space\ndimensionality. The same is true for the Archimedean solids, which have\nequivalent sites but consist of more than one type of polygon. Fullerene\nmolecules and geodesic icosahedra, whose sites are not equivalent, can produce\nground states in as many as five spin dimensions. It is also found that the\nintroduction of interactions in the next bigger dimension does not necessarily\nlower the energy immediately, but it typically takes a finite coupling for this\nto happen.

As compared with routine lab analysis, our mobile soil analysis system\nhas correctly classified soil pH in 97% of cases while reducing the analysis\nturnaround time from days to minutes. Moreover, by performing on-the-spot\nanalyses of individual compound sub-samples in the field, we have achieved a\n9-fold increase of spatial resolution that reveals pH-variations not detectable\nin compound mapping mode. Our mobile system can be extended to perform\nmulti-parameter chemical tests of soil nutrients for applications in\nenvironmental monitoring at marginal manufacturing cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 15:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The\nconventional mmWave standard, IEEE 802.11ad, considers establishing only one\nmmWave link in wireless local area network (WLAN) to provide multi Gbps data\nrate. But, mmWave has a tenuous channel which hinders it from providing such\nrate. Hence, it's necessary to establish multiple mmWave links simultaneously\nby deploying a multiple number of mmWave access points (APs) in 5G networks.\nUnfortunately, applying conventional standard without any modifications for\nmmWave concurrent transmission impedes mmWave APs from selecting optimum mmWave\nconcurrent links. Because IEEE 802.11ad standard associates the user equipment\n(UEs) to mmWave APs using the link that has the maximum received power without\nconsidering mutual interference between simultaneous links. In this paper, a\njoint proportional fairness scheduling (JPFS) optimization problem for\nestablishing optimum mmWave concurrent transmission links is formulated. And,\nto find a solution to this non-polynomial (NP) time problem, we use exhaustive\nsearch (ES) scheme. Numerical simulation proves the effectiveness of using the\nES scheme to improve the system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 10:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

By generating adversarial examples with slight perturbations on\ndifferent levels (sentence / word / character), adversarial attacks can fool\nPrLMs to generate incorrect predictions, which questions the robustness of\nPrLMs. However, we find that most existing textual adversarial examples are\nunnatural, which can be easily distinguished by both human and machine. Based\non a general anomaly detector, we propose a novel metric (Degree of Anomaly) as\na constraint to enable current adversarial attack approaches to generate more\nnatural and imperceptible adversarial examples. Under this new constraint, the\nsuccess rate of existing attacks drastically decreases, which reveals that the\nrobustness of PrLMs is not as fragile as they claimed. In addition, we find\nthat four types of randomization can invalidate a large portion of textual\nadversarial examples. Based on anomaly detector and randomization, we design a\nuniversal defense framework, which is among the first to perform textual\nadversarial defense without knowing the specific attack. Empirical results show\nthat our universal defense framework achieves comparable or even higher\nafter-attack accuracy with other specific defenses, while preserving higher\noriginal accuracy at the same time. Our work discloses the essence of textual\nadversarial attacks, and indicates that (1) further works of adversarial\nattacks should focus more on how to overcome the detection and resist the\nrandomization, otherwise their adversarial examples would be easily detected\nand invalidated; and (2) compared with the unnatural and perceptible\nadversarial examples, it is those undetectable adversarial examples that pose\nreal risks for PrLMs and require more attention for future robustness-enhancing\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}
