This is a follow-up work of our previous\ndevelopment of a conservative low rank tensor approach for Vlasov dynamics\n(arXiv:2201.10397). In that work, we applied a low rank tensor method with a\nconservative singular value decomposition (SVD) to the high dimensional VP\nsystem to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, while maintaining the local\nconservation of mass and momentum. However, energy conservation is not\nguaranteed, which is a critical property to avoid unphysical plasma\nself-heating or cooling. The new ingredient in the LoMaC low rank tensor\nalgorithm is that we simultaneously evolve the macroscopic conservation laws of\nmass, momentum and energy using a flux-difference form with kinetic flux vector\nsplitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank\nkinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables\nby a conservative orthogonal projection. The algorithm is extended to the high\ndimensional problems by hierarchical Tuck decomposition of solution tensors and\na corresponding conservative projection algorithm. Extensive numerical tests on\nthe VP system are showcased for the algorithm's efficacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 16:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

The former theory provides an array of techniques to\ncharacterize a wide class of microstructures; in this work, we apply them to\nthe distributions of galaxies. We focus on the lower-order correlation\nfunctions, `void' and `particle' nearest-neighbor functions, pair-connectedness\nfunctions, percolation properties, and a scalar order metric. Compared to\nhomogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological\nsimulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the\nnearest-neighbor functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range\ncorrelations. On large scales, the system appears `hyperuniform', due to\nprimordial density fluctuations, whilst on the smallest scales, the system\nbecomes almost `antihyperuniform', and, via the order metric, is shown to be a\nhighly correlated disordered system. Via a finite scaling analysis, we show\nthat the percolation threshold of the galaxy catalogs is significantly lower\nthan for Poisson realizations; this is consistent with the observation that the\ngalaxy distribution contains larger voids. However, the two sets of simulations\nshare a fractal dimension, implying that they lie in the same universality\nclass. Finally, we consider the ability of large-scale clustering statistics to\nconstrain cosmological parameters using simulation-based inference. Both the\nnearest-neighbor distribution and pair-connectedness function considerably\ntighten bounds on the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations at a level\nequivalent to observing twenty-five times more galaxies.

We focus on the particularly\nchallenging situation where the past dynamical state time series that is\navailable for ML training predominantly lies in a restricted region of the\nstate space, while the behavior to be predicted evolves on a larger state space\nset not fully observed by the ML model during training. In this situation, it\nis required that the ML prediction system have the ability to extrapolate to\ndifferent dynamics past that which is observed during training. We investigate\nthe extent to which ML methods are capable of accomplishing useful results for\nthis task, as well as conditions under which they fail. In general, we found\nthat the ML methods were surprisingly effective even in situations that were\nextremely challenging, but do (as one would expect) fail when ``too much\"\nextrapolation is required. For the latter case, we investigate the\neffectiveness of combining the ML approach with conventional modeling based on\nscientific knowledge, thus forming a hybrid prediction system which we find can\nenable useful prediction even when its ML-based and knowledge-based components\nfail when acting alone. We also found that achieving useful results may require\nusing very carefully selected ML hyperparameters and we propose a\nhyperparameter optimization strategy to address this problem. The main\nconclusion of this paper is that ML-based approaches are promising tools for\npredicting the behavior of non-stationary dynamical systems even in the case\nwhere the future evolution (perhaps due to the crossing of a tipping point)\nincludes dynamics on a set outside of that explored by the training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 16:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

As an\nexample, the possibility to iteratively generate or modify images by manually\nadding specific items is a desired property that, to our knowledge, has not\nbeen fully investigated in the literature. In this work we propose a\ntransformer-based approach conditioned by scene graphs that, conversely to\nrecent transformer-based methods, also employs a decoder to autoregressively\ncompose images, making the synthesis process more effective and controllable.\nThe proposed architecture is composed by three modules: 1) a graph\nconvolutional network, to encode the relationships of the input graph; 2) an\nencoder-decoder transformer, which autoregressively composes the output image;\n3) an auto-encoder, employed to generate representations used as input/output\nof each generation step by the transformer.

Classically,\nthis system undergoes a series of transitions between Kasner epochs, which are\ndescribed by a specific transition law. This law is derived based on the\nconservation of certain physical quantities and the rotational symmetry of the\nsystem. In a quantum scenario, however, fluctuations and higher-order moments\nmodify these quantities, and consequently also the transition rule. In\nparticular, we perform a canonical quantization of the model and then\nanalytically obtain the modifications of this transition law for semiclassical\nstates peaked around classical trajectories. The transition rules for the\nquantum moments are also obtained, and a number of interesting properties are\nderived concerning the coupling between the different degrees of freedom. More\nimportantly, we show that, due to the presence of quantum-gravity effects and\ncontrary to the classical model, there appear certain finite ranges of the\nKasner parameters for which the system will not undergo further transitions and\nwill follow a Kasner regime until the singularity.

Utilising these large samples to study the inner structure\nof lens galaxies requires source redshifts, to turn lens models into mass\nmeasurements. However, obtaining spectroscopic source redshifts for large lens\nsamples is prohibitive with the capacity of spectroscopic facilities.\nAlternatively, we study the possibility of obtaining source photometric\nredshifts (photo-zs) for large lens samples. Our strategy consists of\ndeblending the source and lens light by simultaneously modelling the lens and\nbackground source in all available photometric bands, and feeding the derived\nsource colours to a template-fitting photo-z algorithm. We describe the lens\nand source light with a Sersic profile, and the lens mass with a Singular\nIsothermal Ellipsoid. We test our approach on a simulated and a real sample of\nlenses, both in broad-band photometry of the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We\nidentify the deviations of the lens light from a Sersic profile and the\ncontrast between the lens and source image as the main drivers of the source\ncolour measurement error. We split the real sample based on the ratio $\\Lambda$\nof the lens to source surface brightness measured at the image locations. In\nthe $\\Lambda<1$ regime, the photo-z outlier fraction is $20\\%$, and the\naccuracy of photo-z estimation is limited by the performance of\ntemplate-fitting process. In the opposite regime, the photo-z outlier fraction\nis $75\\%$, and the errors from the source colour measurements dominate the\nphoto-z uncertainty. Measuring source photo-zs for lenses with $\\Lambda<1$\nposes no particular challenges, compared to isolated galaxies.

The model can be\nused to predict the asymptotic mass loss limit for orbiting subhaloes, solely\nas a function of the initial structure of the subhalo and the value of the\ntidal field at pericentre. Predictions can easily be made for differently\nconcentrated host-haloes with and without baryonic components, which differ\nmost notably in their relation between pericentre radius and tidal field.

Neutron stars are surrounded by ultra-relativistic particles\nefficiently accelerated by ultra strong electromagnetic fields.

It is the purpose of this paper\nto study particle acceleration and radiation reaction damping in a rotating\nmagnetic dipole with realistic field strengths typical of millisecond and young\npulsars as well as of magnetars. To this end, we implemented an exact\nanalytical particle pusher including radiation reaction in the reduced\nLandau-Lifshitz approximation where the electromagnetic field is assumed\nconstant in time and uniform in space during one time step integration. The\nposition update is performed using a velocity Verlet method. We extensively\ntested our algorithm against time independent background electromagnetic fields\nlike the electric drift in cross electric and magnetic fields and the magnetic\ndrift and mirror motion in a dipole. Eventually, we apply it to realistic\nneutron star environments. We investigated particle acceleration and the impact\nof radiation reaction for electrons, protons and iron nuclei plunged around\nmillisecond pulsars, young pulsars and magnetars, comparing it to situations\nwithout radiation reaction.

While natural language (NL) is ambiguous, real world tasks and their\nsafety requirements need to be communicated unambiguously. Signal Temporal\nLogic (STL) is a formal logic that can serve as a versatile, expressive, and\nunambiguous formal language to describe robotic tasks. On one hand, existing\nwork in using STL for the robotics domain typically requires end-users to\nexpress task specifications in STL, a challenge for non-expert users.\n  On the other, translating from NL to STL specifications is currently\nrestricted to specific fragments. In this work, we propose DIALOGUESTL, an\ninteractive approach for learning correct and concise STL formulas from (often)\nambiguous NL descriptions. We use a combination of semantic parsing,\npre-trained transformer-based language models, and user-in-the-loop\nclarifications aided by a small number of user demonstrations to predict the\nbest STL formula to encode NL task descriptions. An advantage of mapping NL to\nSTL is that there has been considerable recent work on the use of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to identify control policies for robots. We show we can use Deep\nQ-Learning techniques to learn optimal policies from the learned STL\nspecifications. We demonstrate that DIALOGUESTL is efficient, scalable, and\nrobust, and has high accuracy in predicting the correct STL formula with a few\nnumber of demonstrations and a few interactions with an oracle user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 19:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In the undoped two-leg\nladder spin-singlets occupy ladder rungs, and doped ladders are characterized\nby superconducting correlations with quasi-long range order (quasi-LRO).\nPressure-induced SC in Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ (SCCO) has long been\nexplained within one-band ladder theories. The dramatic pressure-driven\ncrossover from quasi one-to-two dimensional (1D-to-2D) transport and the\nsimultaneous vanishing of the spin gap due to ladder singlets in the metallic\nstate preceding SC however lie outside the scope of ladder-based theories.\nRecent demonstration of rapid decay of superconducting correlations with\ndistance within a realistic multiband model of the cuprate ladder gives\nadditional credence to this viewpoint.

We present a biologically plausible model of\noff-policy reinforcement learning in the basal ganglia, which enables learning\nin such an architecture. The model accounts for action-related modulation of\ndopamine activity that is not captured by previous models that implement\non-policy algorithms. In particular, the model predicts that dopamine activity\nsignals a combination of reward prediction error (as in classic models) and\n\"action surprise,\" a measure of how unexpected an action is relative to the\nbasal ganglia's current policy. In the presence of the action surprise term,\nthe model implements an approximate form of Q-learning. On benchmark navigation\nand reaching tasks, we show empirically that this model is capable of learning\nfrom data driven completely or in part by other policies (e.g. from other brain\nregions). By contrast, models without the action surprise term suffer in the\npresence of additional policies, and are incapable of learning at all from\nbehavior that is completely externally driven. The model provides a\ncomputational account for numerous experimental findings about dopamine\nactivity that cannot be explained by classic models of reinforcement learning\nin the basal ganglia. These include differing levels of action surprise signals\nin dorsal and ventral striatum, decreasing amounts movement-modulated dopamine\nactivity with practice, and representations of action initiation and kinematics\nin dopamine activity. It also provides further predictions that can be tested\nwith recordings of striatal dopamine activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 19:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Long scan times can lead to\nmotion artifacts, for example due to bulk patient motion such as head movement\nand periodic motion produced by the heart or lungs. Motion artifacts can\ndegrade image quality and in some cases render the scans nondiagnostic. To\ncombat this problem, prospective and retrospective motion correction techniques\nhave been introduced. More recently, data driven methods using deep neural\nnetworks have been proposed. As a large number of publicly available MRI\ndatasets are based on Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequences, methods that use them for\ntraining should incorporate the correct FSE acquisition dynamics.\nUnfortunately, when simulating training data, many approaches fail to generate\naccurate motion-corrupt images by neglecting the effects of the temporal\nordering of the k-space lines as well as neglecting the signal decay throughout\nthe FSE echo train. In this work, we highlight this consequence and demonstrate\na training method which correctly simulates the data acquisition process of FSE\nsequences with higher fidelity by including sample ordering and signal decay\ndynamics. Through numerical experiments, we show that accounting for the FSE\nacquisition leads to better motion correction performance during inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 20:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

The\nmulti-resolution approach addresses issues such as the computational expense of\naccurate hydraulic fracture simulations and the difficulties associated with\nreconstructing crack apertures from diffuse fracture representations. In the\nglobal domain, a coupled system of equations for displacements and pressures is\nconsidered. The crack geometry is assumed to be fixed and the displacement\nfield is enriched with discontinuous functions. Around the crack tips in the\nlocal subdomains, phase-field sub-problems are instantiated on the fly to\npropagate fractures in arbitrary, mesh independent directions.

While existing approaches only model\nfinite, discrete fidelities, in practice, the fidelity choice is often\ncontinuous and infinite, which can correspond to a continuous mesh spacing or\nfinite element length. In this paper, we propose Infinite Fidelity\nCoregionalization (IFC). Given the data, our method can extract and exploit\nrich information within continuous, infinite fidelities to bolster the\nprediction accuracy. Our model can interpolate and/or extrapolate the\npredictions to novel fidelities, which can be even higher than the fidelities\nof training data. Specifically, we introduce a low-dimensional latent output as\na continuous function of the fidelity and input, and multiple it with a basis\nmatrix to predict high-dimensional solution outputs. We model the latent output\nas a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to capture the complex\nrelationships within and integrate information throughout the continuous\nfidelities.

This paper proposes a two-stage\nstochastic optimization strategy to optimally place the PV smart inverters with\nVolt-VAr capability for distribution systems with high photovoltaic (PV)\npenetration to mitigate voltage violation issues. The proposed optimization\nstrategy enables a planningstage guide for upgrading the existing PV inverters\nto smart inverters with Volt-VAr capability while considering the\noperationstage characteristics of the Volt-VAr control. One advantage of this\nplanning strategy is that it utilizes the local control capability of the smart\ninverter that requires no communication, thus avoiding issues related to\ncommunication delays and failures. Another advantage is that the Volt-VAr\ncontrol characteristic is internally integrated into the optimization model as\na set of constraints, making placement decisions more accurate. The objective\nof the optimization is to minimize the upgrading cost and the number of the\nsmart inverters required while maintaining the voltage profile within the\nacceptable range.

This reduces\nthe modeling capacity and leaves models unable to capture long-range\nrelationships. The primary reason for the shallow design results from\nover-smoothing, which leads node states to become more similar with increased\ndepth. We build on the close connection between GNNs and PageRank, for which\npersonalized PageRank introduces the consideration of a personalization vector.\nAdopting this idea, we propose the Personalized PageRank Graph Neural Network\n(PPRGNN), which extends the graph convolutional network to an infinite-depth\nmodel that has a chance to reset the neighbor aggregation back to the initial\nstate in each iteration. We introduce a nicely interpretable tweak to the\nchance of resetting and prove the convergence of our approach to a unique\nsolution without placing any constraints, even when taking infinitely many\nneighbor aggregations. As in personalized PageRank, our result does not suffer\nfrom over-smoothing. While doing so, time complexity remains linear while we\nkeep memory complexity constant, independently of the depth of the network,\nmaking it scale well to large graphs.

In an image captioning task, BLIP remarks upon the race of\nAsian individuals as much as 36% of the time, but never remarks upon race for\nWhite individuals. Finally, provided with an initialization image from the CFD\nand the text \"an American person,\" a synthetic image generator (VQGAN) using\nthe text-based guidance of CLIP lightens the skin tone of individuals of all\nraces (by 35% for Black individuals, based on pixel brightness).

Existing\nreactive controllers for self-collision avoidance cannot guarantee\ncollision-free trajectories as they do not leverage the robot's full dynamics,\nthus compromising kinematic feasibility. In comparison, the proposed CBF-WBC\ncontroller can reason about the robot's underactuated dynamics in real-time to\nguarantee collision-free motions. The effectiveness of this approach is\nvalidated in simulation. First, a simple hand-reaching experiment shows that\nthe CBF-WBC enables the robot's hand to deviate from an infeasible reference\ntrajectory to avoid self-collisions. Second, the CBF-WBC is combined with a\nlinear model predictive controller (LMPC) designed for dynamic locomotion, and\nthe CBF-WBC is used to track the LMPC predictions.

In this paper we\ndemonstrate data pruning-a method for increasing adversarial training\nefficiency through data sub-sampling.We empirically show that data pruning\nleads to improvements in convergence and reliability of adversarial training,\nalbeit with different levels of utility degradation. For example, we observe\nthat using random sub-sampling of CIFAR10 to drop 40% of data, we lose 8%\nadversarial accuracy against the strongest attackers, while by using only 20%\nof data we lose 14% adversarial accuracy and reduce runtime by a factor of 3.\nInterestingly, we discover that in some settings data pruning brings benefits\nfrom both worlds-it both improves adversarial accuracy and training time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 23:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Whilst THz\nsignals suffer from severe propagation losses, a massive antenna array can be\ndeployed at the base station (BS) to mitigate those losses through beamforming.\nNevertheless, a large number of antennas increases the hardware complexity and\ncircuit power consumption, and hence it can lead to poor energy efficiency\n(EE). To surmount this fundamental problem, we propose a novel array design\nbased on coupled antenna pairs. Specifically, we exploit the mutual coupling\nbetween closely spaced antennas to form superdirective pairs. A unique property\nof them is that all require the same excitation amplitude, and therefore can be\ndriven by a single radio frequency chain akin to conventional phased arrays.\nMoreover, they facilitate the implementation of multi-port impedance matching,\nwhich ensures maximum power transfer for any beamforming angle. After\naddressing the hardware-related problems of superdirectivity, we show that the\nnumber of BS antennas can be effectively reduced without sacrificing the\nachievable rate.

In this work, we use data from\nTwitter to explore English and Spanish considering the rank diversity at\ndifferent scales: temporal (from 3 to 96 hour intervals), spatial (from 3km to\n3000+km radii), and grammatical (from monograms to pentagrams). We find that\nall three scales are relevant. However, the greatest changes come from\nvariations in the grammatical scale. At the lowest grammatical scale\n(monograms), the rank diversity curves are most similar, independently on the\nvalues of other scales, languages, and countries. As the grammatical scale\ngrows, the rank diversity curves vary more depending on the temporal and\nspatial scales, as well as on the language and country. We also study the\nstatistics of Twitter-specific tokens: emojis, hashtags, and user mentions.\nThese particular type of tokens show a sigmoid kind of behaviour as a rank\ndiversity function. Our results are helpful to quantify aspects of language\nstatistics that seem universal and what may lead to variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 01:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 15:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

To obtain more\ninformation to optimize the model, the existing method generated pseudo\nframe-wise labels iteratively based on the output of a segmentation model and\nthe timestamp annotations. However, this practice may introduce noise and\noscillation during the training, and lead to performance degeneration.

The MDM framework is\nincorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed for decentralized\nstochastic search without communication for detecting stationary targets\n(fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple\nsensors (varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely\nunknown area. The MDM framework consists of a metacognitive component and a\nself-cognitive component. The metacognitive component helps to self-regulate\nthe search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of\n\"which-sensor-to-use\", \"when-to-switch-sensor\", and \"how-to-search\". Each\nsensor possesses inverse characteristics for the sensing attributes like\nsensing range and accuracy. Based on the information gathered by multiple\nsensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different\nlevels of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching. The\nlower levels of search aim to localize the search space for the possible\npresence of a target (detection) with different sensors. The highest level of a\nsearch exploits the search space for target confirmation using the sensor with\nthe highest accuracy among all sensors. The performance of the MDM framework\nwith two sensors having low accuracy with wide range sensor for detection and\nincreased accuracy with low range sensor for confirmation is evaluated through\nMonte-Carlo simulations and compared with six multi-UAV stochastic search\nalgorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive\nbased search).

By periodically driving the interspecies\ninteractions and pulsing the tunneling between the two modes of each gas, a\nsynthetic gauge field is generated. We derive an effective Hamiltonian in the\nshort pulse limit which resembles the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian where the\nmagnetic flux per plaquette is controlled by the ratio of the interaction\nenergy and the driving frequency. The quasispectrum of the Floquet operator of\nthe driving sequence shows the celebrated Hofstadter's butterfly pattern as\nwell as the existence of edge states. From the calculation of the local Chern\nmarker, we establish that the FSL has non-trivial topology and by simulating\nthe dynamics of the edge states, show that they exhibit chirality. Finally, the\ninclusion of the intraspecies interactions creates an overall harmonic trap in\nthe lattice and introduces the nonlinear effect of macroscopic quantum\nself-trapping which is shown to hinder the movement along the edge of the\nlattice. This work introduces a new avenue to explore synthetic gauge fields\nand provides a link between non-trivial condensed matter systems and quantum\ngases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 05:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 10:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

While there are techniques for\nverifying DNNs with formal guarantees, they are limited in scalability and\naccuracy. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction-refinement approach for\nscalable and exact DNN verification. Specifically, we propose a novel\nabstraction to break down the size of DNNs by over-approximation. The result of\nverifying the abstract DNN is always conclusive if no spurious counterexample\nis reported. To eliminate spurious counterexamples introduced by abstraction,\nwe propose a novel counterexample-guided refinement that refines the abstract\nDNN to exclude a given spurious counterexample while still over-approximating\nthe original one. Our approach is orthogonal to and can be integrated with many\nexisting verification techniques. For demonstration, we implement our approach\nusing two promising and exact tools Marabou and Planet as the underlying\nverification engines, and evaluate on widely-used benchmarks ACAS Xu, MNIST and\nCIFAR-10. The results show that our approach can boost their performance by\nsolving more problems and reducing up to 86.3% and 78.0% verification time,\nrespectively.

Binary stars\nconsisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence star are cataclysmic variable\n(CV) candidates. The magnitude distribution of CV candidates is bimodal up to 2\nGyr. The bright CV population is particularly bright in FUV-NUV. The FUV-NUV\ncolor of our model clusters is 1-2 mag redder than the UV-excess globular\nclusters in M 87 and in the Milky Way.

The\nconstructions of the polynomial invariant and its categorification are natural\nin the sense that if we treat Legendrian knots as only knots (that is, we\nforget the geometry on the knots), then we recover the Jones polynomial and\nKhovanov homology respectively. In the end, we discuss strengths and\nlimitations of these invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 09:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Existing free-text\nrationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's\npredicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics'\nreliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label\nconsistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three\naxioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales,\nwhich maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately\nsensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should\nbe robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text\nclassification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all\nthree FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which\nmuddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric\nthat greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing\ncompetitively on (2).

Although learning\ndifferent objects' local differences via Deep Neural Networks has achieved\nsuccess, how to exploit the query-support cross-image object semantic relations\nin Transformer-based architecture remains under-explored in the few-shot\nfine-grained scenario. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based\ndouble-helix model, namely HelixFormer, to achieve the cross-image object\nsemantic relation mining in a bidirectional and symmetrical manner. The\nHelixFormer consists of two steps: 1) Relation Mining Process (RMP) across\ndifferent branches, and 2) Representation Enhancement Process (REP) within each\nindividual branch. By the designed RMP, each branch can extract fine-grained\nobject-level Cross-image Semantic Relation Maps (CSRMs) using information from\nthe other branch, ensuring better cross-image interaction in semantically\nrelated local object regions. Further, with the aid of CSRMs, the developed REP\ncan strengthen the extracted features for those discovered semantically-related\nlocal regions in each branch, boosting the model's ability to distinguish\nsubtle feature differences of fine-grained objects. Extensive experiments\nconducted on five public fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate that HelixFormer\ncan effectively enhance the cross-image object semantic relation matching for\nrecognizing fine-grained objects, achieving much better performance over most\nstate-of-the-art methods under 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

While various models are commonly employed to\ndescribe these dynamics, a prominent example being the microscopic three\ntemperature model (M3TM), systematic, quantitative comparisons to both the\ndynamics of energy flow and magnetic order are scarce. Here, we apply a M3TM to\nthe ultrafast magnetic order dynamics of the layered antiferromagnet\nGdRh$_2$Si$_2$. The femtosecond dynamics of electronic temperature, surface\nferromagnetic order, and bulk antiferromagnetic order were explored at various\npump fluences employing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved resonant magnetic soft x-ray diffraction, respectively. After\noptical excitation, both the surface ferromagnetic order and the bulk\nantiferromagnetic order dynamics exhibit two-step demagnetization behaviors\nwith two similar timescales (<1 ps, ~10 ps), indicating a strong exchange\ncoupling between localized 4f and itinerant conduction electrons. Despite a\ngood qualitative agreement, the M3TM predicts larger demagnetization than our\nexperimental observation, which can be phenomenologically described by a\ntransient, fluence-dependent increased N\\'eel temperature. Our results indicate\nthat effects beyond a mean-field description have to be considered for a\nquantitative description of ultrafast magnetic order dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 10:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In this work, we\ncarry out the DL-based downscaling to estimate the local precipitation data\nfrom the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which was created by\napproximating the value from station location to a grid point. To test the\nefficacy of different DL approaches, we apply four different methods of\ndownscaling and evaluate their performance.

A custom VGG network, used in the\nSR-GAN, is developed in this work using precipitation data. The results\nindicate that SR-GAN is the best method for precipitation data downscaling.

The origin of the magnetic field,\nwhich is a key component of the launching process, is still an open question.\nHere we address the question of how the magnetic field required for jet\nlaunching is generated and maintained by a dynamo process. By carrying out\nnon-ideal MHD simulations (PLUTO code), we investigate how the feedback of the\ngenerated magnetic field on the mean-field dynamo affects the disk and jet\nproperties. We find that a stronger quenching of the dynamo leads to a\nsaturation of the magnetic field at a lower disk magnetization. Nevertheless,\nwe find that, while applying different dynamo feedback models, the overall jet\nproperties remain unaffected. We then investigate a feedback model which\nencompasses a quenching of the magnetic diffusivity. Our modeling considers a\nmore consistent approach for mean-field dynamo modeling simulations, as the\nmagnetic quenching of turbulence should be considered for both, a turbulent\ndynamo and turbulent magnetic diffusivity. We find that, after the magnetic\nfield is saturated, the Blandford-Payne mechanism can work efficiently, leading\nto more collimated jets, that move, however, with slower speed. We find strong\nintermittent periods of flaring and knot ejection for low Coriolis numbers. In\nparticular, flux ropes are built up and advected towards the inner disk thereby\ncutting off of the inner disk wind, leading to magnetic field reversals,\nreconnection and the emergence of intermittent flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 12:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

ImLoveNet\nis simple to implement yet effective, since 1) the misaligned image provides\nclearer overlap information for the two low-overlap point clouds to better\nlocate overlap parts; 2) it contains certain geometry knowledge to extract\nbetter deep features; and 3) it does not require the extrinsic parameters of\nthe imaging device with respect to the reference frame of the 3D point cloud.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on different kinds of\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our ImLoveNet over\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 13:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

However, the underwater image acquisition has defects such as weak\nlight, low resolution, and many interferences, while the existing target\ndetection algorithms are not effective.

These symmetries\nfall within the standard definition of higher-form symmetries in quantum field\ntheory, and the corresponding symmetry generators are topological. Worldlines\nof particles are regarded as the charged objects of 1-form symmetries, and\nmobility restrictions can be implemented by introducing additional 1-form\nsymmetries whose generators do not commute with spatial translations. These\nfeatures are realized by effective field theories associated with spontaneously\nbroken nonuniform 1-form symmetries. At low energies, the theories reduce to\nknown higher-rank gauge theories such as scalar/vector charge gauge theories,\nand the gapless excitations in these theories are interpreted as\nNambu--Goldstone modes for higher-form symmetries. Due to the nonuniformity of\nthe symmetry, some of the modes acquire a gap, which is the higher-form\nanalogue of the inverse Higgs mechanism of spacetime symmetries.

The special structure of the shipping\nmarket attracted the interest of both academics and practitioners, since\npricing of the related traded options which are written on non-storable assets\n(i.e. the freight service) is not a trivial task. Management of freight risk is\nof major importance to preserve the viability of shipping operations,\nespecially in periods where shocks appear in the world economy, which\nintroduces uncertainty in the freight rate prices. In practice, the reduction\nof freight risk is almost exclusively performed by constructing hedging\nportfolios relying on freight rate options.

Moreover, objects in\nthe overlap region are often largely occluded or suffer from deformation due to\ncamera distortion, causing a domain shift. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nusing the following two main modules: (1) Stereo Disparity Estimation for Weak\nDepth Supervision and (2) Adversarial Overlap Region Discriminator. The former\nutilizes the traditional stereo disparity estimation method to obtain reliable\ndisparity information from the overlap region. Given the disparity estimates as\nsupervision, we propose regularizing the network to fully utilize the geometric\npotential of binocular images and improve the overall detection accuracy\naccordingly.

While reliability is\noften referenced with respect to on-schedule arrivals and departures, in this\nstudy we are interested in the ability of the system to satisfy the total\npassenger demand. This is crucial, since if the capacity of the system is not\nenough to satisfy all the passengers, then ridership will inevitably drop.\nHowever, quantifying this excess demand is not straightforward since public\ntransit data, and in particular data from bus systems that we focus on in this\nstudy, only include information for people that got on the bus, and not those\nthat were left behind at a stop due to a full bus.

These instances of\npotential excess demand are filtered out from the training phase of the Poisson\nregression. We show through simulated data that this filtering is able to\nremove the bias introduced by the censored data logged by the system.
