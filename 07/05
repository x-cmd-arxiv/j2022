It is\nthen advantageous to learn relations automatically from the data, as learning\nwith predefined labels cannot capture all possible relations. However, current\nrelation learning methods typically require supervision, and are not designed\nto generalize to scenes with more complicated relational structures than those\nseen during training. Here, we introduce ViRel, a method for unsupervised\ndiscovery and learning of Visual Relations with graph-level analogy. In a\nsetting where scenes within a task share the same underlying relational\nsubgraph structure, our learning method of contrasting isomorphic and\nnon-isomorphic graphs discovers the relations across tasks in an unsupervised\nmanner. Once the relations are learned, ViRel can then retrieve the shared\nrelational graph structure for each task by parsing the predicted relational\nstructure. Using a dataset based on grid-world and the Abstract Reasoning\nCorpus, we show that our method achieves above 95% accuracy in relation\nclassification, discovers the relation graph structure for most tasks, and\nfurther generalizes to unseen tasks with more complicated relational\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 16:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Standard approaches to estimating\nrelative risk available in common software packages may produce biased\ninference when applied to correlated binary data collected from longitudinal or\nclustered studies.

While the Black-Scholes model is well-known for pricing stock\nderivatives such as stock options, a larger portion of derivatives are based on\ninterest rates instead of stocks. Pricing interest rate derivatives used to be\nchallenging, as their previous models employed either the instantaneous\ninterest or forward rate that could not be directly observed in the market.\nThis has been much improved since LMM was raised, as it uses directly\nobservable interbank offered rates and is expected to be more precise.\nRecently, quantum computing has been used to speed up option pricing tasks, but\nrarely on structured interest rate derivatives. Given the size of the interest\nrate derivatives market and the widespread use of LMM, we employ quantum\ncomputing to price an interest rate derivative, caps, based on the LMM. As caps\npricing relates to path-dependent Monte Carlo iterations for different tenors,\nwhich is common for many complex structured derivatives, we developed our\nhybrid classical-quantum approach that applies the quantum amplitude estimation\nalgorithm to estimate the expectation for the last tenor. We show that our\nhybrid approach still shows better convergence than pure classical Monte Carlo\nmethods, providing a useful case study for quantum computing with a greater\ndiversity of derivatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 16:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

The\nmethod yields competitive experimental results. In continuous control problems\nwith infinitely many states, our value function minimizes its prediction error\nby simultaneously learning a small set of `probing states' and a mapping from\nactions produced in probing states to the policy's return. The method extracts\ncrucial abstract knowledge about the environment in form of very few states\nsufficient to fully specify the behavior of many policies.

To\nestablish that, we formulate a selectivity metric that quantifies the system\nperformance and captures the capability of the nanoantenna to induce a\nconformational change in the desired protein molecule/population. The metric\nprovides a score between -1 and 1 that indicates the degree of control we have\nover the system to achieve targeted protein interactions.

By learning the causal relationships between image semantic labels or\ntabular variables, we can analyze biases, intervene on the generative model,\nand simulate new scenarios. Furthermore, by modifying the causal structure, we\ncan generate samples outside the domain of the original training data and use\nsuch counterfactual models to de-bias datasets. Thus, datasets with known\nbiases can still be used to train the causal generative model and learn the\ncausal relationships, but we can produce de-biased datasets on the generative\nside. Our proposed method combines a causal latent space VAE model with\nspecific modification to emphasize causal fidelity, enabling finer control over\nthe causal layer and the ability to learn a robust intervention framework. We\nexplore how better disentanglement of causal learning and encoding/decoding\ngenerates higher causal intervention quality. We also compare our model against\nsimilar research to demonstrate the need for explicit generative de-biasing\nbeyond interventions. Our initial experiments show that our model can generate\nimages and tabular data with high fidelity to the causal framework and\naccommodate explicit de-biasing to ignore undesired relationships in the causal\ndata compared to the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 16:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 16:18:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Here, we study the displacement of silicone oil by water in a\nmostly oil-wet porous media patterned with discrete water-wet clusters that\nhave precisely controlled wettability. Surprisingly, the macroscopic\ndisplacement pattern varies dramatically depending on the details of\nwettability alteration -- the invading water preferentially fills strongly\nwater-wet clusters but encircles weakly water-wet clusters instead, resulting\nin significant trapping of the defending oil. We explain this counter-intuitive\nobservation with pore-scale simulations, which reveal that the fluid-fluid\ninterfaces at mixed-wet pores resemble an S-shaped saddle with mean curvatures\nclose to zero. We show that incorporation of the capillary entry pressures at\nmixed-wet pores into a dynamic pore-network model reproduces the experiments.\nOur work demonstrates the complex nature of wettability control in mixed-wet\nporous media, and it presents experimental and numerical platforms upon which\nfurther insights can be drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 17:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 01:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Recently, transformers have shown their strong\ncapability in various applications by capturing global pixel interactions and\nthis capability is highly desirable in shadow removal. However, applying\ntransformers to promote shadow removal is non-trivial for the following two\nreasons: 1) The patchify operation is not suitable for shadow removal due to\nirregular shadow shapes; 2) shadow removal only needs one-way interaction from\nthe non-shadow region to the shadow region instead of the common two-way\ninteractions among all pixels in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncross-region transformer, namely CRFormer, for shadow removal which differs\nfrom existing transformers by only considering the pixel interactions from the\nnon-shadow region to the shadow region without splitting images into patches.\nThis is achieved by a carefully designed region-aware cross-attention operation\nthat can aggregate the recovered shadow region features conditioned on the\nnon-shadow region features.

Moreover,\nit is interesting to explore whether DNN classifiers can circumvent the curse\nof dimensionality in handling high-dimensional data. The contributions of this\npaper are two-fold.

Methods to handle such problems\nmust specify what structure is common between the domains and what varies. A\nnatural assumption is that causal (structural) relationships are invariant in\nall domains. Then, it is tempting to learn a predictor for label $Y$ that\ndepends only on its causal parents. However, many real-world problems are\n\"anti-causal\" in the sense that $Y$ is a cause of the covariates $X$ -- in this\ncase, $Y$ has no causal parents and the naive causal invariance is useless. In\nthis paper, we study representation learning under a particular notion of\ndomain shift that both respects causal invariance and that naturally handles\nthe \"anti-causal\" structure.

On the other hand, the\nVO-Enhanced VPS Module also improves the segmentation accuracy by fusing the\npanoptic segmentation result of the current frame on the fly to the adjacent\nframes, using geometric information such as camera pose, depth, and optical\nflow obtained from the VO Module. These two modules contribute to each other\nthrough recurrent iterative optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat PVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual odometry and video\npanoptic segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 17:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 17:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

For transparent\nand ethical applications of such models, sound audit frameworks need to be\ndeveloped. In this paper, an audit framework for technical assessment of\nregression MLMs is proposed. The focus is on three aspects, model,\ndiscrimination, and transparency and explainability. These aspects are\nsubsequently divided into sub aspects. Contributors, such as inter MLM group\nfairness, feature contribution order, and aggregated feature contribution, are\nidentified for each of these sub aspects. To measure the performance of the\ncontributors, the framework proposes a shortlist of KPIs. A traffic light risk\nassessment method is furthermore coupled to these KPIs. For assessing\ntransparency and explainability, different explainability methods (SHAP and\nLIME) are used, which are compared with a model intrinsic method using\nquantitative methods and machine learning modelling. Using an open source\ndataset, a model is trained and tested and the KPIs are computed. It is\ndemonstrated that popular explainability methods, such as SHAP and LIME,\nunderperform in accuracy when interpreting these models. They fail to predict\nthe order of feature importance, the magnitudes, and occasionally even the\nnature of the feature contribution. For other contributors, such as group\nfairness and their associated KPIs, similar analysis and calculations have been\nperformed with the aim of adding profundity to the proposed audit framework.\nThe framework is expected to assist regulatory bodies in performing conformity\nassessments of AI systems using multilevel binomial classification models at\nbusinesses. It will also benefit businesses deploying MLMs to be future proof\nand aligned with the European Commission proposed Regulation on Artificial\nIntelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 17:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 09:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

VI\nproceeds in batches, where the update to the value of each state must be\ncompleted before the next batch of updates can begin. Completing a single batch\nis prohibitively expensive if the state space is large, rendering VI\nimpractical for many applications. Asynchronous VI helps to address the large\nstate space problem by updating one state at a time, in-place and in an\narbitrary order. However, Asynchronous VI still requires a maximization over\nthe entire action space, making it impractical for domains with large action\nspace. To address this issue, we propose doubly-asynchronous value iteration\n(DAVI), a new algorithm that generalizes the idea of asynchrony from states to\nstates and actions. More concretely, DAVI maximizes over a sampled subset of\nactions that can be of any user-defined size. This simple approach of using\nsampling to reduce computation maintains similarly appealing theoretical\nproperties to VI without the need to wait for a full sweep through the entire\naction space in each update. In this paper, we show DAVI converges to the\noptimal value function with probability one, converges at a near-geometric rate\nwith probability 1-delta, and returns a near-optimal policy in computation time\nthat nearly matches a previously established bound for VI. We also empirically\ndemonstrate DAVI's effectiveness in several experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 17:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2022 12:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Yet, because\nof its black-box nature, the results by random forests can be hard to interpret\nin many big data applications. Quantifying the usefulness of individual\nfeatures in random forests learning can greatly enhance its interpretability.\nExisting studies have shown that some popularly used feature importance\nmeasures for random forests suffer from the bias issue. In addition, there lack\ncomprehensive size and power analyses for most of these existing methods. In\nthis paper, we approach the problem via hypothesis testing, and suggest a\nframework of the self-normalized feature-residual correlation test (FACT) for\nevaluating the significance of a given feature in the random forests model with\nbias-resistance property, where our null hypothesis concerns whether the\nfeature is conditionally independent of the response given all other features.\nSuch an endeavor on random forests inference is empowered by some recent\ndevelopments on high-dimensional random forests consistency. The vanilla\nversion of our FACT test can suffer from the bias issue in the presence of\nfeature dependency. We exploit the techniques of imbalancing and conditioning\nfor bias correction.

As long as the frictional strength is nowhere exceeded, the\nblocks stick against each other, allowing for large rotations. Once the\ninterfacial stresses exceed the frictional strength, relative sliding between\nthe blocks alters the structure's mechanical response. Improving the structural\nperformance, precisely the strength and the toughness, has been one of the main\nfocal points in the literature. However, many fundamental questions regarding\nthe role and effect of the interface mechanisms (stick and slip) and rotation\nof the blocks have not been addressed yet. Here, we carry out a parametric\nanalysis to understand the effect of Young's modulus, friction coefficient and\ngeometry of the blocks on the dominance of the stick or slip governed\nmechanism. We combine analytical and computational tools to analyze the failure\nmechanisms and the response capacities of beam-like topologically interlocked\nstructures. This is achieved using a finite element method coupled with a\npenalty-based approach for enforcing contact constraints along interfaces. We\nshow that the combination of the structure's height and the friction\ncoefficient controls whether the failure mechanism is slip-governed or\nstick-governed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sticking mechanism across\nall interfaces along with the rotation of the blocks dictates a saturation\nlevel to the mechanical performance of a given structure irrespective of\ngeometric and material properties. This provides a theoretical upper bound for\nthe structural response of topologically interlocked structures and establishes\na theoretical benchmark of achievable performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 19:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 20:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

To tackle the\nexisting challenges, especially to enable the generation of multiple distinct\nmotions from the same text, and to avoid the undesirable production of trivial\nmotionless pose sequences, we propose the use of motion token, a discrete and\ncompact motion representation. This provides one level playing ground when\nconsidering both motions and text signals, as the motion and text tokens,\nrespectively. Moreover, our motion2text module is integrated into the inverse\nalignment process of our text2motion training pipeline, where a significant\ndeviation of synthesized text from the input text would be penalized by a large\ntraining loss; empirically this is shown to effectively improve performance.\nFinally, the mappings in-between the two modalities of motions and texts are\nfacilitated by adapting the neural model for machine translation (NMT) to our\ncontext. This autoregressive modeling of the distribution over discrete motion\ntokens further enables non-deterministic production of pose sequences, of\nvariable lengths, from an input text. Our approach is flexible, could be used\nfor both text2motion and motion2text tasks.

Many studies have used such libraries to carry out empirical\ninvestigations on predictive Software Engineering (SE) tasks. However, the\ndifferences stemming from using one library over another have been overlooked,\nimplicitly assuming that using any of these libraries would provide the user\nwith the same or very similar results. This paper aims at raising awareness of\nthe differences incurred when using different ML libraries for software\ndevelopment effort estimation (SEE), one of most widely studied SE prediction\ntasks. To this end, we investigate 4 deterministic machine learners as provided\nby 3 of the most popular ML open-source libraries written in different\nlanguages (namely, Scikit-Learn, Caret and Weka). We carry out a thorough\nempirical study comparing the performance of the machine learners on 5 SEE\ndatasets in the two most common SEE scenarios (i.e., out-of-the-box-ml and\ntuned-ml) as well as an in-depth analysis of the documentation and code of\ntheir APIs. The results of our study reveal that the predictions provided by\nthe 3 libraries differ in 95% of the cases on average across a total of 105\ncases studied. These differences are significantly large in most cases and\nyield misestimations of up to approx. 3,000 hours per project. Moreover, our\nAPI analysis reveals that these libraries provide the user with different\nlevels of control on the parameters one can manipulate, and a lack of clarity\nand consistency, overall, which might mislead users. Our findings highlight\nthat the ML library is an important design choice for SEE studies, which can\nlead to a difference in performance. However, such a difference is\nunder-documented. We conclude by highlighting open-challenges with suggestions\nfor the developers of libraries as well as for the researchers and\npractitioners using them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 20:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

In this\npaper, we aim to improve the generalization ability of the compositional action\nrecognition model to novel verbs or novel nouns that are unseen during training\ntime, by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs. Previous work utilizes\nverb-noun compositional action nodes in the knowledge graph, making it\ninefficient to scale since the number of compositional action nodes grows\nquadratically with respect to the number of verbs and nouns. To address this\nissue, we propose our approach: Disentangled Action Recognition with\nKnowledge-bases (DARK), which leverages the inherent compositionality of\nactions. DARK trains a factorized model by first extracting disentangled\nfeature representations for verbs and nouns, and then predicting classification\nweights using relations in external knowledge graphs. The type constraint\nbetween verb and noun is extracted from external knowledge bases and finally\napplied when composing actions. DARK has better scalability in the number of\nobjects and verbs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Charades\ndataset.

In this paper, we introduce a method to\ndesign nonlinear waveguides with arbitrarily shaped effective nonlinearity\nprofiles. The method takes advantage of the fact that the second order\nnonlinear response is a tensor quantity and thus the local effective\nnonlinearity of a material depends on the propagation direction of the fields\nparticipating in the interaction.

In real-world applications, however, a trained FG-SBIR model is\noften applied to both new categories and different human sketchers, i.e.,\ndifferent drawing styles. Although this complicates the generalisation problem,\nfortunately, a handful of examples are typically available, enabling the model\nto adapt to the new category/style. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective\n-- instead of asking for a model that generalises, we advocate for one that\nquickly adapts, with just very few samples during testing (in a few-shot\nmanner). To solve this new problem, we introduce a novel model-agnostic\nmeta-learning (MAML) based framework with several key modifications: (1) As a\nretrieval task with a margin-based contrastive loss, we simplify the MAML\ntraining in the inner loop to make it more stable and tractable. (2) The margin\nin our contrastive loss is also meta-learned with the rest of the model. (3)\nThree additional regularisation losses are introduced in the outer loop, to\nmake the meta-learned FG-SBIR model more effective for category/style\nadaptation. Extensive experiments on public datasets suggest a large gain over\ngeneralisation and zero-shot based approaches, and a few strong few-shot\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 21:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 15:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 11:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

These prior models,\nhowever, suffer from limitations that are distinct from those of continuous\nflows. Most notably, discrete flow-based models cannot be straightforwardly\noptimized with conventional deep learning methods because gradients of discrete\nfunctions are undefined or zero. Previous works approximate pseudo-gradients of\nthe discrete functions but do not solve the problem on a fundamental level. In\naddition to that, backpropagation can be computationally burdensome compared to\nalternative discrete algorithms such as decision tree algorithms. Our approach\nseeks to reduce computational burden and remove the need for pseudo-gradients\nby developing a discrete flow based on decision trees -- building upon the\nsuccess of efficient tree-based methods for classification and regression for\ndiscrete data. We first define a tree-structured permutation (TSP) that\ncompactly encodes a permutation of discrete data where the inverse is easy to\ncompute; thus, we can efficiently compute the density value and sample new\ndata. We then propose a decision tree algorithm to build TSPs that learns the\ntree structure and permutations at each node via novel criteria.

However, the limitations\nof computing resources, battery capacity, and maximum load of UAV hinder the\ndeployment of deep learning-based tracking algorithms on UAV. Consequently,\ndiscriminative correlation filters (DCF) trackers stand out in the UAV tracking\ncommunity because of their high efficiency. However, their precision is usually\nmuch lower than trackers based on deep learning. Model compression is a\npromising way to narrow the gap (i.e., effciency, precision) between DCF- and\ndeep learning- based trackers, which has not caught much attention in UAV\ntracking. In this paper, we propose the P-SiamFC++ tracker, which is the first\nto use rank-based filter pruning to compress the SiamFC++ model, achieving a\nremarkable balance between efficiency and precision. Our method is general and\nmay encourage further studies on UAV tracking with model compression.

With SESS, existing saliency approaches become robust to\nscale variance, multiple occurrences of target objects, presence of distractors\nand generate less noisy and more discriminative saliency maps. SESS improves\nsaliency by fusing saliency maps extracted from multiple patches at different\nscales from different areas, and combines these individual maps using a novel\nfusion scheme that incorporates channel-wise weights and spatial weighted\naverage. To improve efficiency, we introduce a pre-filtering step that can\nexclude uninformative saliency maps to improve efficiency while still enhancing\noverall results.

A few examples\ninclude fixing failures like false negatives/positives of a learned model or\nmitigating class imbalance in a dataset. The targeted selection task requires\nfinding the relevant data from a large-scale pool of unlabeled data. Manual\nmining at this scale is infeasible. Further, the OOI are often small and occupy\nless than 1% of image area, are occluded, and co-exist with many semantically\ndifferent objects in cluttered scenes. Existing semantic image retrieval\nmethods often focus on mining for larger sized geographical landmarks, and/or\nrequire extra labeled data, such as images/image-pairs with similar objects,\nfor mining images with generic objects. We propose a fast and robust template\nmatching algorithm in the DNN feature space, that retrieves semantically\nsimilar images at the object-level from a large unlabeled pool of data. We\nproject the region(s) around the OOI in the query image to the DNN feature\nspace for use as the template.

In our\nformalism, a microcanonical ensemble is specified by two parameters, i.e., the\nenergy of the system and its associated energy window. Accordingly, the density\nof states is expressed as a sum of Gaussians centered at the target energy with\nits spread corresponding to the width of the energy window. We then show that\nthe thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and temperature are calculated by\nevaluating the trace of the time-evolution operator and the trace of the\ntime-evolution operator multiplied by the Hamiltonian of the system. We also\ndescribe how these traces can be evaluated using random diagonal-unitary\ncircuits appropriate to quantum computation. The pure quantum state\nrepresenting our microcanonical ensemble is related to a state of the form\nintroduced by Wall and Neuhauser for the filter diagonalization method [M. R.\nWall and D.

However, most existing works assume both\ntasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the\nsub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task\ndistribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a\nmore realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks,\ni.e., source and target tasks are continuously evolving over time. We\ntheoretically show that the expected error on the dynamic target task can be\ntightly bounded in terms of source knowledge and consecutive distribution\ndiscrepancy across tasks. This result motivates us to propose a generic\nmeta-learning framework L2E for modeling the knowledge transferability on\ndynamic tasks. It is centered around a task-guided meta-learning problem with a\ngroup of meta-pairs of tasks, based on which we are able to learn the prior\nmodel initialization for fast adaptation on the newest target task. L2E enjoys\nthe following properties: (1) effective knowledge transferability across\ndynamic tasks; (2) fast adaptation to the new target task; (3) mitigation of\ncatastrophic forgetting on historical target tasks; and (4) flexibility in\nincorporating any existing static transfer learning algorithms.

Specifically, the approval mechanism is\nused to delegate the privilege of spending users' tokens to DApps. By doing so,\nthe DApps can transfer these tokens to arbitrary receivers on behalf of the\nusers. To increase the usability, unlimited approval is commonly adopted by\nDApps to reduce the required interaction between them and their users.

However, the evaluation result suggests that only 0.2% of\nusers follow the good practice to mitigate the risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 03:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

The parameterized quantum circuit\n(PQC), a major building block of a QNN, consists of several layers of\nsingle-qubit rotations and multi-qubit entanglement operations. The optimum\nnumber of PQC layers for a particular ML task is generally unknown. A larger\nnetwork often provides better performance in noiseless simulations. However, it\nmay perform poorly on hardware compared to a shallower network. Because the\namount of noise varies amongst quantum devices, the optimal depth of PQC can\nvary significantly. Additionally, the gates chosen for the PQC may be suitable\nfor one type of hardware but not for another due to compilation overhead. This\nmakes it difficult to generalize a QNN design to wide range of hardware and\nnoise levels. An alternate approach is to build and train multiple QNN models\ntargeted for each hardware which can be expensive. To circumvent these issues,\nwe introduce the concept of knowledge distillation in QNN using approximate\nsynthesis. The proposed approach will create a new QNN network with (i) a\nreduced number of layers or (ii) a different gate set without having to train\nit from scratch. Training the new network for a few epochs can compensate for\nthe loss caused by approximation error. Through empirical analysis, we\ndemonstrate ~71.4% reduction in circuit layers, and still achieve ~16.2% better\naccuracy under noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 04:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Logic locking emerges as a\nprimary design-for-security measure to counter these threats, where ICs become\nfully functional only when unlocked with a secret key. However, Boolean\nsatisfiability-based attacks have rendered most locking schemes ineffective.\nThis gives rise to numerous defenses and new locking methods to achieve SAT\nresiliency. This paper provides a unique perspective on the SAT attack\nefficiency based on conjunctive normal form (CNF) stored in SAT solver. First,\nwe show how the attack learns new relations between keys in every iteration\nusing distinguishing input patterns and the corresponding oracle responses. The\ninput-output pairs result in new CNF clauses of unknown keys to be appended to\nthe SAT solver, which leads to an exponential reduction in incorrect key\nvalues. Second, we demonstrate that the SAT attack can break any locking scheme\nwithin linear iteration complexity of key size.

Flat field processing is\nindispensable to remove the instrumental non-uniformity of a solar EUV imager\nin producing high-quality scientific data from original observed data.\nFengyun-3E (FY-3E) is a meteorological satellite operated in Sun-synchronous\norbit, and the routine EUV imaging data from the Solar X-ray and Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) onboard FY-3E has the characteristics of concentric\nrotation. Taking advantage of the concentric rotation, we propose a post-hoc\nflat field measurement method for its EUV 195 channel in this paper. This\nmethod removes small-scale and time-varying component of the coronal activities\nby taking the median value for each pixel along the time axis of a concentric\nrotation data cube, and then derives large-scale and invariable component of\nthe quiet coronal radiation, and finally generates a flat field image. Analysis\nshows that our method is able to measure the instrumental spot-like\nnon-uniformity possibly caused by contamination on the detector, which mostly\ndisappears after the in-orbit self-cleaning process. It can also measure the\nquasi-periodic grid-like non-uniformity, possibly from the obscuration of the\nsupport mesh on the rear filter. After flat field correction, these\ninstrumental non-uniformities from the original data are effectively removed.\nX-EUVI 195 data after dark and flat field corrections are consistent with the\n193 channel data from SDO/AIA, verifying the suitability of the method.

In this paper, we extend our previous Glow-WaveGAN to\nGlow-WaveGAN 2, aiming to solve the problem from both stages for high-quality\nzero-shot text-to-speech and any-to-any voice conversion.

Based on a continuous speaker space and the\nreversible property of flows, the conditional distribution can be obtained for\nany speaker, and thus we can further conduct high-quality zero-shot speech\ngeneration for new speakers.

Especially when a new\nvulnerability (or a privacy-invasive behavior) was discovered in a third-party\nlibrary, there is a practical need to precisely identify the existence of\nlibraries and their versions for iOS apps. However, few studies have been\nproposed to tackle this problem, and they all suffer from the code duplication\nproblem in different libraries. In this paper, we focus on third-party library\ndetection in iOS apps.

By doing so, we have two key observations: 1) even\nthough two libraries can share classes, the shared classes cannot be integrated\ninto an app simultaneously without causing a class name conflict; and 2) code\nduplication between multiple versions of two libraries can vary. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a novel profile-based similarity comparison approach to\nperform the detection. Specifically, we build a library database consists of\noriginal library binaries with distinct versions. After extracting profiles for\neach library version and the target app, we conduct a similarity comparison to\nfind the best matches. We implemented this approach in iLibScope.

To this end, the entire communication chain needs to be\noptimized, including the channel and the surrounding environment, as it is no\nlonger sufficient to control the transmitter and/or the receiver only.\nInvestigating large intelligent surfaces, ultra massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output, and smart constructive environments will contribute to this\ndirection. In addition, to allow the exchange of high dimensional sensing data\nbetween connected intelligent devices, semantic and goal oriented\ncommunications need to be considered for a more efficient and context-aware\ninformation encoding. In particular, for multi-agent systems, where agents are\ncollaborating together to achieve a complex task, emergent communications,\ninstead of hard coded communications, can be learned for more efficient task\nexecution and communication resources use. Moreover, new physics phenomenon\nshould be exploited such as the thermodynamics of communication as well as the\nthe interaction between information theory and electromagnetism to better\nunderstand the physical limitations of different technologies, e.g, holographic\ncommunications. Another new communication paradigm is to consider the\nend-to-end approach instead of block-by-block optimization, which requires\nexploiting machine learning theory, non-linear signal processing theory, and\nnon-coherent communications theory.

In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by\nadapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of\nConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we\nlearn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in\na given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively\ndetermined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with\nvarying scale.

The complexity of object management has grown dramatically with the\never increasing requirements of performance, consistency and fault-tolerance\nfrom storage subsystems. Simply stated, more number of intermediate layers are\nencountered in the I/O data path, with each passing layer adding its own syntax\nand semantics. Thereby increasing the overheads of request processing. In this\npaper, through comprehensive under-the-hood analysis of an object-storage node,\nwe characterize the impact of object-store (and user-application) workloads on\nthe OS I/O stack and its subsequent rippling effect on the underlying\nobject-storage devices (OSD). We observe that the legacy architecture of the OS\nbased I/O storage stack coupled with complex data management policies leads to\na performance mismatch between what an end-storage device is capable of\ndelivering and what it actually delivers in a production environment.\nTherefore, the gains derived from developing faster storage devices is often\nnullified. These issues get more pronounced in highly concurrent and\nmultiplexed cloud environments. Owing to the associated issues of\nobject-management and the vulnerabilities of the OS I/O software stacks, we\ndiscuss the potential of a new class of storage devices, known as\nObject-Drives.

Despite the growing progress on\nbenchmarks, we realize that existing methods often perform unsatisfactorily on\ndistant interactions, where the leading causes are two-fold: 1) Distant\ninteractions are by nature more difficult to recognize than close ones. A\nnatural scene often involves multiple humans and objects with intricate spatial\nrelations, making the interaction recognition for distant human-object largely\naffected by complex visual context. 2) Insufficient number of distant\ninteractions in benchmark datasets results in under-fitting on these instances.\nTo address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage method\nfor better handling distant interactions in HOI detection. One essential\ncomponent in our method is a novel Far Near Distance Attention module. It\nenables information propagation between humans and objects, whereby the spatial\ndistance is skillfully taken into consideration.

For the\nbulk properties, the density and isospin dependencies of the nuclear\nincompressibility in infinite matter are characterized by introducing new\nempirical parameters, and two new constraints for the value of $K_{sym}$ are\nsuggested. For finite nuclei, we employ a Bayesian approach coupled to a\nMarkov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) exploration of the parameter space to confront\nthe model predictions of $K_A$ in Zr, Sn and Pb isotopes to the experimental\ndata.

To identify such unseen labels, multi-label zero-shot learning (ML-ZSL)\nfocuses on transferring knowledge by a pre-trained textual label embedding\n(e.g., GloVe). However, such methods only exploit single-modal knowledge from a\nlanguage model, while ignoring the rich semantic information inherent in\nimage-text pairs. Instead, recently developed open-vocabulary (OV) based\nmethods succeed in exploiting such information of image-text pairs in object\ndetection, and achieve impressive performance. Inspired by the success of\nOV-based methods, we propose a novel open-vocabulary framework, named\nmulti-modal knowledge transfer (MKT), for multi-label classification.\nSpecifically, our method exploits multi-modal knowledge of image-text pairs\nbased on a vision and language pre-training (VLP) model. To facilitate\ntransferring the image-text matching ability of VLP model, knowledge\ndistillation is employed to guarantee the consistency of image and label\nembeddings, along with prompt tuning to further update the label embeddings. To\nfurther enable the recognition of multiple objects, a simple but effective\ntwo-stream module is developed to capture both local and global features.\nExtensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.

However, given the complexity of models\nand data-generating processes, the resulting explanations are far from being\n`complete', in that they lack an indication of feature interactions and\nvisualization of their `effect'. In this work, we propose a novel\ntwin-surrogate explainability framework to explain the decisions made by any\nCNN-based image classifier (irrespective of the architecture). For this, we\nfirst disentangle latent features from the classifier, followed by aligning\nthese features to observed/human-defined `context' features. These aligned\nfeatures form semantically meaningful concepts that are used for extracting a\ncausal graph depicting the `perceived' data-generating process, describing the\ninter- and intra-feature interactions between unobserved latent features and\nobserved `context' features. This causal graph serves as a global model from\nwhich local explanations of different forms can be extracted. Specifically, we\nprovide a generator to visualize the `effect' of interactions among features in\nlatent space and draw feature importance therefrom as local explanations. Our\nframework utilizes adversarial knowledge distillation to faithfully learn a\nrepresentation from the classifiers' latent space and use it for extracting\nvisual explanations.

The other model (CCA) argues that\nconceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the\nbase word. We compare the two models on the basis of how well the speech signal\nof plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the\nsemantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the\nperformance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form\ndistances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for\nCCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which\na given word's own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories\naccording to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on\nhigh-level abstraction. We see that what has often been conceived of as a\nhighly abstract concept, [+plural], is better captured via a family of\nmid-level partial generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 10:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 16:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components,\nnamely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily\nincorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures.

However, that same autonomy\nopens the door for malicious peers to poison the model by conducting either\nuntargeted or targeted poisoning attacks. The label-flipping (LF) attack is a\ntargeted poisoning attack where the attackers poison their training data by\nflipping the labels of some examples from one class (i.e., the source class) to\nanother (i.e., the target class). Unfortunately, this attack is easy to perform\nand hard to detect and it negatively impacts on the performance of the global\nmodel. Existing defenses against LF are limited by assumptions on the\ndistribution of the peers' data and/or do not perform well with\nhigh-dimensional models. In this paper, we deeply investigate the LF attack\nbehavior and find that the contradicting objectives of attackers and honest\npeers on the source class examples are reflected in the parameter gradients\ncorresponding to the neurons of the source and target classes in the output\nlayer, making those gradients good discriminative features for the attack\ndetection. Accordingly, we propose a novel defense that first dynamically\nextracts those gradients from the peers' local updates, and then clusters the\nextracted gradients, analyzes the resulting clusters and filters out potential\nbad updates before model aggregation. Extensive empirical analysis on three\ndata sets shows the proposed defense's effectiveness against the LF attack\nregardless of the data distribution or model dimensionality.

Moreover, we adopt a subarray-wise\nestimation strategy to overcome the severe angular-domain energy dispersion\nproblem which is caused by the near-field effect in XL-MIMO channels.\nSimulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm over\nstate-of-the-art CS algorithms for massive access based on XL-MIMO with\nmixed-ADC architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 12:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 15:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Therefore,\nplenty of efficient channel covariance matrix estimation schemes have been\nproposed in the literature. However, an abrupt change in the channel covariance\nmatrix may happen occasionally in practice due to the change in the scattering\nenvironment and the user location. Our paper aims to adopt the classic change\ndetection theory to detect the change in the channel covariance matrix as\naccurately and quickly as possible such that the new covariance matrix can be\nre-estimated in time. Specifically, this paper first considers the technique of\non-line change detection (also known as quickest/sequential change detection),\nwhere we need to detect whether a change in the channel covariance matrix\noccurs at each channel coherence time interval. Next, because the complexity of\ndetecting the change in a high-dimension covariance matrix at each coherence\ntime interval is too high, we devise a low-complexity off-line strategy in\nmassive MIMO systems, where change detection is merely performed at the last\nchannel coherence time interval of a given time period. Numerical results show\nthat our proposed on-line and off-line schemes can detect the channel\ncovariance change with a small delay and a low false alarm rate. Therefore, our\npaper theoretically and numerically verifies the feasibility of detecting the\nchannel covariance change accurately and quickly in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 12:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 07:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

As far as we know, we are the first to study the problem\nof open-vocabulary 3D point-cloud detection. Instead of seeking a point-cloud\ndataset with full labels, we resort to ImageNet1K to broaden the vocabulary of\nthe point-cloud detector. We propose OV-3DETIC, an Open-Vocabulary 3D DETector\nusing Image-level Class supervision. Specifically, we take advantage of two\nmodalities, the image modality for recognition and the point-cloud modality for\nlocalization, to generate pseudo labels for unseen classes. Then we propose a\nnovel debiased cross-modal contrastive learning method to transfer the\nknowledge from image modality to point-cloud modality during training. Without\nhurting the latency during inference, OV-3DETIC makes the point-cloud detector\ncapable of achieving open-vocabulary detection. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed OV-3DETIC achieves at least 10.77 % mAP\nimprovement (absolute value) and 9.56 % mAP improvement (absolute value) by a\nwide range of baselines on the SUN-RGBD dataset and ScanNet dataset,\nrespectively.

We hypothesized that head motion is reduced when participants\nupper back is unsupported, as this stimulates active postural control. We\ndeveloped an experimental methodology to evaluate 3D vibration transmission\nfrom compliant seats to the human body. Wide-band (0.1-12 Hz) motion stimuli\nwere applied in fore-aft, lateral and vertical direction to evaluate the\ntranslational and rotational body response in pelvis, trunk and head. A\nstandard car seat was equipped with a configurable and compliant back support\nto test 3 support heights and 3 sitting postures (erect, slouched, and\npreferred) where we also tested head down looking at a smartphone. Seat back\nsupport height and sitting posture substantially affected vibration\ntransmission and affected low-frequency responses in particular for body\nsegment rotation.

However, there is still a lack of study on how to distill\nbetween heterogeneous detectors. In this paper, we empirically find that better\nFPN features from a heterogeneous teacher detector can help the student\nalthough their detection heads and label assignments are different. However,\ndirectly aligning the feature maps to distill detectors suffers from two\nproblems. First, the difference in feature magnitude between the teacher and\nthe student could enforce overly strict constraints on the student. Second, the\nFPN stages and channels with large feature magnitude from the teacher model\ncould dominate the gradient of distillation loss, which will overwhelm the\neffects of other features in KD and introduce much noise.

However, mobility poses great challenges\non delivering reliable MEC service required for latency-critical applications.\nFirst, mobility management has to tackle the dynamics of both user's location\nchanges and task arrivals that vary in different timescales. Second, user\nmobility could induce service migration, leading to reliability loss due to the\nmigration delay. In this paper, we propose a two-timescale mobility management\nframework by joint control of service migration and transmission power to\naddress the above challenges. Specifically, the service migration operates at a\nlarge timescale to support user mobility in the multi-cell network, while the\npower control is performed at a small timescale for real-time task offloading.\nTheir joint control is formulated as an optimization problem aiming at the\nlong-term mobile energy minimization subject to the reliability requirement of\ncomputation offloading. To solve the problem, we propose a Lyapunov-based\nframework to decompose the problem into different timescales, based on which a\nlow-complexity two-timescale online algorithm is developed by exploiting the\nproblem structure. The proposed online algorithm is shown to be asymptotically\noptimal via theoretical analysis, and is further developed to accommodate the\nmultiuser management.

Segmentation is a fundamental limiting\nprecursor to both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Advances in machine\nlearning (ML) aim to increase diagnostic efficiency by replacing a single\napplication with generalized algorithms. The goal of unsupervised anomaly\ndetection (UAD) is to identify potential anomalous regions unseen during\ntraining, where convolutional neural network (CNN) based autoencoders (AEs) and\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs) are considered a de facto approach for\nreconstruction based-anomaly segmentation. The restricted receptive field in\nCNNs limits the CNN to model the global context. Hence, if the anomalous\nregions cover large parts of the image, the CNN-based AEs are not capable of\nbringing a semantic understanding of the image.

Due to the exponentially growing Hilbert\nspace, we find that for such system sizes even a single random state is\nsufficient to yield results with extremely low noise that is negligible for\nmost practical purposes. In contrast, a classical analog of typicality is\nmissing. In particular, we demonstrate that, in order to obtain data with a\nsimilar level of noise in the classical case, extensive averaging over\nclassical trajectories is required, no matter how large the system size.\nFocusing on (quasi-)one-dimensional spin chains and ladders, we find a\nremarkably good agreement between quantum and classical dynamics.

However, the uncertainty\nof which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of\nproactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by\nbenefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is\ndesigned to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial\nrisk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the\nlevel of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance\nadaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for\nentities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as\nan investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of\nreturn when they need it most.\n  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they\nover-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.\nThis is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in\nclimate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but\nalso outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic\nvalue.

Although railway\ntransportation is roughly four times more fuel-efficient than roadway\ntransportation, a train derailment has greater potential to cause more\ndisastrous consequences than a truck incident. Train types, such as unit train\nor manifest train (also called mixed train), can influence transport risks in\nseveral ways. For example, unit trains only experience risks on mainlines and\nwhen arriving at or departing from terminals, while manifest trains experience\nadditional switching risks in yards. Based on prior studies and various data\nsources covering the years 1996-2018, this paper constructs event chains for\nline-haul risks on mainlines (for both unit trains and manifest trains),\narrival/departure risks in terminals (for unit trains) and yards (for manifest\ntrains), and yard switching risks for manifest trains using various\nprobabilistic models, and finally determines expected casualties as the\nconsequences of a potential train derailment and release incident. This is the\nfirst analysis to quantify the total risks a train may encounter throughout the\nshipment process, either on mainlines or in yards/terminals, distinguishing\ntrain types. It provides a methodology applicable to any train to calculate the\nexpected risks (quantified as expected casualties in this paper) from an origin\nto a destination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 17:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

As such, the progenitors of HMXBs are likely to have\nformed away from the current location of the X-ray emitting systems. We aim to\nfind the birthplace of the known HMXBs of our Milky Way. Specifically, we want\nto answer the question whether the formation of HMXBs can be associated to open\nstellar clusters and/or Galactic spiral structures, and infer from that the\ntime elapsed since the first supernova event. We use astrometric data from the\nGaia EDR3 to initialize the position and velocity of each known HMXBs from the\nGalaxy, and integrate their motion back in time. In parallel, we perform the\nsame calculations on a sample of 1381 open clusters detected by Gaia as well as\nfor four Galactic spiral arms which shape and motion have also been recently\nmodelled using Gaia data. We report on all the encounter candidates between\nHMXBs and clusters or spiral arms in the past 100 Myr.

The\nbirthplaces of the remaining 4 HMXBs are still inconclusive due to a\ncombination of great distance, poor astrometric data and lack of known open\ncluster in the vicinity. We provide the kinematical age since supernova of 15\nHMXBs. The astrometry from Gaia and the orbit integration we employ are\neffective at finding the birthplaces of HMXBs in the Milky Way. By considering\nthe biases in our data and method, we find it is likely that the progenitors of\nHMXBs preferentially formed alongside other massive stars in open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 15:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

The ill-posedness of the unfolding problem\ncan lead to results with strong anti-correlations and fluctuations between\nbins, which make comparisons to theoretical models in plots difficult. To\nalleviate this problem, one can introduce regularisation terms in the unfolding\nprocedure. These suppress the anti-correlations in the result, at the cost of\nintroducing some bias towards the expected shape of the data. This paper\ndiscusses a method using simple linear algebra, which makes it is possible to\nregularise any result that is presented as a central value and a covariance\nmatrix. This \"post-hoc\" regularisation is generally much faster than repeating\nthe unfolding method with different regularisation terms. The method also\nyields a regularisation matrix which connects the regularised to the\nunregularised result, and can be used to retain the full statistical power of\nthe unregularised result when publishing a nicer looking regularised result. In\naddition to the regularisation method, this paper also presents some thoughts\non the presentation of correlated data in general. When using the proposed\nmethod, the bias of the regularisation can be understood as a data\nvisualisation problem rather than a statistical one. The strength of the\nregularisation can be chosen by minimising the difference between the\nimplicitly uncorrelated distribution shown in the plots and the actual\ndistribution described by the unregularised central value and covariance. Aside\nfrom minimising the difference between the shown and the actual result,\nadditional information can be provided by showing the local log-likelihood\ngradient of the models shown in the plots.

For example, magnetic twist plays a role in the initiation of\nflares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Various proxies for the twist above\nthe photosphere have been found using models of uniformly twisted flux tubes,\nand are routinely computed from single photospheric vector magnetograms. One\nclass of proxies is based on $\\alpha_z$, the ratio of the vertical current to\nthe vertical magnetic field. Another class of proxies is based on the so-called\ntwist density, $q$, which depends on the ratio of the azimuthal field to the\nvertical field. However, the sensitivity of these proxies to temporal\nfluctuations of the magnetic field has not yet been well characterized. We aim\nto determine the sensitivity of twist proxies to temporal fluctuations in the\nmagnetic field as estimated from time-series of SDO/HMI vector magnetic field\nmaps. To this end, we introduce a model of a sunspot with a peak vertical field\nof 2370 Gauss at the photosphere and a uniform twist density $q= -0.024$\nMm$^{-1}$. We add realizations of the temporal fluctuations of the magnetic\nfield that are consistent with SDO/HMI observations, including the spatial\ncorrelations. Using a Monte-Carlo approach, we determine the robustness of the\ndifferent proxies to the temporal fluctuations. The temporal fluctuations of\nthe three components of the magnetic field are correlated for spatial\nseparations up to 1.4 Mm (more than expected from the point spread function\nalone). The Monte-Carlo approach enables us to demonstrate that several proxies\nfor the twist of the magnetic field are not biased in each of the individual\nmagnetograms. The associated random errors on the proxies have standard\ndeviations in the range between $0.002$ and $0.006$ Mm$^{-1}$, which is smaller\nby approximately one order of magnitude than the mean value of $q$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 15:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

A fundamental quantity to measure optical performance of the\nquantum dots is a distribution function for the light-emission duration. So\nfar, to estimate it, a threshold value for the fluorescent intensity was\nintroduced, and the light-emission state was evaluated as a state above the\nthreshold. With this definition, the light-emission duration was estimated, and\nits distribution function was derived as a blinking plot. Due to the noise in\nthe fluorescent data, however, this treatment generates a large number of\nartificially short-lived emission states, thus leading to an erroneous blinking\nplot. In the present paper, we propose a hidden Markov model to eliminate these\nartifacts. The hidden Markov model introduces a hidden variable specifying the\nlight-emission and quenching states behind the observed fluorescence.

However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing\nbest-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to\nimplement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing\nthis gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its\ncore, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop\nefficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational\ncomplexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as\nmixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate\nimplementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular\ninterface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically\ndemonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while\nalso observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory\nusage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on\nmultiple benchmarks.

Employing self-attention modules results in a\nquadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on\napproximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have thus\nbeen made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this\nwork reveals that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically\nineffective for visual recognition. We identify that their limitations are\nrooted in retaining the softmax self-attention during approximations.\nSpecifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled\ndot-product between token feature vectors. Preserving the softmax operation\nchallenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Under this insight, a\nSOftmax-Free Transformer (abbreviated as SOFT) is proposed for the first time.\nTo eliminate the softmax operator in self-attention, a Gaussian kernel function\nis adopted to replace the dot-product similarity. This enables a full\nself-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition.\nThe robustness of our approximation is achieved by calculating its\nMoore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Further, an efficient\nsymmetric normalization is introduced on the low-rank self-attention for\nenhancing model generalizability and transferability. Extensive experiments on\nImageNet, COCO and ADE20K show that our SOFT significantly improves the\ncomputational efficiency of existing ViT variants.

In this environment, reinforcement learning agents learn\nto trade successfully. The agents can trade the usage right of computational\ncores to process high-priority, high-reward jobs faster than low-priority,\nlow-reward jobs. However, due to combinatorial effects, the action and\nobservation spaces of a simple reinforcement learning agent in this environment\nscale exponentially with key parameters of the problem size. However, the\nexponential scaling behavior can be transformed into a linear one if the agent\nis split into several independent sub-units. We further improve this\ndistributed architecture using agent-internal parameter sharing. Moreover, it\ncan be extended to set the exchange prices autonomously. We show that in our\nscheduling environment, the advantages of a distributed agent architecture\nclearly outweigh more aggregated approaches. We demonstrate that the\ndistributed agent architecture becomes even more performant using\nagent-internal parameter sharing. Finally, we investigate how two different\nreward functions affect autonomous pricing and the corresponding scheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 13:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

As a natural bridge between the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) and the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equations, the ILW equation\nis of physical interest. We prove that the solutions of ILW converge in the\n$H^s$-Sobolev space for $s>\\frac12$, to those of BO in the deep-water limit (as\n$\\delta\\to\\infty$), and to those of KdV in the shallow-water limit (as\n$\\delta\\to 0$). This improves previous convergence results by Abdelouhab, Bona,\nFelland, and Saut (1989), which required $s>\\frac32$ in the deep-water limit\nand $s\\geq2$ in the shallow-water limit. Moreover, the convergence results also\napply to the generalised ILW equation, i.e.~with nonlinearity $\\partial_x\n(u^k)$ for $k\\geq 2$. Furthermore, this work gives the first convergence\nresults of generalised ILW solutions on the circle with regularity $s\\geq\n\\frac34$. Overall, this study provides mathematical insights for the behaviour\nof the ILW equation and its solutions in different water depths, and has\nimplications for predicting and modelling wave behaviour in various\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 14:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 15:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}
