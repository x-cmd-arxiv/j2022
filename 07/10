This paper proposes an industrial weld segmentation\nnetwork based on a deep learning semantic segmentation algorithm fused with\nheatmap detail guidance and Image Matting to solve the automatic segmentation\nproblem of weld regions. In the existing semantic segmentation networks, the\nboundary information can be preserved by fusing the features of both high-level\nand low-level layers. However, this method can lead to insufficient expression\nof the spatial information in the low-level layer, resulting in inaccurate\nsegmentation boundary positioning. We propose a detailed guidance module based\non heatmaps to fully express the segmented region boundary information in the\nlow-level network to address this problem. Specifically, the expression of\nboundary information can be enhanced by adding a detailed branch to predict\nsegmented boundary and then matching it with the boundary heat map generated by\nmask labels to calculate the mean square error loss. In addition, although deep\nlearning has achieved great success in the field of semantic segmentation, the\nprecision of the segmentation boundary region is not high due to the loss of\ndetailed information caused by the classical segmentation network in the\nprocess of encoding and decoding process. This paper introduces a matting\nalgorithm to calibrate the boundary of the segmentation region of the semantic\nsegmentation network to solve this problem. Through many experiments on\nindustrial weld data sets, the effectiveness of our method is demonstrated, and\nthe MIOU reaches 97.93%.

DMD is a data-driven modeling method, which provides a linear\nfinite-dimensional representation of a possibly nonlinear system dynamics by\nmeans of a set of modes with associated frequencies. Its use for ship operating\nin waves has been little discussed and a systematic analysis of its forecasting\ncapabilities is still needed in this context. Here, a statistical analysis of\nDMD forecasting capabilities is presented for ships in waves, including\nstandard and augmented DMD. The statistical assessment uses multiple time\nseries, studying the effects of the number of input/output waves, time steps,\ntime derivatives, along with the use of time-shifted copies of time series by\nthe Hankel matrix. The assessment of the forecasting capabilities is based on\nfour metrics: normalized root mean square error, Pearson correlation\ncoefficient, average angle measure, and normalized average minimum/maximum\nabsolute error. Two test cases are used for the assessment: the course keeping\nof a self-propelled 5415M in irregular stern-quartering waves and the\nturning-circle of a free-running self-propelled KRISO Container Ship in regular\nwaves. Results are overall promising and show how state augmentation (using\nfrom four to eight input waves, up to two time derivatives, and four\ntime-shifted copies) improves the DMD forecasting capabilities up to two wave\nencounter periods in ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 17:35:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 15:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 12:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Cross approximation-originally\ndeveloped for representing a matrix from a set of selected rows and columns-is\nan efficient method for constructing a tensor train decomposition of a tensor\nfrom few of its entries. While tensor train cross approximation has achieved\nremarkable performance in practical applications, its theoretical analysis, in\nparticular regarding the error of the approximation, is so far lacking.

In\nthis sense fluids form a wide subset of the phases of matter that includes\nliquids, dense gases, plasmas, and to some extent even plastic solids. Fluidity\nis one of the main dynamical characteristics that depends strongly on the\ndetails of the local structure. And vice versa, dominant details of local\nstructural ordering in the arrangement of particles on some time scales are\nimportant for understanding the dynamics of fluids. The orderliness over\ndistances comparable to the inter-particle distances is usually treated as the\nshort-range order, whereas the orderliness repeated over infinitely large\ndistances is called the long-range order. Both are absent in the ideal gas, but\nliquids and amorphous solids exhibit the short-range order. The physics of\ncrystalline solids with the long-range order is well understood. In fluids,\nhowever, the atomic structure is changing with time. How are specific features\nof structural ordering reflected in the fluid dynamics? In this chapter we try\nto find answers to some old and new questions that still make the fluid\ndynamics still very attractive for the theoretical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 19:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Upstream Reynolds number $Re$ was changed between 1187 and 1999, while\nthe pulsatile period $T$ was kept fixed at 0.96s. Velocity fields were acquired\nusing Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) for a region of interest (ROI)\nlocated downstream of the constriction. The flow is composed of a central jet\nand a recirculation region near the wall where vortex forms and sheds. To study\nthe mixing processes, finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) fields and\nconcentration maps were computed. Two lagrangian coherent structures (LCS)\nresponsible for mixing and transporting fluid were found from FTLE ridges. A\nfirst LCS delimits the trailing edge of the vortex, separating the flow that\nenters the ROI between successive periods. A second LCS delimits the leading\nedge of the vortex. This LCS concentrates the highest particle agglomeration,\nas verified by the concentration maps. Moreover, from the particle residence\ntime maps (RT) the probability for a fluid particle of leaving the ROI before\none cycle was measured. As $Re$ increases, the probability of leaving the ROI\nincreases from 0.6 to 0.95. Final position maps $r{_f}$ were introduced to\nevaluate the flow mixing between different subregions of the ROI.

Purpose:\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\bar D$ meson production are calculated with a combination of\nperturbative QCD and intrinsic charm to determine the best energy range to\nstudy intrinsic charm production. Methods: $J/\\psi$ and $\\bar D$ meson\nproduction are calculated in perturbative QCD to next-to-leading order in the\ncross section. Cold nuclear matter effects, including nuclear modification of\nthe parton densities and $p_T$ broadening by multiple scattering are taken into\naccount in the production of both; absorption by nucleons is also included for\nthe $J/\\psi$.

However, these systems also lead to high variance in producers'\neconomic outcomes: a new producer who sells high-quality items, may, by luck,\nreceive one low rating early on, negatively impacting their popularity with\nfuture customers. We investigate the design of rating systems that balance the\ngoals of identifying high quality products (\"efficiency\") and minimizing the\nvariance in economic outcomes of producers of similar quality (individual\n\"producer fairness\").\n  We observe that there is a trade-off between these two goals: rating systems\nthat promote efficiency are necessarily less individually fair to producers. We\nintroduce Bayesian rating systems as an approach to managing this trade-off.\nInformally, the systems we propose set a system-wide prior for the quality of\nan incoming product, and subsequently the system updates that prior to a\nBayesian posterior on quality based on user-generated ratings over time.\nThrough calibrated simulations, we show that the strength of the prior directly\ndetermines the operating point on the identified trade-off: the stronger the\nprior, the more the marketplace discounts early ratings data (so individual\nproducer fairness increases), but the slower the platform is in learning about\ntrue item quality (so efficiency suffers). Importantly, the prevailing method\nof ratings aggregation -- displaying the sample mean of ratings -- is an\nextreme point in this design space, that maximally prioritizes efficiency at\nthe expense of producer fairness. Instead, by choosing a Bayesian rating system\ndesign with an appropriately set prior, a platform can be intentional about the\nconsequential choice of a balance between efficiency and producer fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 03:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 05:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Here, relatively weak correlations\nbelow the Mott regime are taken into account in the mean-field fashion but\ndisorder effects are introduced essentially exactly.

An\nimportant category of bosonic codes called the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP)\ncode has aroused much interest recently. Theoretically, the error correction\nability of GKP code is limited since it can only correct small shift errors in\nposition and momentum quadratures. A natural approach to promote the GKP error\ncorrection for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation is concatenating\nencoded GKP states with a stabilizer code. The performance of the XZZX\nsurface-GKP code, i.e., the single-mode GKP code concatenated with the XZZX\nsurface code is investigated in this paper under two different noise models.\nFirstly, in the code-capacity noise model, the asymmetric rectangular GKP code\nwith parameter $\\lambda$ is introduced. Using the minimum weight perfect\nmatching decoder combined with the continuous-variable GKP information, the\noptimal threshold of the XZZX-surface GKP code reaches $\\sigma\\approx0.67$ when\n$\\lambda=2.1$, compared with the threshold $\\sigma\\approx0.60$ of the standard\nsurface-GKP code. Secondly, we analyze the shift errors of two-qubit gates in\nthe actual implementation and build the full circuit-level noise model. By\nsetting the appropriate bias parameters, the logical error rate is reduced by\nseveral times in some cases. These results indicate the XZZX surface-GKP codes\nare more suitable for asymmetric concatenation under the general noise models.\nWe also estimate the overhead of the XZZX-surface GKP code which uses about 291\nGKP states with the noise parameter 18.5 dB ($\\kappa/g \\approx 0.71\\%$) to\nencode a logical qubit with the error rate $2.53\\times10^{-7}$, compared with\nthe qubit-based surface code using 3041 qubits to achieve almost the same\nlogical error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 04:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 08:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Thus, in this work, we propose the 2D Priors Assisted Semantic\nSegmentation (2DPASS), a general training scheme, to boost the representation\nlearning on point clouds, by fully taking advantage of 2D images with rich\nappearance. In practice, by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion and\nmulti-scale fusion-to-single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD), 2DPASS acquires\nricher semantic and structural information from the multi-modal data, which are\nthen online distilled to the pure 3D network. As a result, equipped with\n2DPASS, our baseline shows significant improvement with only point cloud\ninputs. Specifically, it achieves the state-of-the-arts on two large-scale\nbenchmarks (i.e. SemanticKITTI and NuScenes), including top-1 results in both\nsingle and multiple scan(s) competitions of SemanticKITTI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 06:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 14:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

In fact, in some real\nteaching practice, a teacher helps students learn while also gets promotion\nfrom students to some extent, which inspires us to explore a dual-directional\nknowledge transfer between domains, and thus propose a Dual-Correction\nAdaptation Network (DualCAN) in this paper. However, due to the asymmetrical\nlabel knowledge across domains, transfer from unlabeled target to labeled\nsource poses a more difficult challenge than the common source-to-target\ncounterpart. First, the target pseudo-labels predicted by source commonly\ninvolve noises due to model bias, hence in the reverse adaptation, they may\nhurt the source performance and bring a negative target-to-source transfer.\nSecondly, source domain usually contains innate noises, which will inevitably\naggravate the target noises, leading to noise amplification across domains. To\nthis end, we further introduce a Noise Identification and Correction (NIC)\nmodule to correct and recycle noises in both domains. To our best knowledge,\nthis is the first naive attempt of dual-directional adaptation for noisy UDA,\nand naturally applicable to noise-free UDA.

The Harnack\nextension principle, which discusses a sufficient condition for\nKurzweil-Henstock integrable functions on particular subsets of $(a,b)$ to be\nintegrable on $[a,b]$, is a key step to supply convergence theorems. The\nKurzweil-Stieltjes integral reduces to the Kurzweil-Henstock integral whenever\nthe integrator is an identity function. In general, if the integrator $F$ is\ndiscontinuous on $[c,d]\\subset[a,b]$, then the values of the Kurzweil-Stieltjes\nintegrals $$\\int_c^d[dF]g,\\ \\int_{[c,d]}[dF]g,\\ \\int_{[c,d)}[dF]g,\\\n\\int_{(c,d]}[dF]g,\\ {\\rm and}\\ \\int_{(c,d)}[dF]g$$ need not coincide.

Therefore, besides constructing the Harnack\nextension principle for the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral, the aim of\nthis paper is also to demonstrate its role in guaranteeing the existence of the\nintegrals $\\int_{T}[dF]g$ for arbitrary subsets $T$ of an elementary set $E$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 09:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 10:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 02:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 03:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2022 23:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Unlike traditional biometric features, physiological signals can not\nbe easily compromised (usually unobservable to human eyes).\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) signal is easy to measure, making it more attractive\nthan many other physiological signals for biometric authentication. However,\nwith the advent of remote PPG (rPPG), unobservability has been challenged when\nthe attacker can remotely steal the rPPG signals by monitoring the victim's\nface, subsequently posing a threat to PPG-based biometrics. In PPG-based\nbiometric authentication, current attack approaches mandate the victim's PPG\nsignal, making rPPG-based attacks neglected. In this paper, we firstly analyze\nthe security of PPG-based biometrics, including user authentication and\ncommunication protocols. We evaluate the signal waveforms, heart rate and\ninter-pulse-interval information extracted by five rPPG methods, including four\ntraditional optical computing methods (CHROM, POS, LGI, PCA) and one deep\nlearning method (CL_rPPG). We conducted experiments on five datasets (PURE,\nUBFC_rPPG, UBFC_Phys, LGI_PPGI, and COHFACE) to collect a comprehensive set of\nresults. Our empirical studies show that rPPG poses a serious threat to the\nauthentication system. The success rate of the rPPG signal spoofing attack in\nthe user authentication system reached 0.35. The bit hit rate is 0.6 in\ninter-pulse-interval-based security protocols. Further, we propose an active\ndefence strategy to hide the physiological signals of the face to resist the\nattack. It reduces the success rate of rPPG spoofing attacks in user\nauthentication to 0.05. The bit hit rate was reduced to 0.5, which is at the\nlevel of a random guess. Our strategy effectively prevents the exposure of PPG\nsignals to protect users' sensitive physiological data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 11:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

In this report, the perfect Abelian\ndominance is shown to exist with the help of the multilevel method but without\nintroducing additional smoothing techniques like partial gauge fixings,\nalthough lattice sizes studied are not large enough to study the infinite\nvolume limit. Perfect monopole dominance is also shown without any additional\ngauge fixing. Abelian electric fields are squeezed due to solenoidal monopole\ncurrents and the penetration length for an Abelian electric field of a single\ncolor is the same as that of non-Abelian electric field.

In\nthe high swirl scenario, the disintegrations of the nodes, rim, and bag-film\ncontribute to the number mean diameter, resulting in smaller satellite\ndroplets.

To reduce such over-reliance on\nhuman annotations, we propose Mix-Teaching, an effective semi-supervised\nlearning framework applicable to employ both labeled and unlabeled images in\ntraining stage. Mix-Teaching first generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled images\nby self-training. The student model is then trained on the mixed images\npossessing much more intensive and precise labeling by merging instance-level\nimage patches into empty backgrounds or labeled images. This is the first to\nbreak the image-level limitation and put high-quality pseudo labels from multi\nframes into one image for semi-supervised training. Besides, as a result of the\nmisalignment between confidence score and localization quality, it's hard to\ndiscriminate high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions using only\nconfidence-based criterion. To that end, we further introduce an\nuncertainty-based filter to help select reliable pseudo boxes for the above\nmixing operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified SSL\nframework for monocular 3D object detection. Mix-Teaching consistently improves\nMonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios on\nKITTI dataset.

The\nreproduction fidelity of the designed micro- and nanostructures is influenced\nby experimental writing conditions, including laser power, exposure time, etc.\nTo determine the appropriate writing parameters, characterization of\nmorphological features and surface roughness during the experiment is needed.\nTraditional characterization methods for TPP, e.g., scanning electron\nmicroscopy and atomic force microscopy, have limited speed and cannot study\ninternal structures without invasive approaches. Optical diffraction tomography\n(ODT) is an emerging label-free 3D imaging technique based on reconstructing\nthe object's 3D refractive index (RI) distribution with diffraction-limited\nresolution. Here, we propose a non-invasive solution to fully characterize the\nTPP-fabricated structures using a high-speed ODT technique, which can eliminate\nthe need for complex sample preparation, such as fluorescence labelling or\nmetal-coating, and achieve a full 3D measurement time of 6 ms. By visualizing\nand studying different TPP-fabricated structures, including embedded spirals\nand cubes, via the ODT system, the fabrication quality, including 3D\nmorphological features, exposure levels, and surface roughness, can be examined\nquantitatively.

Optimization requires differentiating a\nmeasure of performance over a trajectory, such as the closeness of tracking the\nenvironment, with respect to the parameters of the differential equations.\nBecause model trajectories are usually calculated numerically by multistep\nalgorithms, such as Runge-Kutta, the automatic differentiation must be passed\nthrough the numerical algorithm. This article explains how such automatic\ndifferentiation of trajectories is achieved. It also discusses why such\ncomputational breakthroughs are likely to advance theoretical and statistical\nstudies of biological problems, in which one can consider variables as dynamic\npaths over time and space.

However, its wider adoption is excessively limited due to the\nwell recognized challenges in ICG delineation. We present a simple, adaptive,\nand efficient method for the most demanding ICG delineation task - detection of\nless distinct B-point that marks the onset of the left ventricular ejection.\nMethod: The core of the new method is transformation of ICG time series by\nweighted time window of an ICG segment preceding the maximal ICG peak (the\nC-point) aiming at the B-point enhancement. The resulting Modified B-point\n(MB-point) is then easily delineated. To evaluate the proposed workflow, the\ndataset comprising 20 healthy participants and 21065 B-points are manually\nannotated and openly shared with the software code.

Previous methods commonly strive to depict sample \"confidence\"\nalong with a threshold for rejecting unknowns, and align feature distributions\nof shared classes across domains. However, it is still hard to pre-specify a\n\"confidence\" criterion and threshold which are adaptive to various real tasks,\nand a mis-prediction of unknowns further incurs misalignment of features in\nshared classes. In this paper, we propose a new UniDA method with adaptive\nUnknown Authentication by Classifier Paradox (UACP), considering that samples\nwith paradoxical predictions are probably unknowns belonging to none of the\nsource classes. In UACP, a composite classifier is jointly designed with two\ntypes of predictors. That is, a multi-class (MC) predictor classifies samples\nto one of the multiple source classes, while a binary one-vs-all (OVA)\npredictor further verifies the prediction by MC predictor. Samples with\nverification failure or paradox are identified as unknowns. Further, instead of\nfeature alignment for shared classes, implicit domain alignment is conducted in\noutput space such that samples across domains share the same decision boundary,\nthough with feature discrepancy.
