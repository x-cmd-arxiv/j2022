Experimental results on standard\nbenchmarks, such as residual networks for ImageNet classification and BERT\nmodels for language modelling, show that CrAM produces dense models that can be\nmore accurate than the standard SGD/Adam-based baselines, but which are stable\nunder weight pruning: specifically, we can prune models in one-shot to 70-80%\nsparsity with almost no accuracy loss, and to 90% with reasonable ($\\sim 1\\%$)\naccuracy loss, which is competitive with gradual compression methods.\nAdditionally, CrAM can produce sparse models which perform well for transfer\nlearning, and it also works for semi-structured 2:4 pruning patterns supported\nby GPU hardware.

In this paper, we\npresent iVoro, a holistic framework for CIL, derived from computational\ngeometry. We found Voronoi Diagram (VD), a classical model for space\nsubdivision, is especially powerful for solving the CIL problem, because VD\nitself can be constructed favorably in an incremental manner -- the newly added\nsites (classes) will only affect the proximate classes, making the\nnon-contiguous classes hardly forgettable. Further, in order to find a better\nset of centers for VD construction, we colligate DNN with VD using Power\nDiagram and show that the VD structure can be optimized by integrating local\nDNN models using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Moreover, our VD construction\nis not restricted to the deep feature space, but is also applicable to multiple\nintermediate feature spaces, promoting VD to be multi-centered VD (CIVD) that\nefficiently captures multi-grained features from DNN. Importantly, iVoro is\nalso capable of handling uncertainty-aware test-time Voronoi cell assignment\nand has exhibited high correlations between geometric uncertainty and\npredictive accuracy (up to ~0.9). Putting everything together, iVoro achieves\nup to 25.26%, 37.09%, and 33.21% improvements on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and\nImageNet-Subset, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art non-exemplar\nCIL approaches.

In this\npaper, we study the effects of this superposition on pixel-based foreground\nfitting strategies by modelling the spectral energy distribution (SED) in each\npixel as the integral of individual MBB spectra over various\nphysically-motivated statistical distributions of dust cloud properties. We\nshow that fitting these SEDs with the simple two-parameter MBB model generally\nresults in unbiased estimates of the CMB Stokes Q and U amplitudes in each\npixel, unless there are significant changes in both the dust SED and\npolarization angle along the line of sight, in which case significant ($ >\n10\\sigma$) biases are observed in an illustrative model. We also find that the\nbest-fit values of the dust temperature, $T_d$, and spectral index, $\\beta_d$,\nare significantly biased away from the mean/median of the corresponding\nstatistical distributions when the distributions are broad, suggesting that MBB\nmodel fits can give an unrepresentative picture of the physical properties of\nthe dust at microwave wavelengths if not interpreted carefully. Using a Fisher\nmatrix analysis, we also determine the experimental sensitivity required to\nrecover the parameters of the $T_d$ and $\\beta_d$ distributions themselves by\nfitting a probabilistic MBB model, finding that only the parameters of broad\ndistributions can be measured by SED fitting on a single line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 16:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Strong molecule-radiation field coupling is often reached when a\nlarge number N of molecules respond collectively to the radiation field. In\nelectronic strong coupling, molecular nuclear dynamics following polariton\nexcitation reflects (a) the timescale separation between the fast electronic\nand photonic dynamics and the slow nuclear motion on one hand, and (b) the\ninterplay between the collective nature of the molecule-field coupling and the\nlocal nature of the molecules nuclear response on the other. The first implies\nthat the electronic excitation takes place, in the spirit of the Born\napproximation, at an approximately fixed nuclear configuration. The second can\nbe rephrased as the intriguing question, can the collective nature of the\noptical excitation lead to collective nuclear motion following polariton\nformation, resulting in so-called polaron decoupled dynamics. We address this\nissue by studying the dynamical properties of a simplified\nHolstein-Tavis-Cummings type model, in which boson modes representing molecular\nvibrations are replaced by two-level systems while the boson frequency and the\nvibronic coupling are represented by the coupling between these levels (that\ninduces Rabi oscillations between them) and electronic state dependence of this\ncoupling. We investigate the short-time behavior of this model following\npolariton excitation as well as its response to CW driving and its density of\nstates spectrum. We find that, while some aspects of the dynamical behavior\nappear to adhere to the polaron decoupling picture, the observed dynamics\nmostly reflect the local nature of the nuclear configuration of the electronic\npolariton rather than this picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 16:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

In Paper\nI of this series, we used the population of nearly 2000 galaxy mergers\npredicted by the TNG50-3 simulation to seed semi-analytic models of the orbital\nevolution and coalescence of MBH pairs with initial separations of about 1 kpc.\nHere, we calculate the dAGN luminosities and separation of these pairs as they\nevolve in post-merger galaxies, and show how the coalescence fraction of dAGNs\nchanges with redshift. We find that because of the several Gyr long dynamical\nfriction timescale for orbital evolution, the fraction of dAGNs that eventually\nend in a MBH merger grows with redshift and does not pass 50% until a redshift\nof 1. However, dAGNs in galaxies with bulge masses >10^10 solar masses, or\ncomprised of near-equal mass MBHs, evolve more quickly and have higher than\naverage coalescence fractions. At any redshift, dAGNs observed with small\nseparations (> 0.7 kpc) have a higher probability of merging in a Hubble time\nthan more widely separated systems. As found in Paper I, radiation feedback\neffects can significantly reduce the number of MBH mergers, and this could be\nmanifested as a larger than expected number of widely separated dAGNs. We\npresent a method to estimate the MBH coalescence rate as well as the potential\nLISA detection rate given a survey of dAGNs. Comparing these rates to the\neventual LISA measurements will help determine the efficiency of dynamical\nfriction in post-merger galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 16:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

However, the majority of the existing work focuses on 2D\nrecognition tasks. In this paper, we make the observation that there is a\ncertain persistence in TV shows, i.e., repetition of the environments and the\nhumans, which makes possible the 3D reconstruction of this content. Building on\nthis insight, we propose an automatic approach that operates on an entire\nseason of a TV show and aggregates information in 3D; we build a 3D model of\nthe environment, compute camera information, static 3D scene structure and body\nscale information.

In this paper we present our newly-developed array\narrangement, which mounts all telescopes into the inside of a hemispherical\nbowl (turning the original dome design inside-out). The telescopes' beams thus\nconverge at a single ``pseudofocal'' point. When placed along the telescope's\npolar axis, this point does not move as the telescope tracks, allowing every\ntelescope to simultaneously look through a single, unmoving window in a fixed\nenclosure. This telescope bowl is suspended from a simple free-swinging pivot\n(turning the usual telescope mounting support upside-down), with polar\nalignment afforded by the creation of a virtual polar axis defined by a second\nmounting pivot. This new design, currently being prototyped with the\n38-telescope Argus Pathfinder, eliminates the need for a movable external dome\nand thus greatly reduces the cost and complexity of the full Argus Array.\nCoupled with careful software scope control and the use of existing software\npipelines, the Argus Array could thus become one of the deepest and fastest sky\nsurveys, within a midscale-level budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

Like all things that move in space,\nwe can in principle use differential equations to describe their motion as a\nset of functions that maps time to position (and velocity, acceleration, and so\non). With inanimate objects, we can reliably predict their trajectories by\nusing differential equations that account for up to the second-order time\nderivative of their position, as is commonly done in analytical mechanics. With\nanimate objects, though, and with humans, in particular, we do not know the\ncardinality of the set of equations that define their trajectory. We may be\ntempted to think, for example, that by reason of their complexity in cognition\nor behaviour as compared to, say, a rock, then the motion of humans requires a\nmore complex description than the one generally used to describe the motion of\nphysical systems. In this paper, we examine a real-world dataset on human\nmobility and consider the information that is added by each (computed, but\ndenoised) additional time derivative, and find the maximum order of derivatives\nof the position that, for that particular dataset, cannot be expressed as a\nlinear transformation of the previous. In this manner, we identify the\ndimensionality of a minimal model that correctly describes the observed\ntrajectories.

This measure\nis robust against noise and the choice for differentiation techniques that we\nuse to compute the time-derivatives numerically as a function of the measured\nposition.

Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the\ncurrent recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training\ndata, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user\npreference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is\noften noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal\nrepresentation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT,\na novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments\nuser representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an\nexplicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to\nmaintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph\ntransformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative\nself-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the\nuser-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender\nsystems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve\nthe performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation\nstudies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation\nframework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues.

The gravitational waves from a coalescing binary contain information\nabout its orbital eccentricity, which may be measured if the binary retains\nsufficient eccentricity near merger. Dedicated waveforms are required to\nmeasure eccentricity. Several models have been put forward, and show good\nagreement with numerical relativity at the level of a few percent or better.\nHowever, there are multiple ways to define eccentricity for inspiralling\nsystems, and different models internally use different definitions of\neccentricity, making it difficult to directly compare eccentricity\nmeasurements. In this work, we systematically compare two eccentric waveform\nmodels, $\\texttt{SEOBNRE}$ and $\\texttt{TEOBResumS}$, by developing a framework\nto translate between different definitions of eccentricity. This mapping is\nconstructed by minimizing the relative mismatch between the two models over\neccentricity and reference frequency, before evolving the eccentricity of one\nmodel to the same reference frequency as the other model. We show that for a\ngiven value of eccentricity passed to $\\texttt{SEOBNRE}$, one must input a\n$20$-$50\\%$ smaller value of eccentricity to $\\texttt{TEOBResumS}$ in order to\nobtain a waveform with the same empirical eccentricity. We verify this mapping\nby repeating our analysis for eccentric numerical relativity simulations,\ndemonstrating that $\\texttt{TEOBResumS}$ reports a correspondingly smaller\nvalue of eccentricity than $\\texttt{SEOBNRE}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 18:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Our method was built on\nthe generalized U-Net architecture, which allows the evaluation of each\ncomponent individually. We modified the traditional binary training targets to\ninclude three classes for direct instance segmentation. Detailed experiments\nwere performed regarding training schemes, training settings, network\nbackbones, and individual modules on the segmentation performance. Our proposed\ntraining scheme draws minibatches in turn from each dataset, and the gradients\nare accumulated before an optimization step. We found that the key to training\na universal network is all-time supervision on all datasets, and it is\nnecessary to sample each dataset in an unbiased way. Our experiments also\nsuggest that there might exist common features to define cell boundaries across\ncell types and imaging modalities, which could allow application of trained\nmodels to totally unseen datasets. A few training tricks can further boost the\nsegmentation performance, including uneven class weights in the cross-entropy\nloss function, well-designed learning rate scheduler, larger image crops for\ncontextual information, and additional loss terms for unbalanced classes.

In this paper\nwe address two fundamental questions: the existence of oscillatory motions and\nof chaotic hyperbolic sets.\n  In 1922, Chazy classified the possible final motions of the three bodies,\nthat is the behaviors the bodies may have when time tends to infinity. One of\nthe possible behaviors are oscillatory motions, that is, solutions of the 3\nBody Problem such that the positions of the bodies $q_0, q_1, q_2$ satisfy \\[\n\\liminf_{t\\to\\pm\\infty}\\sup_{i,j=0,1,2, i\\neq j}\\|q_i-q_j\\|<+\\infty \\quad\n\\text{ and }\\quad \\limsup_{t\\to\\pm\\infty}\\sup_{i,j=0,1,2, i\\neq\nj}\\|q_i-q_j\\|=+\\infty. \\] Assume that all three masses $m_0,m_1,m_2>0$ are not\nequal. Then, we prove that such motions exists. We also prove that one can\nconstruct solutions of the three body problem whose forward and backward final\nmotions are of different type.\n  This result relies on constructing invariant sets whose dynamics is\nconjugated to the (infinite symbols) Bernouilli shift. These sets are\nhyperbolic for the symplectically reduced planar 3 Body Problem. As a\nconsequence, we obtain the existence of chaotic motions, an infinite number of\nperiodic orbits and positive topological entropy for the 3 Body Problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 19:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In this work, we propose an HRTF personalization method employing\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict a subject's HRTFs for all\ndirections from their scanned head geometry. To ease the training of the CNN\nmodels, we propose novel pre-processing methods for both the head scans and\nHRTF data to achieve compact representations. For the head scan, we use\ntruncated spherical cap harmonic (SCH) coefficients to represent the pinna\narea, which is important in the acoustic scattering process. For the HRTF data,\nwe use truncated spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients to represent the HRTF\nmagnitudes and onsets. One CNN model is trained to predict the SH coefficients\nof the HRTF magnitudes from the SCH coefficients of the scanned ear geometry\nand other anthropometric measurements of the head. The other CNN model is\ntrained to predict SH coefficients of the HRTF onsets from only the\nanthropometric measurements of the ear, head, and torso. Combining the\nmagnitude and onset predictions, our method is able to predict the complete and\nglobal HRTF data. A leave-one-out validation with the log-spectral distortion\n(LSD) metric is used for objective evaluation. The results show a decent LSD\nlevel at both spatial \\& temporal dimensions compared to the ground-truth HRTFs\nand a lower LSD than the boundary element method (BEM) simulation of HRTFs that\nthe database provides. The localization simulation results with an auditory\nmodel are also consistent with the objective evaluation metrics, showing the\nlocalization responses with our predicted HRTFs are significantly better than\nwith the BEM calculated ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 19:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

The\nmost common definition is that of partial equivalence, namely that the two\nfunctions emit the same output if they are fed with the same input and they\nboth terminate. The strategy used by the Regression Verification Tool (RVT) is\nto progress bottom up on the call graphs of $P_1,P_2$, abstract those functions\nthat were already proven to be equivalent with uninterpreted functions, turn\nloops into recursion, and abstract the recursive calls also with uninterpreted\nfunctions. This enables it to create verification conditions in the form of\nsmall programs that are loop- and recursion-free.

Firstly, the effect of changing island half-width at a fixed system\nsize is investigated. As the island half-width increases, the total magnetic\nflux content increases resulting in an increase in upstream magnetic field,\nupstream velocity field and unnormalized reconnection rate while keeping the\nnormalized rate, downstream magnetic field and current sheet length independent\nof it. Interestingly, the reconnection rate is found to be different from the\nupstream and downstream velocity as well as inverse aspect ratio of the current\nsheet, as opposed to the findings of the Sweet-Parker model. Secondly, the\nin-plane shear flow effects are studied, keeping the island width and system\nsize fixed. Here thickness and length of the current sheet, the upstream\nmagnetic and velocity field components, reconnection rate and time, current\nsheet inclination angle with shear flow length scale and amplitude are\ncalculated. Interestingly, the inclination angle of the current sheet and the\ndiffusion region are found to be different. These differences are more in\nstronger shear flows. These results are significantly different from the Harris\nsheet setup with shear flow.

However, the\nperformance of these solutions is limited by the amount of records available\nfrom warm users to use. Thus, building a recommendation system based on few\ninteraction records from a few users still remains a challenging problem for\nunpopular or early-stage recommendation platforms. This paper focuses on\nsolving the few-shot recommendation problem for news recommendation based on\ntwo observations. First, news at different platforms (even in different\nlanguages) may share similar topics. Second, the user preference over these\ntopics is transferable across different platforms. Therefore, we propose to\nsolve the few-shot news recommendation problem by transferring the user-news\npreference from a rich source domain to a low-resource target domain. To bridge\ntwo domains in different languages without any overlapping users and news, we\npropose a novel unsupervised cross-lingual transfer model as the news encoder\nthat aligns semantically similar news in two domains. A user encoder is\nconstructed on top of the aligned news encoding and transfers the user\npreference from the source to the target domain. Experimental results on two\nreal-world news recommendation datasets show the superior performance of our\nproposed method on addressing few-shot news recommendation, comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 20:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

Such systems are encountered frequently in shear-dominated\nfluid flows where non-normality plays a significant role in the growth of\ndisturbances. In order to address these issues, we employ ideas from active\nsubspaces to find low-dimensional systems of coordinates for model reduction\nthat balance adjoint-based information about the system's sensitivity with the\nvariance of states along trajectories. The resulting method, which we refer to\nas covariance balancing reduction using adjoint snapshots (CoBRAS), is\nanalogous to balanced truncation with state and adjoint-based gradient\ncovariance matrices replacing the system Gramians and obeying the same key\ntransformation laws. Here, the extracted coordinates are associated with an\noblique projection that can be used to construct Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order\nmodels. We provide an efficient snapshot-based computational method analogous\nto balanced proper orthogonal decomposition. This also leads to the observation\nthat the reduced coordinates can be computed relying on inner products of state\nand gradient samples alone, allowing us to find rich nonlinear coordinates by\nreplacing the inner product with a kernel function. In these coordinates,\nreduced-order models can be learned using regression.

Robust 2D ferromagnetism with out-of-plane anisotropy and a\ncritical temperature of $\\text{T}_\\text{c}\\approx$~15 K is demonstrated by\nX-ray magnetic dichroism and electrical transport measurements. Using\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we observe the opening of a sizable\nmagnetic gap in the 2D FM phase, while the surface remains gapless in the\nparamagnetic phase above T$_c$. This sizable gap indicates a relocation of the\nTSS to the FM ordered Mn moments near the surface, which leads to a large\nmutual overlap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Our study shows\nthat Lorentz violation can also activate multiple polarizations of GWs. We use\nthe gauge invariants to investigate the polarizations of GWs in the bumblebee\ngravity model, and obtain the following results. (i) For a vector background\n$b^\\mu$ with only a nonzero temporal component $b^t$, there are five\nindependent propagating degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is simlar to the\nEinstein-aether theory. (ii) The presence of a spatial component in the\nbackground defines a preferred spatial direction which breaks rotational\nsymmetry. We denote $\\hat{\\bf b}$ as the direction of the spatial part of the\nbackground and $b_s$ as its length. If GWs propagate along $\\hat{\\bf b}$, the\npolarization content is similar to the purely timelike case. (iii) If the\npropagation direction of GWs is separated by an angle $\\beta$ to $\\hat{\\bf b}$,\nand $\\beta=\\arccos(b^t/b_s)$, there are only two tensor polarizations.

Three cases of moderate AS, one with a dilated\nascending aorta and two within the normal range (root diameter less than 4cm)\nare simulated for physiological beat cycle waveforms obtained from\nechocardiography data. The computational framework is built based on\nsharp-interface Immersed Boundary Method, where aortic geometries segmented\nfrom CT angiograms are integrated into a high-order incompressible\nNavier-Stokes solver. We show that even though the wall shear stress is\nelevated and oscillatory due to turbulence in the ascending aorta for all the\ncases, its spatial distribution is significantly more focused for the case with\ndilation than those without dilation. This focal area is linked to aortic valve\njet impingement on the outer curvature of the ascending aorta, and has been\nshown in vivo using 4D flow MRI of aortic stenosis patients with aortic\ndilation (van Ooij et al., J.

The cases without dilation, on the contrary, showed a\nrather oscillatory pressure behaviour, with no persistent pressure buildup\neffect. We further argue that a more proximal branching of the aortic arch\ncould explain the lack of a focal area of elevated wall shear stress and\npressure, because it interferes with the impingement process due to fluid\nsuction effects.

We extend our lower bounds to the case where the learner performs\npossibly adaptive measurements from a fixed set of $\\exp(O(d))$ measurements.\nThis implies in particular that adaptivity does not give us any advantage using\nsingle-copy measurements that are efficiently implementable. We also obtain a\nsimilar bound in the case where the goal is to predict the expectation values\nof a given sequence of observables, a task known as shadow tomography. Finally,\nin the case of adaptive, single-copy measurements implementable with\npolynomial-size circuits, we prove that a straightforward strategy based on\ncomputing sample means of the given observables is optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 02:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 22:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Although a few methods have been recently proposed to handle the\neffect of hidden variables, these methods often overlook the possibility of any\ninteraction between the observed treatment variable and the unobserved\ncovariates. In this work, we address this shortcoming by studying a\nmultivariate response regression problem with both unobserved and heterogeneous\nconfounding variables of the form $Y=A^T X+ B^T Z+ \\sum_{j=1}^{p} C^T_j X_j Z +\nE$, where $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ are $m$-dimensional response variables, $X \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^p$ are observed covariates (including the treatment variable), $Z\n\\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ are $K$-dimensional unobserved confounders, and $E \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^m$ is the random noise. Allowing for the interaction between $X_j$\nand $Z$ induces the heterogeneous confounding effect. Our goal is to estimate\nthe unknown matrix $A$, the direct effect of the observed covariates or the\ntreatment on the responses. To this end, we propose a new debiased estimation\napproach via SVD to remove the effect of unobserved confounding variables. The\nrate of convergence of the estimator is established under both the\nhomoscedastic and heteroscedastic noises.

A\nkey question when applying sub-sampling approaches is how to select an\ninformative subset based on the questions being asked of the data. A recent\napproach for this has been proposed based on determining sub-sampling\nprobabilities for each data point, but a limitation of this approach is that\nappropriate sub-sampling probabilities rely on an assumed model for the Big\ndata. In this article, to overcome this limitation, we propose a model robust\napproach where a set of models is considered, and the sub-sampling\nprobabilities are evaluated based on the weighted average of probabilities that\nwould be obtained if each model was considered singularly.

In future, learning on small data\nthat approximates the generalization ability of big data is one of the ultimate\npurposes of AI, which requires machines to recognize objectives and scenarios\nrelying on small data as humans. A series of learning topics is going on this\nway such as active learning and few-shot learning. However, there are few\ntheoretical guarantees for their generalization performance. Moreover, most of\ntheir settings are passive, that is, the label distribution is explicitly\ncontrolled by finite training resources from known distributions. This survey\nfollows the agnostic active sampling theory under a PAC (Probably Approximately\nCorrect) framework to analyze the generalization error and label complexity of\nlearning on small data in model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised fashion.\nConsidering multiple learning communities could produce small data\nrepresentation and related topics have been well surveyed, we thus subjoin\nnovel geometric representation perspectives for small data: the Euclidean and\nnon-Euclidean (hyperbolic) mean, where the optimization solutions including the\nEuclidean gradients, non-Euclidean gradients, and Stein gradient are presented\nand discussed. Later, multiple learning communities that may be improved by\nlearning on small data are summarized, which yield data-efficient\nrepresentations, such as transfer learning, contrastive learning, graph\nrepresentation learning. Meanwhile, we find that the meta-learning may provide\neffective parameter update policies for learning on small data. Then, we\nexplore multiple challenging scenarios for small data, such as the weak\nsupervision and multi-label.

The proposed approach\nprovides a much tighter upper bound when compared to the traditionally used\nunion bound, especially when the number of pairwise error probabilities (PEPs)\nis large. In fact, the proposed approach tightens the union bound by first\nassuming that a detection error always occurs in a deep fading event where the\nchannel gain is lower than a certain threshold. A minimisation is then taken\nwith respect to the gain threshold in order to make the upper bound as tight as\npossible. We also prove that the objective function has a single minimiser\nunder several general assumptions so that the minimiser can be easily found\nusing optimisation algorithms. The expression of the new upper bound under\ncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is derived and several analytical and\nnumerical examples are provided to show the performance of the proposed bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 03:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

There is a canonical family of distributed graph\ncoloring algorithms known as the locally-iterative coloring algorithms, first\nformalized in the seminal work of [Szegedy and Vishwanathan, STOC'93]. In such\nalgorithms, every vertex iteratively updates its own color according to a\npredetermined function of the current coloring of its local neighborhood. Due\nto the simplicity and naturalness of its framework, locally-iterative coloring\nalgorithms are of great significance both in theory and practice. In this\npaper, we give a locally-iterative $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with\n$O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta)+\\log^*n$ running time. This is the first\nlocally-iterative $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm with sublinear-in-$\\Delta$\nrunning time, and answers the main open question raised in a recent\nbreakthrough [Barenboim, Elkin, and Goldberg, JACM'21]. A key component of our\nalgorithm is a locally-iterative procedure that transforms an\n$O(\\Delta^2)$-coloring to a $(\\Delta+O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta))$-coloring in\n$o(\\Delta)$ time. Inside this procedure we work on special proper colorings\nthat encode (arb)defective colorings, and reduce the number of used colors\nquadratically in a locally-iterative fashion. As a main application of our\nresult, we also give a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring with $O(\\Delta^{3/4}\\log\\Delta)+\\log^*n$ stabilization\ntime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-stabilizing\nalgorithm for $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring with sublinear-in-$\\Delta$ stabilization\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 03:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

However, existing top-performing works\nusually impose pairwise similarities on the semantic embedding spaces or design\na localization sub-network to continually fine-tune the entire model in limited\ndata scenarios, thus resulting in convergence to suboptimal solutions. In this\npaper, we develop Fine-grained Retrieval Prompt Tuning (FRPT), which steers a\nfrozen pre-trained model to perform the fine-grained retrieval task from the\nperspectives of sample prompting and feature adaptation. Specifically, FRPT\nonly needs to learn fewer parameters in the prompt and adaptation instead of\nfine-tuning the entire model, thus solving the issue of convergence to\nsuboptimal solutions caused by fine-tuning the entire model. Technically, a\ndiscriminative perturbation prompt (DPP) is introduced and deemed as a sample\nprompting process, which amplifies and even exaggerates some discriminative\nelements contributing to category prediction via a content-aware inhomogeneous\nsampling operation. In this way, DPP can make the fine-grained retrieval task\naided by the perturbation prompts close to the solved task during the original\npre-training. Thereby, it preserves the generalization and discrimination of\nrepresentation extracted from input samples. Besides, a category-specific\nawareness head is proposed and regarded as feature adaptation, which removes\nthe species discrepancies in features extracted by the pre-trained model using\ncategory-guided instance normalization. And thus, it makes the optimized\nfeatures only include the discrepancies among subcategories.

In downlink transmissions, the data symbols are broadcast\nfrom a base station to different users, which are superimposed with different\npower to facilitate high-integrity detection using successive interference\ncancellation (SIC). However, SIC requires accurate knowledge of both the\nchannel model and channel state information (CSI), which may be difficult to\nacquire. We propose a deep learningaided SIC detector termed SICNet, which\nreplaces the interference cancellation blocks of SIC by deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Explicitly, SICNet jointly trains its internal DNN-aided blocks for\ninferring the soft information representing the interfering symbols in a\ndata-driven fashion, rather than using hard-decision decoders as in classical\nSIC. As a result, SICNet reliably detects the superimposed symbols in the\ndownlink of non-orthogonal systems without requiring any prior knowledge of the\nchannel model, while being less sensitive to CSI uncertainty than its\nmodel-based counterpart. SICNet is also robust to changes in the number of\nusers and to their power allocation. Furthermore, SICNet learns to produce\naccurate soft outputs, which facilitates improved soft-input error correction\ndecoding compared to model-based SIC. Finally, we propose an online training\nmethod for SICNet under block fading, which exploits the channel decoding for\naccurately recovering online data labels for retraining, hence, allowing it to\nsmoothly track the fading envelope without requiring dedicated pilots. Our\nnumerical results show that SICNet approaches the performance of classical SIC\nunder perfect CSI, while outperforming it under realistic CSI uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 04:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In each step, a subset of\nedges of $K_n$, say $X$, is independently sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$ and\npresented to the player. The player then adaptively selects precisely one edge\n$e$ from $X$, and adds $e$ to its current graph.

Through appropriate choices of\n$\\mathcal{D}$, the $\\mathcal{D}$-process generalizes well-studied adaptive\nprocesses, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process.\n  We prove a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a\nsharp threshold for the property $\\mathcal{P}$ in the $\\mathcal{D}$-process.

In this paper, we shed light on the behavior of\nthese algorithms in the full-batch and sufficiently large batch settings.\nSpecifically, we empirically demonstrate that during full-batch training, the\nmaximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian typically equilibrates at a\ncertain numerical value -- the stability threshold of a gradient descent\nalgorithm. For Adam with step size $\\eta$ and $\\beta_1 = 0.9$, this stability\nthreshold is $38/\\eta$. Similar effects occur during minibatch training,\nespecially as the batch size grows. Yet, even though adaptive methods train at\nthe ``Adaptive Edge of Stability'' (AEoS), their behavior in this regime\ndiffers in a significant way from that of non-adaptive methods at the EoS.\nWhereas non-adaptive algorithms at the EoS are blocked from entering\nhigh-curvature regions of the loss landscape, adaptive gradient methods at the\nAEoS can keep advancing into high-curvature regions, while adapting the\npreconditioner to compensate.

Mainly we have compared results between the hadronic and quark\nequation of state. The quark matter is modelled with Gibbs formalism, where a\nmixed-phase appears between the pure hadronic and pure quark state. We have\nvaried the density where quark matter first appears. It is found that when two\nalmost equal mass binaries merge, the final star attains a stable configuration\n(does not collapse) irrespective of the matter properties. However, if the\npost-merger scenario of the binary merger can be probed, a significant\ndifference in the gravitational wave amplitude can be seen if quark matter\nappears at low densities. It is found that if the matter properties with\nhadronic and quark degrees differ significantly, it is reflected in the\nstability of the final merger product. Hadronic matter can give a stable\nremnant star, whereas if quark matter appears, it makes the collapse possible\n(assuming that the hadronic equation of state is stiffer than the quark\nequation of state). However, when unequal mass binaries (the mass difference is\nsignificant) merge, the difference in the observational signals depending on\nthe equation of state (hadronic or quark) is evident just from the point of\nfirst contact.

However, the annotation of NR-IQA is\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming, which severely limits their application\nespecially for authentic images. To relieve the dependence on quality\nannotation, some works have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to\nNR-IQA. However, the above methods ignore that the alignment space used in\nclassification is sub-optimal, since the space is not elaborately designed for\nperception. To solve this challenge, we propose an effective\nperception-oriented unsupervised domain adaptation method StyleAM for NR-IQA,\nwhich transfers sufficient knowledge from label-rich source domain data to\nlabel-free target domain images via Style Alignment and Mixup. Specifically, we\nfind a more compact and reliable space i.e., feature style space for\nperception-oriented UDA based on an interesting/amazing observation, that the\nfeature style (i.e., the mean and variance) of the deep layer in DNNs is\nexactly associated with the quality score in NR-IQA. Therefore, we propose to\nalign the source and target domains in a more perceptual-oriented space i.e.,\nthe feature style space, to reduce the intervention from other\nquality-irrelevant feature factors. Furthermore, to increase the consistency\nbetween quality score and its feature style, we also propose a novel feature\naugmentation strategy Style Mixup, which mixes the feature styles (i.e., the\nmean and variance) before the last layer of DNNs together with mixing their\nlabels.

The elastic scattering of slow particles by pair of non-overlapping\nshort-range potentials has been studied. The continuum wave function of\nparticle is represented as a combination of a plane wave and two spherical\ns-waves, generated by the scattering centers. The asymptotic of this function\ndetermines in closed form the amplitude of elastic particle scattering. It is\nshown that this amplitude of scattering on a nonspherical target cannot be\ncorrectly represented as an expansion into a series of spherical functions , as\nis the case for scattering on an atom. Therefore, methods of the scattering\nphase calculation based on the assumption of spherical symmetry of the\nmolecular potential field beyond the molecular sphere cannot be considered as\njustified and reliable. So is the representation outside this sphere of the\nwave function as a linear combination of the regular and irregular solutions of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation. It has been shown that asymptotically at great\ndistances from the molecule the continuum wave functions can be presented as an\nexpansion in a set of other, than spherical, orthonormal functions . General\nformulas for these functions are obtained. The coefficients of the scattering\namplitude expansion to a series of these functions determine the scattering\nphases for the molecular system under consideration. The special features of\nthe S-matrix method for the case of arbitrary non-spherical potentials are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 06:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In our\nproblem, a fleet of robots is initially distributed in the plane. The socalled\nvertex robots take the responsibility of determining the geometric shape of the\nentire formation and its overall size, while the others move so as to minimize\nthe differences with two direct neighbors. In the first step, each vertex robot\nestimates the number of robots in its associated chain. Two types of control\ninputs that serve for the estimation are designed using the measurements from\nthe latest and the last two time instants respectively. In the second step, the\nself-organized formation control law is proposed where only vertex robots\nreceive external information. Comparisons between the two estimation strategies\nare carried out in terms of the convergence speed and robustness.

The key for generating effective trajectory embeddings is to\nextract high-level travel semantics from trajectories, including movement\npatterns and travel purposes, with consideration of the trajectories' long-term\nspatial-temporal correlations. Despite the existing efforts, there are still\nmajor challenges in pre-training trajectory embeddings. First, commonly used\ngenerative pretext tasks are not suitable for extracting high-level semantics\nfrom trajectories. Second, existing data augmentation methods fit badly on\ntrajectory datasets. Third, current encoder designs fail to fully incorporate\nlong-term spatial-temporal correlations hidden in trajectories. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Contrastive Spatial-Temporal Trajectory\nEmbedding (CSTTE) model for learning comprehensive trajectory embeddings.

A class of such enhanced sampling methods works by identifying a few\nslow degrees of freedom, termed collective variables (CVs), and enhancing the\nsampling along these CVs. Selecting CVs to analyze and drive the sampling is\nnot trivial and often relies on physical and chemical intuition. Despite\nroutinely circumventing this issue using manifold learning to estimate CVs\ndirectly from standard simulations, such methods cannot provide mappings to a\nlow-dimensional manifold from enhanced sampling simulations as the geometry and\ndensity of the learned manifold are biased. Here, we address this crucial issue\nand provide a general reweighting framework based on anisotropic diffusion maps\nfor manifold learning that takes into account that the learning data set is\nsampled from a biased probability distribution. We consider manifold learning\nmethods based on constructing a Markov chain describing transition\nprobabilities between high-dimensional samples. We show that our framework\nreverts the biasing effect yielding CVs that correctly describe the equilibrium\ndensity. This advancement enables the construction of low-dimensional CVs using\nmanifold learning directly from data generated by enhanced sampling\nsimulations.

The vertical Laplacian of the\ntangent bundle possesses the same form as the Hamiltonian of a 2D semiconductor\nquantum Hall system. This explains fractional charge quantization of quarks and\nthe existence of lepton and quark families. As will be shown the SU(3) colour\nsymmetry for strong interaction arises in the TB as an emergent symmetry\nsimilar as Chern-Simon gauge symmetries in quantum Hall systems. This predicts\na signature of quark confinement as an universal large-scale property of the\nChern-Simon fields and induces a new understanding of the vacuum as the ground\nstate occupied with a condensate of quark-antiquark pairs. The gap for\nquark-antiquark pairing is calculated in the mean-field approximation which\nallows a numerical estimation of the characteristic parameters of the vacuum\nsuch as its chemical potential, the quark condensation parameter and the vacuum\nenergy. Note that previously a gauge theoretical understanding of gravity has\nbeen achieved by considering the translation group T(3,1) in the TB as gauge\ngroup.

When\napplied to unseen classes, the prototypes often perform suboptimally due to\ndomain shift.

To\naddress this shortcoming, the paper deals with the theoretical modelling of a\nviscoelastic beam dynamics, and pursues the elucidation of underlying how the\nflexural vibrations may be affected when an axial preload, compressive or\ntensile, is applied. The analytical model presented, is able to shed light on a\npeculiar behaviour, which is strongly related to the frequency dependent\ndamping induced by viscoelasticity.

In spectral clustering, we aim to identify clusters of nodes\nwhere most edges fall within clusters and only few edges fall between clusters.\nThis task is important for many downstream applications and exploratory\nanalysis. A core step of spectral clustering is performing an\neigendecomposition of the corresponding graph Laplacian matrix (or\nequivalently, a singular value decomposition, SVD, of the incidence matrix).\nThe convergence of iterative singular value decomposition approaches depends on\nthe eigengaps of the spectrum of the given matrix, i.e., the difference between\nconsecutive eigenvalues. For a graph Laplacian corresponding to a\nwell-clustered graph, the eigenvalues will be non-negative but very small (much\nless than $1$) slowing convergence. This paper introduces a parallelizable\napproach to dilating the spectrum in order to accelerate SVD solvers and in\nturn, spectral clustering. This is accomplished via polynomial approximations\nto matrix operations that favorably transform the spectrum of a matrix without\nchanging its eigenvectors.

The N-PDFs are\ndouble-log-normal at low column densities, and display one or two power law\ntails (PLTs) at higher column densities. For diffuse, quiescent, and low-mass\nSF clouds, we propose that the two log-normals arise from the atomic and\nmolecular phase, respectively. For massive clouds, we suggest that the first\nlog-normal is built up by turbulently mixed H2 and the second one by compressed\n(via stellar feedback) molecular gas. Nearly all clouds have two PLTs with\nslopes consistent with self-gravity, where the second one can be flatter or\nsteeper than the first one. A flatter PLT could be caused by stellar feedback\nor other physical processes that slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass\ntoward higher densities. The steeper slope could arise if the magnetic field is\noriented perpendicular to the LOS column density distribution. The first\ndeviation point (DP), where the N-PDF turns from log-normal into a PLT, shows a\nclustering around values of a visual extinction of AV (DP1) around 2-5. The\nsecond DP, which defines the break between the two PLTs, varies strongly. Using\nthe Delta-variance, we observe that the AV value, where the slope changes\nbetween the first and second PLT, increases with the characteristic size scale\nin the variance spectrum. We conclude that at low column densities, atomic and\nmolecular gas is turbulently mixed, while at high column densities, the gas is\nfully molecular and dominated by self-gravity. The best fitting model N-PDFs of\nmolecular clouds is thus one with log-normal low column density distributions,\nfollowed by one or two PLTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 10:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the role of non-Hermiticity in the Chern insulating Haldane model\non a dice lattice. Due to the presence of a non-dispersive flat band, the\ndice-Haldane model hosts a topologically rich phase diagram with the\nnon-trivial phases accommodating Chern numbers $\\pm 2$. We introduce\nnon-Hermiticity into this model in two ways -- through balanced non-Hermitian\ngain and loss, and by non-reciprocal hopping in one direction. Both these types\nof non-Hermiticity induce higher-order exceptional points of order three. We\nsubstantiate the presence and the order of these higher-order exceptional\npoints using the phase rigidity and its scaling. Further, we construct a phase\ndiagram to identify and locate the occurrence of these exceptional points in\nthe parameter space. Non-Hermiticity has yet more interesting consequences on a\nfinite-sized lattice. Unlike for balanced gain and loss, in the case of\nnon-reciprocal hopping, the nearest-neighbour dice lattice system under\nperiodic boundary conditions accommodates a finite, non-zero spectral area in\nthe complex plane. This manifests as the non-Hermitian skin effect when open\nboundary conditions are invoked. In the more general case of the dice-Haldane\nlattice model, the non-Hermitian skin effect can be caused by both gain and\nloss or non-reciprocity. Fascinatingly, the direction of localization of the\neigenstates depends on the nature and strength of the non-Hermiticity. We\nestablish the occurrence of the skin effect using the local density of states,\ninverse participation ratio and the edge probability, and demonstrate its\nrobustness to disorder.

Here we report deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations allowing to\nresolve at atomic-resolution the complex dynamics of various types of copper\n(Cu) surfaces, used as an example, near the H\\\"uttig ($\\sim1/3$ of melting)\ntemperature. The development of a deep neural network potential trained on DFT\ncalculations provides a dynamically-accurate force field that we use to\nsimulate large atomistic models of different Cu surface types. A combination of\nhigh-dimensional structural descriptors and unsupervised machine learning\nallows identifying and tracking all the atomic environments (AEs) emerging in\nthe surfaces at finite temperatures.

Our analyses allow\nestimating the lifetime of all the AEs populating these Cu surfaces and to\nreconstruct their dynamic interconversions networks.

CELU-VFL caches the stale statistics and reuses them to\nestimate model gradients without exchanging the ad hoc statistics. Significant\ntechniques are proposed to improve the convergence performance. First, to\nhandle the stochastic variance problem, we propose a uniform sampling strategy\nto fairly choose the stale statistics for local updates.

Alfv\\'en waves\ncan establish such a coupling by forming Alfv\\'en wings. SPI allows phenomena\nthat we do not know from the Solar System. Wing-wing interaction is such an\nexample, where the Alfv\\'en wings of two planets merge and interact\nnon-linearly. In this paper we focus on the effects that SPI has on other\nplanets and the stellar wind. First, we analyse the different wave structures\nconnected to SPI. The second part then investigates wing-wing interaction. Our\nstudy applies a magnetohydrodynamic model to describe a stellar system with\nmultiple possible planets. As an example, we chose TRAPPIST-1 and its two\ninnermost planets. We extended the PLUTO code to simulate collisions between\natmospheric neutral particles and plasma ions. Neutral gas clouds imitate the\nplanets and move through the simulation domain. That allows the simulation of\nfully time-dependent stellar systems. We analysed the wave structures, which\nresult from the interaction between stellar wind and TRAPPIST-1 b. The inward\ngoing wave structure is an Alfv\\'en wing. The outward going part of the\ninteraction consists of an Alfv\\'en wing, slow mode waves, the planetary wake\nand a slow shock. We quantified the strength of the respective wave\nperturbations at the outer planets to be on the order of 10\\% to 40\\% of the\nlocal background values of thermal, magnetic and dynamic pressure. Wing-wing\ninteraction occurs due to the relative position of two planets during their\nconjunction and shows three phases. First there is an initial, non-linear\nintensification of the Poynting flux by $20\\%$, an intermediate phase with\nreduced Poynting flux and a third phase when the Alfv\\'en wing of planet c goes\nthrough planet b's wave structures with another intensification of the Poynting\nflux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 13:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

For this purpose, a general state-space model for\nmobile platforms with several kinematic chains is defined, which considers\nnon-linearities and constraints. The proposed motion planner is based on a\nsequential multi-stage approach that takes advantage of the warm start on each\nstep. Firstly, a globally optimal and smooth 2D/3D trajectory is generated\nusing the Fast Marching Method. This trajectory is fed as a warm start to a\nsequential linear quadratic regulator that is able to generate an optimal\nmotion plan without constraints for all the platform actuators. Finally, a\nfeasible motion plan is generated considering the constraints defined in the\nmodel. In this respect, the sequential linear quadratic regulator is employed\nagain, taking the previously generated unconstrained motion plan as a warm\nstart.

This rover is an Ackermann-capable planetary\nexploration testbed that is equipped with a robotic arm.

It is known that\nthis dark matter candidate tends to conflict with the relevant constraints such\nas the neutrino oscillation data and charged lepton flavor violating processes\nif its thermal production mechanism is assumed. We find that the dark matter\nproduction mechanisms are modified by first-order phase transitions at some\nspecific parameter regions, where the phase transitions can be one-step or\ntwo-step depending on the parameters. If the phase transition is one-step, a\nsufficiently low nucleation temperature is required to reproduce the observed\nrelic abundance of dark matter. If the phase transition is two-step, the dark\nmatter should never be thermalized, otherwise the abundance would remain too\nmuch and overclose the universe. This is because the nucleation temperature\ncannot be low as in the one-step case. Therefore we require another way of dark\nmatter production, the freeze-in mechanism for the two-step case. We show that\nthe freeze-in mechanism is modified by the temporary vacuum expectation value\nof the inert scalar field. In both cases, the first-order phase transitions\ncould produce observable gravitational wave spectra. In particular for the\none-step phase transition, the generated gravitational waves with sizable\nenergy density are intrinsically correlated with the dark matter production\nmechanism, and can be detectable by future space-based interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 13:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 04:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

We order aggregate\nrandom variables under the convex order and provide methods to compute the\ncumulative distribution function of aggregate rvs when the marginals are\ndiscrete. Finally, we discuss risk-sharing and capital allocation, providing\nnumerical examples for each.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 14:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

As a\nprototypical illustration, we study the entanglement asymmetry in a quantum\nquench of a spin chain in which an initially broken global $U(1)$ symmetry is\nrestored dynamically. We adapt the quasiparticle picture for entanglement\nevolution to the analytic determination of the entanglement asymmetry.

These\nmethods do not reason the target moment locations based on the visual-textual\nsemantic alignment but over-rely on the temporal biases of queries in training\nsets. To this end, this paper proposes a novel training framework for grounding\nmodels to use shuffled videos to address temporal bias problem without losing\ngrounding accuracy. Our framework introduces two auxiliary tasks, cross-modal\nmatching and temporal order discrimination, to promote the grounding model\ntraining. The cross-modal matching task leverages the content consistency\nbetween shuffled and original videos to force the grounding model to mine\nvisual contents to semantically match queries. The temporal order\ndiscrimination task leverages the difference in temporal order to strengthen\nthe understanding of long-term temporal contexts.

Through probabilistic\ninference, the susceptibility map and distribution parameters can be jointly\nrecovered using approximate message passing (AMP).\n  Methods: We compare our proposed AMP with built-in parameter estimation\n(AMP-PE) to the state-of-the-art L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI approaches on the\nsimulated and in vivo datasets, and perform experiments to explore the optimal\nsettings of AMP-PE. Reproducible code is available at\nhttps://github.com/EmoryCN2L/QSM_AMP_PE\n  Results: On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP-PE achieved the lowest NRMSE,\nDFCM and the highest SSIM, while MEDI achieved the lowest HFEN. On the in vivo\ndatasets, AMP-PE is robust and successfully recovers the susceptibility maps\nusing the estimated parameters, whereas L1-QSM, FANSI and MEDI typically\nrequire additional visual fine-tuning to select or double-check working\nparameters.\n  Conclusion: AMP-PE provides automatic and adaptive parameter estimation for\nQSM and avoids the subjectivity from the visual fine-tuning step, making it an\nexcellent choice for the clinical setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 14:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 16:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 21:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

A key aspect is competency, as cells are not a\npassive material but descendants of unicellular organisms with complex\ncontext-sensitive capabilities. We used an evolutionary simulation in the\ncontext of minimal artificial embryogeny to probe the effects of different\ndegrees of cellular competency on evolutionary dynamics. Virtual embryos\nconsisted of a single axis of positional information values provided by cells'\ngenomes, operated upon by an evolutionary cycle in which embryos' fitness was\nproportional to monotonicity of the axial gradient. Evolutionary dynamics were\nevaluated in two modes: hardwired \"mosaic\" development (genotype directly\nencodes phenotype), and a more realistic mode in which cells interact prior to\nevaluation by the fitness function (\"regulative\" development). Even minimal\ncompetency with respect to improving their position in the embryo results in\nbetter performance of the evolutionary search. Crucially, we observed that as\ncompetency of cells masks the raw fitness of the genomes, the phenotypic\nfitness gains are then mostly due to improvements of cells' developmental\nproblem-solving capacities, not the structural genome. This suggests the\nexistence of a powerful ratchet mechanism: evolution progressively becomes\nlocked in to improvements in the intelligence of its agential substrate, with\nreduced pressure on the structural genome. A feedback loop in which evolution\nincreasingly puts more effort into the developmental software than perfecting\nthe hardware explains the very puzzling divergence of genome from anatomy in\nspecies like planaria, identifies a possible drive for scaling intelligence\nover time, and suggests strategies for engineering novel systems in silico and\nin bioengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 15:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}
