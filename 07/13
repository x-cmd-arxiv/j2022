Due to the improved\ninteraction balance it allows for more accurate description of condensed phase\nsystems. In the present work we develop a consistent strategy to parametrize\ncarbohydrate molecules accurately within the framework of Martini 3. In\nparticular, we develop a canonical mapping scheme that decomposes arbitrarily\nlarge carbohydrates into a limited number of fragments. Bead types for these\nfragments have been assigned by matching physicochemical properties of mono-\nand disaccharides. In addition, guidelines for assigning bonds, angles, and\ndihedrals are developed. These guidelines enable a more accurate description of\ncarbohydrate conformations than in the Martini 2 force field. We show that\nmodels obtained with this approach are able to accurately reproduce osmotic\npressures of carbohydrate water solutions. Furthermore, we provide evidence\nthat the model differentiates correctly the solubility of the poly-glucoses\ndextran (water soluble) and cellulose (water insoluble, but soluble in\nionic-liquids). Finally, we demonstrate that the new building blocks can be\napplied to glycolipids, being able to reproduce membrane properties and to\ninduce binding of peripheral membrane proteins.

The uncertainty analysis of stochastic simulators requires their\nrepeated evaluation for different values of the input variables, as well as for\ndifferent realizations of the underlying latent stochasticity. The\ncomputational cost of such analyses can be considerable, which motivates the\nconstruction of surrogate models that can approximate the original model and\nits stochastic response, but can be evaluated at much lower cost.\n  We propose a surrogate model for stochastic simulators based on spectral\nexpansions.

However, the\ndistillation-based methods are intrinsically sub-optimal since it forces the\nnew feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space. To address this\nissue, we propose the Ranking-based Backward Compatible Learning (RBCL), which\ndirectly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features.\nDifferent from previous methods, RBCL only pushes the new features to find\nbest-ranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment,\nand is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval.

The code is designed to sample efficiently from posterior\ndistributions with non-trivial geometry, including strong multimodality and\nnon-linearity. To this end, pocoMC relies on the Preconditioned Monte Carlo\nalgorithm which utilises a Normalising Flow in order to decorrelate the\nparameters of the posterior. It facilitates both tasks of parameter estimation\nand model comparison, focusing especially on computationally expensive\napplications. It allows fitting arbitrary models defined as a log-likelihood\nfunction and a log-prior probability density function in Python. Compared to\npopular alternatives (e.g. nested sampling) pocoMC can speed up the sampling\nprocedure by orders of magnitude, cutting down the computational cost\nsubstantially. Finally, parallelisation to computing clusters manifests linear\nscaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 16:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

DFT calculates a direct band-gap of $\\sim$$0.47$\neV, while $G_{0}W_{0}$ method estimates a band-gap of $\\sim1.01$ eV. We used\nparabola fitting to estimate effective mass ($m^{*}$) values for bands B1-B4 at\n$\\Gamma$-point, which are $\\sim$ -0.087 (-0.075), $\\sim$ -0.17 (-0.27), $\\sim$\n-0.17 (-0.27), and $\\sim$ 0.049 (0.058) along the $\\Gamma-X$ ($\\Gamma-L$)\ndirection, respectively. We also examine phonon dispersion and thermal\nproperties. Furthermore, optoelectronics' properties are calculated within the\nenergy range of 0 to 10 eV. The optical conductivity $\\sigma (\\omega)$,\nrefractive index $\\tilde{n}(\\omega)$, and dielectric function $\\epsilon\n(\\omega)$ show strong optical transitions in the visible region.

Consider this partition into positive and negative groups as the\ndescription of a partially defined Boolean function; the data is then processed\nto identify a subset of attributes, whose values may be used to characterize\nthe observations of the positive groups against those of the negative group.\n  LAD constitutes an interesting rule-based learning alternative to classic\nstatistical learning techniques and has many practical applications.\nNevertheless, the computation of group characterization may be costly,\ndepending on the properties of the data instances. A major aim of our work is\nto provide effective tools for speeding up the computations, by computing some\n\\emph{a priori} probability that a given set of attributes does characterize\nthe positive and negative groups. To this effect, we propose several models for\nrepresenting the data set of observations, according to the information we have\non it. These models, and the probabilities they allow us to compute, are also\nhelpful for quickly assessing some properties of the real data at hand;\nfurthermore they may help us to better analyze and understand the computational\ndifficulties encountered by solving methods.\n  Once our models have been established, the mathematical tools for computing\nprobabilities come from Analytic Combinatorics.

A further,\nlong-range goal of this paper is to show that the methods of Analytic\nCombinatorics can help in analyzing the performance of various algorithms in\nLAD and related fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 16:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

We carry out the first differential emission measure (DEM)\nanalysis that combines both AIA (and XRT when available) bandpass filter data\nand RHESSI HXR measurements for coronal jets, and obtain self-consistent\nresults across a wide temperature range and into non-thermal energies. In both\nevents, hot plasma first appeared at the jet base, but as the base plasma\ngradually cooled, hot plasma also appeared near the jet top. Moreover,\nnon-thermal electrons, while only mildly energetic, are found in multiple HXR\nlocations and contain a large amount of total energy. Particularly, the\nenergetic electrons that produced the HXR sources at the jet top were\naccelerated near the top location, rather than traveling from a reconnection\nsite at the jet base. This means that there was more than one particle\nacceleration site in each event. Jet velocities are consistent with previous\nstudies, including upward and downward velocities around ~200 km/s and ~100\nkm/s respectively, and fast outflows of 400-700 km/s.

This paper explores the\neffects of two learning approaches, useAllPredictAll and usePrePredictPost, on\nthe performance of software fault-proneness prediction, both within-release and\nacross-releases. The empirical results are based on data extracted from 64\nreleases of twelve open-source projects.

Specifically, using useAllPredictAll leads to\nsignificantly better performance than using usePrePredictPost learning\napproach, both within-release and across-releases. Furthermore, this paper\nuncovers that, for within-release predictions, this difference in\nclassification performance is due to different levels of class imbalance in the\ntwo learning approaches. When class imbalance is addressed, the performance\ndifference between the learning approaches is eliminated. Our findings imply\nthat the learning approach should always be explicitly identified and its\nimpact on software fault-proneness prediction considered.

To synthesize a novel view, we train a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) network conditioned on the learned 3D representation to\nperform volume rendering. This novel 3D representation allows the network to\nreconstruct unseen regions without enforcing constraints like symmetry or\ncanonical coordinate systems. Our method can render novel views from only a\nsingle input image and generalize across multiple object categories using a\nsingle model. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and renders richer\ndetails than existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 17:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 20:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

As\ndifferent languages have different amounts of supervision, cross-lingual\ntransfer benefits languages with little to no training data by transferring\nfrom other languages. From an engineering perspective, multilingual NLP\nbenefits development and maintenance by serving multiple languages with a\nsingle system. Both cross-lingual transfer and multilingual NLP rely on\ncross-lingual representations serving as the foundation. As BERT revolutionized\nrepresentation learning and NLP, it also revolutionized cross-lingual\nrepresentations and cross-lingual transfer. Multilingual BERT was released as a\nreplacement for single-language BERT, trained with Wikipedia data in 104\nlanguages.\n  Surprisingly, without any explicit cross-lingual signal, multilingual BERT\nlearns cross-lingual representations in addition to representations for\nindividual languages. This thesis first shows such surprising cross-lingual\neffectiveness compared against prior art on various tasks. Naturally, it raises\na set of questions, most notably how do these multilingual encoders learn\ncross-lingual representations. In exploring these questions, this thesis will\nanalyze the behavior of multilingual models in a variety of settings on high\nand low resource languages. We also look at how to inject different\ncross-lingual signals into multilingual encoders, and the optimization behavior\nof cross-lingual transfer with these models. Together, they provide a better\nunderstanding of multilingual encoders on cross-lingual transfer. Our findings\nwill lead us to suggested improvements to multilingual encoders and\ncross-lingual transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 17:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

The\nDES data are the two-point correlation functions of weak gravitational lensing,\ngalaxy clustering, and their cross-correlation. We use simulated data and blind\nanalyses of real data to validate the robustness of our results. In many cases,\nconstraining power is limited by the absence of nonlinear predictions that are\nreliable at our required precision. The models are: dark energy with a\ntime-dependent equation of state, non-zero spatial curvature, sterile\nneutrinos, modifications of gravitational physics, and a binned $\\sigma_8(z)$\nmodel which serves as a probe of structure growth. For the time-varying dark\nenergy equation of state evaluated at the pivot redshift we find $(w_{\\rm p},\nw_a)= (-0.99^{+0.28}_{-0.17},-0.9\\pm 1.2)$ at 68% confidence with $z_{\\rm\np}=0.24$ from the DES measurements alone, and $(w_{\\rm p}, w_a)=\n(-1.03^{+0.04}_{-0.03},-0.4^{+0.4}_{-0.3})$ with $z_{\\rm p}=0.21$ for the\ncombination of all data considered.

While observations have established that reionization occurred,\nobservational constraints on the emissivity of ionizing photons at\nhigh-redshift remains elusive. Here, we present a new analysis of the\nLow-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS) and archival observations, a\ncombined sample of 89 star-forming galaxies at z~0.3 with Hubble Space\nTelescope observations of their ionizing continua (or Lyman Continuum, LyC).

On average, galaxies with redder\ncontinuum slopes have smaller f$_{esc}$ than galaxies with bluer slopes due to\nhigher dust attenuation. More than 5% (20%) of the LyC emission escapes\ngalaxies with $\\beta$<-2.1 (-2.6).

Using previous observations of $\\beta$ at high-redshift, we\nestimate the evolution of f$_{esc}$ with both $z$ and M$_{UV}$. The LzLCS\nsuggest that fainter and lower mass galaxies dominate the ionizing photon\nbudget at higher redshift, possibly due to their rapidly evolving metal and\ndust content. Finally, we use our correlation between $\\beta$ and f$_{\nesc}\\times\\xi_{ion}$ to predict the ionizing emissivity of galaxies during the\nepoch of reionization.

It can\nbe considered as a fine-grained task of water body extraction, which involves\nextracting water areas in images and then separating dam reservoirs from\nnatural water bodies. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based\npipeline that decomposes dam reservoir extraction into water body segmentation\nand dam reservoir recognition.

We present\nnear-IR interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant IRC +10420\nand blue spectra taken between 1994-2019. Our 2.2 $\\mu$m GRAVITY/VLTI\nobservations attain a spatial resolution of $\\sim$5 stellar radii and probe the\nhot emission in the K-band tracing the gas via Na i double emission and the\nBr$\\gamma$ emission. The observed configurations spatially resolve the 2.2\n$\\mu$m continuum as well as the Br$\\gamma$ and the Na i emission lines. Our\ngeometric modelling demonstrates the presence of a compact neutral zone (Na i)\nwhich is slightly larger than the continuum but within an extended Br$\\gamma$\nemitting region. Our geometric models of the Br$\\gamma$ emission confirm an\nhour-glass geometry of the wind. To explain this peculiar geometry we\ninvestigate the presence of a companion at 7-800 au separations and find no\nsignature at the contrast limit of our observations (3.7 mag at 3$\\sigma$). We\nreport an evolution of the ejecta over a time span of 7 years, which allows us\nto constrain the opening angle of the hour-glass geometry at $<$10$^\\circ$.\nLastly, we present the first blue optical spectra of IRC +10420 since 1994. The\nmulti-epoch data indicate that the spectral type, and thus temperature, of the\nobject has essentially remained constant during the intervening years. This\nconfirms earlier conclusions that following an increase in temperature of 2000\nK in less than two decades prior to 1994, the temperature increase has halted.\nThis suggests that this yellow hypergiant has \"hit\" the White Wall in the\nHR-diagram preventing it from evolving blue-wards, and will likely undergo a\nmajor mass-loss event in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 20:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas\nnetwork could not only help to supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could\nalso to balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and\nthus avoid power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed\nexpansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a\nsector-coupled and self-sufficient European energy system with high shares of\nrenewables. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and\nindustry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With\nthis high spatio-temporal resolution, the model can capture bottlenecks in\ntransmission networks, the variability of demand and renewable supply, as well\nas regional opportunities for the retrofitting of legacy gas infrastructure and\nthe development of geological hydrogen storage. Our results show consistent\nsystem cost reductions with a pan-continental hydrogen network that connects\nregions with low-cost and abundant renewable potentials to demand centres,\nsynthetic fuel production and cavern storage sites. Developing a hydrogen\nnetwork reduces system costs by up to 26 billion Euros per year (3.4%), with\nthe highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised.\nBetween 64% and 69% of this network could be built from repurposed natural gas\npipelines.

However, collecting such\nreward feedback from the entire population not only incurs a prohibitively high\ncost but often leads to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, we consider\ndifferentially private distributed linear bandits, where only a subset of users\nfrom the population are selected (called clients) to participate in the\nlearning process and the central server learns the global model from such\npartial feedback by iteratively aggregating these clients' local feedback in a\ndifferentially private fashion.

The CMOS camera with an intensifier detected\nthe changes in Cherenkov emission profile during expiration and inspiration of\nthe respiration cycle for the mice to be about 3 mm.\n  Significance: This fast imaging technique can be utilized for in vivo\nintrafraction monitoring of FLASH patient treatments at single pulse\nresolution.

Compared with the existing scrambling-based audio cancellation\napproaches, NEC can selectively remove a target speaker's voice from a mixed\nspeech without causing interference to others. Specifically, for a target\nspeaker, we design a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to extract high-level\nspeaker-specific but utterance-independent vocal features from his/her\nreference audios. When the microphone is recording, the DNN generates a shadow\nsound to cancel the target voice in real-time. Moreover, we modulate the\naudible shadow sound onto an ultrasound frequency, making it inaudible for\nhumans. By leveraging the non-linearity of the microphone circuit, the\nmicrophone can accurately decode the shadow sound for target voice\ncancellation. We implement and evaluate NEC comprehensively with 8 smartphone\nmicrophones in different settings. The results show that NEC effectively mutes\nthe target speaker at a microphone without interfering with other users' normal\nconversations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 21:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online,\ne.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging\ntask for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the\nexplaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has\nuncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views\nor likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos' explaining\nquality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be\nstatistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality.

The question arises whether similar correlations\nbetween the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for\nvideos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for\nexample from quantum physics.

However, most existing\nvideo codecs directly use the ready-made entropy model from image codec to\nencode the residual or motion, and do not fully leverage the spatial-temporal\ncharacteristics in video. To this end, this paper proposes a powerful entropy\nmodel which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. In\nparticular, we introduce the latent prior which exploits the correlation among\nthe latent representation to squeeze the temporal redundancy. Meanwhile, the\ndual spatial prior is proposed to reduce the spatial redundancy in a\nparallel-friendly manner. In addition, our entropy model is also versatile.\nBesides estimating the probability distribution, our entropy model also\ngenerates the quantization step at spatial-channel-wise.

Experimental results show that, powered\nby the proposed entropy model, our neural codec can achieve 18.2% bitrate\nsaving on UVG dataset when compared with H.266 (VTM) using the highest\ncompression ratio configuration.

The Gaussian process latent force model (GPFLM) is a\ngeneralized Bayesian virtual sensing technique which combines a physics-driven\nmodel of the structure with a data-driven model of latent variables of the\nsystem to extrapolate unmeasured strain states. In the GPLFM, modeling of\nunknown sources of excitation as a Gaussian process (GP) serves to facilitate\nstrain estimation by providing a complete stochastic characterization of the\ncovariance relationship between input forces and states, using properties of\nthe GP covariance kernel as well as correlation information supplied by the\nmechanical model. It is shown that posterior inference of the latent inputs and\nstates is performed by Gaussian process regression of measured accelerations,\ncomputed efficiently using Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing\nin an augmented state-space model. While the GPLFM has been previously\ndemonstrated in numerical studies to improve upon other virtual sensing\ntechniques in terms of accuracy, robustness, and numerical stability, this work\nprovides one of the first cases of in-situ validation of the GPLFM. The\npredicted strain response by the GPLFM is compared to subsoil strain data\ncollected from an operating offshore wind turbine in the Westermeerwind Park in\nthe Netherlands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

However, these methods will significantly degrade the\nnaturalness and diversity of the synthesized motion when dealing with complex\nand impromptu movements, e.g., dance performance and martial arts. In addition,\ncurrent research lacks fine-grained control over the generated motion, which is\nessential for intelligent human-computer interaction and animation creation. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel keyframe-based motion generation network based\non multiple constraints, which can achieve diverse dance synthesis via learned\nknowledge. Specifically, the algorithm is mainly formulated based on the\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) and the Transformer architecture. The backbone\nof our network is a hierarchical RNN module composed of two long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) units, in which the first LSTM is utilized to embed the posture\ninformation of the historical frames into a latent space, and the second one is\nemployed to predict the human posture for the next frame. Moreover, our\nframework contains two Transformer-based controllers, which are used to model\nthe constraints of the root trajectory and the velocity factor respectively, so\nas to better utilize the temporal context of the frames and achieve\nfine-grained motion control. We verify the proposed approach on a dance dataset\ncontaining a wide range of contemporary dance. The results of three\nquantitative analyses validate the superiority of our algorithm.

It is\nproved that the boundary Lamb dilatation flux (BLDF, namely the wall-normal\nLamb dilatation flux at the wall) is determined by the boundary enstrophy flux\n(BEF) and the surface curvature-induced contribution. As the first step to\nexplore this new concept, the present study only considers flow past a\nstationary no-slip flat wall without curvature-fluid dynamic coupling effects.\nIt is found that the temporal-spatial evolution rate of the WNLDF is\ncontributed by four source terms, which can be explicitly expressed using the\nfundamental surface quantities including skin friction (or surface vorticity)\nand surface pressure. Therefore, the instantaneous near-wall flow structures\nare directly related to the WNLDF in both laminar and turbulent flows. As an\nexample, for the turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\\tau}=180$, the intensification\nof the temporal-spatial evolution rate of the WNLDF is caused by the strong\nwall-normal velocity event (SWNVE) associated with quasi-streamwise vortices\nand high intermittency of the viscous sublayer. In addition, near the SWNVE,\nthis evolution rate is mainly contributed by the coupling between skin friction\nand the boundary enstrophy gradient, as well as the coupling between the skin\nfriction divergence and the boundary enstrophy. The exact results presented in\nthis paper could provide new physical insights into complex near-wall flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 01:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that\ngeneralize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are\ncharacterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the\nuncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability\nof the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems\nowing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this\ndifficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the\nexpanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed\nvia robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is\nequivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide\nsufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix\ninequalities (MIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the linear MIs\nreduce to cubic MIs whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The cubic MIs\nare transformed into simpler quadratic MIs that can be solved using\noptimization techniques. Moreover, solving such non-convex MIs is relaxed into\nthe iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization\nprovide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here,\nthe SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain mean and covariance\nand other existing systems such as independently identically distributed\ndynamics and random polytopes. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 02:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

This is the first\ninstance of CPD detection via gaseous emission capable of tracing the overall\nCPD mass. The CPD is spatially unresolved with a $117\\times82$ mas beam and\nmanifests as a point source in $^{13}$CO, indicating that its diameter is\n$\\lesssim14$ au.

Secondly, we experimentally find that the training with dropout leads\nto the neural network with a flatter minimum compared with standard gradient\ndescent training, and the implicit regularization is the key to finding flat\nsolutions. Although our theory mainly focuses on dropout used in the last\nhidden layer, our experiments apply to general dropout in training neural\nnetworks. This work points out a distinct characteristic of dropout compared\nwith stochastic gradient descent and serves as an important basis for fully\nunderstanding dropout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 04:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 08:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

In contrast, the spin torque diminishes in\n[spin-current generator/magnet]n superlattices lacking inversion symmetry\nbreaking. These results advances the understanding of spin-orbit torques in\nmagnetic multilayers and establishes spin-current generator/magnet/oxide\nsuperlattices as advantageous bricks for development of high energy-efficiency,\nhigh-endurance, and high-density spintronic memory and computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 07:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

Besides the user-item interaction\ngraph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (e.g.,\nuser-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations\nof users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and\naggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be\nprohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.\nMoreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly\nsampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide\nthe learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational\ncost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the\ntraining process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel\nself-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires\nneither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically,\nBM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users\nand items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three\nmulti-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by\nreconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features\nunder both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need\nfor contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from\nan additional target network for contrastive view generation.

Much of traditional caching research\nstudies cache management for a single-user or single-processor environment. In\nthis paper, we propose two related generalizations of the classical caching\nproblem that capture issues that arise in a multi-user or multi-processor\nenvironment. In the caching with reserves problem, a caching algorithm is\nrequired to maintain at least $k_i$ pages belonging to user $i$ in the cache at\nany time, for some given reserve capacities $k_i$. In the public-private\ncaching problem, the cache of total size $k$ is partitioned into subcaches, a\nprivate cache of size $k_i$ for each user $i$ and a shared public cache usable\nby any user. In both of these models, as in the classical caching framework,\nthe objective of the algorithm is to dynamically maintain the cache so as to\nminimize the total number of cache misses.\n  We show that caching with reserves and public-private caching models are\nequivalent up to constant factors, and thus focus on the former. Unlike\nclassical caching, both of these models turn out to be NP-hard even in the\noffline setting, where the page sequence is known in advance. For the offline\nsetting, we design a 2-approximation algorithm, whose analysis carefully keeps\ntrack of a potential function to bound the cost. In the online setting, we\nfirst design an $O(\\ln k)$-competitive fractional algorithm using the\nprimal-dual framework, and then show how to convert it online to a randomized\nintegral algorithm with the same guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

Our key contribution is the observation that if the\nrelaxed objective satisfies entry-wise concavity, a low optimization loss\nguarantees the quality of the final integral solutions. This observation\nsignificantly broadens the applicability of the previous framework inspired by\nErdos' probabilistic method. In particular, this observation can guide the\ndesign of objective models in applications where the objectives are not given\nexplicitly while requiring being modeled in prior. We evaluate our framework by\nsolving a synthetic graph optimization problem, and two real-world applications\nincluding resource allocation in circuit design and approximate computing. Our\nframework largely outperforms the baselines based on na\\\"{i}ve relaxation,\nreinforcement learning, and Gumbel-softmax tricks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 06:44:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 03:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 21:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The realizable USOs are those that arise from the reductions of\nthese problems to the USO sink-finding problem. Finding the sink of realizable\nUSOs is thus highly practically relevant, yet it is unknown whether\nrealizability can be exploited algorithmically to find the sink more quickly.\nHowever, all (non-trivial) known unconditional lower bounds for sink-finding\nmake use of USOs that are provably not realizable. This indicates that the\nsink-finding problem might indeed be strictly easier on realizable USOs.\n  In this paper we show that this is true for a subclass of all USOs. We\nconsider the class of Matou\\v{s}ek-type USOs, which are a translation of\nMatou\\v{s}ek's LP-type problems into the language of USOs.

As an effort to push RL research towards algorithms which can\ngeneralize to novel test environments, we introduce the Brick Tic-Tac-Toe\n(BTTT) test bed, where the brick position in the test environment is different\nfrom that in the training environment.

To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the\nrobustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However,\nthe generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice,\nthey are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models\nare fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A\nstraightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that\nthey can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a\nplug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation\n(PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial\ndefense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have\ndifferent influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace,\ncalled the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts\non the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates\nthe immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting\nthem to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen\nadversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of\nadversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior\ngeneralization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional\ntraining, indicating that it can be easily generalized to existing face\nrecognition systems.

With the nuclear spins identified, the\nisotropic and anisotropic components of the hyperfine interactions in turn\noffer unique insight into the electronic ground-state properties of the\nparamagnetic centers. However, traditional ensemble measurements of hyperfine\ninteractions average over a macroscopic number of spins with different\ngeometrical locations and nuclear isotopes. Here, we use a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) to measure\nhyperfine spectra of hydrogenated-titanium (Ti) atoms on MgO/Ag(100) and\nthereby determine the isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine interactions at the\nsingle-atom level. By combining vector-field ESR spectroscopy with STM-based\natom manipulation, we characterize the full hyperfine tensor of individual\nTi-47 and Ti-49 atoms and identify significant spatial anisotropy of hyperfine\ninteraction for both isotopes when they are adsorbed at low-symmetry binding\nsites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the large hyperfine\nanisotropy arises from a highly anisotropic distribution of the ground-state\nelectron spin density.

In this paper, we focus on one general setting, i.e.,\nnon-parallel many-to-many voice conversion, which is close to the real-world\nscenario. As the name implies, non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion does\nnot require the paired source and reference speeches and can be applied to\narbitrary voice transfer. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) and other techniques such as Conditional Variational Autoencoders\n(CVAEs) have made considerable progress in this field. However, due to the\nsophistication of voice conversion, the style similarity of the converted\nspeech is still unsatisfactory.

In\nparticular, the style encoder network is designed to learn style codes for\ndifferent subbands of the target speaker. The content encoder network can\ncapture the content information on the source speech. Finally, the decoder\ngenerates particular subband content.

The planetary C/O ratio is thought to\nconstrain the planet formation pathway, because of the condensation sequence of\nH$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO, resulting in an increase of the gas phase C/O\nratio with increasing distance. Here we use a disc evolution model including\npebble growth, drift and evaporation coupled with a planet formation model that\nincludes pebble and gas accretion as well as planet migration to compute the\natmospheric compositions of giant planets. We compare our results to the recent\nobservations of the hot Jupiters WASP-77A b and $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis b, which\nfeature sub-solar and super-solar C/H and O/H values, respectively. Our\nsimulations reproduce these measurements and show that giants like WASP-77A b\nshould start to form beyond the CO$_2$ evaporation front, while giants like\n$\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis b should originate from beyond the H$_2$O line. Our model\nallows the formation of sub- and super-solar atmospheric compositions. However\nsimulations without pebble evaporation can not reproduce the super-solar C/H\nand O/H ratios of $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis b's atmosphere without additional accretion\nof solids. We identify the $\\alpha$ viscosity parameter of the disc as a key\ningredient, because the viscosity drives the inward motion of volatile enriched\nvapor, responsible for the accretion of gaseous C and O. Depending on the\nplanet's migration history order-of-magnitude differences in atmospheric C/H\nand O/H are expected. Our simulations also predict super-solar N/H for $\\tau$\nBo\\\"otis b and solar N/H for WASP-77A b.

For concrete\nIR renormalon models for the QCD Adler function the resulting CIPT-FOPT\ndiscrepancy, the asymptotic separation, can be calculated analytically from the\nBorel representation of the CIPT series expansion. If the known perturbative\ncorrections for the QCD Adler function at the 5-loop level already have a\nsizeable contribution from the asymptotic behavior related to the gluon\ncondensate (GC) renormalon, the asymptotic separation is dominated by that\nrenormalon. This implies that the CIPT expansion can be reconciled with FOPT,\nwhen a renormalon-free scheme for the GC is adopted. In this talk we discuss\nsuch a renormalon-free scheme for the GC, which involves perturbative\nsubtractions in analogy to using short-distance quark mass schemes instead of\nthe pole mass. Using a concrete realistic high-order Borel model for the Adler\nfunction consistent with the known corrections up to 5 loops and containing a\nsizeable GC renormalon contribution, we show that the CIPT-FOPT discrepancy can\nbe avoided when switching to the renormalon-free GC scheme.

ML models inform\ndecisions in criminal justice, the extension of credit in banking, and the\nhiring practices of corporations. This posits the requirement of model\nfairness, which holds that automated decisions should be equitable with respect\nto protected features (e.g., gender, race, or age) that are often\nunder-represented in the data. We postulate that this problem of\nunder-representation has a corollary to the problem of imbalanced data\nlearning. This class imbalance is often reflected in both classes and protected\nfeatures. For example, one class (those receiving credit) may be\nover-represented with respect to another class (those not receiving credit) and\na particular group (females) may be under-represented with respect to another\ngroup (males). A key element in achieving algorithmic fairness with respect to\nprotected groups is the simultaneous reduction of class and protected group\nimbalance in the underlying training data, which facilitates increases in both\nmodel accuracy and fairness. We discuss the importance of bridging imbalanced\nlearning and group fairness by showing how key concepts in these fields overlap\nand complement each other; and propose a novel oversampling algorithm, Fair\nOversampling, that addresses both skewed class distributions and protected\nfeatures. Our method: (i) can be used as an efficient pre-processing algorithm\nfor standard ML algorithms to jointly address imbalance and group equity; and\n(ii) can be combined with fairness-aware learning algorithms to improve their\nrobustness to varying levels of class imbalance.

In this study we attempt a theoretical\nmodelling of the coupling of black holes with their jets and discs, via three\ninnovations. First, we propose a semi-analytical MHD description of a steady\nrelativistic inflow-outflow structure characteristic to the extraction of the\nhole rotational energy. The mass-loading is ensured in a thin layer, the\nstagnation surface, by a two-photon pair production originating to a gamma-ray\nemission from the surrounding disc. The double flow is described near the polar\naxis by an axisymmetric meridionally self-similar MHD model. Second, the inflow\nand outflow solutions are crossing the MHD critical points and are matched at\nthe stagnation surface. Knowledge of the MHD field on the horizon give us the\nangular momentum and energy extracted from the black hole. Finally, we\nillustrate the model with three specific examples of double-flow solutions by\nvarying the energetic interaction between the MHD field and the rotating black\nhole. When the isorotation frequency is half of the black hole one, the\nextracted Poynting flux is comparable to the one obtained using the force-free\nassumption. In two of the presented solutions, the Penrose process dominates at\nlarge colatitudes, while the third is Poynting flux dominated at mid\ncolatitudes. Mass injection rate estimations, from disk luminosity and inner\nradius, give an upper limit just above the values obtained for two solutions.\nThis model is pertinent to describe the flows near the polar axis where pair\nproduction is more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 10:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

For physiological time series, deep learning\n(DL) superiority to feature engineering (FE) approaches based on domain\nknowledge is still an open question. Moreover, it remains unclear whether\ncombining DL with FE may improve performance. Methods: We considered three\ntasks intending to address these research gaps: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis\n(multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction\n(binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall\ndataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each\ntask: i) a random forest taking the FE as input was trained as a classical\nmachine learning approach; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model\nof FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating\nsignificantly less data for the two classification tasks and it was\noutperformed by DL for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL\ndid not improve performance over DL alone.

We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over\nDL alone which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by\nDL.

A natural block\nextension of it, {\\it sample block correlation matrix}, is proposed to take on\nthe same role, when random variables are generalized to random sub-vectors. In\nthis paper, we establish a spectral theory of the sample block correlation\nmatrices and apply it to group independent test and related problem, under the\nhigh-dimensional setting. More specifically, we consider a random vector of\ndimension $p$, consisting of $k$ sub-vectors of dimension $p_t$'s, where\n$p_t$'s can vary from $1$ to order $p$. Our primary goal is to investigate the\ndependence of the $k$ sub-vectors. We construct a random matrix model called\nsample block correlation matrix based on $n$ samples for this purpose. The\nspectral statistics of the sample block correlation matrix include the\nclassical Wilks' statistic and Schott's statistic as special cases. It turns\nout that the spectral statistics do not depend on the unknown population mean\nand covariance. Further, under the null hypothesis that the sub-vectors are\nindependent, the limiting behavior of the spectral statistics can be described\nwith the aid of the Free Probability Theory. Specifically, under three\ndifferent settings of possibly $n$-dependent $k$ and $p_t$'s, we show that the\nempirical spectral distribution of the sample block correlation matrix\nconverges to the free Poisson binomial distribution, free Poisson distribution\n(Marchenko-Pastur law) and free Gaussian distribution (semicircle law),\nrespectively.

Prior approaches,\ndespite the promising results, have relied on either estimating dense attention\nto compute per-point matching, which is limited to only coarse scales due to\nthe quadratic memory cost, or fixing the number of correspondences to achieve\nlinear complexity, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nsparse attention based Transformer model, termed Dynamic Sparse Transformer\n(DynaST), to achieve fine-level matching with favorable efficiency. The heart\nof our approach is a novel dynamic-attention unit, dedicated to covering the\nvariation on the optimal number of tokens one position should focus on.\nSpecifically, DynaST leverages the multi-layer nature of Transformer structure,\nand performs the dynamic attention scheme in a cascaded manner to refine\nmatching results and synthesize visually-pleasing outputs. In addition, we\nintroduce a unified training objective for DynaST, making it a versatile\nreference-based image translation framework for both supervised and\nunsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on three applications,\npose-guided person image generation, edge-based face synthesis, and undistorted\nimage style transfer, demonstrate that DynaST achieves superior performance in\nlocal details, outperforming the state of the art while reducing the\ncomputational cost significantly.

This method fully combines the advantages of the LiDAR and\nstereo camera, which can retain the advantages of the high precision of the\nLiDAR and the high resolution of images respectively. Compared with the\ntraditional stereo matching method, the texture of the object and lighting\nconditions have less influence on the algorithm. Firstly, the depth of the\nLiDAR data is converted to the disparity of the stereo camera. Because the\ndensity of the LiDAR data is relatively sparse on the y-axis, the converted\ndisparity map is up-sampled using the interpolation method.

Primitive galaxies with low metal and\ndust content have been shown to host a more patchy and porous ISM than their\nhigh-metallicity counterparts. To what extent this peculiar structure\ncontributes to the leakage of ionizing photons remains to be quantitatively\nstudied. To address these questions we build a refined grid of models including\ndensity-bounded regions and a possible contribution of an X-ray source. Using\nMULTIGRIS, a new Bayesian code based on Monte Carlo sampling, we combine the\nmodels as sectors under various assumptions to extract the probability density\ndistributions of the parameters and infer the corresponding escape fractions\nfrom H II regions (fesc,HII). We apply this new code to a sample of 39\nwell-know local starbursting dwarf galaxies from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We\nconfirm previous results hinting at an increased porosity to ionizing photons\nof the ISM in low-metallicity galaxies and provide, for the first time,\nquantitative predictions for fesc,HII. The predicted fesc,HII for\nlow-metallicity objects span a large range of values, up to 60%, while the\nvalues derived for more metal-rich galaxies are globally lower. We also examine\nthe influence of other parameters on the escape fractions, and find that the\nspecific star-formation rate correlates best with fesc,HII . Finally, we\nprovide observational line ratios which could be used as tracers of the photons\nescaping from density-bounded regions.

The former adopts the extremely fine-grained instance-level\ndiscrimination whose supervisory signal is not efficient due to the false\nnegatives.

Recent researches have been identifying a lack of interactivity as the\nprime source of these machine learning problems. Consequently, interactive\nmachine learning (iML) has acquired increased attention of researchers on\naccount of its human-in-the-loop modality and relatively efficient resource\nutilization. Thereby, a state-of-the-art review of interactive machine learning\nplays a vital role in easing the effort toward building human-centred models.\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of\niML. We analyze salient research works using merit-oriented and\napplication/task oriented mixed taxonomy. We use a bottom-up clustering\napproach to generate a taxonomy of iML research works. Research works on\nadversarial black-box attacks and corresponding iML based defense system,\nexploratory machine learning, resource constrained learning, and iML\nperformance evaluation are analyzed under their corresponding theme in our\nmerit-oriented taxonomy. We have further classified these research works into\ntechnical and sectoral categories.

The most common post-hoc\napproach to compensate for this is to perform temperature scaling, which\nadjusts the confidences of the predictions on any input by scaling the logits\nby a fixed value. Whilst this approach typically improves the average\ncalibration across the whole test dataset, this improvement typically reduces\nthe individual confidences of the predictions irrespective of whether the\nclassification of a given input is correct or incorrect. With this insight, we\nbase our method on the observation that different samples contribute to the\ncalibration error by varying amounts, with some needing to increase their\nconfidence and others needing to decrease it. Therefore, for each input, we\npropose to predict a different temperature value, allowing us to adjust the\nmismatch between confidence and accuracy at a finer granularity.

In this paper, we propose different\nsolutions for time-varying topologies that require neither strong connectivity\nnor any global knowledge on the network.\n  First, we study the case of unbounded clocks, and propose a self-stabilizing\n$MinMax$ algorithm that works if, in each sufficiently long but bounded period\nof time, there is an agent, called a root, that can send messages, possibly\nindirectly, to all other agents. Such networks are highly dynamic in the sense\nthat roots may change arbitrarily over time. Moreover, the bound on the time\nrequired for achieving this rootedness property is unknown to the agents. Then\nwe present a finite-state algorithm that synchronizes periodic clocks in\ndynamic networks that are strongly connected over bounded period of time. Here\nalso, the bound on the time for achieving strong connectivity exists, but is\nnot supposed to be known. Interestingly, our algorithm unifies several\nseemingly different algorithms proposed previously for static networks.

By organic priors, we mean invaluable\nintermediate prior information intrinsic to the NRSfM matrix factorization\ntheory. It is shown that such priors reside in the factorized matrices, and\nquite surprisingly, existing methods generally disregard them. The paper's main\ncontribution is to put forward a simple, methodical, and practical method that\ncan effectively exploit such organic priors to solve NRSfM. The proposed method\ndoes not make assumptions other than the popular one on the low-rank shape and\noffers a reliable solution to NRSfM under orthographic projection.

CL models can benefit from self-supervised\npre-training as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features.\nHowever, the effect of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of\ntask sequences increases. Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training\ndata distribution and the task distribution reduces the generalizability of the\nlearned representations. To address these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic\nRepresentation Consolidation (TARC), a two-stage training paradigm for CL that\nintertwines task-agnostic and task-specific learning whereby self-supervised\ntraining is followed by supervised learning for each task. To further restrict\nthe deviation from the learned representations in the self-supervised stage, we\nemploy a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised stage.

By \"relatively hard\" we mean that the transverse momenta\nof the two jets -- the quark ($q$) and the antiquark ($\\bar{q}$) generated by\nthe decay of the virtual photon -- are much larger than the target saturation\nmomentum $Q_s(Y_{\\mathbb{P}})$ evaluated at the rapidity gap $Y_{\\mathbb{P}}$.\nWe argue that the typical final-state configurations are such that the hard\n$q\\bar q$ dijets are accompanied by a semi-hard gluon jet, with a transverse\nmomentum of the order of $Q_s(Y_{\\mathbb{P}})$. The presence of this third jet\nensures that the scattering is strong and thus avoids the strong suppression of\nexclusive (hard) dijet production due to colour transparency. For such \"2+1\"\njet configurations, we demonstrate that both the emission of the semi-hard\ngluon and its scattering with the hadronic target can be factorised in terms of\nan effective gluon-gluon dipole. This effective description, originally\nproposed in [1-4], builds a bridge between the colour dipole picture and\ncollinear factorisation: the cross-section for diffractive 2+1 jets can be\nwritten as the product between a hard factor describing the $q\\bar{q}$ dijets\nand a semi-hard factor expressing the unintegrated gluon distribution of the\nPomeron. The latter is controlled by gluon dipole scattering in the black disk\nlimit and hence is strongly sensitive to gluon saturation.

The unparalleled ability\nof machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from data also enables them to\nincorporate biases embedded within. A biased model can then make decisions that\ndisproportionately harm certain groups in society -- limiting their access to\nfinancial services, for example. The awareness of this problem has given rise\nto the field of Fair ML, which focuses on studying, measuring, and mitigating\nunfairness in algorithmic prediction, with respect to a set of protected groups\n(e.g., race or gender). However, the underlying causes for algorithmic\nunfairness still remain elusive, with researchers divided between blaming\neither the ML algorithms or the data they are trained on. In this work, we\nmaintain that algorithmic unfairness stems from interactions between models and\nbiases in the data, rather than from isolated contributions of either of them.\nTo this end, we propose a taxonomy to characterize data bias and we study a set\nof hypotheses regarding the fairness-accuracy trade-offs that fairness-blind ML\nalgorithms exhibit under different data bias settings.

The model is based on the symmetry structure of the known 3-3-1\nmodels and, thus, it relates the number of the three observed fermion\ngenerations with the cancellation of gauge anomalies. Symmetry breaking is\ntriggered via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism taking into account a minimal set\nof scalar field multiplets. We establish the stability conditions for the\ntree-level scalar potential imposing the copositivity criteria and use the\nmethod of Gildener-Weinberg for computing the one-loop effective potential when\none has multiple scalar fields. With the addition of vectorial fermions,\ngetting their mass mainly through the vacuum expectation value of scalar\nsinglets at $10^3$ TeV, the $B-L$ symmetry leads to textures for the fermion\nmass matrices, allowing seesaw mechanisms for neutrinos and quarks to take\nplace.

This is owing to its simplicity and adaptability to a wide range of\napplications and circumstances, as opposed to specific Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) accelerators and compilers that are often designed only for certain\nspecific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for\nquantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical\nchallenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data\nfor better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the\ninput space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized\ncounterpart. As a result, advanced assessment strategies have become of\nparamount importance. In this paper, we present DiverGet, a search-based\ntesting framework for quantization assessment. DiverGet defines a space of\nmetamorphic relations that simulate naturally-occurring distortions on the\ninputs. Then, it optimally explores these relations to reveal the disagreements\namong DNNs of different arithmetic precision. We evaluate the performance of\nDiverGet on state-of-the-art DNNs applied to hyperspectral remote sensing\nimages. We chose the remote sensing DNNs as they're being increasingly deployed\nat the edge (e.g., high-lift drones) in critical domains like climate change\nresearch and astronomy.

Extensive empirical studies show that the long tail of the\ntravel time distribution and corresponding unexpected delay can have much more\nserious consequences than expected delay. However, unexpected delay due to\nunreliability has received limited attention in previous studies of the value\nof travel time variability. Methodologically, we define the summation of all\nunexpected delays as the unreliability area of the travel time distribution and\nshow that this is captured by two existing well defined reliability for\nquantifying travel time variability. We then formally derive the value of\nunreliability (VOU), show that it is distinct from the more established value\nof reliability (VOR), and combine the VOU and VOR in an overall VOV. We prove\ntheoretically that the VOV exhibits diminishing marginal benefit in terms of\nthe traveler punctuality requirements under a validity condition, implying that\nit may be economically inefficient for travelers to blindly pursue a higher\nprobability of not being late. We then proceed to develop the concept of the\ntravel time variability ratio, which gives the implicit cost of the punctuality\nrequirement imposed on any given trip.

To go beyond these limitations, a non-local variant of\nQAOA, namely recursive QAOA (RQAOA), was proposed to improve the quality of\napproximate solutions. The RQAOA has been studied comparatively less than QAOA,\nand it is less understood, for instance, for what family of instances it may\nfail to provide high quality solutions. However, as we are tackling\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is\nexpected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better\nquantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

This decoupling is known to\nhave a regular saddle-point structure: each saddle point is a set of elementary\nfield configurations localized in space and imaginary time which we coin\ninstantons. We formulate a classical partition function for the instanton gas\nthat has predictive power. Namely, we can predict the distribution of\ninstantons and show that the instanton number is sharply defined in the\nthermodynamic limit, thus defining a unique dominant saddle point. Despite the\nfact that the instanton approach does not capture the magnetic transition\ninherent to the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, we were able to\ndescribe the local moment formation accompanied by short-ranged\nanti-ferromagnetic correlations. This aspect is also seen in the single\nparticle spectral function that shows clear signs of the upper and lower\nHubbard bands. Our instanton approach bears remarkable similarities to local\ndynamical approaches, such as dynamical mean field theory, in the sense that it\nhas the unique property of allowing for local moment formation without breaking\nthe SU(2) spin symmetry. In contrast to local approaches, it captures\nshort-ranged magnetic fluctuations. Furthermore, it also offers possibilities\nfor systematic improvements by taking into account fluctuations around the\ndominant saddle point. Finally, we show that the saddle point structure depends\nupon the choice of lattice geometry. For the square lattice at half-filling,\nthe saddle point structure reflects the itinerant to localized nature of the\nmagnetism as a function of the coupling strength.

Although there has\nbeen plenty of work on automating analog circuit design under the typical\ncondition, limited research has been done on exploring robust designs under\nreal and unpredictable silicon variations. Automatic analog design against\nvariations requires prohibitive computation and time costs. To address the\nchallenge, we present RobustAnalog, a robust circuit design framework that\ninvolves the variation information in the optimization process.

The size of the computer system\nmemory required to store the graph grows proportional to the number of\nfloating-point operations executed by the underlying program. It quickly\nexceeds the available memory resources. Naive adjoint algorithmic\ndifferentiation often becomes infeasible except for relatively simple numerical\nsimulations.\n  Access to the data associated with the graph can be classified as sequential\nand random. The latter refers to memory access patterns defined by the\nadjacency relationship between vertices within the graph. Sequentially accessed\ndata can be decomposed into blocks. The blocks can be streamed across the\nsystem memory hierarchy thus extending the amount of available memory, for\nexample, to hard discs. Asynchronous i/o can help to mitigate the increased\ncost due to accesses to slower memory. Much larger problem instances can thus\nbe solved without resorting to technically challenging user intervention such\nas checkpointing. Randomly accessed data should not have to be decomposed. Its\nblock-wise streaming is likely to yield a substantial overhead in computational\ncost due to data accesses across blocks. Consequently, the size of the randomly\naccessed memory required by an adjoint should be kept minimal in order to\neliminate the need for decomposition. We propose a combination of dedicated\nmemory for adjoint $L$-values with the exploitation of remainder bandwidth as a\npossible solution. Test results indicate significant savings in random access\nmemory size while preserving overall computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

In contrast, some of the most popular and\ntraditional algorithms for RecSys solely focus on a given user-item-rating\nrelation without including side information. The goal of this case study is to\nprovide a performance comparison and assessment of RecSys and ML algorithms\nwhen side information is included. We chose the Movielens-100K data set since\nit is a standard for comparing RecSys algorithms. We compared six different\nfeature sets with varying quantities of features which were generated from the\nbaseline data and evaluated on a total of 19 RecSys algorithms, baseline ML\nalgorithms, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipelines, and state-of-the-art\nRecSys algorithms that incorporate side information.

Throughout\nour experiments, the average performance on the feature set with the lowest\nnumber of features is about 6% worse compared to that with the highest in terms\nof the Root Mean Squared Error. An interesting observation is that AutoML\noutperforms matrix factorization-based RecSys algorithms when additional\nfeatures are used. Almost all algorithms that can include side information have\nhigher performance when using the highest quantity of features. In the other\ncases, the performance difference is negligible (<1%).

We start to address these issues by first deriving and\nimplementing an expert elicitation procedure suitable for generating MFA\nparameter priors. Second, we propose to learn the data noise concurrent with\nthe parametric uncertainty. These methods are demonstrated using a case study\non the 2012 U.S. steel flow. Eight experts are interviewed to elicit\ndistributions on steel flow uncertainty from raw materials to intermediate\ngoods. The experts' distributions are combined and weighted according to the\nexpertise demonstrated in response to seeding questions. These aggregated\ndistributions form our model parameters' prior. A sensible, weakly-informative\nprior is also adopted for learning the data noise. Bayesian inference is then\nperformed to update the parametric and data noise uncertainty given MFA data\ncollected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the World Steel\nAssociation (WSA). The results show a reduction in MFA parametric uncertainty\nwhen incorporating the collected data. Only a modest reduction in data noise\nuncertainty was observed; however, greater reductions were achieved when using\ndata from multiple years in the inference.

Offensive semantics\nreview can combine the context of user input sentences to detect the rapid\nevolution of Offensive semantics and respond to Offensive semantics responses.\nThe semantics purification model For the case of chatting robot models, it has\nbeen contaminated by large numbers of offensive semantics, by strengthening the\noffensive reply learned by the learning algorithm, rather than rolling back to\nthe early versions. In addition, by integrating a once-through learning\napproach, the speed of semantics purification is accelerated while reducing the\nimpact on the quality of replies. The experimental results show that our\nproposed approach reduces the probability of the chat model generating\noffensive replies and that the integration of the few-shot learning algorithm\nimproves the training speed rapidly while effectively slowing down the decline\nin BLEU values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 10:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Furthermore, when storing\nlinguistic information, still nowadays, the most common practice is the concept\nof \"gold standard\", which is in contrast with recent trends in NLP that aim at\nstressing the importance of different subjectivities and points of view when\ntraining machine learning and deep learning methods. In this paper we present\nO-Dang!: The Ontology of Dangerous Speech Messages, a systematic and\ninteroperable Knowledge Graph (KG) for the collection of linguistic annotated\ndata.

The ontology has also been designed to account for a\nperspectivist approach, since it provides a model for encoding both gold\nstandard and single-annotator labels in the KG. The paper is structured as\nfollows. In Section 1 the motivations of our work are outlined. Section 2\ndescribes the O-Dang!

In this research effort, we study the unfairness\nof GANs. We formally define a new fairness notion for generative models in\nterms of the distribution of generated samples sharing the same protected\nattributes (gender, race, etc.). The defined fairness notion (representational\nfairness) requires the distribution of the sensitive attributes at the test\ntime to be uniform, and, in particular for GAN model, we show that this\nfairness notion is violated even when the dataset contains equally represented\ngroups, i.e., the generator favors generating one group of samples over the\nothers at the test time. In this work, we shed light on the source of this\nrepresentation bias in GANs along with a straightforward method to overcome\nthis problem. We first show on two widely used datasets (MNIST, SVHN) that when\nthe norm of the gradient of one group is more important than the other during\nthe discriminator's training, the generator favours sampling data from one\ngroup more than the other at test time. We then show that controlling the\ngroups' gradient norm by performing group-wise gradient norm clipping in the\ndiscriminator during the training leads to a more fair data generation in terms\nof representational fairness compared to existing models while preserving the\nquality of generated samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 14:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

However, how to recognize emotions with limited labels has\nbecome a new research and application bottleneck. To address the issue, this\npaper proposes a Self-supervised Group Meiosis Contrastive learning framework\n(SGMC) based on the stimuli consistent EEG signals in human being. In the SGMC,\na novel genetics-inspired data augmentation method, named Meiosis, is\ndeveloped. It takes advantage of the alignment of stimuli among the EEG samples\nin a group for generating augmented groups by pairing, cross exchanging, and\nseparating. And the model adopts a group projector to extract group-level\nfeature representations from group EEG samples triggered by the same emotion\nvideo stimuli. Then contrastive learning is employed to maximize the similarity\nof group-level representations of augmented groups with the same stimuli. The\nSGMC achieves the state-of-the-art emotion recognition results on the publicly\navailable DEAP dataset with an accuracy of 94.72% and 95.68% in valence and\narousal dimensions, and also reaches competitive performance on the public SEED\ndataset with an accuracy of 94.04%.
