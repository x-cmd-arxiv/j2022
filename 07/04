Recent research has demonstrated that a single model for one modality\ncan be adapted for another using cross-modality transfer learning. In this\npaper, we extend this approach by combining cross/inter-modality transfer\nlearning with a vision transformer to develop a unified detector that achieves\nsuperior performance across diverse modalities. Our research envisions an\napplication scenario for robotics, where the unified system seamlessly switches\nbetween RGB cameras and depth sensors in varying lighting conditions.\nImportantly, the system requires no model architecture or weight updates to\nenable this smooth transition. Specifically, the system uses the depth sensor\nduring low-lighting conditions (night time) and both the RGB camera and depth\nsensor or RGB caemra only in well-lit environments. We evaluate our unified\nmodel on the SUN RGB-D dataset, and demonstrate that it achieves similar or\nbetter performance in terms of mAP50 compared to state-of-the-art methods in\nthe SUNRGBD16 category, and comparable performance in point cloud only mode. We\nalso introduce a novel inter-modality mixing method that enables our model to\nachieve significantly better results than previous methods.

Based on\na crucial observation that skin disease images often exist multiple\nsub-clusters within a class (i.e., the appearances of images within one class\nof disease vary and form multiple distinct sub-groups), we design a novel\nSub-Cluster-Aware Network, namely SCAN, for rare skin disease diagnosis with\nenhanced accuracy. As the performance of few-shot learning highly depends on\nthe quality of the learned feature encoder, the main principle guiding the\ndesign of SCAN is the intrinsic sub-clustered representation learning for each\nclass so as to better describe feature distributions. Specifically, SCAN\nfollows a dual-branch framework, where the first branch is to learn class-wise\nfeatures to distinguish different skin diseases, and the second one aims to\nlearn features which can effectively partition each class into several groups\nso as to preserve the sub-clustered structure within each class. To achieve the\nobjective of the second branch, we present a cluster loss to learn image\nsimilarities via unsupervised clustering. To ensure that the samples in each\nsub-cluster are from the same class, we further design a purity loss to refine\nthe unsupervised clustering results.

Modeling the interactions between the disc\ngas and the embedded BBHs is crucial to understand their orbital evolution.\nUsing a suite of 2D high-resolution simulations of prograde equal-mass circular\nbinaries in local disc models, we systematically study how their hydrodynamical\nevolution depends on the equation of state (EOS; including the $\\gamma$-law and\nisothermal EOS) and on the binary mass and separation scales (relative to the\nsupermassive BH mass and the Hill radius, respectively). We find that binaries\naccrete slower and contract in orbit if the EOS is far from isothermal such\nthat the surrounding gas is diffuse, hot, and turbulent. The typical orbital\ndecay rate is of the order of a few times the mass doubling rate. For a fixed\nEOS, the accretion flows are denser, hotter, and more turbulent around more\nmassive or tighter binaries. The torque associated with accretion is often\ncomparable to the gravitational torque, so both torques are essential in\ndetermining the long-term binary orbital evolution. We carry out additional\nsimulations with non-accreting binaries and find that their orbital evolution\ncan be stochastic and is sensitive to the gravitational softening length, and\nthe secular orbital evolution can be very different from those of accreting\nbinaries. Our results indicate that stellar-mass BBHs may be hardened\nefficiently under ideal conditions, namely less massive and wider binaries\nembedded in discs with a non-isothermal EOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 21:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In one example, we use regular perturbation theory to predict the\nimpact Tikhonov regularizations have on condition numbers of symmetric,\npositive semi-definite matrices. We then use a numerical example to confirm our\nresult. In another example, we construct an exactly solvable optimal control\nproblem that exhibits a boundary layer phenomenon. Since optimal control\nproblems are rarely exactly solvable, this brings clarity to how vital Tikhonov\nregularizations are for the class of problems this example represents. We solve\nthe problem numerically using MATLAB's built-in optimization software and\ncompare results with a Galerkin-type/genetic algorithm. We find the second\nmethod generally outperforms MATLAB's optimization routines and we provide the\nMATLAB code used to generate the numerics. Finally, to demonstrate the utility\nof Tikhonov regularization from the second example in a more technologically\nrealistic application, we show that regularization guides the design of\ngradient-index optical devices toward those which are significantly less\nexpensive to fabricate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 22:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 23:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 03:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

One challenge that limits its practical application is the performance\ndegradation on clean samples. A major bottleneck identified by previous works\nis the widely used batch normalization (BN), which struggles to model the\ndifferent statistics of clean and adversarial training samples in AT. Although\nthe dominant approach is to extend BN to capture this mixture of distribution,\nwe propose to completely eliminate this bottleneck by removing all BN layers in\nAT. Our normalizer-free robust training (NoFrost) method extends recent\nadvances in normalizer-free networks to AT for its unexplored advantage on\nhandling the mixture distribution challenge. We show that NoFrost achieves\nadversarial robustness with only a minor sacrifice on clean sample accuracy.

In contrast, BN-based AT obtains\n$59.28\\%$ clean accuracy, suffering a significant $16.78\\%$ drop from standard\ntraining.

After the KEKB asymmetric-energy collider\nproject was commissioned in 1998 with direct energy injections, the techniques\nsuch as two-bunch acceleration and simultaneous injection were developed. As\nthe soft structure design of the LINAC was too weak against the great east\nJapan earthquake, it took three years to recover. Then the construction and\ncommissioning for the SuperKEKB project went on, and the simultaneous top-up\ninjection into four storage rings contributes to the both elementary particle\nphysics and photon science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 04:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

In\nthis work, we emphasize that studying semantic consensus is necessary to\nimprove the robustness of R-VOS.

In this work, we review\nthe existing definitions for uncertainty calibration of probabilistic\nregression tasks. We inspect the calibration properties of common detection\nnetworks and extend state-of-the-art recalibration methods. Our methods use a\nGaussian process (GP) recalibration scheme that yields parametric distributions\nas output (e.g. Gaussian or Cauchy). The usage of GP recalibration allows for a\nlocal (conditional) uncertainty calibration by capturing dependencies between\nneighboring samples. The use of parametric distributions such as as Gaussian\nallows for a simplified adaption of calibration in subsequent processes, e.g.,\nfor Kalman filtering in the scope of object tracking.\n  In addition, we use the GP recalibration scheme to perform covariance\nestimation which allows for post-hoc introduction of local correlations between\nthe output quantities, e.g., position, width, or height in object detection. To\nmeasure the joint calibration of multivariate and possibly correlated data, we\nintroduce the quantile calibration error which is based on the Mahalanobis\ndistance between the predicted distribution and the ground truth to determine\nwhether the ground truth is within a predicted quantile.\n  Our experiments show that common detection models overestimate the spatial\nuncertainty in comparison to the observed error.

Previous proposals for\nlong-distance coupling with magnons involved off-resonant coupling, where the\ndetuning of the spin-qubit frequency from the magnonic band edge provides\nprotection against spontaneous relaxation.

Therefore, there are efforts to\nreduce the computational complexity by using quantum computation.

To\nthe best of our knowledge, this work presents the first empirical radio wave\npropagation measurements in the form of time-variant channel transfer functions\nfor a linear, widely distributed antenna array with 32 single antenna RUs\nspread out over a range of 46.5 m. The large aperture allows for valuable\ninsights into the propagation characteristics of cell-free systems. Three\ndifferent co-located and widely distributed RU configurations and their\nproperties in an urban environment are analyzed in terms of time-variant\ndelay-spread, Doppler spread, path loss and the correlation of the local\nscattering function over space. For the development of 6G cell-free massive\nMIMO transceiver algorithms, we analyze properties such as channel hardening,\nchannel aging as well as the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). Our\nempirical evidence supports the promising claims for widely distributed\ncell-free systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 09:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 15:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

To address the above\nissues, we propose a Fourier-based Frequency Complex Network (FFCNet) for colon\ndisease classification in this study. Specifically, FFCNet is a novel complex\nnetwork that enables the combination of complex convolutional networks with\nfrequency learning to overcome the loss of phase information caused by real\nconvolution operations. Also, our Fourier transform transfers the average\nbrightness of an image to a point in the spectrum (the DC component),\nalleviating the effects of uneven brightness by decoupling image content and\nbrightness. Moreover, the image patch scrambling module in FFCNet generates\nrandom local spectral blocks, empowering the network to learn long-range and\nlocal diseasespecific features and improving the discriminative ability of hard\nsamples. We evaluated the proposed FFCNet on an in-house dataset with 2568\ncolonoscopy images, showing our method achieves high performance outperforming\nprevious state-of-the art methods with an accuracy of 86:35% and an accuracy of\n4.46% higher than the backbone.

In this case, deep learning\nmodels fail to obtain satisfactory performance. Transfer learning is a\npromising approach to solve the data scarcity issue. However, existing transfer\nlearning approaches in traffic prediction are mainly based on regular grid\ndata, which is not suitable for the inherent graph data in the traffic network.\nMoreover, existing graph-based models can only capture shared traffic patterns\nin the road network, and how to learn node-specific patterns is also a\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to\nsolve the traffic prediction with few data, which can transfer the knowledge\nlearned from a data-rich source domain to a data-scarce target domain. First, a\nspatial-temporal graph neural network is proposed, which can capture the\nnode-specific spatial-temporal traffic patterns of different road networks.\nThen, to improve the robustness of transfer, we design a pattern-based transfer\nstrategy, where we leverage a clustering-based mechanism to distill common\nspatial-temporal patterns in the source domain, and use these knowledge to\nfurther improve the prediction performance of the target domain. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 10:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Hence, we frame image harmonization as an\nimage-level regression problem to learn the arguments of the filters that\nhumans use for the task. We present a Harmonizer framework for image\nharmonization. Unlike prior methods that are based on black-box autoencoders,\nHarmonizer contains a neural network for filter argument prediction and several\nwhite-box filters (based on the predicted arguments) for image harmonization.\nWe also introduce a cascade regressor and a dynamic loss strategy for\nHarmonizer to learn filter arguments more stably and precisely.

Using a specially\ndesigned dual wave interferometric setup, the 3D dynamics of 9 micrometers\ndiameter particles at a few hundreds of nanometers from an air-water interface\nis here measured in thermal equilibrium.

The most\nefficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's\ninterpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records,\nCVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same\ncards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in\na way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to\nrepresent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in\nwhich they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot.\nBut for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote\nanonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast\nthem. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each\nballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks.\nBut what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or\ndoes not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to\nconduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on\neach ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not\ncompromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method\nallows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards.\nThe method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection\ndoes not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system\nmisbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results\nwhen the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and\nretrieval were accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 12:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

This\nobservation led to the concept of so-called tree-based networks, which recently\ngained substantial interest in the literature. Unfortunately, though,\nidentifying such networks in the unrooted case is an NP-complete problem.\nTherefore, classes of networks for which tree-basedness can be guaranteed are\nof the utmost interest.\n  The most prominent such class is formed by so-called edge-based networks,\nwhich have a close relationship to generalized series-parallel graphs known\nfrom graph theory.

While\nsatellite altimetry provides a direct observation of the sea surface height\n(SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents,\nthe associated sampling pattern prevents from retrieving fine-scale sea surface\ndynamics, typically below a 10-day time scale.

We tackle specifically forecasting in the long\nterm (one, two months ahead) and we compare different approaches for the task\nat hand, considering different forecasting algorithms as well as relying or not\non a cluster-based approach which first groups network cells with similar busy\nhour traffic profiles and then fits per-cluster forecasting models to predict\nthe traffic loads. Results on a real cellular network dataset show that busy\nhour traffic can be forecasted with errors below 10% for look-ahead periods up\nto 2 months in the future. Moreover, when clusters are available, we improve\nforecasting accuracy up to 8% and 5% for look-ahead of 1 and 2 months,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 12:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Fast\nupdates based on real-time data are essential when drilling in complex\nreservoirs with high uncertainties in pre-drill models. However, practical\nassimilation of real-time data requires effective geological modeling and\nmathematically robust parameterization. We propose a generative adversarial\ndeep neural network (GAN), trained to reproduce geologically consistent 2D\nsections of fluvial successions. Offline training produces a fast GAN-based\napproximation of complex geology parameterized as a 60-dimensional model vector\nwith standard Gaussian distribution of each component. Probabilistic forecasts\nare generated using an ensemble of equiprobable model vector realizations. A\nforward-modeling sequence, including a GAN, converts the initial (prior)\nensemble of realizations into EM log predictions. An ensemble smoother\nminimizes statistical misfits between predictions and real-time data, yielding\nan update of model vectors and reduced uncertainty around the well. Updates can\nbe then translated to probabilistic predictions of facies and resistivities.\nThe present paper demonstrates a workflow for geosteering in an outcrop-based,\nsynthetic fluvial succession.

In this regard, we introduce Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM),\na simple module for fine-grained few-shot classification. Our objective is to\nlocalize the class-wise discriminative regions by highlighting channels\nencoding distinct information of the class. Specifically, TDM learns\ntask-specific channel weights based on two novel components: Support Attention\nModule (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM produces a support weight to\nrepresent channel-wise discriminative power for each class. Still, since the\nSAM is basically only based on the labeled support sets, it can be vulnerable\nto bias toward such support set. Therefore, we propose QAM which complements\nSAM by yielding a query weight that grants more weight to object-relevant\nchannels for a given query image. By combining these two weights, a class-wise\ntask-specific channel weight is defined. The weights are then applied to\nproduce task-adaptive feature maps more focusing on the discriminative details.\nOur experiments validate the effectiveness of TDM and its complementary\nbenefits with prior methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 12:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

As such devices have limited memory storage,\nneural pruning on SNNs has been widely explored in recent years. Most existing\nSNN pruning works focus on shallow SNNs (2~6 layers), however, deeper SNNs (>16\nlayers) are proposed by state-of-the-art SNN works, which is difficult to be\ncompatible with the current SNN pruning work. To scale up a pruning technique\ntowards deep SNNs, we investigate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) which states\nthat dense networks contain smaller subnetworks (i.e., winning tickets) that\nachieve comparable performance to the dense networks. Our studies on LTH reveal\nthat the winning tickets consistently exist in deep SNNs across various\ndatasets and architectures, providing up to 97% sparsity without huge\nperformance degradation.

However, to achieve this, the\nstate-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions\nto seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control\nover the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nto learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction.\nOur network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture\nto model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the\ncorresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the\ninductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables\nin two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each\npartial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two\ntypes of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one\nportion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by\nsampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a\nsampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable\npredictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by\nflexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental\nresults and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of\npredicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 13:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In this context,\nhigh-quality training, validation and testing datasets are particularly needed.\nVolumetric data is a very important resource in medicine, as it ranges from\ndisease diagnoses to therapy monitoring. When the dataset is sufficient, models\ncan be trained to help doctors with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are\nscenarios and applications where large amounts of data is unavailable. For\nexample, in the medical field, rare diseases and privacy issues can lead to\nrestricted data availability. In non-medical fields, the high cost of obtaining\na sufficient amount of high-quality data can also be a concern. A solution to\nthese problems can be the generation of synthetic data to perform data\naugmentation in combination with other more traditional methods of data\naugmentation. Therefore, most of the publications on 3D Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) are within the medical domain. The existence of mechanisms to\ngenerate realistic synthetic data is a good asset to overcome this challenge,\nespecially in healthcare, as the data must be of good quality and close to\nreality, i.e. realistic, and without privacy issues. In this review, we provide\na summary of works that generate realistic 3D synthetic data using GANs. We\ntherefore outline GAN-based methods in these areas with common architectures,\nadvantages and disadvantages. We present a novel taxonomy, evaluations,\nchallenges and research opportunities to provide a holistic overview of the\ncurrent state of GANs in medicine and other fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 13:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Compared to supervised learning with labelled disease EEG data which\ncan train a model to analyze specific diseases but would fail to monitor\npreviously unseen statuses, anomaly detection based on only normal EEGs can\ndetect any potential anomaly in new EEGs. Different from existing anomaly\ndetection strategies which do not consider any property of unavailable abnormal\ndata during model development, a task-oriented self-supervised learning\napproach is proposed here which makes use of available normal EEGs and expert\nknowledge about abnormal EEGs to train a more effective feature extractor for\nthe subsequent development of anomaly detector. In addition, a specific two\nbranch convolutional neural network with larger kernels is designed as the\nfeature extractor such that it can more easily extract both larger scale and\nsmall-scale features which often appear in unavailable abnormal EEGs. The\neffectively designed and trained feature extractor has shown to be able to\nextract better feature representations from EEGs for development of anomaly\ndetector based on normal data and future anomaly detection for new EEGs, as\ndemonstrated on three EEG datasets.

To minimize the\nquantization impact of each weight on others, we perform an orthonormal\ntransformation of the weights at each layer by training an input-dependent\ncorrelation matrix and importance vector, such that each weight is disentangled\nfrom the others. Then, we quantize the weights based on their importance to\nminimize the loss of the information from the original weights/activations. We\nfurther perform progressive layer-wise quantization from the bottom layer to\nthe top, so that quantization at each layer reflects the quantized\ndistributions of weights and activations at previous layers.

Meetings as a facilitator for\ncoordination and communication are an established medium for information\nexchange. Analyses of meetings in software projects have shown that certain\ninteractions in these meetings, such as proactive statements followed by\nsupportive ones, influence the mood and motivation of a team, which in turn\naffects its productivity. So far, however, research has focused only on certain\ninteractions at a detailed level, requiring a complex and fine-grained analysis\nof a meeting itself.\n  Aim: In this paper, we investigate meetings from a more abstract perspective,\nfocusing on the polarity of the statements, i.e., whether they appear to be\npositive, negative, or neutral.\n  Method: We analyze the relationship between the polarity of statements in\nmeetings and different social aspects, including conflicts as well as the mood\nbefore and after a meeting.\n  Results: Our results emerge from 21 student software project meetings and\nshow some interesting insights: (1) Positive mood before a meeting is both\nrelated to the amount of positive statements in the beginning, as well as\nthroughout the whole meeting, (2) negative mood before the meeting only\ninfluences the amount of negative statements in the first quarter of the\nmeeting, but not the whole meeting, and (3) the amount of positive and negative\nstatements during the meeting has no influence on the mood afterwards.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that the behaviour in meetings might rather\ninfluence short-term emotional states (feelings) than long-term emotional\nstates (mood), which are more important for the project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 13:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

However, playing a long\ntime-lapse sequence back as a video often results in distracting flicker due to\nrandom effects, such as weather, as well as cyclic effects, such as the\nday-night cycle. We introduce the problem of disentangling time-lapse sequences\nin a way that allows separate, after-the-fact control of overall trends, cyclic\neffects, and random effects in the images, and describe a technique based on\ndata-driven generative models that achieves this goal. This enables us to\n\"re-render\" the sequences in ways that would not be possible with the input\nimages alone.

Our\narchitecture and training procedure are designed so that the networks learn to\nmodel random variations, such as weather, using the GAN's latent space, and to\ndisentangle overall trends and cyclic variations by feeding the conditioning\ntime label to the model using Fourier features with specific frequencies.\n  We show that our models are robust to defects in the training data, enabling\nus to amend some of the practical difficulties in capturing long time-lapse\nsequences, such as temporary occlusions, uneven frame spacing, and missing\nframes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 13:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

To alleviate this problem, we present a novel plug-in dynamic\ncontrastive distillation (DCD) framework to compress the large VLP models for\nthe ITR task. Technically, we face the following two challenges: 1) the typical\nuni-modal metric learning approach is difficult to directly apply to the\ncross-modal tasks, due to the limited GPU memory to optimize too many negative\nsamples during handling cross-modal fusion features. 2) it is inefficient to\nstatic optimize the student network from different hard samples, which have\ndifferent effects on distillation learning and student network optimization. We\ntry to overcome these challenges from two points. First, to achieve multi-modal\ncontrastive learning, and balance the training costs and effects, we propose to\nuse a teacher network to estimate the difficult samples for students, making\nthe students absorb the powerful knowledge from pre-trained teachers, and\nmaster the knowledge from hard samples. Second, to dynamic learn from hard\nsample pairs, we propose dynamic distillation to dynamically learn samples of\ndifferent difficulties, from the perspective of better balancing the difficulty\nof knowledge and students' self-learning ability. We successfully apply our\nproposed DCD strategy to two state-of-the-art vision-language pretrained\nmodels, i.e. ViLT and METER. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K\nbenchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our DCD framework.\nEncouragingly, we can speed up the inference at least 129$\\times$ compared to\nthe existing ITR models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 14:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In this study, using a novel computational\nmethod combining geometrical analysis and information-theoretic measures, we\nanalyse the accessibility to public transport in terms of the spatial coverage\nof the transport nodes (stops) and the quality of service at these nodes across\ndifferent areas. Furthermore, using a network clustering procedure, we also\ncharacterise the land-use pattern of those areas and relate that to their\npublic transport accessibility. Using Singapore as a case study, we find that\nthe commercial areas in the CBD area expectedly have excellent accessibility\nand the residential areas also have good to very good accessibility. However,\nnot every residential area is equally accessible. While the spatial coverage of\nstops in these areas is very good, the quality of service indicates substantial\nvariation among different regions, with high contrast between the central and\neastern areas compared to the others in the west and north of the city-state.\nWe believe this kind of analysis could yield a good understanding of the\ncurrent level of public transport services across the urban system, and their\ndisparity will provide valuable and actionable insights into the future\ndevelopment plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 14:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Though the recently discovered\nAu-enhanced exfoliation technique provides an effective strategy for\npreparation of large-scale 2D crystals, the high cost of gold hinders this\nmethod from being widely adopted in industrial applications. In addition,\ndirect Au contact could significantly quench photoluminescence (PL) emission in\n2D semiconductors. It is therefore crucial to find alternative metals that can\nreplace gold to achieve efficient exfoliation of 2D materials. Here, we present\na one-step Ag-assisted method that can efficiently exfoliate many large-area 2D\nmonolayers, where the yield ratio is comparable to Au-enhanced exfoliation\nmethod. Differing from Au film, however, the surface roughness of as-prepared\nAg films on SiO2/Si substrate is much higher, which facilitates the generation\nof surface plasmons resulting from the nanostructures formed on the rough Ag\nsurface. More interestingly, the strong coupling between 2D semiconductor\ncrystals (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2) and Ag film leads to a unique PL enhancement that\nhas not been observed in other mechanical exfoliation techniques, which can be\nmainly attributed to enhanced light-matter interaction as a result of extended\npropagation of surface plasmonic polariton (SPP). Our work provides a\nlower-cost and universal Ag-assisted exfoliation method, while at the same\noffering enhanced SPP-matter interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 14:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

However, utilizing a few known anomalies\nduring training may cause another issue that the model may be biased by those\nknown anomalies and fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. In this paper, we\ntackle supervised anomaly detection, i.e., we learn AD models using a few\navailable anomalies with the objective to detect both the seen and unseen\nanomalies. We propose a novel explicit boundary guided semi-push-pull\ncontrastive learning mechanism, which can enhance model's discriminability\nwhile mitigating the bias issue. Our approach is based on two core designs:\nFirst, we find an explicit and compact separating boundary as the guidance for\nfurther feature learning. As the boundary only relies on the normal feature\ndistribution, the bias problem caused by a few known anomalies can be\nalleviated. Second, a boundary guided semi-push-pull loss is developed to only\npull the normal features together while pushing the abnormal features apart\nfrom the separating boundary beyond a certain margin region. In this way, our\nmodel can form a more explicit and discriminative decision boundary to\ndistinguish known and also unseen anomalies from normal samples more\neffectively.

The correspondence between the simple bulk problem and the more\ncomplicated interface problem is usually justified by invoking an abstract\nindex theorem. Here, by applying ray tracing machinery to the paradigmatic\nexample of equatorial shallow water waves, we propose a physical interpretation\nof this correspondence. We first compute ray trajectories in a phase space\ngiven by position and wavenumber of the wave packet, using Wigner-Weyl\ntransforms. We then apply a quantization condition to describe the spectral\nproperties of the original wave operator. We show that the Chern number emerges\nnaturally from this quantization relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 15:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 10:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

As for many\nknowledge-sharing websites, the value of SO depends largely on users'\nengagement, namely their willingness to answer, comment or post technical\nquestions. Still, many of these questions (including cybersecurity-related\nones) remain unanswered, putting the site's relevance and reputation into\nquestion. Hence, it is important to understand users' participation in privacy\nand security discussions to promote engagement and foster the exchange of such\nexpertise. Objective: Based on prior findings on online social networks, this\nwork elaborates on the interplay between users' engagement and their privacy\npractices in SO. Particularly, it analyses developers' self-disclosure\nbehaviour regarding profile visibility and their involvement in discussions\nrelated to privacy and security. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach\nby (i) analysing SO data from 1239 cybersecurity-tagged questions along with\n7048 user profiles, and (ii) conducting an anonymous online survey (N=64).\nResults: About 33% of the questions we retrieved had no answer, whereas more\nthan 50% had no accepted answer. We observed that \"proactive\" users tend to\ndisclose significantly less information in their profiles than \"reactive\" and\n\"unengaged\" ones. However, no correlations were found between these engagement\ncategories and privacy-related constructs such as Perceived Control or General\nPrivacy Concerns. Implications: These findings contribute to (i) a better\nunderstanding of developers' engagement towards privacy and security topics,\nand (ii) to shape strategies promoting the exchange of cybersecurity expertise\nin SO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 15:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In the context of a Physical Theory, the physical\nquantities and the physical laws are described, respectively, by suitable\ngeometrical objects and relations between these objects. These relations are\nexpressed with systems of (mainly second order) differential equations. The\nsolution of these equations is frequently a formidable task, either because the\ndynamical equations cannot be integrated by standard methods or because the\ndefined dynamical system is non-integrable. Therefore, it is important that we\nhave a systematic and reliable method to determine their integrability. This\nhas led to the development of several (algebraic or geometric) methods, which\ndetermine if a dynamical system is integrable/superintegrable or not. Most of\nthese methods concern the first integrals (FIs), that is, quantities that are\nconstant along the evolution of the system. FIs are important, because they can\nbe used to reduce the order of the system of the dynamical equations and, if\nthere are `enough' of them, even to determine its solution by means of\nquadratures. In the latter case, the dynamical system is said to be Liouville\nintegrable and it is associated with a canonical Lagrangian, whose kinetic\nenergy defines a metric tensor known as kinetic metric. It is proved that there\nis a close relation between the geometric symmetries (collineations and Killing\ntensors) of this metric and the quantities defining the FIs. This\ncorrespondence makes it possible to use the results of Differential Geometry in\nthe study of the integrability of dynamical systems. In this thesis, we study\nthis correspondence and geometrize the determination of FIs by developing a new\ngeometric method to compute them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 15:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Here\nwe propose and investigate two configurations that allow for in-situ modulation\nof Casimir forces through electrical gating of a metal-insulator-semiconductor\n(MIS) junction comprised of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials.

These attractive properties have\nspurred much research into integrated soliton generation in microring\nresonators at telecom wavelenghts. However, these solitons are generated via\nexternal pumping of a nonlinear medium, which limits system compactness and the\nwavelength coverage. Recently it was shown that dissipative Kerr solitons can\nbe generated directly in the gain medium of mid-infrared semiconductor ring\nlasers, where the energy is supplied via electrical pumping. These\ntechnological advances enable a new route towards the monolithic generation of\ndiverse light states in a wide frequency range, requiring insight into the\nconditions necessary for achieving control over the system. In this work, we\nstudy in depth the phase diagram of such systems, exhibiting fast gain dynamics\nand no external pumping, and which are described by the complex cubic\nGinzburg-Landau equation with periodic boundary conditions. While previous\nstudies have focused on large system sizes, we here focus on finite ring sizes\nleading to a modification of the phase space and enlargement of the region for\nstable soliton formation. In addition to localized, dispersion-less soliton\npulses on a finite background, breather solitons are predicted to occur under\nfeasible experimental conditions.

Such factor networks are task-wise\ndisentangled and can be directly assembled, without any fine-tuning, to produce\nthe more competent combined-task networks. In other words, the factor networks\nserve as Lego-brick-like building blocks, allowing us to construct customized\nnetworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, each factor network comprises\ntwo modules, a common-knowledge module that is task-agnostic and shared by all\nfactor networks, alongside with a task-specific module dedicated to the factor\nnetwork itself.

In this paper, we evaluate and comment\non the dynamical communication performances of a FSO mode diversity receiver,\nbased on a spatial demultiplexer and a silicon photonic coherent combiner, for\nan optical link from a GEO satellite to an optical ground station (OGS). We\nsimulate time series of distorted wavefronts received by the OGS and we show\nnumerically that the coherent combination of spatial modes mitigate the signal\nfading compared to a conventional single mode fiber (SMF) receiver. We verify\nthis property in a laboratory environment by generating the wavefronts\ncorresponding to the use case with an atmospheric propagation channel emulator.\nThen we modulate the optical carrier prior to the wavefront emulator with 10G\nOOK and DPSK data sequences to measure the BER performance of the proposed\nreceiver during the time series emulation. Finally, we study and comment on the\ninfluence of the number of modes combined and the wavelength multiplexing on\nthe BER performances. We prove that the mode diversity receiver provide a\nhigher collection efficiency, has better BER performances and much less\nsynchronization losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 14:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}
