This physical\ninteraction takes multiple forms depending on the task, the user, and what the\nrobot has learned so far. State-of-the-art approaches focus on learning from a\nsingle modality, or combine multiple interaction types by assuming that the\nrobot has prior information about the human's intended task. By contrast, in\nthis paper we introduce an algorithmic formalism that unites learning from\ndemonstrations, corrections, and preferences. Our approach makes no assumptions\nabout the tasks the human wants to teach the robot; instead, we learn a reward\nmodel from scratch by comparing the human's inputs to nearby alternatives. We\nfirst derive a loss function that trains an ensemble of reward models to match\nthe human's demonstrations, corrections, and preferences. The type and order of\nfeedback is up to the human teacher: we enable the robot to collect this\nfeedback passively or actively. We then apply constrained optimization to\nconvert our learned reward into a desired robot trajectory. Through simulations\nand a user study we demonstrate that our proposed approach more accurately\nlearns manipulation tasks from physical human interaction than existing\nbaselines, particularly when the robot is faced with new or unexpected\nobjectives.

It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and\nit will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical\ninternet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed\nglobally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over\nlong distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize\nquantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in\norder to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the\nlimitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work\nprovides an initial step towards this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory\nof near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we\nshow that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model\nprotocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific\nimplementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links\nintroduced in prior work, and by providing new results on policies for\nelementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. In particular, we\nshow that the well-known memory-cutoff policy is optimal in the steady-state\nlimit. Then we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a\nquantum network protocol in which we wait for all elementary links to be active\nbefore creating end-to-end links. We then provide an extension of the MDP\nformalism to two elementary links, which is useful for analyzing more\nsophisticated quantum network protocols. Here, as new results, we derive linear\nprogramming relaxations that allow us to obtain optimal steady-state policies\nwith respect to the expected fidelity and waiting time of the end-to-end link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 16:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

However,\nthe actual measurements of signals have to be quantized before storing or\nprocessing. 1(One)-bit compressed sensing is a heavily quantized version of\ncompressed sensing, where each linear measurement of a signal is reduced to\njust one bit: the sign of the measurement. Once enough of such measurements are\ncollected, the recovery problem in 1-bit compressed sensing aims to find the\noriginal signal with as much accuracy as possible. The recovery problem is\nrelated to the traditional \"halfspace-learning\" problem in learning theory.\n  For recovery of sparse vectors, a popular reconstruction method from 1-bit\nmeasurements is the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm. The\nalgorithm is a simple projected sub-gradient descent method, and is known to\nconverge well empirically, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. The\nconvergence property of BIHT was not theoretically justified, except with an\nexorbitantly large number of measurements (i.e., a number of measurement\ngreater than $\\max\\{k^{10}, 24^{48}, k^{3.5}/\\epsilon\\}$, where $k$ is the\nsparsity, $\\epsilon$ denotes the approximation error, and even this expression\nhides other factors).

Therefore, techniques to\nreconstruct articulated 3D objects from 2D images are crucial and highly\nuseful. In this work, we propose a practical problem setting to estimate 3D\npose and shape of animals given only a few (10-30) in-the-wild images of a\nparticular animal species (say, horse). Contrary to existing works that rely on\npre-defined template shapes, we do not assume any form of 2D or 3D ground-truth\nannotations, nor do we leverage any multi-view or temporal information.\nMoreover, each input image ensemble can contain animal instances with varying\nposes, backgrounds, illuminations, and textures. Our key insight is that 3D\nparts have much simpler shape compared to the overall animal and that they are\nrobust w.r.t. animal pose articulations. Following these insights, we propose\nLASSIE, a novel optimization framework which discovers 3D parts in a\nself-supervised manner with minimal user intervention. A key driving force\nbehind LASSIE is the enforcing of 2D-3D part consistency using self-supervisory\ndeep features. Experiments on Pascal-Part and self-collected in-the-wild animal\ndatasets demonstrate considerably better 3D reconstructions as well as both 2D\nand 3D part discovery compared to prior arts.

The drones\nare launched and retrieved by the truck at customer locations, and each of\ntheir flights must not consume more energy than allowed by their batteries.\nMost problem settings in the literature restrict the feasible truck routes to\ncycles, i.e., closed paths, which never visit a node more than once.

We\nrefer to such solutions as arc-retraversing, and include them in our solution\nspace by modeling the truck route as a closed walk. We describe Euclidean\ninstances where all the optimal solutions are arc-retraversing.

To test the concept of centrifugal\nbarrier, which was originally based on angular momentum conserving-collapse of\na rotating test particle around a fixed point mass, we carry out simple\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar disk formation including\na minimum set of ingredients: self-gravity, rotation, and a prescribed\nviscosity that enables the disk to accrete.

The region has more specific\nangular momentum than its surrounding envelope material, which points to an\norigin in outward angular momentum transport in the disk (subject to the\nconstraint of disk expansion by the infalling envelope), rather than the\nspin-up of the envelope material envisioned in the classic picture as it falls\ncloser to the center in order to conserve angular momentum. For smaller\nviscosities, the super-Keplerian rotation is weaker or non-existing.

For this problem, the system is\npartially observed since the data is only available at well locations.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are highly uncertain due to sparsity of\navailable field data. In principle, RL algorithms are capable of learning\noptimal action policies -- a map from states to actions -- to maximize a\nnumerical reward signal.

In the RL formulation of the robust\noptimal well control problem, the states are represented by saturation and\npressure values at well locations while the actions represent the valve\nopenings controlling the flow through wells.

This helps generalize\nto novel objects at inference. Two popular forms of weak-supervision used in\nopen-vocabulary detection (OVD) include pretrained CLIP model and image-level\nsupervision. We note that both these modes of supervision are not optimally\naligned for the detection task: CLIP is trained with image-text pairs and lacks\nprecise localization of objects while the image-level supervision has been used\nwith heuristics that do not accurately specify local object regions. In this\nwork, we propose to address this problem by performing object-centric alignment\nof the language embeddings from the CLIP model. Furthermore, we visually ground\nthe objects with only image-level supervision using a pseudo-labeling process\nthat provides high-quality object proposals and helps expand the vocabulary\nduring training. We establish a bridge between the above two object-alignment\nstrategies via a novel weight transfer function that aggregates their\ncomplimentary strengths. In essence, the proposed model seeks to minimize the\ngap between object and image-centric representations in the OVD setting.

However, direct evidence of enhanced mixing due to these migrations\nremains challenging to obtain and inconclusive. These shortcomings are due to\nthe limitations of current measurement techniques, i.e., velocimetry\ntechniques, which require a priori knowledge of the precise aggregation\nlocation and typically trigger animal avoidance behavior from introducing\ninstrumentation into the migration. Here we develop a new approach to overcome\nthese longstanding limitations by leveraging advancements in modern\nmagnetometry to detect the flow-induced magnetic fields that naturally arise\nfrom seawater as it moves through the Earth's geomagnetic field. We derive\nquantitative predictions showing that these flow-induced magnetic fields in the\nvicinity of migrating aggregations have a strength proportional to the\nintegrated fluid transport due to the migration. Importantly these magnetic\nsignatures are potentially detectable remotely at a significant distance far\nfrom the aggregation and region of moving fluid with emerging quantum-enhanced\nmagnetometry techniques such as Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond.

Present\nefforts to model the GW signal from cosmic strings are often based on minimal\nmodels, such as, eg, the Nambu--Goto action that describes cosmic strings as\nexactly one-dimensional objects without any internal structure. In order to\narrive at more realistic predictions, it is therefore necessary to consider\nnonminimal models that make an attempt at accounting for the microscopic\nproperties of cosmic strings. With this goal in mind, we derive in this paper\nthe GW spectrum emitted by current-carrying cosmic strings (CCCSs), which may\nform in a variety of cosmological scenarios. Our analysis is based on a\ngeneralized version of the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model, which, in\naddition to the mean velocity and correlation length of the string network,\nalso describes the evolution of a chiral (light-like) current. As we are able\nto show, the solutions of the VOS equations imply a temporarily growing\nfractional cosmic-string energy density, $\\Omega_{\\rm cs}$. This results in an\nenhanced GW signal across a broad frequency interval, whose boundaries are\ndetermined by the times of generation and decay of cosmic-string currents.

However, when using the lowest-order quadrilateral Raviart-Thomas\nelements, standard finite element discretisations of the vector transport\nequation typically have a low order of spatial accuracy. This paper describes\ntwo schemes that improve the accuracy of transporting such vector-valued fields\non two-dimensional curved manifolds.\n  The first scheme that is presented reconstructs the transported field in a\nhigher-order function space, where the transport equation is then solved. The\nsecond scheme applies a mixed finite element formulation to the vector\ntransport equation, simultaneously solving for the transported field and its\nvorticity. An approach to stabilising this mixed vector-vorticity formulation\nis presented that uses a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. These\nschemes are then demonstrated, along with their accuracy properties, through\nsome numerical tests. Two new test cases are used to assess the transport of\nvector-valued fields on curved manifolds, solving the vector transport equation\nin isolation. The improvement of the schemes is also shown through two standard\ntest cases for rotating shallow-water models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 18:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Implementing an autonomous\nvehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the\ncentralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures.

There is a factor of up to 30\ndifference in the intensity of the complex organic molecules (COMs) lines.\nHowever the molecular emission of the hot cores appears to be the same within a\nfactor 2-3. This points towards both a similar chemical composition and\nexcitation of most of the COMs over these massive cores, which span about an\norder of magnitude in core mass. In contrast, CH3CCH emission is found to\npreferentially trace more the envelope, with a temperature ranging from 50 K to\n90 K. Core 1, the most massive hot core of W43-MM1, shows a richer line\nspectrum than the other cores. In core 2, the emission of O-bearing molecules\ndoes not peak at the dust continuum core center; the blue and red shifted\nemission correspond to the outflow lobes, suggesting a formation via the\nsublimation of the ice mantles through shocks or UV irradiation on the walls of\nthe cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 19:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Theoretical machinery developed for forced-probe\nmicrorheology of colloidal suspensions focused on either constant-force (CF) or\nconstant-velocity (CV) probes while in experiments neither the force nor the\nkinematics of the probe is fixed. More importantly, the constraint of CF or CV\nintroduces a difficulty in the meaningful quantification of the fluctuations of\nthe probe due to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. It is known that for a\nBrownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential well, the product of the\nstandard deviations of the trap force and the particle position is $d k_BT$ in\n$d$ dimensions with $k_BT$ being the thermal energy. As a result, if the force\n(position) is not allowed to fluctuate, the position (force) fluctuation\nbecomes infinite. To allow the measurement of fluctuations, in this work we\nconsider a microrheology model in which the embedded probe is dragged along by\na moving harmonic potential so that both its position and the trap force are\nallowed to fluctuate.

Here we\ntreat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model\noptimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic\nmodel combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive\nforce to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a\nglobally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective\nhighlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la\nBYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a\npurely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved\nperformance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle\ncoordinates.

It is promising\nin challenging scenes such as nighttime and complex backgrounds due to the\ninsensitivity to lighting conditions of thermal images. Thus, the key problem\nof RGB-T SOD is to make the features from the two modalities complement and\nadjust each other flexibly, since it is inevitable that any modalities of RGB-T\nimage pairs failure due to challenging scenes such as extreme light conditions\nand thermal crossover. In this paper, we propose a novel mirror complementary\nTransformer network (MCNet) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we introduce a\nTransformer-based feature extraction module to effective extract hierarchical\nfeatures of RGB and thermal images. Then, through the attention-based feature\ninteraction and serial multiscale dilated convolution (SDC) based feature\nfusion modules, the proposed model achieves the complementary interaction of\nlow-level features and the semantic fusion of deep features.

Here, we transform the structural\nconnectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific\ndiffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary\nmarkedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency\neigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the\nfunctional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction\nin transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the\nunimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are\nusually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and\nrandom dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity\nprediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent\nstructure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although\nthe information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it\neffectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal\nregions and 56% in transmodal regions.

This suggests that C-Score is not defined by the individual\ncharacteristics of each sample but rather by other factors. We hypothesize that\na sample's relation to its neighbours, in particular, how many of them share\nthe same labels, can help in explaining C-Scores. We plan to explore this in\nfuture work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 21:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Such descriptors are key for traversing chemical compound\nspace with machine learning. Our focus is on the Coulomb matrix and on the\nsmooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP). We adopt a basic framework that\nallows us to connect both descriptors to electronic structure theory. This\nframework enables us then to define two new descriptors that are more closely\nrelated to electronic structure theory, which we call Coulomb lists and smooth\noverlap of electron densities (SOED). By investigating their usefulness as\nmolecular similarity descriptors, we gain new insights in how and why Coulomb\nmatrix and SOAP work. Moreover, Coulomb lists avoid the somewhat mysterious\ndiagonalization step of the Coulomb matrix and might provide a direct means to\nextract subsystem information that can be compared across Born-Oppenheimer\nsurfaces of varying dimension. For the electron density we derive the necessary\nformalism to create the SOED measure in close analogy to SOAP. Since this\nformalism is more involved than that of SOAP, we review the essential theory,\nbut also introduce a set of approximations that eventually allow us to work\nwith SOED in terms of the same implementation available for the evaluation of\nSOAP. We focus our analysis on elementary reaction steps, where transition\nstate structures are more similar to either reactant or product structures than\nthe latter two are with respect to one another. The prediction of electronic\nenergies of transition state structures can, however, be more difficult than\nthat of stable intermediates due to multi-configurational effects. The question\narises to what extent molecular similarity descriptors rooted in electronic\nstructure theory can resolve these intricate effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 21:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 15:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

The dominant role of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) seems to be challenged by increasingly effective\ntransformer-based models. Very recently, a couple of advanced convolutional\nmodels strike back with large kernels motivated by the local-window attention\nmechanism, showing appealing performance and efficiency. While one of them,\ni.e. RepLKNet, impressively manages to scale the kernel size to 31x31 with\nimproved performance, the performance starts to saturate as the kernel size\ncontinues growing, compared to the scaling trend of advanced ViTs such as Swin\nTransformer. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training extreme\nconvolutions larger than 31x31 and test whether the performance gap can be\neliminated by strategically enlarging convolutions. This study ends up with a\nrecipe for applying extremely large kernels from the perspective of sparsity,\nwhich can smoothly scale up kernels to 61x61 with better performance.

In particular, with perfect delay alignment, inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) can be eliminated even with single-carrier (SC)\ntransmission, without relying on sophisticated channel equalization. The key\nideas of DAM are delay pre-compensation and path-based beamforming, so that all\nmulti-path signal components may arrive at the receiver simultaneously and be\nsuperimposed constructively, rather than causing the detrimental ISI. Compared\nto the classic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission,\nDAM-enabled SC communication has several appealing advantages, including low\npeak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) and high tolerance for Doppler frequency\nshift, which renders DAM also appealing for radar sensing. Therefore, in this\npaper, DAM is investigated for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)\nsystems. We first study the output signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for ISI-free\nSC communication and radar sensing, and then derive the closed-form expressions\nfor DAM-based sensing in terms of the ambiguity function (AF) and integrated\nsidelobe ratio (ISR).

By varying the accumulated laser fluence to\nmodulate the oxidation depth, an unprecedented large gamut of 90% sRGB is\nobtained. Our highly reproducible printing technique manifests\nangle-insensitive colors the variation of Hue is <0.14pi when viewing angles\nchanging from 6 to 60. The full-color printing speed reaches to 1.4 cm2/s and\nthe highest printing resolution exceeds 25000 dpi. The durability of the\nlaser-printed colors is confirmed by fastness examination, including salt fog,\ndouble-85, light bleaching, and adhesion tests. These features render our\ntechnique to be competitive for high-throughput industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 02:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, AUC maximization algorithms may decrease generalization\nperformance due to the noisy data. Self-paced learning is an effective method\nfor handling noisy data. However, existing self-paced learning methods are\nlimited to pointwise learning, while AUC maximization is a pairwise learning\nproblem. To solve this challenging problem, we innovatively propose a balanced\nself-paced AUC maximization algorithm (BSPAUC). Specifically, we first provide\na statistical objective for self-paced AUC. Based on this, we propose our\nself-paced AUC maximization formulation, where a novel balanced self-paced\nregularization term is embedded to ensure that the selected positive and\nnegative samples have proper proportions. Specially, the sub-problem with\nrespect to all weight variables may be non-convex in our formulation, while the\none is normally convex in existing self-paced problems. To address this, we\npropose a doubly cyclic block coordinate descent method. More importantly, we\nprove that the sub-problem with respect to all weight variables converges to a\nstationary point on the basis of closed-form solutions, and our BSPAUC\nconverges to a stationary point of our fixed optimization objective under a\nmild assumption. Considering both the deep learning and kernel-based\nimplementations, experimental results on several large-scale datasets\ndemonstrate that our BSPAUC has a better generalization performance than\nexisting state-of-the-art AUC maximization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 02:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

However, the\nscaling behaviour of the community size lacks investigation, especially from\nthe perspectives of local interactions. Based on the assumption that\nheterogeneous nodes behave differently and result in different topological\npositions of the networks, we propose a model of designed random walks in\ndirected networks to explain the features in the observed networks. The model\nhighlights that two different dynamics can mimic the local interactions, and a\nhidden layer is essential when reproducing the characteristics of real complex\nnetworks. The key features the model can explain include community size\ndistribution, degree distribution, percolation properties, distribution of\naverage path length and dependence of the above properties on the labels of\nnodes in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 02:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

The\ntask poses great visual, linguistic, and reasoning challenges that cannot be\neasily overcome without an appropriate representation scheme over video and\ndialog that supports high-level reasoning. To tackle these challenges we\npresent a new object-centric framework for video dialog that supports neural\nreasoning dubbed COST - which stands for Conversation about Objects in\nSpace-Time.

The Kripke model equivalence is perfectly caught by the\nstructural relationship called bisimulation. In this paper, we propose the\ngeneralized action emulation perfectly catching the action model equivalence.\nPrevious structural relationships sufficient for the action model equivalence,\ni.e. the bisimulation, the propositional action emulation, the action\nemulation, and the action emulation of canonical action models, can be\ndescribed by various restricted versions of the generalized action emulation.\nWe summarize four critical properties of the atom set over preconditions, and\nprove that any formula set satisfying these properties can be used to restrict\nthe generalized action emulation to determine the action model equivalence by\nan iteration algorithm. We also construct a new formula set with these four\nproperties, which is generally more efficient than the atom set. The technique\nof the partition refinement has been used to minimize the world space of a\nKripke model under the bisimulation. Applying the partition refinement to\naction models allows one to minimize their event spaces under the bisimulation.\nThe propositional action emulation is weaker than bismulation but still\nsufficient for the action model equivalence.

More specifically, the detection\nalgorithm usually requires an accurate geometric relationship among multiple\nsensors as the input, and it is often assumed that the contents from these\nsensors are captured at the same time. Preparing such sensor suites involves\ncarefully designed calibration rigs and accurate synchronization mechanisms,\nand the preparation process is usually done offline. In this work, a\nsegmentation-based framework is proposed to jointly estimate the geometrical\nand temporal parameters in the calibration of a camera-LIDAR suite. A semantic\nsegmentation mask is first applied to both sensor modalities, and the\ncalibration parameters are optimized through pixel-wise bidirectional loss.

We design a hierarchical indexing\nalong with a novel search algorithm to support efficient trajectory\nmodification, ensuring the modified trajectories satisfy the perturbed\ndistributions without compromising privacy guarantee or data utility.

Meanwhile, recent work has found that the frames of natural video\ntransformed into the perceptual domain of the HVS tend to form a straight\ntrajectory of the representations. With the obtained insight that distortion\nimpairs the perceived video quality and results in a curved trajectory of the\nperceptual representation, we propose a temporal perceptual quality index\n(TPQI) to measure the temporal distortion by describing the graphic morphology\nof the representation. Specifically, we first extract the video perceptual\nrepresentations from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual\narea (V1) of the HVS, and then measure the straightness and compactness of\ntheir trajectories to quantify the degradation in naturalness and content\ncontinuity of video. Experiments show that the perceptual representation in the\nHVS is an effective way of predicting subjective temporal quality, and thus\nTPQI can, for the first time, achieve comparable performance to the spatial\nquality metric and be even more effective in assessing videos with large\ntemporal variations. We further demonstrate that by combining with NIQE, a\nspatial quality metric, TPQI can achieve top performance over popular\nin-the-wild video datasets. More importantly, TPQI does not require any\nadditional information beyond the video being evaluated and thus can be applied\nto any datasets without parameter tuning.

On our\nplanet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic\ndisequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of\ndifferent redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the\nrange of several thousands of reactions.

To avoid the use of conventional axle detectors and\nbridge type specific methods, we propose a novel method for axle detection\nthrough the placement of accelerometers at any point of a bridge. In order to\ndevelop a model that is as simple and comprehensible as possible, the axle\ndetection task is implemented as a binary classification problem instead of a\nregression problem. The model is implemented as a Fully Convolutional Network\nto process signals in the form of Continuous Wavelet Transforms. This allows\npassages of any length to be processed in a single step with maximum efficiency\nwhile utilising multiple scales in a single evaluation. This enables our method\nto use acceleration signals at any location of the bridge structure serving as\nVirtual Axle Detectors (VADs) without being limited to specific structural\ntypes of bridges. To test the proposed method, we analysed 3787 train passages\nrecorded on a steel trough railway bridge of a long-distance traffic line. Our\nresults on the measurement data show that our model detects 95% of the axes,\nthus, 128,599 of 134,800 previously unseen axles were correctly detected. In\ntotal, 90% of the axles can be detected with a maximum spatial error of 20cm,\nwith a maximum velocity of $v_{\\mathrm{max}}=56,3~\\mathrm{m/s}$.

The traditional\nalgorithms including the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm and the weighted minimum\nmean square error (WMMSE) algorithm failed to achieve a satisfactory trade-off\nbetween complexity and performance. In this paper, leveraging on the power of\ndeep learning, we propose a low-complexity precoding design framework for\nMU-MIMO systems. The key idea is to transform the MIMO precoding problem into\nthe multiple-input single-output precoding problem, where the optimal precoding\nstructure can be obtained in closed-form. A customized deep neural network is\ndesigned to fit the mapping from the channels to the precoding matrix. In\naddition, the technique of input dimensionality reduction, network pruning, and\nrecovery module compression are used to further improve the computational\nefficiency. Furthermore, the extension to the practical MIMO orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system is studied.

We show that, while for a finite length NW with\nhomogeneous RSOC contacted to two electrodes the sign of its RSOC does not\naffect electron transport, the situation can be quite different in the presence\nof an inhomogeneous RSOC and a magnetic field applied along the NW axis. By\nanalyzing transport across an interface between two regions of different RSOC\nwe find that, if the two regions have equal RSOC signs, the transmission within\nthe magnetic gap energy range is almost perfect, regardless of the ratio of the\nspin-orbit energies to the Zeeman energy. In contrast, when the two regions\nhave opposite RSOC signs and are Rashba-dominated, the transmission gets\nsuppressed. Furthermore, we discuss the implementation on a realistic NW setup\nwhere two RSOC regions are realized with suitably coupled gates separated by a\nfinite distance. We find that the low-temperature NW conductance exhibits a\ncrossover from a short distance behavior that strongly depends on the relative\nRSOC sign of the two regions to a large distance oscillatory behavior that is\nindependent of such relative sign. We are thus able to identify the conditions\nwhere the NW conductance mainly depends on the sign of the RSOC and the ones\nwhere only the RSOC magnitude matters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 09:21:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 06:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

The famous Network Creation\nGame [Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003] enables us to understand such processes,\ntheir dynamics, and their outcomes in the form of equilibrium states. In this\nmodel, agents buy incident edges towards other agents for a price of $\\alpha$\nand simultaneously try to minimize their buying cost and their total hop\ndistance. Since in many real-world networks, e.g., social networks, consent\nfrom both sides is required to maintain a connection, Corbo and Parkes [PODC\n2005] proposed a bilateral version of the Network Creation Game, in which\nmutual consent and payment are required in order to create edges. It is known\nthat the bilateral version has a significantly higher Price of Anarchy,\ncompared to the unilateral version.

We investigate this\nphenomenon by analyzing the Price of Anarchy of the bilateral version with\nrespect to different solution concepts that allow for various degrees of\ncooperation among the agents. With this, we provide insights into what kind of\ncooperation is needed to ensure that socially good networks are created.

Current works mainly use sequence-to-sequence models to solve this\nproblem, either in an autoregressive architecture or a flow-based\nnon-autoregressive architecture. However, these models suffer from several\ndrawbacks: 1) Instead of directly generating audios, they use a two-stage\npipeline that first generates mel-spectrograms and then reconstructs audios\nfrom the spectrograms. This causes cumbersome deployment and degradation of\nspeech quality due to error propagation; 2) The audio reconstruction algorithm\nused by these models limits the inference speed and audio quality, while neural\nvocoders are not available for these models since their output spectrograms are\nnot accurate enough; 3) The autoregressive model suffers from high inference\nlatency, while the flow-based model has high memory occupancy: neither of them\nis efficient enough in both time and memory usage.

From the perspective of\nproduction management, it is important to improve the profitability of an\nenterprise by exploiting the different timing of the selling season in\ndifferent markets to develop an operational strategy that is optimized and\nconfigured on a global scale. This paper examines the above issue with an\ninsightful model of selling the product to two markets (a primary and a\nsecondary market) with multiple risks of changes in the market environment and\nnonoverlapping selling seasons. We refer to this problem as the \"global robust\nnewsvendor\" problem. We provide closed-form solutions of the optimal operation\nstrategy for demand-independent and demand-related scenarios for the above two\nmarket stochastic systems. The closed-form solutions fully reflect the\ninfluence of the relationship between supply and demand on strategy selection.\nWe find that the demand correlation and the lack of demand information will not\nsubstantially affect the operation strategy, and the enterprise's industrial\nchain and supply chain remain stable. However, the reduction of inter-market\ntariffs or logistics costs will cause changes, and the existence of the\nsecondary market will lead to more capacity planning in the primary market.

Here, we propose an entanglement-free scheme of thermometry to\napproach Heisenberg scaling for a wide range of $N$, which has built-in\nrobustness irrespective of the type of noise in question. Our scheme is\namenable to a variety of experimental setups. Moreover, it can be used as a\nbasic building block for promoting previous proposals of thermometry to reach\nHeisenberg scaling, and its applications are not limited to thermometry but can\nbe straightforwardly extended to other metrological tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 10:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

The DR method\nusually falls into feature selection~(FS) and feature projection~(FP). FS\nfocuses on selecting a critical subset of dimensions but risks destroying the\ndata distribution (structure). On the other hand, FP combines all the input\nfeatures into lower dimensions space, aiming to maintain the data structure;\nbut lacks interpretability and sparsity. FS and FP are traditionally\nincompatible categories; thus, they have not been unified into an amicable\nframework. We propose that the ideal DR approach combines both FS and FP into a\nunified end-to-end manifold learning framework, simultaneously performing\nfundamental feature discovery while maintaining the intrinsic relationships\nbetween data samples in the latent space. In this work, we develop a unified\nframework, Unified Dimensional Reduction Neural-network~(UDRN), that integrates\nFS and FP in a compatible, end-to-end way.

Intense agriculture leads to a\nloss in species richness and homogenization of species pools as well as the\nfragmentation of natural habitats and groundwater pollution. Constructed\nwetlands stand as nature-based solutions (NBS) to buffer the degradation of\nwater quality by intercepting the transfer of particles, nutrients and\npesticides between crops and surface waters. In karstic watersheds where\nsinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water\nresource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate\nagricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to\nimprove landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for\nwildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify\noptimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands\nfrom the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling\nat the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine\namphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We\ncombine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at\nthe operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed\nus to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze\nthe effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water\npollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More\ngenerally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve\nmultifunctionality of NBS for pollution mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 11:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

We invited a small group of professional game designers and a larger\ngroup of game design students to participate in a seminal experiment on\nminimalism in game design.

We designed a\ngame that starts with a black pixel and asks players to press a key when the\npixel turns white. This minimal game, almost a Skinner box, captures the\nessential elements of the mechanics of games like \"The Impossible Game,\" which\nasks players to do nothing more than press a key at the right moment. We\npresented this game concept to the professional game designers and challenged\nthem to create other games with the least amount of player interaction and\ndisplayed information.

One of the main issues when establishing a learned\nconstraint arises when we need to set further bounds for its response variable:\nthe fulfillment of these is directly related to the accuracy of the predictive\nmodel and its probabilistic behaviour. In this sense, CCL makes use of\nlinearizable machine learning models to estimate conditional quantiles of the\nlearned variables, providing a data-driven solution for chance constraints.

In\nthe particle picture, entanglement characterizes the deviation of a fermionic\nquantum state from the non-interacting ones, e.g., single Slater determinants.\nIn the mode picture, we recover the notion of subsystems, by referring to the\npartitioning of the orbital/mode that the fermions occupy, which allows us to\nnaturally adopt the formalism of entanglement between distinguishable\nconstituents. Both pictures reveal essential and interconnected aspects of\nfermionic entanglement, and thus offer precise tools for studying electron\nentanglement in highly relevant systems such as atoms and molecules.

It has\nreached the status of consensus solution for task-aware model training in\nremote sensing domain (RSD). Unfortunately, due to different categories of\nimaging data and stiff challenges of data annotation, there is not a large\nenough and uniform remote sensing dataset to support large-scale pretraining in\nRSD. Moreover, pretraining models on large-scale nature scene datasets by\nsupervised learning and then directly fine-tuning on diverse downstream tasks\nseems to be a crude method, which is easily affected by inevitable labeling\nnoise, severe domain gaps and task-aware discrepancies. Thus, in this paper,\nconsidering the self-supervised pretraining and powerful vision transformer\n(ViT) architecture, a concise and effective knowledge transfer learning\nstrategy called ConSecutive PreTraining (CSPT) is proposed based on the idea of\nnot stopping pretraining in natural language processing (NLP), which can\ngradually bridge the domain gap and transfer knowledge from the nature scene\ndomain to the RSD. The proposed CSPT also can release the huge potential of\nunlabeled data for task-aware model training. Finally, extensive experiments\nare carried out on twelve datasets in RSD involving three types of downstream\ntasks (e.g., scene classification, object detection and land cover\nclassification) and two types of imaging data (e.g., optical and SAR).

We further propose a new algorithm called VSR-LKH-3 that combines the\nvariable strategy reinforcement learning method with LKH-3 for typical TSP\nvariants, including the TSP with time windows (TSPTW) and Colored TSP (CTSP).\nThe proposed algorithms replace the inflexible traversal operations in LKH and\nLKH-3 and let the algorithms learn to make a choice at each search step by\nreinforcement learning. Both LKH and LKH-3, with either $\\alpha$-measure or\nPOPMUSIC, can be significantly improved by our methods. Extensive experiments\non 236 widely-used TSP benchmarks with up to 85,900 cities demonstrate the\nexcellent performance of VSR-LKH. VSR-LKH-3 also significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art heuristics for TSPTW and CTSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 13:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 06:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

The advantages of using this format compared to pcap are that\nit contains fewer data, is less privacy intrusive, and is easier to collect and\nprocess. However, having less data does mean that this format might not be able\nto capture important network behaviour as all information is summarised into\nstatistics. Much research aims to overcome this disadvantage through the use of\nmachine learning, for instance, to detect attacks within a network. Many\napproaches can be used to pre-process the NetFlow data before it is used to\ntrain the machine learning algorithms. However, many of these approaches simply\napply existing methods to the data, not considering the specific properties of\nnetwork data. We argue that for data originating from software systems, such as\nNetFlow or software logs, similarities in frequency and contexts of feature\nvalues are more important than similarities in the value itself. In this work,\nwe, therefore, propose an encoding algorithm that directly takes the frequency\nand the context of the feature values into account when the data is being\nprocessed. Different types of network behaviours can be clustered using this\nencoding, thus aiding the process of detecting anomalies within the network.\nFrom windows of these clusters obtained from monitoring a clean system, we\nlearn state machine behavioural models for anomaly detection.

Among them, Trojan attacks are the hardest to\ndefend against. In this paper, we first introduce a variation of the Badnet\nkind of attacks that introduces Trojan backdoors to multiple target classes and\nallows triggers to be placed anywhere in the image. The former makes it more\npotent and the latter makes it extremely easy to carry out the attack in the\nphysical space. The state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods fail with this\nthreat model. To defend against this attack, we first introduce a trigger\nreverse-engineering mechanism that uses multiple images to recover a variety of\npotential triggers. We then propose a detection mechanism by measuring the\ntransferability of such recovered triggers.

We also model the\ncombined PSP and Helios data, using empirical Parker-like models for which the\nsolar wind undergoes an \"iso-poly\" expansion: isothermal in the corona, then\npolytropic at distances larger than the sonic point radius. The polytropic\nindices are derived from the observed temperature and density gradients. Our\nmodelling reveals that the electron thermal pressure has a major contribution\nin the acceleration process of slow and intermediate winds (in the range of\n300-500 km/s at 1 au), over a broad range of distances and that the global\n(electron and protons) thermal energy, alone, is able to explain the\nacceleration profiles. Moreover, we show that the very slow solar wind requires\nin addition to the observed pressure gradients, another source of acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 13:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The emerging light rays are processed by considering that the\nretardation of each ray carries the cumulative effect of traversing the\ncontact-induced axisymmetric stress field.

Predictions are generally accurate, with differences between\npredicted and literature binding energies values of less than $\\pm$20\\%.

SE uses a content-aware reassembly of\nfeatures block (CARAFEB) to generate an extra pyramid bottom-level to boost\nsmall ship performance, a feature balance operation (FBO) to improve scale\nfeature description, and a global context block (GCB) to refine features.\nExperimental results on two public SSDD and HRSID datasets reveal that\nMAI-SE-Net outperforms the other nine competitive models, better than the\nsuboptimal model by 4.7% detec-tion AP and 3.4% segmentation AP on SSDD and by\n3.0% detection AP and 2.4% segmentation AP on HRSID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 14:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Lean conditions are established at an\nequivalence ratio of 0.7. Detailed-chemistry, one-dimensional simulations are\nperformed on a reactants-to-products counter-flow configuration with an applied\nstrain rate ranging from $a=100 \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$ to $a=10000 \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$\nand the \\texttt{GRI3.0} mechanism. Following a similar setup, two-dimensional\ndirect numerical simulations are also conducted for representative strain rates\nof $2000 \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$ and $5000 \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$. Both solutions show a\ndecreasing NO$_{\\rm x}$ trend as the applied strain rate is increased. This\ndecreasing emission outcome is highlighted for the first time in this study for\nlean pure-hydrogen flamelets. A deep analysis of the 2D solution underlines\nthat there is no production of NO$_{\\rm x}$ in the second dimension, thus\nproving that the emission trend is not a result of a setup preconditioning, but\nis instead a direct physical effect of stretch on the flame. Furthermore, a\ndetailed analysis of the NO$_{\\rm x}$ formation pathways at $a=2000 \\, {\\rm\ns}^{-1}$ and $a=5000 \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$ is performed. Thermal NO$_{\\rm x}$ and\nNNH pathways are shown to both contribute significantly to the total NO$_{\\rm\nx}$ production. While the NNH route contribution is roughly constant at\ndifferent strain rates, a significant decrease is observed along the thermal\nNO$_{\\rm x}$ route. Overall, results show that lean and highly-strained\nhydrogen flames experience a significant decrease of NO$_{\\rm x}$. This\nproperty is discussed and analysed in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 14:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

We determine conditions on\nwhich submanifolds can arise, in terms of Stiefel-Whitney classes and other\nproperties. We then consider the random submanifolds that arise from randomly\ncoloring the vertices. Since this model generates submanifolds, it allows for\nstudying properties and using tools that are not available in processes that\nproduce general random subcomplexes. The case of 3 colors in a triangulated\n3-ball gives rise to random knots and links. In this setting, we answer a\nquestion raised by de Crouy-Chanel and Simon (2019), showing that the\nprobability of generating an unknot decays exponentially. In the general case\nof k colors in d-dimensional manifolds, we investigate the random submanifolds\nof different codimensions, as the number of vertices in the triangulation\ngrows. We compute the expected Euler characteristic, and discuss relations to\nhomological percolation and other topological properties. Finally, we explore a\nmethod to search for solutions to topological problems by generating random\nsubmanifolds. We describe computer experiments that search for a low-genus\nsurface in the 4-dimensional ball whose boundary is a given knot in the\n3-dimensional sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 14:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 11:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Despite the extensive literature on offline CPD, unsupervised online\nCPD still suffers from major challenges, including scalability, hyperparameter\ntuning, and learning constraints. To mitigate some of these challenges, in this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for unsupervised online CPD\nfrom multi-dimensional time series, named Adaptive LSTM-Autoencoder\nChange-Point Detection (ALACPD). ALACPD exploits an LSTM-autoencoder-based\nneural network to perform unsupervised online CPD. It continuously adapts to\nthe incoming samples without keeping the previously received input, thus being\nmemory-free. We perform an extensive evaluation on several real-world time\nseries CPD benchmarks. We show that ALACPD, on average, ranks first among\nstate-of-the-art CPD algorithms in terms of quality of the time series\nsegmentation, and it is on par with the best performer in terms of the accuracy\nof the estimated change-points.

The use of unsupervised models to overcome the lack of\nlabels often fails to catch domain specific anomalies as they rely on general\ndefinitions of outlier. This paper suggests a new active learning based\napproach, ALIF, to solve this problem by reducing the number of required labels\nand tuning the detector towards the definition of anomaly provided by the user.\nThe proposed approach is particularly appealing in the presence of a Decision\nSupport System (DSS), a case that is increasingly popular in real-world\nscenarios. While it is common that DSS embedded with anomaly detection\ncapabilities rely on unsupervised models, they don't have a way to improve\ntheir performance: ALIF is able to enhance the capabilities of DSS by\nexploiting the user feedback during common operations.

SANs can thus\nreduce routing costs for frequently communicating node pairs by paying a cost\nfor adjusting the embedding. This is particularly beneficial when the demand\nhas structure, which the network can adapt to. Demand can be represented in the\nform of a demand graph, which is defined by the set of network nodes (vertices)\nand the set of pairwise communication requests (edges). Thus, adapting to the\ndemand can be interpreted by embedding the demand graph to the network\ntopology. This can be challenging both when the demand graph is known in\nadvance (offline) and when it revealed edge-by-edge (online). The difficulty\nalso depends on whether we aim at constructing a static topology or a dynamic\n(self-adjusting) one that improves the embedding as more parts of the demand\ngraph are revealed. Yet very little is known about these self-adjusting\nembeddings.\n  In this paper, the network topology is restricted to a line and the demand\ngraph to a ladder graph, i.e., a $2^n$ grid, including all possible subgraphs\nof the ladder. We present an online self-adjusting network that matches the\nknown lower bound asymptotically and is $12$-competitive in terms of request\ncost. As a warm up result, we present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for\nthe cycle demand graph. We also present an oracle-based algorithm for an\narbitrary demand graph that has a constant overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 15:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

This leads\nto dynamically simpler modulation equations posed in the blown-up space, via a\nformal procedure which directly extends the established approach to the\ntime-dependent setting. The modulation equations take the form of\nnon-autonomous Ginzburg-Landau equations, which can be analysed within the\nblow-up. The asymptotics of solutions in weighted Sobelev spaces are given in\ntwo different cases: (i) A symmetric case featuring a delayed loss of\nstability, and (ii) A second case in which the symmetry is broken by a source\nterm. In order to characterise the dynamics of the Swift-Hohenberg equation\nitself we derive rigorous estimates on the error of the dynamic modulation\napproximation. These estimates are obtained by bounding weak solutions to an\nevolution equation for the error which is also posed in the blown-up space.\nUsing the error estimates obtained, we are able to infer the asymptotics of a\nlarge class of solutions to the dynamic Swift-Hohenberg equation. We provide\nrigorous asymptotics for solutions in both cases (i) and (ii). We also prove\nthe existence of the delayed loss of stability in the symmetric case (i), and\nprovide a lower bound for the delay time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 15:34:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 15:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Such resonance phenomena in biological systems are typically\nexplained by one of two mechanisms: either a classical linear resonance of\nharmonic oscillator, or entrainment and phase locking of nonlinear limit cycle\noscillators subjected to periodic forcing. Here, we discover a nonlinear\nmechanism, which does not require intrinsic oscillations. Instead, the resonant\nfrequency dependence arises from coupling between an excitable and a monostable\nregion of the medium. This composite system is endowed with emergent\nbistability between a stable steady state and stable spatiotemporal\noscillations. The resonant transition from stable state to oscillatory state is\ninduced by waves of particular frequency travelling through the medium. This\ntransition to the spatiotemporal oscillatory state requires accumulation of\nmultiple waves, resulting in the exclusion of lower frequencies. The cutting\noff of high frequencies is realized by damping of wave amplitude in the\nmonostable zone and then by activating amplitude sensitive dynamics in the\nmonostable units. We demonstrate this new resonance mechanism in a simplistic\nreaction-diffusion model. Also, we reveal this collective resonance mechanism\nin in-vitro experiments and detailed biophysical simulations representing a\nmajor type of arrhythmia. We further demonstrate, both experimentally and\ntheoretically, that the ongoing spatiotemporal oscillations, such as ectopic\nactivity in cardiac tissue, can be stopped by travelling waves of high\nfrequency. Overall, we claim the universality of this resonance mechanism in a\nbroad class of nonlinear biophysical systems. Specifically, we hypothesize that\nsuch phenomena could be found in neuronal systems as an alternative to\ntraditional resonant processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 15:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Multi-omics data\nintegration is attracting widespread interest in cancer research for providing\ninformation for understanding cancer progression at multiple genetic levels.\nMany works, however, are limited because of the high dimensionality and\nheterogeneity of multi-omics data. In this paper, we propose a novel method to\nintegrate multi-omics data for cancer survival prediction, called Stacked\nAutoEncoder-based Survival Prediction Neural Network (SAEsurv-net). In the\ncancer survival prediction for TCGA cases, SAEsurv-net addresses the curse of\ndimensionality with a two-stage dimensionality reduction strategy and handles\nmulti-omics heterogeneity with a stacked autoencoder model. The two-stage\ndimensionality reduction strategy achieves a balance between computation\ncomplexity and information exploiting. The stacked autoencoder model removes\nmost heterogeneities such as data's type and size in the first group of\nautoencoders, and integrates multiple omics data in the second autoencoder.

The GCA model consists of a collection of cells which\nchange their states depending on the states of their neighbors, like in the\nclassical CA model. In generalization of the CA model, the neighbors are no\nlonger fixed and local, they are variable and global. In the basic GCA model, a\ncell is structured into a data part and a pointer part. The pointer part\nconsists of several pointers that hold addresses to global neighbors. The data\nrule defines the new data state, and the pointer rule define the new pointer\nstates. The cell's state is synchronously or asynchronously updated using the\nnew data and new pointer states. Thereby the global neighbors can be changed\nfrom generation to generation. Similar to the CA model, only the own cell's\nstate is modified. Thereby write conflicts cannot occur, all cells can work in\nparallel which makes it a massively parallel model. The GCA model is related to\nthe CROW (concurrent read owners write) model, a specific PRAM (parallel random\naccess machine) model. Therefore many of the well-studied PRAM algorithms can\nbe transformed into GCA algorithms. Moreover, the GCA model allows to describe\na large number of data parallel applications in a suitable way.

This sharing can be facilitated through a\nvariety of processes, including those not observable to the user's browser. The\nunobservability of these processes limits the ability of researchers and\nauditors seeking to verify compliance with regulations which require complete\ndisclosure of data sharing partners. Unfortunately, the applicability of\nexisting techniques to make inferences about unobservable data sharing\nrelationships is limited due to their dependence on protocol- or case-specific\nartifacts of the online behavioral advertising ecosystem (e.g., they work only\nwhen client-side header bidding is used for ad delivery or when advertisers\nperform ad retargeting). As behavioral advertising technologies continue to\nevolve rapidly, the availability of these artifacts and the effectiveness of\ntransparency solutions dependent on them remain ephemeral. In this paper, we\npropose a generalizable technique, called ATOM, to infer data sharing\nrelationships between online trackers and advertisers. ATOM is different from\nprior work in that it is universally applicable -- i.e., independent of ad\ndelivery protocols or availability of artifacts. ATOM leverages the insight\nthat by the very nature of behavioral advertising, ad creatives themselves can\nbe used to infer data sharing between trackers and advertisers -- after all,\nthe topics and brands showcased in an ad are dependent on the data available to\nthe advertiser. Therefore, by selectively blocking trackers and monitoring\nchanges in the characteristics of ads delivered by advertisers, ATOM is able to\nidentify data sharing relationships between trackers and advertisers. The\nrelationships discovered by our implementation of ATOM include those not found\nusing prior approaches and are validated by external sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 04:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Most existing TTA methods adapt the trained classifier using the\nclassifier's prediction on the test data as pseudo-label. However, under\ntest-time domain shift, accuracy of the pseudo labels cannot be guaranteed, and\nthus the TTA methods often encounter performance degradation at the adapted\nclassifier. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel test-time\nadaptation method, called Test-time Adaptation via Self-Training with nearest\nneighbor information (TAST), which is composed of the following procedures: (1)\nadds trainable adaptation modules on top of the trained feature extractor; (2)\nnewly defines a pseudo-label distribution for the test data by using the\nnearest neighbor information; (3) trains these modules only a few times during\ntest time to match the nearest neighbor-based pseudo label distribution and a\nprototype-based class distribution for the test data; and (4) predicts the\nlabel of test data using the average predicted class distribution from these\nmodules. The pseudo-label generation is based on the basic intuition that a\ntest data and its nearest neighbor in the embedding space are likely to share\nthe same label under the domain shift. By utilizing multiple randomly\ninitialized adaptation modules, TAST extracts useful information for the\nclassification of the test data under the domain shift, using the nearest\nneighbor information. TAST showed better performance than the state-of-the-art\nTTA methods on two standard benchmark tasks, domain generalization, namely\nVLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita, and image corruption, particularly\nCIFAR-10/100C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 05:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 03:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Nonetheless, viewing deep\nlearning as a dynamical system allows the use of established theories to\ninvestigate the behaviour of deep neural networks. In order to study the\nstability of the training process, in this article, we formulate training of\ndeep neural networks as a hydrodynamics system, which has a multisymplectic\nstructure. For that, the deep neural network is modelled using a stochastic\ndifferential equation and, thereby, mean-field type control is used to train\nit. The necessary conditions for optimality of the mean--field type control\nreduce to a system of Euler-Poincare equations, which has the a similar\ngeometric structure to that of compressible fluids. The mean-field type control\nis solved numerically using a multisymplectic numerical scheme that takes\nadvantage of the underlying geometry. Moreover, the numerical scheme, yields an\napproximated solution which is also an exact solution of a hydrodynamics system\nwith a multisymplectic structure and it can be analysed using backward error\nanalysis.

These closure models are common in many nonlinear\nspatiotemporal systems to account for losses due to reduced order\nrepresentations, including many transport phenomena in fluids. Previous\ndata-driven closure modeling efforts have mostly focused on supervised learning\napproaches using high fidelity simulation data. On the other hand,\nreinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful yet relatively uncharted method in\nspatiotemporally extended systems. In this study, we put forth a modular\ndynamic closure modeling and discovery framework to stabilize the Galerkin\nprojection based reduced order models that may arise in many nonlinear\nspatiotemporal dynamical systems with quadratic nonlinearity.

In math classrooms, teachers might \"funnel\" students towards a\nnormative answer or \"focus\" students to reflect on their own thinking,\ndeepening their understanding of math concepts. When teachers focus, they treat\nstudents' contributions as resources for collective sensemaking, and thereby\nsignificantly improve students' achievement and confidence in mathematics. We\npropose the task of computationally detecting funneling and focusing questions\nin classroom discourse. We do so by creating and releasing an annotated dataset\nof 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling and focusing questions, or\nneither. We introduce supervised and unsupervised approaches to differentiating\nthese questions. Our best model, a supervised RoBERTa model fine-tuned on our\ndataset, has a strong linear correlation of .76 with human expert labels and\nwith positive educational outcomes, including math instruction quality and\nstudent achievement, showing the model's potential for use in automated teacher\nfeedback tools. Our unsupervised measures show significant but weaker\ncorrelations with human labels and outcomes, and they highlight interesting\nlinguistic patterns of funneling and focusing questions. The high performance\nof the supervised measure indicates its promise for supporting teachers in\ntheir instruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 01:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

The organismal phenotype is a topologically complex structure\nthat interacts with a genotype, developmental physics, and an informational\nenvironment. Using this observation as inspiration, we utilize a type of\nembodied agent that exhibits layered representational capacity: meta-brain\nmodels. Meta-brains are used to demonstrate how phenotypes process information\nand exhibit self-regulation from development to maturity. We focus on two\ncandidate structures that potentially explain this capacity: folding and\nlayering. As layering and folding can be observed in a host of biological\ncontexts, they form the basis for our representational investigations. First,\nan innate starting point (genomic encoding) is described. The generative output\nof this encoding is a differentiation tree, which results in a layered\nphenotypic representation. Then we specify a formal meta-brain model of the\ngut, which exhibits folding and layering in development in addition to\ndifferent degrees of representation of processed information. This organ\ntopology is retained in maturity, with the potential for additional folding and\nrepresentational drift in response to inflammation. Next, we consider\ntopological remapping using the developmental Braitenberg Vehicle (dBV) as a\ntoy model. During topological remapping, it is shown that folding of a layered\nneural network can introduce a number of distortions to the original model,\nsome with functional implications. The paper concludes with a discussion on how\nthe meta-brains method can assist us in the investigation of enactivism,\nholism, and cognitive processing in the context of biological simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 21:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}
