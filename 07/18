This\nlimits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where\nOOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via\nexploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature\nspace, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast,\nthis paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD\ndetection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being\nout-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features\nextracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD\nalgorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways,\nactually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features.\nThus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired\nimage features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise\nOOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of\nthe proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical\nin real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\\%$ to\n$12.30\\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD\ndetector. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the efficacy\nof ETLT for OOD detection task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 16:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, the rate of decline of smoking\nprevalence is slowing down. Therefore, there is a need for models that capture\nthe full complexity of the smoking epidemic. These models can then be used as\ntest-beds to develop new policies to limit the spread of smoking. Current\nmodels of smoking dynamics mainly use ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nmodels, where studying the effect of an individual's contact network is\nchallenging. They also do not consider all the interactions between individuals\nthat can lead to changes in smoking behaviour, implying that they do not\nconsider valuable information on the spread of smoking behaviour.\n  In this context, we develop an agent-based model (ABM), calibrate and then\nvalidate it on historical trends observed in the US and UK. Our ABM considers\nspontaneous terms, interactions between agents, and the agent's contact\nnetwork. To explore the effect of the underlying network on smoking dynamics,\nwe test the ABM on six different networks, both synthetic and real-world. In\naddition, we also compare the ABM with an ODE model. Our results suggest that\nthe dynamics from the ODE model are similar to the ABM only when the network\nstructure is fully connected (FC). The FC network performs poorly in\nreplicating the empirical trends in the data, while the real-world network best\nreplicates it amongst the six networks. Further, when information on the\nreal-world network is unavailable, our ABM on Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi\nbenchmark networks (or networks with a similar average degree as the real-world\nnetwork) can be used to model smoking behaviour. These results suggest that\nnetworks are essential for modelling smoking behaviour and that our ABM can be\nused to develop network-based intervention strategies and policies for tobacco\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 18:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods\nrely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch\nlevel. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because\ntiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations\nbetween these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally\nsupervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the\nentire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a\npre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally\nusing an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction\nunit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the\nperformance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly\navailable WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority\nof our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times\nfaster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires\nas little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

The phase\nspace dynamics of the quantum field modes are mapped to curves in a\n2-dimensional hyperbolic metric space, in which distances between neighbor\npoints are shown to be proportional to the Bogoliubov coefficients associated\nwith their corresponding mode solutions in phase space. The vacuum state for\neach mode is then defined as the unique trajectory from which all mapped phase\nspace solutions move within thin annular regions around it. This property\nimplies the stability of the vacuum state: solutions evolved from a point in\nthis trajectory stay close to it as both evolve, and the particle creation is\ntherefore minimized. The new approach is applied to the well-known cases of the\ntime-independent dynamics, where the solutions draw circles around this curve,\nand when the adiabatic approximation is valid. The analysis is then extended to\ntime-dependent cases in which the adiabatic approximation is not applicable, in\nthe super-Hubble or low-frequency regimes. It is shown that stability\ntrajectories can also be found in these situations, and stable quantum vacua\ncan be obtained. This new formalism is applied to two situations: de Sitter\nspace, where the Bunch-Davies vacuum is obtained in a completely different\nmanner through an analysis in the super-Hubble regime, and in the context of\ncosmological bouncing models, in which the contracting phase is dominated by a\ncosmological constant in the asymptotic past. A new vacuum state for\ncosmological perturbations is proposed in this situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 19:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Here we propose to use the mechanism of the echo\nphenomenon previously observed in hadron accelerators, free-electron lasers,\nand laser-excited molecules to overcome the destructive thermal effects and\nachieve efficient field-free molecular orientation at high temperatures. In our\nscheme, a linearly polarized short laser pulse transforms a broad thermal\ndistribution in the molecular rotational phase space into many separated narrow\nfilaments due to the nonlinear phase mixing during the post-pulse free\nevolution. Molecular subgroups belonging to individual filaments have\nmuch-reduced dispersion of angular velocities. They are rotationally cold, and\na subsequent moderate terahertz (THz) pulse can easily orient them. The overall\nenhanced orientation of the molecular gas is achieved with some delay, in the\ncourse of the echo process combining the contributions of different filaments.\nOur results demonstrate that the echo-enhanced orientation is an order of\nmagnitude higher than that of the THz pulse alone. The mechanism is robust --\nit applies to different types of molecules, and the degree of orientation is\nrelatively insensitive to the temperature. The laser and THz pulses used in the\nscheme are readily available, allowing quick experimental demonstration and\ntesting in various applications. Breaking the phase space to individual\nfilaments to overcome hindering thermal conditions may find a wide range of\napplications beyond molecular orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 19:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Then one first removes the\nUV cutoff using renormalisation techniques applied to families of CQFT's\nlabelled by finite UV resolutions and then takes the thermodynamic limit.\nAlternatively, one may try to work directly without IR cut-off.\n  More recently, wavelets have been proposed to define the renormalisation flow\nof CQFT's which is natural as they come accompanied with a multi-resolution\nanalysis (MRA). However, wavelets so far have been mostly studied in the\nnon-compact case. Practically useful wavelets that display compact support and\nsome degree of smoothness can be constructed on the real line using Fourier\nspace techniques but explicit formulae as functions of position are rarely\navailable. Compactly supported wavelets can be periodised by summing over\nperiod translates keeping orthogonality properties but still yield to rather\ncomplicated expressions which generically lose their smoothness and position\nlocality properties.\n  It transpires that a direct approach to wavelets in the compact case is\ndesirable.

These generalised wavelets\nare smooth, are simple explicitly computable functions, display quasi-local\nproperties close to the Haar wavelet and have compact momentum supprt.\nAccordingly they have a built-in cut-off both in position and momentum, making\nthem very useful for renormalisation applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 21:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

In particular the induced metric on Cauchy surfaces\nmust be nowhere degenerate. It is only under this assumption that one can\nderive the hypersurace deformation algebra between the initial value\nconstraints which is absolutely transparent from the fact that the {\\it\ninverse} of the induced metric is needed to close the algebra. This statement\nis independent of the density weight that one may want to equip the spatial\nmetric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation\nof the hypersurface defomation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the\nissue of non-degenracy of the induced metric that is needed in the classical\ntheory. In the Hilbert space representation employed in Loop Quantum Gravity\n(LQG) most emphasis has been layed to define an inverse metric operator on the\ndense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum\ngeometries which are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that\ndemonstration of closure of the constraint algebra on this domain meets\ndifficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically\nforbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical\nhypersurface deformation algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue\nsuch as non-standard operator topologies, dual spaces (habitats) and density\nweights have been propposed to address this issue with respect to the quantum\ndynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that\ninsisting on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG\nrepresentation may provide a natural resolution of the issue thereby possibly\navoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 21:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, only quite complicated algorithms are known for finding\na so-called shrunk subspace, which acts as a dual certificate for the value of\nthe noncommutative rank. In particular, the operator Sinkhorn algorithm,\nperhaps the simplest algorithm to compute the noncommutative rank with operator\nscaling, does not find a shrunk subspace. Finding a shrunk subspace plays a key\nrole in applications, such as separation in the Brascamp-Lieb polytope,\none-parameter subgroups in the null-cone membership problem, and primal-dual\nalgorithms for matroid intersection and fractional matroid matching.\n  In this paper, we provide a simple Sinkhorn-style algorithm to find the\nsmallest shrunk subspace over the complex field in deterministic polynomial\ntime. To this end, we introduce a generalization of the operator scaling\nproblem, where the spectra of the marginals must be majorized by specified\nvectors. Then we design an efficient Sinkhorn-style algorithm for the\ngeneralized operator scaling problem. Applying this to the shrunk subspace\nproblem, we show that a sufficiently long run of the algorithm also finds an\napproximate shrunk subspace close to the minimum exact shrunk subspace.\nFinally, we show that the approximate shrunk subspace can be rounded if it is\nsufficiently close. Along the way, we also provide a simple randomized\nalgorithm to find the smallest shrunk subspace.\n  As applications, we design a faster algorithm for fractional linear matroid\nmatching and efficient weak membership and optimization algorithms for the\nrank-2 Brascamp-Lieb polytope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 22:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on\nencoder-decoder architecture have achieved tremendous success in various defect\ndetection tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution, they\ncommonly exhibit a limitation in explicitly modeling long-range interactions,\ncritical for pixel-wise defect detection in complex cases, e.g., cluttered\nbackground and illegible pseudo-defects. Recent transformers are especially\nskilled at learning global image dependencies but with limited local structural\ninformation necessary for detailed defect location. To overcome the above\nlimitations, we propose an efficient hybrid transformer architecture, termed\nDefect Transformer (DefT), for surface defect detection, which incorporates CNN\nand transformer into a unified model to capture local and non-local\nrelationships collaboratively. Specifically, in the encoder module, a\nconvolutional stem block is firstly adopted to retain more detailed spatial\ninformation. Then, the patch aggregation blocks are used to generate\nmulti-scale representation with four hierarchies, each of them is followed by a\nseries of DefT blocks, which respectively include a locally position-aware\nblock for local position encoding, a lightweight multi-pooling self-attention\nto model multi-scale global contextual relationships with good computational\nefficiency, and a convolutional feed-forward network for feature transformation\nand further location information learning. Finally, a simple but effective\ndecoder module is proposed to gradually recover spatial details from the skip\nconnections in the encoder.

To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel generalized linear model to analyze such that\nusing a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distributed error structure. Using a novel link\nfunction that relies on the transformation between Cartesian and spherical\ncoordinates, we regress the vMF distributed principal diffusion directions on\nthe subject's covariates. This regression model allows us to measure the\nimportance of the clinical factors on fiber orientations. Furthermore, we\nimpose the spatial dependence to be supported along a given fiber using an\nautoregressive model. This novel specification renders computational efficiency\nand flexibility. For Bayesian inference of the directional data, a\ncomprehensive toolbox is thoroughly developed with applications to neuroimaging\nanalysis. We first show the method's empirical efficacy through simulation\nexperiments. Subsequently, applying our regression model to the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we acquire new insights related to\nthe progression of cognitive impairment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 15:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

When a\ncontinuous response variable is measured repeatedly for a subject or the\ncontinuous responses arise from clusters, it is more challenging to model the\ncontinuous response data due to correlation within clusters. We extend a widely\nused ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), to fit\nclustered continuous response variables based on generalized estimating\nequation (GEE) methods for ordinal responses. With our approach, estimates of\nmarginal parameters, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), expectations,\nand quantiles conditional on covariates can be obtained without\npre-transformation of the potentially skewed continuous response data.\nComputational challenges arise with large numbers of distinct values of the\ncontinuous response variable, and we propose two feasible and computationally\nefficient approaches to fit CPMs for clustered continuous response variables\nwith different working correlation structures.

However, the concerns that they can be biased against specific\ndemographic groups hinder their adoption in high-stake applications. Thus, it\nis essential to ensure fairness in machine learning models. Most previous\nefforts require direct access to sensitive attributes for mitigating bias.\nNonetheless, it is often infeasible to obtain large-scale users' sensitive\nattributes considering users' concerns about privacy in the data collection\nprocess. Privacy mechanisms such as local differential privacy (LDP) are widely\nenforced on sensitive information in the data collection stage due to legal\ncompliance and people's increasing awareness of privacy.

Then, it jointly models the corrected and clean\ndata in an adversarial way for debiasing and prediction.

However, additional\ningredients such as anharmonicity and forces that can not be derived from a\npotential energy may generate a different scaling behavior at depinning. The\nmost experimentally relevant is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) term,\nproportional to the square of the slope at each site, which drives the critical\nbehavior into the so-called quenched KPZ (qKPZ) universality class. We study\nthis universality class both numerically and analytically: by using exact\nmappings we show that at least for $d=1,2$ this class encompasses not only the\nqKPZ equation itself, but also anharmonic depinning and a well-known class of\ncellular automata introduced by Tang and Leschhorn. We develop scaling\narguments for all critical exponents, including size and duration of\navalanches. The scale is set by the confining potential strength $m^2$. This\nallows us to estimate numerically these exponents as well as the $m$-dependent\neffective force correlator $\\Delta(w)$, and its correlation length $\\rho:=\n\\Delta(0)/|\\Delta'(0^+)|$.

However, they embed the complete transform, including the color\ncomponent-independent and the component-correlated parts, into only a single\ntype of LUTs, either 1D or 3D, in a coupled manner. This scheme raises a\ndilemma of improving model expressiveness or efficiency due to two factors. On\nthe one hand, the 1D LUTs provide high computational efficiency but lack the\ncritical capability of color components interaction. On the other, the 3D LUTs\npresent enhanced component-correlated transform capability but suffer from\nheavy memory footprint, high training difficulty, and limited cell utilization.\nInspired by the conventional divide-and-conquer practice in the image signal\nprocessor, we present SepLUT (separable image-adaptive lookup table) to tackle\nthe above limitations.

In this way, the capabilities of\ntwo sub-transforms can facilitate each other, where the 3D LUT complements the\nability to mix up color components, and the 1D LUT redistributes the input\ncolors to increase the cell utilization of the 3D LUT and thus enable the use\nof a more lightweight 3D LUT.

The representation of\nknowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is\ngenerally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features\ndirectly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge\ndistillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image\nsuper-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the\nteachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via\nknowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order\nto improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students'\nrequirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate\noutputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the\ncorrelation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the\ntexture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features\nto be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the\ndistillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the\nrecovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are\noptimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and\nthe student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of\nthe student. Experiments conducted on various single image super-resolution\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing defined\nknowledge representation related distillation methods, and can help\nsuper-resolution algorithms achieve better reconstruction quality without\nintroducing any inference complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Compared to spin defects in bulk\ncrystals, VB- preserves its spin coherence properties when placed at\nnanometer-scale distances from the hBN surface, enabling nanometer-scale\nquantum sensing. On the other hand, the low quantum efficiency of VB- has\nhindered its use in practical applications. Several studies have reported\nimproving the overall quantum efficiency of VB- defects using plasmonic\neffects; however, the overall enhancements of up to 17 times reported to date\nare relatively modest. In this study, we explore and demonstrate much higher\nemission enhancements of VB- with ultralow-loss nano-patch antenna (NPA)\nstructures. An overall intensity enhancement of up to 250 times is observed for\nNPA-coupled VB- defects.

Nevertheless, causality analysis is\npractically challenging, particularly due to limited observability. Recently,\nchaos engineering has been applied to test complex real-world software systems.\nChaos frameworks like Chaos Mesh mutate a set of chaos variables to inject\ncatastrophic events (e.g., network slowdowns) to \"stress\" software systems. The\nsystems under chaos stress are then tested using methods like differential\ntesting to check if they retain their normal functionality (e.g., SQL query\noutput is always correct under stress). Despite its ubiquity in the industry,\nchaos engineering is now employed mostly to aid software testing rather for\nperformance debugging.\n  This paper identifies novel usage of chaos engineering on helping developers\ndiagnose performance anomalies in databases. Our presented framework, PERFCE,\ncomprises an offline phase and an online phase. The offline phase learns the\nstatistical models of the target database system, whilst the online phase\ndiagnoses the root cause of monitored performance anomalies on the fly. During\nthe offline phase, PERFCE leverages both passive observations and proactive\nchaos experiments to constitute accurate causal graphs and structural equation\nmodels (SEMs). When observing performance anomalies during the online phase,\ncausal graphs enable qualitative root cause identification (e.g., high CPU\nusage) and SEMs enable quantitative counterfactual analysis (e.g., determining\n\"when CPU usage is reduced to 45\\%, performance returns to normal\").

A current proposal for combating\ndeletions in racetrack memories is to use redundant heads per-track resulting\nin multiple copies (potentially erroneous) and recovering the data by solving a\nspecialized version of a sequence reconstruction problem. Using this approach,\n$k$-deletion correcting codes of length $n$, with $d \\ge 2$ heads per-track,\nwith redundancy $\\log \\log n + 4$ were constructed. However, the known approach\nrequires that $k \\le d$, namely, that the number of heads ($d$) is larger than\nor equal to the number of correctable deletions ($k$). Here we address the\nquestion: What is the best redundancy that can be achieved for a $k$-deletion\ncode ($k$ is a constant) if the number of heads is fixed at $d$ (due to\nimplementation constraints)? One of our key results is an answer to this\nquestion, namely, we construct codes that can correct $k$ deletions, for any\n$k$ beyond the known limit of $d$. The code has $4k \\log \\log n+o(\\log \\log n)$\nredundancy for $k \\le 2d-1$. In addition, when $k \\ge 2d$, our codes have $2\n\\lfloor k/d\\rfloor \\log n+o(\\log n)$ redundancy, that we prove it is order-wise\noptimal, specifically, we prove that the redundancy required for correcting $k$\ndeletions is at least $\\lfloor k/d\\rfloor \\log n+o(\\log n)$. The\nencoding/decoding complexity of our codes is $O(n\\log^{2k}n)$. Finally, we ask\na general question: What is the optimal redundancy for codes correcting a\ncombination of at most $k$ deletions and insertions in a $d$-head racetrack\nmemory? We prove that the redundancy sufficient to correct a combination of $k$\ndeletion and insertion errors is similar to the case of $k$ deletion errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 04:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is\nalso designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the\ncloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on\nthe visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly,\nthese two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted\nfor cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this\nmethod can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and\nPRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 05:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

This fact seems to restrict the extension of the\ntopological treatment to the timelike circular orbit. In this paper, we confirm\nthat the angular momentum does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the\nconstructed vector with its zero points denoting the equatorial timelike\ncircular orbits. As a result, a well-behaved topology to characterize the\nequatorial timelike circular orbits can be constructed. Our study shows that\nthe total topological number of the timelike circular orbits vanishes for a\ngeneric black hole, which is dependent of the energy of the particle.\nSignificantly, it reveals that if there the timelike circular orbits exist,\nthey always come in pairs for fixed angular momentum. Meanwhile, the stable and\nunstable timelike circular orbits have positive or negative winding number. Of\nparticular interest is that the marginally stable circular orbit corresponds to\nthe bifurcation point of the zero point of the constructed vector. Moreover, we\nalso examine the case when the particle energy acts as the control parameter.\nIt is shown that there will be topological phase transition when the value of\nthe particle energy is one. Below this value, the timelike circular orbits\nalways come in pairs for fixed energy. Otherwise, we will have one more\nunstable timelike circular orbit. We further apply the treatment to the Kerr\nblack hole. All the results given in a generic black hole background are\nexactly reproduced.

Our\ncontributions are three-fold: 1) CoText simultaneously address the three tasks\n(e.g., text detection, tracking, recognition) in a real-time end-to-end\ntrainable framework. 2) With contrastive learning, CoText models long-range\ndependencies and learning temporal information across multiple frames. 3) A\nsimple, lightweight architecture is designed for effective and accurate\nperformance, including GPU-parallel detection post-processing, CTC-based\nrecognition head with Masked RoI. Extensive experiments show the superiority of\nour method. Especially, CoText achieves an video text spotting IDF1 of 72.0% at\n41.0 FPS on ICDAR2015video, with 10.5% and 32.0 FPS improvement the previous\nbest method. The code can be found at github.com/weijiawu/CoText.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 12:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 05:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

Despite vast efforts since the seminal work of Lawson and\nHanson in the '70s, the non-negativity assumption is still an obstacle for the\ntheoretical analysis and scalability of many off-the-shelf solvers. In the\ndifferent context of deep neural networks, we recently started to see that the\ntraining of overparametrized models via gradient descent leads to surprising\ngeneralization properties and the retrieval of regularized solutions. In this\npaper, we prove that, by using an overparametrized formulation, NNLS solutions\ncan reliably be approximated via vanilla gradient flow. We furthermore\nestablish stability of the method against negative perturbations of the\nground-truth. Our simulations confirm that this allows the use of vanilla\ngradient descent as a novel and scalable numerical solver for NNLS.

Quantum circuit mapping (QCM) transforms\nthe circuit into an equivalent one that is compliant with the NISQ device's\narchitecture constraint by adding SWAP gates. The QCM problem asks the minimal\nnumber of auxiliary SWAP gates, and is NP-complete. The complexity of QCM with\nfixed parameters is studied in the paper. We give an exact algorithm for QCM,\nand show that the algorithm runs in polynomial time if the NISQ device's\narchitecture is fixed.

Moreover, the fixed-parameter complexity of QCM is\nW[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of qubits of the quantum circuit. We\nprove the result by a reduction from the clique problem.

Observing and interpreting the\ndynamics of young massive clusters is key to our understanding of the star\nformation process and predicting the outcome of stellar evolution. We have\nstudied NGC6611 in the Eagle Nebula (M16), a young massive cluster hosting 19 O\nstars. We used Gaia EDR3 data to determine the membership, age, cluster\ndynamics and the kinematics of the massive stars including runaways. The\nmembership analysis yields 137 members located at a mean distance of 1706 $\\pm$\n7 pc. The colour - absolute magnitude diagram reveals a blue and a red\npopulation of pre-main-sequence stars, consistent with two distinct populations\nof stars. In line with earlier studies, the youngest population has a mean\nextinction $A_V$ = 3.6 $\\pm$ 0.1 mag and an age = 1.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 Myr, while the\nolder population of stars has a mean extinction $A_V$ = 2.0 $\\pm$ 0.1 mag and\nan age = 7.5 $\\pm$ 0.4 Myr. The latter population is more spatially extended\nthan the younger generation of stars. We argue that most of the OB stars belong\nto the younger population. We identify 8 runaways originating from the center\nof NGC6611, consistent with the dynamical ejection scenario. We show that ~ 50%\nof the O stars have velocities comparable to or greater than the escape\nvelocity. These O stars can be traced back to the center of NGC6611 with\nkinematic ages ranging from 0 to 2 Myr. This suggests that dynamical\ninteractions played an important role in the early evolution of NGC6611, which\nis surprising considering the low current stellar density. Comparing this to\nsimulations of young massive clusters, the required initial radius of 0.1-0.5\npc is not consistent with that of NGC6611.

This work\ndescribes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel induced\nmagnetic field-based 3D hand tracking system, aiming to address the\nshortcomings of existing approaches and supply an alternative solution. This\nsystem is composed of a set of transmitters for the magnetic field generation,\na receiver for field strength sensing, and the Zigbee units for\nsynchronization. In more detail, the transmitters generate the oscillating\nmagnetic fields with a registered sequence, the receiver senses the strength of\nthe induced magnetic field by a customized three axes coil, which is configured\nas the LC oscillator with the same oscillating frequency so that an induced\ncurrent shows up when the receiver is located in the field of the generated\nmagnetic field.

The true-range\nmultilateration method is used to calculate the coordinates of the hand in 3D\nspace.

We studied structural,\nmineralogical, and chemical modifications in the samples and connected them to\nchanges in the reflectance spectra. In both minerals, H irradiation induces\npartially amorphous sub-surface layers containing small vesicles. In OL\npellets, these vesicles are more tightly packed than in OPX ones. Related\nspectral change is mainly in the VIS spectral slope. Changes due to laser\nirradiation are mostly dependent on material's melting temperature. Only the\nlaser-irradiated OL contains nanophase Fe particles, which induce detectable\nspectral slope change throughout the measured spectral range. Our results\nsuggest that spectral changes at VIS-NIR wavelengths are mainly dependent on\nthickness of (partially) amorphous sub-surface layers. Amorphisation smooths\nmicroroughness, increasing the contribution of volume scattering and absorption\nover surface scattering. Soon after exposure to the space environment, the\nappearance of partially amorphous sub-surface layers results in rapid changes\nin the VIS spectral slope. In later stages (onset of micrometeoroid\nbombardment), we expect an emergence of nanoparticles to also mildly affect the\nNIR spectral slope. An increase in dimensions of amorphous layers and vesicles\nin the more space-weathered material will only cause band-depth variation and\ndarkening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 09:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Advanced VSR models, including the latest VSR\nTransformers, are generally equipped with well-designed alignment modules.\nHowever, the progress of the self-attention mechanism may violate this common\nsense. In this paper, we rethink the role of alignment in VSR Transformers and\nmake several counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments show that: (i) VSR\nTransformers can directly utilize multi-frame information from unaligned\nvideos, and (ii) existing alignment methods are sometimes harmful to VSR\nTransformers. These observations indicate that we can further improve the\nperformance of VSR Transformers simply by removing the alignment module and\nadopting a larger attention window. Nevertheless, such designs will\ndramatically increase the computational burden, and cannot deal with large\nmotions. Therefore, we propose a new and efficient alignment method called\npatch alignment, which aligns image patches instead of pixels. VSR Transformers\nequipped with patch alignment could demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on\nmultiple benchmarks.

Many countries with the\ncapacity to do so have made use of lab-processed Polymerase Chain Reaction\n(PCR) testing targeted at individuals with symptoms and the contacts of\nconfirmed cases. Alternatively, Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs) are able to deliver a\nresult quickly, without lab-processing and at a relatively low cost. Their\nadoption can support regular mass asymptomatic testing, allowing earlier\ndetection of infection and isolation of infectious individuals. In this paper\nwe extend and apply the agent-based epidemic modelling framework Covasim to\nexplore the impact of regular asymptomatic testing on the peak and total number\nof infections in an emerging COVID-19 wave. We explore testing with LFTs at\ndifferent frequency levels within a population with high levels of immunity and\nwith background symptomatic PCR testing, case isolation and contact tracing for\ntesting. The effectiveness of regular asymptomatic testing was compared with\n`lockdown' interventions seeking to reduce the number of non-household contacts\nacross the whole population through measures such as mandating working from\nhome and restrictions on gatherings. Since regular asymptomatic testing\nrequires only those with a positive result to reduce contact, while lockdown\nmeasures require the whole population to reduce contact, any policy decision\nthat seeks to trade off harms from infection against other harms will not\nautomatically favour one over the other. Our results demonstrate that, where\nsuch a trade off is being made, at moderate rates of early exponential growth\nregular asymptomatic testing has the potential to achieve significant infection\ncontrol without the wider harms associated with additional lockdown measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 10:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

However, poor\npropagation conditions such as non-line of sight (NLOS) and rich multipath\nstill pose many challenges due to outlier measurements that significantly\ndegrade the positioning performance. In this work, we introduce an iterative\npositioning method that reweights the time of arrival (ToA) and angle of\narrival (AoA) measurements originating from multiple locators in order to\nefficiently remove outliers. In contrast to existing approaches that typically\nrely on a single locator to set the time reference for the time difference of\narrival (TDoA) measurements corresponding to the remaining locators, and whose\nmeasurements may be unreliable, the proposed iterative approach does not rely\non a reference locator only. The resulting robust position estimate is then\nused to initialize a computationally efficient gradient search to perform\nmaximum likelihood position estimation.

Despite vastly different platforms and underlying\nworking principles, the realisations of nonreciprocal transport in linear,\ntime-independent systems rely on Aharonov-Bohm interference among several\npathways and require breaking time-reversal symmetry. Here we extend the notion\nof nonreciprocity to unidirectional bosonic transport in systems with a\ntime-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian by exploiting interference between\nbeamsplitter (excitation preserving) and two-mode-squeezing (excitation\nnon-preserving) interactions. In contrast to standard nonreciprocity, this\nunidirectional transport manifests when the mode quadratures are resolved with\nrespect to an external reference phase. Hence we dub this phenomenon quadrature\nnonreciprocity. First, we experimentally demonstrate it in the minimal system\nof two coupled nanomechanical modes orchestrated by optomechanical\ninteractions. Next, we develop a theoretical framework to characterise the\nclass of networks exhibiting quadrature nonreciprocity based on features of\ntheir particle-hole graphs. In addition to unidirectionality, these networks\ncan exhibit an even-odd pairing between collective quadratures, which we\nconfirm experimentally in a four-mode system, and an exponential end-to-end\ngain in the case of arrays of cavities.

It takes an RGB image as input and predicts 3D\nboxes in the 3D space. The most challenging sub-task lies in the instance depth\nestimation. Previous works usually use a direct estimation method. However, in\nthis paper we point out that the instance depth on the RGB image is\nnon-intuitive. It is coupled by visual depth clues and instance attribute\nclues, making it hard to be directly learned in the network. Therefore, we\npropose to reformulate the instance depth to the combination of the instance\nvisual surface depth (visual depth) and the instance attribute depth (attribute\ndepth). The visual depth is related to objects' appearances and positions on\nthe image. By contrast, the attribute depth relies on objects' inherent\nattributes, which are invariant to the object affine transformation on the\nimage. Correspondingly, we decouple the 3D location uncertainty into visual\ndepth uncertainty and attribute depth uncertainty. By combining different types\nof depths and associated uncertainties, we can obtain the final instance depth.\nFurthermore, data augmentation in monocular 3D detection is usually limited due\nto the physical nature, hindering the boost of performance. Based on the\nproposed instance depth disentanglement strategy, we can alleviate this\nproblem.

However, this semiclassical analysis can\nnot account for quantum-optical phenomena that rely on the quantized nature of\nlight. In this paper, we take a significant step to go beyond the semiclassical\ndescription of atom-photon coupled systems by unifying Floquet theory with\nquantum optics using the framework of Full-Counting Statistics. This is\nachieved by introducing counting fields that keep track of the photonic\ndynamics. This formalism, which is dubbed ``Photon-resolved Floquet theory\"\n(PRFT), is based on two-point tomographic measurements, instead of the\ntwo-point projective measurements used in standard Full-Counting Statistics.\nStrikingly, the PRFT predicts the generation of macroscopic light-matter\nentanglement when atoms interact with multi-frequency electromagnetic fields,\nthereby leading to complete decoherence of the atomic subsystem in the basis of\nthe Floquet states. This decoherence occurs rapidly in the optical frequency\nregime, but is negligible in the radio frequency regime. Intriguingly, time\ncrystals can act as good quantum memories even in the optical frequency regime.\nOur results thus pave the way for the design of efficient quantum memories and\nquantum operations.

Often such a target state corresponds to the minimum\nenergy of a band of states. In this context, approximate quantum calculations\nimply transition not to the single, minimum energy, state but to a group of\nstates close to the minimum. We consider dynamics and the result of two\npossible realization of such a process -- transition of population from a\nsingle initially populated isolated level to the quantum states at the edge of\na band of levels. The first case deals with the time-independent Hamiltonian,\nwhile the other with a moving isolated level.

These fascinating biological organisms\nhave the ability to fly for long-duration while spending little to no energy.\nThis flight technique/maneuver is called dynamic soaring (DS). For biologists\nand physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of the very elegant\nability of the bird's interaction with nature and using its physical ether in\nan optimal way for better survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering\ncommunity, it is a source of inspiration and an unequivocal promising chance\nfor bio-mimicking. In literature, significant work has been done on modeling\nand constructing control systems that allow the DS maneuver to be mimicked.\nHowever, mathematical characterization of the DS phenomenon in literature has\nbeen limited to optimal control configurations that utilized developments in\nnumerical optimization algorithms along with control methods to identify the\noptimal DS trajectory taken (or to be taken) by the bird/mimicking system. In\nthis paper, we provide a novel two-layered mathematical approach to\ncharacterize, model, mimic, and control DS in a simple and real-time\nimplementation. The first layer will be a differential geometric control\nformulation and analysis of the DS problem. The second layer will be a linkage\nbetween the DS philosophy and a class of dynamical control systems known as\nextremum seeking systems. We believe our framework captures more of the\nbiological behavior of soaring birds and opens the door for geometric control\ntheory and extremum seeking systems to be utilized in systems biology and\nnatural phenomena.

However, existing methods for self-triggered control\nrequire explicit system models that are assumed perfectly known a priori. An\nend-to-end control paradigm known as data-driven control learns control laws\ndirectly from data, and offers a competing alternative to the routine system\nidentification-then-control method. In this context, the present paper puts\nforth data-driven self-triggered control schemes for unknown linear systems\nusing data collected offline. Specifically, for output feedback control\nsystems, a data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, which\ncomputes a sequence of control inputs while generating a predicted system\ntrajectory. A data-driven self-triggering law is designed using the predicted\ntrajectory, to determine the next triggering time once a new measurement\nbecomes available. For state feedback control systems, instead of capitalizing\non MPC to predict the trajectory, a data-fitting problem using the\npre-collected input-state data is solved, whose solution is employed to\nconstruct the self-triggering mechanism. Both feasibility and stability are\nestablished for the proposed self-triggered controllers, which are validated\nusing numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Despite the significant\nadvancement of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular representation\nlearning, they generally face limitations such as neighbors-explosion,\nunder-reaching, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. Also, GNNs usually have\nhigh computational costs because of the large-scale number of parameters.\nTypically, such limitations emerge or increase when facing relatively\nlarge-size graphs or using a deeper GNN model architecture. An idea to overcome\nthese problems is to simplify a molecular graph into a small, rich, and\ninformative one, which is more efficient and less challenging to train GNNs. To\nthis end, we propose a novel molecular graph coarsening framework named FunQG\nutilizing Functional groups, as influential building blocks of a molecule to\ndetermine its properties, based on a graph-theoretic concept called Quotient\nGraph. By experiments, we show that the resulting informative graphs are much\nsmaller than the molecular graphs and thus are good candidates for training\nGNNs. We apply the FunQG on popular molecular property prediction benchmarks\nand then compare the performance of some popular baseline GNNs on the obtained\ndatasets with the performance of several state-of-the-art baselines on the\noriginal datasets. By experiments, this method significantly outperforms\nprevious baselines on various datasets, besides its dramatic reduction in the\nnumber of parameters and low computational costs. Therefore, the FunQG can be\nused as a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for solving the molecular\nrepresentation learning problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 08:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

We improved\nand extended the existing implementation of a two-population dust and pebble\ndescription in the global Bern/Heidelberg planet formation and evolution model.\nModern prescriptions for photoevaporative winds were used and we account for\nsettling and advection of dust when calculating entrainment rates. In order to\nprepare for future population studies with varying conditions, we explore a\nwide range of disk-, photoevaporation-, and dust-parameters. We find that if\ndust can grow to pebble sizes, that is, if they are resistant to fragmentation\nor turbulence is weak, drift dominates and the entrained mass is small but\nlarger than under the assumption of no vertical advection of grains with the\ngas flow. For the case of fragile dust shattering at velocities of 1 m/s - as\nindicated in laboratory experiments -, an order of magnitude more dust is\nentrained which becomes the main dust removal process. Radiation pressure\neffects disperse massive, dusty disks on timescales of a few 100 Myr. These\nresults highlight the importance of dust entrainment in winds as a solid mass\nremoval process.

The\nrecoil energy of the electron then depends on the mass difference of the dark\nparticles. In this paper we show that the annual modulation of both the event\nrate and the electron recoil energy provide important additional information\nthat allows to distinguish among different theoretical explanations of the\nsignal. To this end, we first extend the formalism of annual modulation to\nelectronic recoils, inelastic dark matter scattering and the electron recoil\nenergy. We then study a concrete theoretical model with two Dirac fermions and\na dark photon. We take into account all relevant cosmological and experimental\nconstraints on this model and apply it to the XENON1T and and XENONnT\nexperiments with realistic detection thresholds, efficiencies and energy\nresolutions, fitting the main physical parameters of the model, i.e. the mass\nsplitting and the electron scattering cross section. The discriminatory power\nof the additional information from the annual modulation of both the signal\nrate and the electron recoil energy is then demonstrated for XENONnT with a\nsimplified model based on these main physical parameters.

One drawback is that it is hard for them to\nrepresent a 3D shape as multiple parts. Current solutions learn various\nprimitives and blend the primitives directly in the spatial space, which still\nstruggle to approximate the 3D shape accurately. To resolve this problem, we\nintroduce a novel implicit representation to represent a single 3D shape as a\nset of parts in the latent space, towards both highly accurate and plausibly\ninterpretable shape modeling. Our insight here is that both the part learning\nand the part blending can be conducted much easier in the latent space than in\nthe spatial space. We name our method Latent Partition Implicit (LPI), because\nof its ability of casting the global shape modeling into multiple local part\nmodeling, which partitions the global shape unity. LPI represents a shape as\nSigned Distance Functions (SDFs) using surface codes. Each surface code is a\nlatent code representing a part whose center is on the surface, which enables\nus to flexibly employ intrinsic attributes of shapes or additional surface\nproperties. Eventually, LPI can reconstruct both the shape and the parts on the\nshape, both of which are plausible meshes. LPI is a multi-level representation,\nwhich can partition a shape into different numbers of parts after training. LPI\ncan be learned without ground truth signed distances, point normals or any\nsupervision for part partition. LPI outperforms the latest methods under the\nwidely used benchmarks in terms of reconstruction accuracy and modeling\ninterpretability.

This scenario, however, fails to explain some of the features\nobserved in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Microquasars have been proposed as\nadditional candidates, because their non-thermal emission indicates the\nexistence of efficient particle acceleration mechanisms in their jets. A\npromising scenario envisages the production of relativistic neutrons in the\njets, that decay outside the system injecting relativistic protons to the\nsurroundings. The first investigations of this scenario suggest that\nmicroquasars might be fairly alternative cosmic-ray sources.\n  We aim at assessing the role played by the degree of collimation of the jet\non the cosmic-ray energetics in the neutron-carrier scenario, as well as the\nproperties of the emission region. Our goals are to explain the Galactic\ncomponent of the observed proton cosmic-ray spectrum at energies higher than\n$\\sim 10$ GeV and to relate the mentioned jet properties with the power and\nspectral index of the produced cosmic rays. We find that collimated jets, with\ncompact acceleration regions close to the jet base, are very efficient sources\nthat could deliver a fraction of up to $\\sim 0.01$ of their relativistic proton\nluminosity into cosmic rays. Collimation is the most significant feature\nregarding efficiency; a well collimated jet might be $\\sim 4$ orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than a poorly collimated one. The main feature of the\npresented mechanism is the production of a spectrum with a steeper spectral\nindex ($\\sim 2.3$ at energies up to $\\sim 10$ TeV) than in the supernova\nscenario, and closer to what is observed. The predictions of our model may be\nused to infer the total contribution of the population of Galactic microquasars\nto the cosmic ray population, and therefore to quantitatively assess their\nsignificance as cosmic-ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

In this manuscript we perform a\nspectral characterization of the system throughout its 2021, two-week-long\noutburst, analyzing 11 NICER observations and quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR single observations at the outburst peak. The broadband spectrum is\nwell-modeled with a black body component with a temperature of $\\sim$0.6 keV,\nmost likely consistent with a hot spot on the neutron star surface, and a\nComptonisation spectrum with power-law index $\\Gamma \\sim 1.9$, arising from a\nhot corona at $\\sim$12 keV. No direct emission from the disc was found,\npossibly due to it being too cool.

This will result in an\nincrease in observing speed of many orders of magnitude. A spectroscopic\ninstrument on such an observatory requires large arrays of detectors with a\nsensitivity expressed as a noise equivalent power NEP = 3 $\\times 10^{-20}$\n$W\\surd{Hz}$. We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of\nmicrowave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) for this frequency range\nreaching the required sensitivity. The devices are based on thin-film NbTiN\nresonators which use lens-antenna coupling to a submicron-width aluminium\ntransmission line at the shorted end of the resonator where the radiation is\nabsorbed. We optimised the MKID geometry for a low NEP by using a small\naluminium volume of $\\approx$ 1$\\mu m^3$ and fabricating the aluminium section\non a very thin (100 nm) SiN membrane. Both methods of optimisation also reduce\nthe effect of excess noise by increasing the responsivity of the device, which\nis further increased by reducing the parasitic geometrical inductance of the\nresonator. We measure the sensitivity of eight MKIDs with respect to the power\nabsorbed in the detector using a thermal calibration source filtered in a\nnarrow band around 1.55 THz. We obtain a\nNEP$_{exp}(P_{abs})\\:=\\:3.1\\pm0.9\\times10^{-20}\\:W\\surd{Hz}$ at a modulation\nfrequency of 200 Hz averaged over all measured MKIDs. The NEP is limited by\nquasiparticle trapping. The measured sensitivity is sufficient for\nspectroscopic observations from future, actively cooled space-based\nobservatories. Moreover, the presented device design and assembly can be\nadapted for frequencies up to $\\approx$ 10 THz and can be readily implemented\nin kilopixel arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Neural networks are then assumed to necessarily work in\nextrapolative mode. We here study the neural activities of the last hidden\nlayer of typical neural networks. Using an autoencoder to uncover the intrinsic\nspace underlying the neural activities, we show that this space is actually\nlow-dimensional, and that the better the model, the lower the dimensionality of\nthis intrinsic space. In this space, most samples of the test set actually lie\nin the convex hull of the training set: under the convex hull definition, the\nmodels thus happen to work in interpolation regime. Moreover, we show that\nbelonging to the convex hull does not seem to be the relevant criteria.\nDifferent measures of proximity to the training set are actually better related\nto performance accuracy. Thus, typical neural networks do seem to operate in\ninterpolation regime. Good generalization performances are linked to the\nability of a neural network to operate well in such a regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Specifically, we have developed and employed an improved version of\nDASH, a GPU $N$-body code, to study the evolution of low-mass subhaloes inside\na Milky Way-like halo with unprecedented accuracy, reaching solar-mass and\nsub-parsec resolution in our simulations. We simulate subhaloes with varying\nmass, concentration, and orbital properties, and consider the effect of the\ngravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy itself. More specifically, we\nanalyze the evolution of both the bound mass fraction and annihilation\nluminosity of subhaloes, finding that most subhaloes survive until present\ntime, even though in some cases they lose more than 99% of their mass at\naccretion. Baryons in the host induce a much more severe mass loss, especially\nwhen the subhalo orbit is more parallel to the galactic disk. Many of these\nsubhaloes cross the solar galactocentric radius, thus making it easier to\ndetect their annihilation fluxes from Earth. We find subhaloes orbiting a\nDM-only halo with a pericentre in the solar vicinity to lose 70-90% of their\ninitial annihilation luminosity at redshift zero, which increases up to 99%\nwhen baryons are also included in the host. We find a strong relation between\nsubhalo's mass loss and the effective tidal field at pericentre. Indeed, much\nof the dependence on concentration, orbital parameters, host potential and\nbaryonic components can be explained through this single parameter. In addition\nto shedding light on the survival of low-mass galactic subhaloes, our results\ncan provide detailed predictions that will aid current and future quests for\nthe nature of DM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Here, we take into account boundary conditions of Robin type by using\nwell-known results from Sturm-Liouville theory, but we go beyond the existing\nliterature by exploring an unnoticed freedom that emerges from the intrinsic\narbitrariness of secondary solutions at a limit circle endpoint. Accordingly,\nwe show that infinitely many one-parameter families of sensible dynamics are\nadmissible. In other words, we emphasize that physical constraints guaranteeing\nthe construction of full-fledged ground states do not, in general, fix one such\nstate unambiguously. In addition, we provide, in full detail, an example on $(1\n+ 1)$-half Minkowski spacetime to spell out the rationale in a specific\nscenario where analytic formulae can be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 14:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

A wide\nvariety of self assembled structures are achieved by changing the grafting\npatterns on an individual nanoparticle surface. However, accurate estimation of\nthe effective potential of mean force between a pair of grafted nanoparticles\nthat determines their assembly and distribution in a polymer matrix is an\noutstanding challenge in nanoscience. Here, we propose a new deep learning\nmethod that learns the interaction between a pair of grafted nanoparticles from\nthe molecular dynamics trajectory of a cluster of polymer-grafted\nnanoparticles. Subsequently, we carry out the deep learning potential of mean\nforce-based molecular simulation that predicts the self-assembly of a large\nnumber of polymer grafted nanoparticles into various anisotropic\nsuperstructures, including percolating networks and bilayers depending on\nnanoparticles concentration in 3D. The deep learning potential of mean\nforce-predicted self-assembled superstructures are consistent with the actual\nsuperstructures of polymer grafted nanoparticles.

Traditionally, the difference between the\nhistogram and the underlying distribution (i.e., the approximation error) is\nmeasured using the $L_p$ norm, which sums the differences between the two\nfunctions over all items in the domain. Although useful in many applications,\nthe drawback of this error measure is that it treats approximation errors of\nall items in the same way, irrespective of whether the mass of an item is\nimportant for the downstream application that uses the approximation. As a\nresult, even relatively simple distributions cannot be approximated by succinct\nhistograms without incurring large error.\n  In this paper, we address this issue by adapting the definition of\napproximation so that only the errors of the items that belong to the support\nof the distribution are considered.

An essential challenge in SER is to extract common\nattributes from different speakers or languages, especially when a specific\nsource corpus has to be trained to recognize the unknown data coming from\nanother speech corpus. To address this challenge, a Capsule Network (CapsNet)\nand Transfer Learning based Mixed Task Net (CTLMTNet) are proposed to deal with\nboth the singlecorpus and cross-corpus SER tasks simultaneously in this paper.\nFor the single-corpus task, the combination of Convolution-Pooling and\nAttention CapsNet module CPAC) is designed by embedding the self-attention\nmechanism to the CapsNet, guiding the module to focus on the important features\nthat can be fed into different capsules. The extracted high-level features by\nCPAC provide sufficient discriminative ability.

Particularly in the global north, countries are implementing systems\nto monitor air pollution on a large scale to aid decision-making. Such efforts\nare essential but they have at least three shortcomings: (1) they are costly\nand are difficult to implement expediently; (2) they focus on urban areas,\nwhich is where most people live, but this choice is prone to inequalities; and\n(3) the process of estimating air pollution lacks transparency.

Our approach makes it possible to implement an\ninexpensive method of estimating air pollution concentrations to an accuracy\nlevel that can underpin policymakers' decisions while providing an estimate in\nall districts, not just urban areas, and in a process that is transparent and\nexplainable. Impact Statement. We show that a linear regression model using a\nsingle structural property -- length of the track and unclassified road network\nwithin 0.36% of districts within England and Wales (in the UK) -- can\naccurately estimate which districts are the most polluted. The model presents a\ntransparent and low-cost, yet effective, alternative to more expensive models\nsuch as the one currently used by DEFRA in the UK. The model has apparent\npractical uses for policymakers who want to pursue clean-air initiatives but\nlack the capital to invest in comprehensive monitoring networks.

Our approach\nis inspired by Simulated Annealing for global optimization and allows for\nfine-grain parameter tuning as well as adaptive updates to algorithm\nparameters. We present numerical results that indicate our hybrid approach can\ncompute better approximations to the maximum likelihood estimator with less\ncomputation than the state-of-the-art methods by themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 04:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

Firstly, we demonstrated a 5X faster accurate simulation method\nin Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD). This allows us to find 50% more\nnumbers of high BV (>1400V) designs at a given simulation time. Secondly, a\nmachine learning (ML) model is developed using TCAD-generated data and used as\na surrogate model for differential evolution optimization. It can inversely\ndesign an out-of-the-training-range structure with BV as high as 1887V (89% of\nthe ideal case) compared to ~1100V designed with human domain expertise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 05:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Existing deep learning methods have\nachieved great success over statistical models; however, they still lack\ngeneralization for diverse tasks and suffer from insufficient capacity since\nthey are composed of highly-coupled task-specific architectures and rely on\nsmall-scale, coarse-grained recommendation scenarios. To realize the idea of\ngeneral adaptive systems proposed in pedagogical theory, with the emerging\npre-training techniques in NLP, we try to conduct a practical exploration on\napplying pre-training to adaptive learning, to propose a unified framework\nbased on data observation and learning style analysis, properly leveraging\nheterogeneous learning elements. Through a series of downstream tasks of\nLearning Recommendation, Learning Resource Evaluation, Knowledge Tracing, and\nDropout Prediction, we find that course structures, text, and knowledge are\nhelpful for modeling and inherently coherent to student non-sequential learning\nbehaviors and that indirectly relevant information included in the pre-training\nfoundation can be shared across downstream tasks to facilitate effectiveness.\nWe finally build a simplified systematic application of adaptive learning and\nreflect on the insights brought back to pedagogy. The source code and dataset\nwill be released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In the body of the report, we summarize most of the\nbasic themes that were discussed: the structure and function of the brain,\ntheories of consciousness, explicit attempts to construct conscious machines,\ndetection and measurement of consciousness, possible emergence of a conscious\ntechnology, methods for control of such a technology and ethical considerations\nthat might be owed to it. An appendix outlines the topics of each workshop and\nprovides abstracts of the talks delivered.\n  Update: Although this report was published in 2018 and the workshops it is\nbased on were held in 2017, recent events suggest that it is worth bringing\nforward. In particular, in the Spring of 2022, a Google engineer claimed that\nLaMDA, one of their \"large language models\" is sentient or even conscious. This\nprovoked a flurry of commentary in both the scientific and popular press, some\nof it interesting and insightful, but almost all of it ignorant of the prior\nconsideration given to these topics and the history of research into machine\nconsciousness. Thus, we are making a lightly refreshed version of this report\navailable in the hope that it will provide useful background to the current\ndebate and will enable more informed commentary. Although this material is five\nyears old, its technical points remain valid and up to date, but we have\n\"refreshed\" it by adding a few footnotes highlighting recent developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 23:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}
