The recently proposed pivotal tuning model makes\nsignificant progress towards reconstruction and editability, by using a\ntwo-step approach that first inverts the input image into a latent code, called\npivot code, and then alters the generator so that the input image can be\naccurately mapped into the pivot code.

Fulvenallene and ethynyl\ncyclopentadiene are likely formed in the reaction between cyclopentadiene\n($c$-C$_5$H$_6$) and the ehtynyl radical (CCH). However, the bottom-up\ngas-phase synthesis of cycles in TMC-1 underestimates the abundance of\ncyclopentadiene by two orders of magnitude, which strengthens the need to study\nall possible chemical pathways to cyclisation in cold dark cloud environments,\nsuch as TMC-1. However, the inclusion of the reaction between C$_3$H$_3^+$ and\nC$_2$H$_4$ produces a good agreement between model and observed abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 16:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

While forecasting epidemic progression is frequently\nconceptualized as being analogous to weather forecasting, however it has some\nkey differences and remains a non-trivial task. The spread of diseases is\nsubject to multiple confounding factors spanning human behavior, pathogen\ndynamics, weather and environmental conditions. Research interest has been\nfueled by the increased availability of rich data sources capturing previously\nunobservable facets and also due to initiatives from government public health\nand funding agencies. This has resulted, in particular, in a spate of work on\n'data-centered' solutions which have shown potential in enhancing our\nforecasting capabilities by leveraging non-traditional data sources as well as\nrecent innovations in AI and machine learning. This survey delves into various\ndata-driven methodological and practical advancements and introduces a\nconceptual framework to navigate through them. First, we enumerate the large\nnumber of epidemiological datasets and novel data streams that are relevant to\nepidemic forecasting, capturing various factors like symptomatic online\nsurveys, retail and commerce, mobility, genomics data and more. Next, we\ndiscuss methods and modeling paradigms focusing on the recent data-driven\nstatistical and deep-learning based methods as well as on the novel class of\nhybrid models that combine domain knowledge of mechanistic models with the\neffectiveness and flexibility of statistical approaches. We also discuss\nexperiences and challenges that arise in real-world deployment of these\nforecasting systems including decision-making informed by forecasts.

FL\ntechniques generally use a central server or cloud for aggregating the models\nreceived from the devices. Such centralized FL techniques suffer from inherent\nproblems such as failure of the central node and bottlenecks in channel\nbandwidth. When FL is used in conjunction with connected robots serving as\ndevices, a failure of the central controlling entity can lead to a chaotic\nsituation. This paper describes a mobile agent based paradigm to decentralize\nFL in multi-robot scenarios. Using Webots, a popular free open-source robot\nsimulator, and Tartarus, a mobile agent platform, we present a methodology to\ndecentralize federated learning in a set of connected robots. With Webots\nrunning on different connected computing systems, we show how mobile agents can\nperform the task of Decentralized Federated Reinforcement Learning (dFRL).\nResults obtained from experiments carried out using Q-learning and SARSA by\naggregating their corresponding Q-tables, show the viability of using\ndecentralized FL in the domain of robotics. Since the proposed work can be used\nin conjunction with other learning algorithms and also real robots, it can act\nas a vital tool for the study of decentralized FL using heterogeneous learning\nalgorithms concurrently in multi-robot scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 16:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 20:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

The method is built on a\nhighly efficient compact WENO reconstruction on unstructured meshes, a simple\nPCP limiter, the provably PCP property of the Harten--Lax--van Leer flux, and\nthird-order strong-stability-preserving time discretization. Due to the\nrelativistic effects, the primitive variables (namely, the rest-mass density,\nvelocity, and pressure) are highly nonlinear implicit functions in terms of the\nconservative variables, making the design and analysis of our method\nnontrivial.

Deep-learning-based Computer-Assisted Diagnosis\n(CAD) systems can support radiologists for nodule screening in CXR. However, it\nrequires large-scale and diverse medical data with high-quality annotations to\ntrain such robust and accurate CADs. To alleviate the limited availability of\nsuch datasets, lung nodule synthesis methods are proposed for the sake of data\naugmentation. Nevertheless, previous methods lack the ability to generate\nnodules that are realistic with the size attribute desired by the detector. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a novel lung nodule synthesis framework in\nthis paper, which decomposes nodule attributes into three main aspects\nincluding shape, size, and texture, respectively. A GAN-based Shape Generator\nfirstly models nodule shapes by generating diverse shape masks.

A coarse-to-fine gated\nconvolutional Texture Generator finally synthesizes visually plausible nodule\ntextures conditioned on the modulated shape masks.

The standard CDG method does not\npossess this feature, while directly applying some existing WB techniques to\nthe CDG framework may not accommodate the positivity and keep other important\nproperties at the same time. In order to obtain the WB and\npositivity-preserving properties simultaneously while also maintaining the\nconservativeness and stability of the schemes, a novel spatial discretization\nis devised in the CDG framework based on suitable modifications to the\nnumerical dissipation term and the source term approximation. The modifications\nare based on a crucial projection operator for the stationary hydrostatic\nsolution, which is proposed for the first time in this work.

An increasingly popular approach, known as\nWasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO), achieves this by\napplying the Wasserstein metric to construct a ball centred at the empirical\ndistribution and finding a solution that performs well against the most\nadversarial distribution from the ball. In this paper, we present a general\nframework for studying different choices of a Wasserstein metric and point out\nthe limitation of the existing choices. In particular, while choosing a\nWasserstein metric of a higher order is desirable from a data-driven\nperspective, given its less conservative nature, such a choice comes with a\nhigh price from a robustness perspective - it is no longer applicable to many\nheavy-tailed distributions of practical concern. We show that this seemingly\ninevitable trade-off can be resolved by our framework, where a new class of\nWasserstein metrics, called coherent Wasserstein metrics, is introduced. Like\nWasserstein DRO, distributionally robust optimization using the coherent\nWasserstein metrics, termed generalized Wasserstein distributionally robust\noptimization (GW-DRO), has all the desirable performance guarantees:\nfinite-sample guarantee, asymptotic consistency, and computational\ntractability. The worst-case expectation problem in GW-DRO is in general a\nnonconvex optimization problem, yet we provide new analysis to prove its\ntractability without relying on the common duality scheme. Our framework, as\nshown in this paper, offers a fruitful opportunity to design novel Wasserstein\nDRO models that can be applied in various contexts such as operations\nmanagement, finance, and machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 16:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The\naccurate estimation of the clock state (i.e., the circadian phase) outside of\nthe laboratory has enormous potential for precision medicine. Several methods\nthat predict the phase from measurements collected with wearables (e.g., Apple\nWatch) have been recently developed. However, computation of the uncertainty in\nthe estimation remains an open problem. The uncertainty analysis is necessary\nbecause the estimation accuracy can largely change even by a small perturbation\nof daily routine.

The later are physically\naccurate but require solving integral equations and, therefore, are\ncomputationally expensive. This paper investigates RFTs in comparison with\nstate-of-the art SBT methods. During the process, a neural network-based\nhydrodynamic model that -- similar to RFTs -- relies on local drag coefficients\nfor computational efficiency was developed. However, the network is trained\nusing data from an SBT (regularized stokeslet segments method).The $R^2$ value\nof the trained coefficients were $\\sim 0.99$ with mean absolute error of\n$1.6\\times10^{-2}$.

In particular, we consider the setting of selling to $n$\nbidders whose values are drawn from $n$ independent but not necessarily\nidentical distributions. We work in the robust auction design regime, where we\nassume the seller has no knowledge of the bidders' value distributions and must\ndesign a mechanism that is prior-independent. While there have been many strong\nresults on prior-independent auction design in the i.i.d. setting, not much is\nknown for the heterogeneous setting, even though the latter is of significant\npractical importance. Unfortunately, no prior-independent mechanism can hope to\nalways guarantee any approximation to Myerson's revenue in the heterogeneous\nsetting; similarly, no prior-independent mechanism can consistently do better\nthan the second-price auction. In light of this, we design a family of\n(parametrized) randomized auctions which approximates at least one of these\nbenchmarks: For heterogeneous bidders with regular value distributions, our\nmechanisms either achieve a good approximation of the expected revenue of an\noptimal mechanism (which knows the bidders' distributions) or exceeds that of\nthe second-price auction by a certain multiplicative factor. The factor in the\nlatter case naturally trades off with the approximation ratio of the former\ncase. We show that our mechanism is optimal for such a trade-off between the\ntwo cases by establishing a matching lower bound.

These sources, if confirmed, join GNz11\nin defying number density forecasts for luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV\nluminosity functions, which require a survey area $>10\\times$ larger than we\nhave studied here to find such luminous sources at such high redshifts. They\nextend evidence from lower redshifts for little or no evolution in the bright\nend of the UV luminosity function into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications\nfor just how early these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that\nfuture deep $JWST$ observations may identify relatively bright galaxies to much\nearlier epochs than might have been anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 17:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 21:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

In practice, these\ncost/value quantities often come through processes such as measurement or\nmachine learning, which are noisy, with quantifiable noise distributions. To\ntake these noise distributions into account, one approach is to assume a prior\nfor the values, use it to build a posterior, and then apply standard stochastic\noptimization to pick a solution. However, in many practical applications, such\nprior distributions may not be available. In this paper, we study such\nscenarios using a regret minimization model.\n  In our model, the task is to pick the highest one out of $n$ values. The\nvalues are unknown and chosen by an adversary, but can be observed through\nnoisy channels, where additive noises are stochastically drawn from known\ndistributions. The goal is to minimize the regret of our selection, defined as\nthe expected difference between the highest and the selected value on the\nworst-case choices of values. We show that the na\\\"ive algorithm of picking the\nhighest observed value has regret arbitrarily worse than the optimum, even when\n$n = 2$ and the noises are unbiased in expectation. On the other hand, we\npropose an algorithm which gives a constant-approximation to the optimal regret\nfor any $n$. Our algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient,\nand requires only minimal knowledge of the noise distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 17:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

This induces a large\nfunctional freedom in the construction of the Nicolai map, which cancels in all\ncorrelator computations. Under a certain condition on the coupling flow\noperator the ambiguity disappears, and the power-series expansion for the map\ncollapses to a linear function in the coupling. A special role is played by\ntopological (theta) couplings, which do not affect perturbative correlation\nfunctions but also alter the Nicolai map.

This result is in agreement with theoretical models that\npredict radiative feedback regulates gas in the nuclear regions of galaxies and\nis a major driving mechanism of galactic-scale outflows of cold gas. Our\nfindings suggest that radiative quasar feedback ejects star-forming gas from\nwithin nascent stellar bulges at velocities comparable to those seen on larger\nscales, and that molecules survive in outflows even from the most luminous\nquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 18:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 16:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

These conditions could produce significantly\nmore compressible effects, characterized by enhanced density fluctuations, as\nseen by several space missions. In this paper, a series of 3D MHD simulations\nof turbulence are carried out to understand the properties of compressible\nturbulence, particularly the generation of density fluctuations.

Furthermore, through detailed spatio-temporal analysis, we show\nthat the density fluctuations are dominated by low-frequency nonlinear\nstructures, rather than compressible MHD eigen-waves.

In\nthis paper, we address these limitations by introducing a heliostat geometry\nfor beam scanning to achieve an extended field-of-view, and by reconfiguring\nthe ASynchronous OPtical Sampling (ASOPS) system to perform Electronically\nControlled OPtical Sampling (ECOPS) measurements. The former change improved\nthe deflection range of the beam, while also drastically reducing the coupling\nof the two scanning axes, the combination of which resulted in a larger than\nfour-fold increase in the FOV area.

In fact, even if the class is balanced,\nsamples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying\nattributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and\nchallenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most\ndatasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be\nbalanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized\nLong-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances.\nBy \"generalized\", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the\ntraditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most\nclass-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT\nand MSCOCO-GLT. We argue that it is because they over-emphasize the adjustment\nof class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features.\nTo this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first\nstrong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent\nintra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns\ninvariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone,\nIFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and\nensemble.

Like all technologies, these platforms can be\nabused and they are routinely used to attempt to cause harm at scale. One of\nthe most significant offence types that is enabled by these platforms is child\nsexual abuse - both scaling existing abuse and enabling entirely new types of\nonline-only abuse where the impacts on the victim are equally catastrophic.\nMany platforms invest significantly in combating this crime, referring\nconfirmed evidence of illegality to law enforcement. The introduction of\nend-to-end encryption and similar technologies breaks many of the mitigations\nin place today and this has led to a debate around the apparent dichotomy of\ngood child safety and good general user privacy and security. This debate has\nconcentrated on the problem of detecting offenders sharing known abuse imagery\nusing a technique known as client side scanning. We will show that the real\nproblem of online child sexual abuse is much more complex than offender image\nsharing, providing a new set of 'harm archetypes' to better group harms into\ncategories that have similar technical characteristics and, as far as we are\nable, bring more clarity to the processes currently used by platforms and law\nenforcement in relation to child sexual abuse content and the real world\nimpacts.

In our model,\nenergy is exchanged between the baths through two parallel pathways, which can\nbe made distinct through the nondegeneracy of excited levels (energy splitting\n$\\Delta$) and a control parameter $\\alpha$, which adjusts the strength of one\nof the arms. Using a nonsecular quantum master equation of Redfield form, we\nsucceed in deriving closed-form expressions for the quantum coherences and the\nheat current in the steady state limit for closely degenerate excited levels.\nBy including three ingredients in our analysis: nonequilibrium baths,\nnondegeneracy of levels, and asymmetry of pathways, we show that quantum\ncoherences are generated and sustained in the V model in the steady-state limit\nif three conditions, conjoining thermal and coherent effects are simultaneously\nmet: (i) The two baths are held at different temperatures. (ii) Bath-induced\npathways do not interfere destructively. (iii) Thermal rates do not mingle with\nthe control parameter $\\alpha$ to destroy interferences through an effective\nlocal equilibrium condition. We find that coherences are maximized when the\nheat current is suppressed. On the other hand, the secular Redfield quantum\nmaster equation is shown to fail in a broad range of parameters. Although we\nmainly focus on analytical results in the steady state limit, numerical\nsimulations reveal that the transient behavior of coherences contrasts the\nsteady-state limit, suggesting that different mechanisms are at play in these\ntwo regimes. Enhancing either the lifetime of transient coherences or their\nmagnitude at steady state thus requires the control and optimization of\ndifferent physical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 18:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In this paper, we\nhighlight the peculiar action of the Dice loss in the presence of missing or\nempty labels. First, we formulate a theoretical basis that gives a general\ndescription of the Dice loss and its derivative. It turns out that the choice\nof the reduction dimensions $\\Phi$ and the smoothing term $\\epsilon$ is\nnon-trivial and greatly influences its behavior. We find and propose heuristic\ncombinations of $\\Phi$ and $\\epsilon$ that work in a segmentation setting with\neither missing or empty labels. Second, we empirically validate these findings\nin a binary and multiclass segmentation setting using two publicly available\ndatasets. We confirm that the choice of $\\Phi$ and $\\epsilon$ is indeed\npivotal. With $\\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen over a single batch\n(and class) element and with a negligible $\\epsilon$, the Dice loss deals with\nmissing labels naturally and performs similarly compared to recent adaptations\nspecific for missing labels. With $\\Phi$ chosen such that the reductions happen\nover multiple batch elements or with a heuristic value for $\\epsilon$, the Dice\nloss handles empty labels correctly. We believe that this work highlights some\nessential perspectives and hope that it encourages researchers to better\ndescribe their exact implementation of the Dice loss in future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 19:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 10:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-10"}

Toward this goal, in this paper we create an analytic model of\nX-ray feedback from accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), to be used\nas a sub-grid model in future cosmological simulations. Our analytic model\nprovides a relation between the mass of a dark matter halo and the SMBH it\nhosts, where the efficiency is governed by an energy balance argument between\nthermal feedback and the confining gravitational potential of the halo. To\ncalibrate the model, we couple the halo-level recipe with the Press-Schechter\nhalo mass function and derive global mass and energy densities.

The formulae were derived from the Fe XII 195.12 A emission line\nobserved by EIS and the AIA 193 A channel. A study of the weaker Fe XIV 274.20\nA line during the transit, and a comparison of scattering in the AIA 193 A and\n304 A channels suggests the EIS scattering formula applies to other emission\nlines in the EIS wavebands. Both formulae should be valid in regions of fairly\nuniform emission such as coronal holes and quiet Sun, but not faint areas close\n(around 100\") to bright active regions. The formula for EIS is used to estimate\nthe scattered light component of Fe XII 195.12 for seven on-disk coronal holes\nobserved between 2010 and 2018. Scattered light contributions of 56% to 100%\nare found, suggesting that these features are dominated by scattered light,\nconsistent with earlier work of Wendeln \\& Landi. Emission lines from the S X\nand Si X ions - formed at the same temperature as Fe XII and often used to\nderive the first ionization potential (FIP) bias from EIS data - are also\nexpected to be dominated by scattered light in coronal holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 20:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Transfer-learning significantly reduces the time\nand effort of training models. However, it comes at the cost of security\nconcerns. In this paper, we show a new observation that pre-trained models and\nfine-tuned models have significantly high similarities in weight values.

It arises naturally from locality in systems whose interactions\nform a set of constraints such as in geometrically frustrated magnets and balls\nand springs metamaterials. For a magnet whose classical limit exhibits\ntopological frustration, an important question is what happens to this topology\nwhen the degrees of freedom are quantized and whether such frustration could\nlead to exotic quantum phases of matter like a spin liquid. We answer these\nquestions for a geometrically frustrated spin ladder model. It has the feature\nof having infinitely many conserved quantities that aid the solution. We find\nclassical zero modes all get lifted by quantum fluctuations and the system is\nleft with a unique rung singlet ground state -- a trivial quantum spin liquid.\nMoreover, we find low-energy eigenstates corresponding to known symmetry\nprotected topological (SPT) ground states, and a special role of $SU(2)$\nsymmetry, that it demands the existence of extra dimensions of classical zero\nmodes -- the phenomena we call symmetry-enriched topological frustration\n(SETF).

We further study a\ntwo-dimensional bilayer triangular lattice model and find a similar SETF\nphenomena which also leads to suppressed low-energy topological eigenstates in\nthe quantum regime.

Several modeling\nframeworks that consider the inherent uncertainty in the operation and planning\nof the power system have been extensively studied. Stochastic optimization has\nbeen the most popular approach among these frameworks due to its intuitive\nrepresentation, especially when formulated using discrete probabilistic\nscenarios to represent the random variables. Although many scenarios\nrepresenting all possible uncertain operating conditions would be needed to\naccurate evaluate stochastic operation and planning models, the size of the\nscenario set impacts computational complexity, posing a significant tradeoff\nbetween uncertainty detail representation and computational tractability.\n  During the last decade, a large body of research has focused on developing\nnew scenario aggregation methods to derive reduced scenario sets that show\nproperties similar to the original scenario set while decreasing computational\nburden.

However, such density staircases\nare not often observed in ocean interiors, except in regions where double\ndiffusion processes are important, leading to thermohaline staircases.

The entangled photons in IEQNET nodes\nare generated at multiple wavelengths, and are selectively distributed to the\ndesired users via transparent optical switches. Here we describe the network\narchitecture of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered hierarchy that\nleverages software-defined networking (SDN) technology to perform traditional\nwavelength routing and assignment between the Q-nodes. Specifically, SDN\ndecouples the control and data planes, with the control plane being entirely\nimplemented in the classical domain. We also discuss the IEQNET processes that\naddress issues associated with synchronization, calibration, network\nmonitoring, and scheduling. An important goal of IEQNET is to demonstrate the\nextent to which the control plane classical signals can co-propagate with the\ndata plane quantum signals in the same fiber lines (quantum-classical signal\n\"coexistence\"). This goal is furthered by the use of tunable narrow-band\noptical filtering at the receivers and, at least in some cases, a wide\nwavelength separation between the quantum and classical channels. We envision\nIEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks by\ndemonstrating metro-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement\ndistribution and quantum-state teleportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 23:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 02:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

We begin by developing the\ngeostrophic turbulence theory of boundary buoyancy anomalies in a fluid with\nvanishing potential vorticity. We find that the vertical stratification\ncontrols both the interaction range of boundary buoyancy anomalies and the\ndispersion of boundary-trapped Rossby waves. Buoyancy anomalies generate longer\nrange velocity fields and more dispersive Rossby waves over decreasing\nstratification [$\\mathrm{d}N(z)/\\mathrm{d}{z} \\leq 0$, where $N(z)$ is the\nbuoyancy frequency] than over increasing stratification\n[$\\mathrm{d}N(z)/\\mathrm{d}{z} \\geq 0$]. Consequently, the surface kinetic\nenergy spectrum is steeper over decreasing (mixed-layer like) stratification\nthan in the classical uniformly stratified model. We also find that the\nnonlinear interplay of Rossby waves with the turbulence spontaneously\nreorganizes the flow into homogenized zones of surface buoyancy separated by\nbuoyancy discontinuities, with sharp eastward jets centered at the\ndiscontinuities. Jet dynamics then depend on the vertical stratification. Over\ndecreasing stratification, we obtain straight jets perturbed by dispersive\neastward propagating waves. Over increasing stratification, we obtain\nmeandering jets whose shape evolves in time due to westward propagating weakly\ndispersive waves. Finally, we investigate normal modes in the presence of\nboundary-confined restoring forces, with the ultimate aim of obtaining an\nenergy-conserving modal truncation of the quasigeostrophic equations. Such a\nmodal truncation would generalize classical $N$-layer models to account for\nnon-isentropic boundaries. However, we find that the loss of a crucial symmetry\nin the vertical coupling between the modes prevents modal truncations from\nconserving energy, and so no such modal truncation is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 23:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

In real-world environments, choosing the set of possible\nvalues for robust RL can be a difficult task. When that set is specified too\nnarrowly, the agent will be left vulnerable to reasonable parameter values\nunaccounted for. When specified too broadly, the agent will be too cautious. In\nthis paper, we propose Feasible Adversarial Robust RL (FARR), a novel problem\nformulation and objective for automatically determining the set of environment\nparameter values over which to be robust. FARR implicitly defines the set of\nfeasible parameter values as those on which an agent could achieve a benchmark\nreward given enough training resources. By formulating this problem as a\ntwo-player zero-sum game, optimizing the FARR objective jointly produces an\nadversarial distribution over parameter values with feasible support and a\npolicy robust over this feasible parameter set. We demonstrate that approximate\nNash equilibria for this objective can be found using a variation of the PSRO\nalgorithm.

Due to the limited resources of IoT devices,\ncloud-assisted training of CNN models has become the mainstream. However, most\nexisting related works suffer from a large amount of model parameter\ntransmission and weak model robustness. To this end, this paper proposes a\ncloud-assisted CNN training framework with low model parameter transmission and\nstrong model robustness. In the proposed framework, we first introduce MonoCNN,\nwhich contains only a few learnable filters, and other filters are\nnonlearnable. These nonlearnable filter parameters are generated according to\ncertain rules, i.e., the filter generation function (FGF), and can be saved and\nreproduced by a few random seeds. Thus, the cloud server only needs to send\nthese learnable filters and a few seeds to the IoT device. Compared to\ntransmitting all model parameters, sending several learnable filter parameters\nand seeds can significantly reduce parameter transmission. Then, we investigate\nmultiple FGFs and enable the IoT device to use the FGF to generate multiple\nfilters and combine them into MonoCNN. Thus, MonoCNN is affected not only by\nthe training data but also by the FGF. The rules of the FGF play a role in\nregularizing the MonoCNN, thereby improving its robustness. Experimental\nresults show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, our proposed framework\ncan reduce a large amount of model parameter transfer between the cloud server\nand the IoT device while improving the performance by approximately 2.2% when\ndealing with corrupted data.

The facility of its non-invasive acquisition makes retinal\nfundus imaging amenable to such automated approaches. Recent work in analyzing\nfundus images using CNNs relies on access to massive data for training and\nvalidation - hundreds of thousands of images. However, data residency and data\nprivacy restrictions stymie the applicability of this approach in medical\nsettings where patient confidentiality is a mandate. Here, we showcase results\nfor the performance of DL on small datasets to classify patient sex from fundus\nimages - a trait thought not to be present or quantifiable in fundus images\nuntil recently. We fine-tune a Resnet-152 model whose last layer has been\nmodified for binary classification. In several experiments, we assess\nperformance in the small dataset context using one private (DOVS) and one\npublic (ODIR) data source. Our models, developed using approximately 2500\nfundus images, achieved test AUC scores of up to 0.72 (95% CI: [0.67, 0.77]).\nThis corresponds to a mere 25% decrease in performance despite a nearly\n1000-fold decrease in the dataset size compared to prior work in the\nliterature. Even with a hard task like sex categorization from retinal images,\nwe find that classification is possible with very small datasets. Additionally,\nwe perform domain adaptation experiments between DOVS and ODIR; explore the\neffect of data curation on training and generalizability; and investigate model\nensembling to maximize CNN classifier performance in the context of small\ndevelopment datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 02:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

However, all\nexisting caption editing works are implicit models, ie, they directly produce\nthe refined captions without explicit connections to the reference captions. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new task: Explicit Caption Editing (ECE). ECE models\nexplicitly generate a sequence of edit operations, and this edit operation\nsequence can translate the reference caption into a refined one. Compared to\nthe implicit editing, ECE has multiple advantages: 1) Explainable: it can trace\nthe whole editing path. 2) Editing Efficient: it only needs to modify a few\nwords. 3) Human-like: it resembles the way that humans perform caption editing,\nand tries to keep original sentence structures. To solve this new task, we\npropose the first ECE model: TIger. TIger is a non-autoregressive\ntransformer-based model, consisting of three modules: Tagger_del, Tagger_add,\nand Inserter. Specifically, Tagger_del decides whether each word should be\npreserved or not, Tagger_add decides where to add new words, and Inserter\npredicts the specific word for adding. To further facilitate ECE research, we\npropose two new ECE benchmarks by re-organizing two existing datasets, dubbed\nCOCO-EE and Flickr30K-EE, respectively. Extensive ablations on both two\nbenchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of TIger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 02:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Prior TTA methods optimize over unsupervised objectives such as the\nentropy of model predictions in TENT [Wang et al., 2021], but it is unclear\nwhat exactly makes a good TTA loss. In this paper, we start by presenting a\nsurprising phenomenon: if we attempt to meta-learn the best possible TTA loss\nover a wide class of functions, then we recover a function that is remarkably\nsimilar to (a temperature-scaled version of) the softmax-entropy employed by\nTENT. This only holds, however, if the classifier we are adapting is trained\nvia cross-entropy; if trained via squared loss, a different best TTA loss\nemerges. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze TTA through the lens of the\ntraining losses's convex conjugate. We show that under natural conditions, this\n(unsupervised) conjugate function can be viewed as a good local approximation\nto the original supervised loss and indeed, it recovers the best losses found\nby meta-learning. This leads to a generic recipe that can be used to find a\ngood TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general\nclass. Empirically, our approach consistently dominates other baselines over a\nwide range of benchmarks. Our approach is particularly of interest when applied\nto classifiers trained with novel loss functions, e.g., the recently-proposed\nPolyLoss, where it differs substantially from (and outperforms) an\nentropy-based loss. Further, we show that our approach can also be interpreted\nas a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which we refer to\nas the conjugate pseudolabel.

However, performance on leaderboards is\ngenerally achieved by leveraging massive amounts of training data, and rarely\nby encoding explicit linguistic knowledge into neural models. This has led many\nto question the relevance of linguistics for modern natural language\nprocessing. In this dissertation, I present several case studies to illustrate\nhow theoretical linguistics and neural language models are still relevant to\neach other. First, language models are useful to linguists by providing an\nobjective tool to measure semantic distance, which is difficult to do using\ntraditional methods. On the other hand, linguistic theory contributes to\nlanguage modelling research by providing frameworks and sources of data to\nprobe our language models for specific aspects of language understanding.\n  This thesis contributes three studies that explore different aspects of the\nsyntax-semantics interface in language models. In the first part of my thesis,\nI apply language models to the problem of word class flexibility. Using mBERT\nas a source of semantic distance measurements, I present evidence in favour of\nanalyzing word class flexibility as a directional process. In the second part\nof my thesis, I propose a method to measure surprisal at intermediate layers of\nlanguage models. My experiments show that sentences containing morphosyntactic\nanomalies trigger surprisals earlier in language models than semantic and\ncommonsense anomalies. Finally, in the third part of my thesis, I adapt several\npsycholinguistic studies to show that language models contain knowledge of\nargument structure constructions. In summary, my thesis develops new\nconnections between natural language processing, linguistic theory, and\npsycholinguistics to provide fresh perspectives for the interpretation of\nlanguage models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 04:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

To remedy this issue, we propose\na novel approach, namely GenText, to achieve general artistic text style\ntransfer by separably migrating the font and texture styles from the different\nsource images to the target images in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our\ncurrent work incorporates three different stages, stylization, destylization,\nand font transfer, respectively, into a unified platform with a single powerful\nencoder network and two separate style generator networks, one for font\ntransfer, the other for stylization and destylization. The destylization stage\nfirst extracts the font style of the font reference image, then the font\ntransfer stage generates the target content with the desired font style.\nFinally, the stylization stage renders the resulted font image with respect to\nthe texture style in the reference image. Moreover, considering the difficult\ndata acquisition of paired artistic text images, our model is designed under\nthe unsupervised setting, where all stages can be effectively optimized from\nunpaired data. Qualitative and quantitative results are performed on artistic\ntext benchmarks, which demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed\nmodel.

In this paper, we investigate\nan essentially important question which has been largely ignored by the\nprevious literature: how many bits are needed for representing gradients in\ntraining GBDT? To solve this mystery, we propose to quantize all the\nhigh-precision gradients in a very simple yet effective way in the GBDT's\ntraining algorithm. Surprisingly, both our theoretical analysis and empirical\nstudies show that the necessary precisions of gradients without hurting any\nperformance can be quite low, e.g., 2 or 3 bits.

The extensive\nexperimental results confirm that not only the proposed method can achieve\nhigher classification accuracy in a noisy and high-dimensional classification\ntask, but also it would select those more informative features for the decoding\nscenarios. Integrating the correntropy learning approach with the automatic\nrelevance determination technique will significantly improve the robustness\nwith respect to the noise, leading to more adequate robust sparse brain\ndecoding algorithm. It provides a more powerful approach in the real-world\nbrain activity decoding and the brain-computer interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 06:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

However, labeling such data is expensive\nand time-consuming. As the crowd-sourcing labeling process and the ambiguities\nof the objects may raise noisy bounding box annotations, the object detectors\nwill suffer from the degenerated training data. In this work, we aim to address\nthe challenge of learning robust object detectors with inaccurate bounding\nboxes. Inspired by the fact that localization precision suffers significantly\nfrom inaccurate bounding boxes while classification accuracy is less affected,\nwe propose leveraging classification as a guidance signal for refining\nlocalization results. Specifically, by treating an object as a bag of\ninstances, we introduce an Object-Aware Multiple Instance Learning approach\n(OA-MIL), featured with object-aware instance selection and object-aware\ninstance extension. The former aims to select accurate instances for training,\ninstead of directly using inaccurate box annotations. The latter focuses on\ngenerating high-quality instances for selection.

It greatly limits the capability of modeling the\nlong-range temporal dependencies since the temporal features learned by\none-order interactions cannot be maintained for a long term due to temporal\ninformation dilution and gradient vanishing. To tackle this limitation, we\npropose the Non-local Recurrent Neural Memory (NRNM) for supervised sequence\nrepresentation learning, which performs non-local operations \\MR{by means of\nself-attention mechanism} to learn full-order interactions within a sliding\ntemporal memory block and models global interactions between memory blocks in a\ngated recurrent manner. Consequently, our model is able to capture long-range\ndependencies. Besides, the latent high-level features contained in high-order\ninteractions can be distilled by our model. We validate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of our NRNM on three types of sequence applications across\ndifferent modalities, including sequence classification, step-wise sequential\nprediction and sequence similarity learning. Our model compares favorably\nagainst other state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each of these\nsequence applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Various\nattempts have been made to derive the magnetic field strength and structure of\nnearby galaxy clusters using Faraday rotation of extended cluster radio\nsources. This approach needs to make various assumptions that could be\ncircumvented when using background radio sources. However, because the number\nof polarised radio sources behind clusters is low, at the moment such a study\ncan only be done statistically. In this paper, we investigate the\ndepolarisation of radio sources inside and behind clusters in a sample of 124\nmassive clusters at $z<0.35$ observed with the Karl G.

First, we examine the\nprobability of experiencing flybys or encounters: More than 50\\% of stars with\nplanet-forming discs in a typical star forming environment should experience a\nclose stellar encounter or flyby within 1000 au. Second, we detail the\ndynamical effects of flybys on planet-forming discs. Prograde, parabolic,\ndisc-penetrating flybys are the most destructive. Grazing and penetrating\nflybys in particular lead to the capture of disc material by the secondary to\nform a highly misaligned circumsecondary disc with respect to the disc around\nthe primary. One or both discs may undergo extreme accretion and outburst\nevents, similar to the ones observed in FU Orionis-type stars. Warps and broken\ndiscs are distinct signatures of retrograde flybys. Third, we review some\nrecently observed stellar systems with discs where a stellar flyby or an\nencounter is suspected -- including UX Tau, RW Aur, AS 205, Z CMa, and FU Ori.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of stellar flybys for planet formation and\nexoplanet demographics, including possible imprints of a flyby in the Solar\nSystem in the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects and the Sun's obliquity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 08:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 16:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

The focus is on the non-dissipative case when the elastomer is an\nelastic solid, the liquid making up the inclusions is an elastic fluid, the\ninterfaces separating the solid elastomer from the liquid inclusions are\nelastic interfaces featuring an initial surface tension, and the inclusions are\ninitially $n$-spherical ($n=2,3$) in shape. Remarkably, in spite of the\npresence of local residual stresses within the inclusions due to an initial\nsurface tension at the interfaces, the macroscopic response of such filled\nelastomers turns out to be that of a linear elastic solid that is free of\nresidual stresses and hence one that is simply characterized by an effective\nmodulus of elasticity $\\bar{\\textbf{L}}$.

The penalty of spikes-based encoding has\nbeen the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using\nspikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation\n(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs\ncan be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major\nadvancement toward native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate\nBackpropagation using spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased\nforward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such\nphases necessitates external memory and computational access. This is a\nchallenge for neuromorphic hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose\na stochastic SNN-based Back-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite\nneuron to simultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass\ngradients explicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a\nchallenge for spike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the\ngradient signal into positive and negative streams. The composite neuron\nencodes information in the form of stochastic spike-trains and converts\nBackpropagation weight updates into temporally and spatially local discrete\nSTDP-like spike coincidence updates compatible with hardware-friendly Resistive\nProcessing Units (RPUs). Furthermore, our method approaches BP ANN baseline\nwith sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that softmax\ncross-entropy loss function can be implemented through inhibitory lateral\nconnections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN shows excellent\ngeneralization through comparable performance to ANNs on the MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST and Extended MNIST datasets. Thus, SSNN-BP enables BP compatible\nwith purely spike-based neuromorphic hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 08:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Some early success has been achieved under simplifying\nconditions, such as radially-varying reaction coefficients under revolution\nsymmetry, on a disk or a sphere.

The main issue is that the equations become singular in\nthe radius; when applying the backstepping method, the same type of singularity\nappears in the kernel equations.

Combining the four\nnights and comparing our transmission spectrum to planetary atmosphere models\ncontaining the signature of individual molecules within the cross-correlation\nframework, we find the presence of H2O, CH4, NH3 and HCN with high\nsignificance, tentative detection of CO2, and inconclusive results for C2H2 and\nCO. A qualitative interpretation of these results, using physically motivated\nmodels, suggests an atmosphere consistent with solar composition and the\npresence of disequilibrium chemistry and we therefore recommend the inclusion\nof the latter in future modelling of sub-1000K planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This creates the\nneed to model a stabilised anisotropic backward evolution and to devise an\nappropriate numerical algorithm for this ill-posed process.\n  We address both challenges. First we introduce stabilised inverse flowline\nevolution (SIFE) as an anisotropic image sharpening flow. Outside extrema, its\npartial differential equation (PDE) is backward parabolic in gradient\ndirection. Interestingly, it is sufficient to stabilise it in extrema by\nimposing a zero flow there. We show that morphological derivatives - which are\nnot common in the numerics of PDEs - are ideal for the numerical approximation\nof SIFE: They effortlessly approximate directional derivatives in gradient\ndirection. Our scheme adapts one-sided morphological derivatives to the\nunderlying image structure. It allows to progress in subpixel accuracy and\nenables us to prove stability properties. Our experiments show that SIFE allows\nnonflat steady states and outperforms other sharpening flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The first truly\noptimal Schwarz method that converges in a finite number of steps was proposed\nin 1994 and used precisely transparent boundary conditions as transmission\nconditions between subdomains.

In this first paper, we focus on how the\naccreted ice determines the distribution of iron between the mantle (oxidized\nFeO and FeO$_{1.5}$) and the core (metallic Fe and FeS). We find that an\ninitial primitive composition of ice-rich material leads, upon heating by the\ndecay of $^{26}$Al, to extensive water flow and the formation of clay minerals\ninside planetesimals. Metallic iron dissolves in liquid water and precipitates\nas oxidized magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$. Further heating by $^{26}$Al destabilizes\nthe clay at a temperature of around 900 K. The released supercritical water\nejects the entire water content from the planetesimal. Upon reaching the\nsilicate melting temperature of 1,700 K, planetesimals further differentiate\ninto a core (made mainly of iron sulfide FeS) and a mantle with a high fraction\nof oxidized iron.

Despite a lot of\neffort, it is still not known today whether a deterministic polynomial-time\nalgorithm exists. This makes the exact matching problem an important candidate\nto test the popular conjecture that the complexity classes P and RP are equal.\nIn a recent article, progress was made towards this goal by showing that for\n(bipartite) graphs of bounded (bipartite) independence number, a polynomial\ntime algorithm exists. In terms of parameterized complexity, this algorithm was\nan XP-algorithm parameterized by the independence number. In this article, we\nimprove the techniques to obtain an FPT-algorithm for bipartite graphs. If the\ninput is a general graph we show that one can at least compute a perfect\nmatching $M$ which has the correct number of red edges modulo 2. This is\nmotivated by our last result, in which we prove that an FPT algorithm for\ngeneral graphs reduces to the problem of finding in polynomial time a perfect\nmatching $M$ with the correct number of red edges modulo 2 and additionally at\nmost $k$ red edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 10:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The energy released by the decay\nof $^{26}$Al melts the accreted ice to form clay (phyllosilicates), oxidized\niron (FeO), and a water surface layer with ten times the mass of Earth's modern\noceans. The ocean--atmosphere system undergoes a run-away greenhouse effect\nafter the effective accretion temperature crosses a threshold of around 300 K.\nThe run-away greenhouse process vaporizes the water layer, thereby trapping the\naccretion heat and heating the surface to more than 6,000 K. This causes the\nupper part of the mantle to melt and form a global magma ocean. Metal melt\nseparates from silicate melt and sediments towards the bottom of the magma\nocean; the gravitational energy released by the sedimentation leads to positive\nfeedback where the beginning differentiation of the planet causes the whole\nmantle to melt and differentiate. All rocky planets thus naturally experience a\nmagma ocean stage.

Classical teleoperation schemes are based on either\njoystick control, or on more intuitive interfaces which map directly the user\narm motions into one robot arm's motions. These approaches have limits when the\nexecution of a given task requires reconfigurable multiple robotic arm systems.\nIndeed, the simultaneous teleoperation of two or more robot arms could extend\nthe workspace of the manipulation cell, or increase its total payload, or\nafford other advantages. In different phases of a reconfigurable multi-arm\nsystem, each robot could act as an independent arm, or as one of a pair of\ncooperating arms, or as one of the fingers of a virtual, large robot hand. This\nmanuscript proposes a novel telemanipulation framework that enables both the\nindividual and combined control of any number of robotic arms. Thanks to the\ndesigned control architecture, the human operator can intuitively choose the\nproposed control modalities and the manipulators that make the task convenient\nto execute through the user interface. Moreover, through the tele-impedance\nparadigm, the system can address complex tasks that require physical\ninteraction by letting the robot mimic the arm impedance and position\nreferences of the human operator. The proposed framework is validated with 8\nsubjects controlling 4 Franka Emika Panda robots with 7-DoFs to execute a\ntelemanipulation task. Qualitative results of the experiments show us the\npromising applicability of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 10:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Two\nresearchers hand-coded a random sample of 2,000 sentences. We then trained\nmachine learning models to classify all 187,240 sentences as contributing or\nnot contributing to content categories.

It is\nfound that for tracer in ultra-soft colloidal fluid, at long times, the motion\nis diffusive for all tracer types, however the relaxation time (or diffusion\nconstant) increases (or decreases) with increasing hardness of tracer at a\ngiven temperature. Interestingly, for tracer in hard colloidal fluid, the\nmotion changes from a free diffusion (continuous trajectory) to that of hopping\nwhere there is intermittent jumps following a long period of localized\nvibrations and consequently displacement distribution function show higher\norder peaks indicating different dynamics at different time (or length) scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 11:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Periodic driving is known to be a powerful tool for enriching\nsuch exotic phases, which leads to various phenomena with no static analogs.\nOne such phenomenon is the emergence of the elusive $pi/2$ modes, i.e., a type\nof topological boundary state pinned at a quarter of the driving frequency. The\nlatter may lead to the formation of Floquet parafermions in the presence of\ninteraction, which is known to support more computational power than Majorana\nparticles. In this work, we experimentally verify the signature of $\\pi/2$\nmodes in an acoustic waveguide array, which is designed to simulate a\nsquare-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.

A common generic\nblade tip model is created and tested in a wind tunnel under operating\nconditions ranging from low-subsonic to transonic. A multi-cutoff superposition\ntechnique is developed to achieve better flow visualization. Quantitative image\nprocessing is performed to extract the flow structures and the instability\nmodes. Additional numerical simulations are performed to help classify the\nobserved flow structures. Unsteady flow structures such as over-tip shock\noscillation, shear-layer flapping, and vortex shedding are revealed by Fourier\nanalysis and dynamic mode decomposition. The results show that, under subsonic\nconditions, the trigger position of the shear layer instability is\nmonotonically delayed as the blade loading increases; however, this pattern is\nreversed under transonic conditions. This implies that flow compressibility,\nflow acceleration, and the oscillation of over-tip shock waves are critical\nfactors related to tip flow instabilities. The over-tip shock waves are\nobserved to be locked-in by frequency and position with the shear-layer\nflapping mode. An intermittent flow mode, termed the escaping vortex-shedding\nmode, is also observed. These flow structures are key factors in the control of\ntip leakage flows. Based on the observed flow dynamics, a schematic drawing of\ntip leakage flow structures and related motions is proposed.

We consider\na seller of $m$ items, facing a single buyer with valuation $v$. We observe\nthat previous attempts to define complexity measures often fail to classify\nmechanisms that are intuitively considered simple (e.g., the \"selling\nseparately\" mechanism) as such. We suggest to view a menu as simple if a bundle\nthat maximizes the buyer's profit can be found by conducting a few primitive\noperations that are considered simple. The \\emph{primitive complexity of a\nmenu} is the number of primitive operations needed to (adaptively) find a\nprofit-maximizing entry in the menu. In this paper, the primitive operation\nthat we study is essentially computing the outcome of the \"selling separately\"\nmechanism.\n  Does the primitive complexity capture the simplicity of other auctions that\nare intuitively simple? We consider \\emph{bundle-size pricing}, a common\npricing method in which the price of a bundle depends only on its size. Our\nmain technical contribution is determining the primitive complexity of\nbundle-size pricing menus in various settings. We show that for any\ndistribution $\\cal D$ over weighted matroid rank valuations, even distributions\nwith arbitrary correlation among their values, there is always a bundle-size\npricing menu with low primitive complexity that achieves almost the same\nrevenue as the optimal bundle-size pricing menu. As part of this proof we\nprovide a randomized algorithm that for any weighted matroid rank valuation $v$\nand integer $k$, finds the most valuable set of size $k$ with only a\npoly-logarithmic number of demand and value queries. We show that this result\nis essentially tight in several aspects. For example, if the valuation $v$ is\nsubmodular, then finding the most valuable set of size $k$ requires\nexponentially many queries (this solves an open question of Badanidiyuru et al.\n[EC'12]).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 12:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Imposed MHD effects, within flows which\nexhibit multiple shock interactions, are consequential for emerging aerospace\ntechnologies: including aerodynamic control via magnetic actuation. However,\nnumerical modelling of this flow type remains challenging due to the\nsensitivity of feature formation and the real gas modelling of weakly ionised,\nelectrically conductive, air plasma. In this work, numerical simulation\ncapabilities have been developed for the study of MHD affected, hypersonic\nflows, around 2D axisymmetric non-simple geometries.

Due to the (quasi) lossless indium\noxide interconnect which we employ for the first time in all-perovskite\ntandems, the $V_{OC}$ improvements achieved in the high-gap perovskites\ntranslate directly to improved all-perovskite tandem solar cells with a\nchampion $V_{OC}$ of 2.00 V and a stabilized efficiency of 23.7%.

For the purpose of validation we concentrate on those\nphase space regions where Photos is not expected to work on the basis of its\ndesign alone. These phase space regions of hard, non-collinear photons, do not\ncontribute to large logarithmic terms. We find that in these phase space\nregions the differences between Photos and MadGraph results do not surpass a\nfew percent and these regions, in turn, contribute about 10% to the observed\nprocess rates. This is encouraging in view of the possible ambiguities for\nprecise calculation of realistic observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 13:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Mobile robots usually have an environment map and\nenvironment information can be assigned to the map. Important information for\nmobile robots such as no entry zone can be predicted if localization has\nsucceeded since relative pose of them can be known. However, this prediction is\nfailed when localization does not work. Uncertainty of pose estimate must be\nconsidered for robustly using the map information. In addition, robots have\nexternal sensors and environment information can be recognized using the\nsensors. This on-line recognition of course contains uncertainty; however, it\nhas to be fused with the map information for robust environment recognition\nsince the map also contains uncertainty owing to over time. SLAMER can\nsimultaneously cope with these uncertainties and achieves accurate localization\nand environment recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate LiDAR-based\nimplementation of SLAMER in two cases. In the first case, we use the\nSemanticKITTI dataset and show that SLAMER achieves accurate estimate more than\ntraditional methods. In the second case, we use an indoor mobile robot and show\nthat unmeasurable environmental objects such as open doors and no entry lines\ncan be recognized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Until recently, no clear observational evidence for this\nphenomenon was found.

In the regions of magnetic arms, higher order and lower energy\ndensity of the magnetic field is found than in the stellar spiral arms. The\nglobal temperature of the hot gas is roughly constant throughout the disk. The\ncomparison of the findings with those obtained for the starburst galaxy M83\nsuggests that magnetic reconnection heating may be present in the halo of\nNGC628.

In this work, we\nfocus on adjusting for mark-point dependence when estimating the mean and\ncovariance functions of the mark process, given independent replicates of the\nmarked point process. We assume that the mark process is a Gaussian process and\nthe point process is a log-Gaussian Cox process, where the mark-point\ndependence is generated through the dependence between two latent Gaussian\nprocesses. Under this framework, naive local linear estimators ignoring the\nmark-point dependence can be severely biased. We show that this bias can be\ncorrected using a local linear estimator of the cross-covariance function and\nestablish uniform convergence rates of the bias-corrected estimators.\nFurthermore, we propose a test statistic based on local linear estimators for\nmark-point independence, which is shown to converge to an asymptotic normal\ndistribution in a parametric $\\sqrt{n}$-convergence rate.

In this paper, we present a novel architecture\nnamed GP-Graph which has collective group representations for effective\npedestrian trajectory prediction in crowded environments, and is compatible\nwith all types of existing approaches. A key idea of GP-Graph is to model both\nindividual-wise and group-wise relations as graph representations. To do this,\nGP-Graph first learns to assign each pedestrian into the most likely behavior\ngroup. Using this assignment information, GP-Graph then forms both intra- and\ninter-group interactions as graphs, accounting for human-human relations within\na group and group-group relations, respectively. To be specific, for the\nintra-group interaction, we mask pedestrian graph edges out of an associated\ngroup. We also propose group pooling&unpooling operations to represent a group\nwith multiple pedestrians as one graph node. Lastly, GP-Graph infers a\nprobability map for socially-acceptable future trajectories from the integrated\nfeatures of both group interactions. Moreover, we introduce a group-level\nlatent vector sampling to ensure collective inferences over a set of possible\nfuture trajectories.

Understanding such systems can be difficult because\nof the spatially- and temporally-varying properties of the gel, and the complex\nrelationships between the fluid dynamics, elastic deformation of the gel and\nchemical interaction between the polymer and fluid. We address this using a\nporo-elastic model, considering the dynamics of a thermo-responsive spherical\nhydrogel after a sudden change in the temperature that should result in\nsubstantial swelling or shrinking. We focus on two model examples, with\nequilibrium parameters extracted from data in the literature.

An approximate analytical form for the front dynamics is developed, with\ntwo levels of constant porosity, that well-approximates the numerical\nsolutions.

Interestingly, a particular theoretical\ndevelopment of quantum mechanics, called the process matrix formalism (PMF),\nfeatures another kind of nonseparability, called causal nonseparability. The\nPMF appeals to the notion of quantum process, which is a generalisation of the\nconcept of quantum state allowing to represent quantum-like correlations\nbetween quantum events over multiple parties without specifying a priori their\nspatiotemporal locations. Crucially, since the PMF makes no assumption about\nthe global causal structure between quantum events, it allows for the existence\nof causally nonseparable quantum processes having an indefinite causal\nstructure. This work aims at investigating the philosophical implications of\ncausal nonseparability, especially for the notion of spatiotemporal relations.\nA preliminary discussion will study the formal connection between quantum and\ncausal nonseparability. It will be emphasised that, although quantum processes\ncan be seen as a generalisation of density matrices, the conceptual distinction\nbetween the two notions yields significant differences between quantum and\ncausal nonseparability. From there, it will be shown that, depending on the\ninterpretative framework, causal nonseparability suggests some kind of\nindeterminacy of spatiotemporal relations. Namely, within a realist context,\nspatiotemporal relations can be epistemically or metaphysically indeterminate.\nFinally, it will be argued that, in spite of the disanalogies between standard\nand causal nonseparability, similar implications for spatial relations can\nalready be defended in the context of standard quantum mechanics.

In this\nprescription, the non-perturbative vertex function is improved by subtracting\nunwanted finite lattice spacing ($a$) effects, calculated in lattice\nperturbation theory. The method is versatile and can be applied to a wide range\nof fermion and gluon actions, as well as types of nonlocal operators. The\npresence of operator mixing can also be accommodated.\n  Compared to the standard RI' prescription, this variant can be recast as a\nsupplementary finite renormalization, whose coefficients bring about\ncorrections of higher order in $a$; consequently, it coincides with standard\nRI' as $a\\to 0$, however it can afford us a smoother and more controlled\nextrapolation to the continuum limit.\n  In this proof-of-concept calculation we focus on nonlocal fermion bilinear\noperators containing a straight Wilson line. In the numerical implementation we\nuse Wilson/clover fermions and Iwasaki improved gluons. The finite-$a$ terms\nwere calculated to one-loop level in lattice perturbation theory, and to all\norders in $a$, using the same action as the non-perturbative vertex functions.\nWe find that the method leads to significant improvement in the perturbative\nregion indicated by small and intermediate values of the length of the Wilson\nline. This results in a robust extraction of the renormalization functions in\nthat region.\n  We have also applied the above method to operators with stout-smeared links.\nWe show how to perform the perturbative correction for any number of smearing\niterations, and evaluate its effect on the power divergent renormalization\ncoefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 15:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However,\nthere are few studies in this area for sound generation. In this study, we\ninvestigate generating sound conditioned on a text prompt and propose a novel\ntext-to-sound generation framework that consists of a text encoder, a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), a decoder, and a vocoder. The\nframework first uses the decoder to transfer the text features extracted from\nthe text encoder to a mel-spectrogram with the help of VQ-VAE, and then the\nvocoder is used to transform the generated mel-spectrogram into a waveform. We\nfound that the decoder significantly influences the generation performance.\nThus, we focus on designing a good decoder in this study. We begin with the\ntraditional autoregressive decoder, which has been proved as a state-of-the-art\nmethod in previous sound generation works. However, the AR decoder always\npredicts the mel-spectrogram tokens one by one in order, which introduces the\nunidirectional bias and accumulation of errors problems.

An upper distance limit of\nabout 8,000 AU is given by both the sensitivities of these surveys and the\ndistance at which proper motion becomes too small to be detected. This paper\ncovers the region from 8,000 AU to 700 AU. We have used a series of filtering\nand SED-fitting algorithms to find candidate pairs, whose IRAS and AKARI flux\nmeasurements could together plausibly be fitted by a Planck thermal\ndistribution for a likely planetary temperature. Theoretical studies have\nplaced various constraints on the likely existence of unknown planets in the\nouter solar system. The main observational constraint to date comes from a WISE\nstudy: an upper limit on an unknown planet's mass out into the Oort cloud.

In addition, the analysis demonstrates that, throughout the inference\nprocess, the loss function is mostly affected by the noise of the layer inputs.\nIn particular, we will demonstrate that neural networks with massive identity\nmappings are resistant to the quantization method. It is also difficult to\nimprove the performance of these networks using quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 10:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

However,\ntraditional SBPP research often focuses on cases of empty machines, whose\nobjective, i.e., to minimize the number of used machines, is not well-defined\nfor the more common reality with nonempty machines.

For the execution of\ntrained CNNs, i.e. model inference, we nowadays witness a shift from the Cloud\nto the Edge. Unfortunately, deploying and inferring large, compute and memory\nintensive CNNs on edge devices is challenging because these devices typically\nhave limited power budgets and compute/memory resources. One approach to\naddress this challenge is to leverage all available resources across multiple\nedge devices to deploy and execute a large CNN by properly partitioning the CNN\nand running each CNN partition on a separate edge device. Although such\ndistribution, deployment, and execution of large CNNs on multiple edge devices\nis a desirable and beneficial approach, there currently does not exist a design\nand programming framework that takes a trained CNN model, together with a CNN\npartitioning specification, and fully automates the CNN model splitting and\ndeployment on multiple edge devices to facilitate distributed CNN inference at\nthe Edge.

The goal is to allow new students and\nresearchers to quickly get started in the research area and to skip many of the\ninitial steps, often consuming unnecessarily long time from the scientific\nadvancement of the field. This is achieved by providing a step-by-step guide to\nthe components necessary to understand and implement the theory, as well as\nextending the supplied MATLAB code. The continuous design representation used\nand how it is connected to the Brinkman penalty approach, for simulating an\nimmersed solid in a fluid domain, is illustrated. The different interpretations\nof the Brinkman penalty term and how to chose the penalty parameters are\nexplained. The accuracy of the Brinkman penalty approach is analysed through\nparametric simulations of a reference geometry. The chosen finite element\nformulation and the solution method is explained. The minimum dissipated energy\noptimisation problem is defined and how to solve it using an optimality\ncriteria solver and a continuation scheme is discussed. The included MATLAB\nimplementation is documented, with details on the mesh, pre-processing,\noptimisation and post-processing. The code has two benchmark examples\nimplemented and the application of the code to these is reviewed. Subsequently,\nseveral modifications to the code for more complicated examples are presented\nthrough provided code modifications and explanations. Lastly, the computational\nperformance of the code is examined through studies of the computational time\nand memory usage, along with recommendations to decrease computational time\nthrough approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 22:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Recent advances in the computation\ncapabilities of wearables make it possible to target complex scenarios by\nexploiting multiple biosignals and using high-performance algorithms, such as\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs). There is, however, a trade-off between performance\nof the algorithms and the low-power requirements of IoT platforms with limited\nresources. Besides, physically larger and multi-biosignal-based wearables bring\nsignificant discomfort to the patients. Consequently, reducing power\nconsumption and discomfort is necessary for patients to use IoT devices\ncontinuously during everyday life. To overcome these challenges, in the context\nof epileptic seizure detection, we propose a many-to-one signals knowledge\ndistillation approach targeting single-biosignal processing in IoT wearable\nsystems. The starting point is to get a highly-accurate multi-biosignal DNN,\nthen apply our approach to develop a single-biosignal DNN solution for IoT\nsystems that achieves an accuracy comparable to the original multi-biosignal\nDNN.

Analysis of simulated\natmospheric transmissivity from the MODTRAN radiative transfer model shows that\nspectral slopes of transmissivity spectra are relatively insensitive to choice\nof model atmopshere, with variations in atmospheric path length and aerosol\noptical depth primarily affecting the bias of the spectrum rather than the\nslope.
