This area of study has a long\ntradition in stochastic programming. However, the literature is lacking\nconsistency analysis for problems in which the decision variables are taken\nfrom an infinite-dimensional space, which arise in optimal control, scientific\nmachine learning, and statistical estimation. By exploiting the typical problem\nstructures found in these applications that give rise to hidden norm\ncompactness properties for solution sets, we prove consistency results for\nnonconvex risk-averse stochastic optimization problems formulated in\ninfinite-dimensional space. The proof is based on several crucial results from\nthe theory of variational convergence.

In literature, this task is often used as\na pre-training objective to forge architectures able to jointly deal with\nimages and texts. Nonetheless, it has a direct downstream application:\ncross-modal retrieval, which consists in finding images related to a given\nquery text or vice-versa. Solving this task is of critical importance in\ncross-modal search engines. Many recent methods proposed effective solutions to\nthe image-text matching problem, mostly using recent large vision-language (VL)\nTransformer networks. However, these models are often computationally\nexpensive, especially at inference time. This prevents their adoption in\nlarge-scale cross-modal retrieval scenarios, where results should be provided\nto the user almost instantaneously. In this paper, we propose to fill in the\ngap between effectiveness and efficiency by proposing an ALign And DIstill\nNetwork (ALADIN). ALADIN first produces high-effective scores by aligning at\nfine-grained level images and texts. Then, it learns a shared embedding space -\nwhere an efficient kNN search can be performed - by distilling the relevance\nscores obtained from the fine-grained alignments.

Binaries where the progenitor is paired with a low-mass star in a tight\norbit can produce rapidly spinning BHs (through tides), whereas those with\nmassive companions cannot (as they do not fit in such an orbit). A few\nrapidly-spinning black holes (BHs) have been observed paired with very massive\ncompanion stars, defying stellar-formation paradigm.

However, people actually read text character by\ncharacter, especially for ideograms such as Chinese. This raises the question:\nare segmentation-free strategies really the best solution to HCTR?

However, due to the partial\nobservation, the high-dynamic-range lighting, and the intrinsic ambiguity of a\nscene, lighting estimation remains a challenging task. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose a coupled dual-StyleGAN panorama synthesis network (StyleLight) that\nintegrates LDR and HDR panorama synthesis into a unified framework. The LDR and\nHDR panorama synthesis share a similar generator but have separate\ndiscriminators. During inference, given an LDR LFOV image, we propose a\nfocal-masked GAN inversion method to find its latent code by the LDR panorama\nsynthesis branch and then synthesize the HDR panorama by the HDR panorama\nsynthesis branch. StyleLight takes LFOV-to-panorama and LDR-to-HDR lighting\ngeneration into a unified framework and thus greatly improves lighting\nestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves\nsuperior performance over state-of-the-art methods on indoor lighting\nestimation.

This process is often time-consuming, especially\nfor EEG recordings that last hours or days. To expedite the process, a\nreliable, automated, and patient-independent seizure detector is essential.\nHowever, developing a patient-independent seizure detector is challenging as\nseizures exhibit diverse characteristics across patients and recording devices.\nIn this study, we propose a patient-independent seizure detector to\nautomatically detect seizures in both scalp EEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG).\nFirst, we deploy a convolutional neural network with transformers and belief\nmatching loss to detect seizures in single-channel EEG segments. Next, we\nextract regional features from the channel-level outputs to detect seizures in\nmulti-channel EEG segments. At last, we apply postprocessing filters to the\nsegment-level outputs to determine seizures' start and end points in\nmulti-channel EEGs. Finally, we introduce the minimum overlap evaluation\nscoring as an evaluation metric that accounts for minimum overlap between the\ndetection and seizure, improving upon existing assessment metrics. We trained\nthe seizure detector on the Temple University Hospital Seizure (TUH-SZ) dataset\nand evaluated it on five independent EEG datasets. We evaluate the systems with\nthe following metrics: sensitivity (SEN), precision (PRE), and average and\nmedian false positive rate per hour (aFPR/h and mFPR/h). Across four adult\nscalp EEG and iEEG datasets, we obtained SEN of 0.617-1.00, PRE of 0.534-1.00,\naFPR/h of 0.425-2.002, and mFPR/h of 0-1.003.

However, 3D\ncardiac motion estimation is challenging because the acquired cine CMR images\nare usually 2D slices which limit the accurate estimation of through-plane\nmotion. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-view motion\nestimation network (MulViMotion), which integrates 2D cine CMR images acquired\nin short-axis and long-axis planes to learn a consistent 3D motion field of the\nheart. In the proposed method, a hybrid 2D/3D network is built to generate\ndense 3D motion fields by learning fused representations from multi-view\nimages. To ensure that the motion estimation is consistent in 3D, a shape\nregularization module is introduced during training, where shape information\nfrom multi-view images is exploited to provide weak supervision to 3D motion\nestimation. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on 2D cine CMR images\nfrom 580 subjects of the UK Biobank study for 3D motion tracking of the left\nventricular myocardium.

In the real world though, people\nshow more complex expressions, and switch from one expression to another. We\nthus propose a new model that generates transitions between different\nexpressions, and synthesizes long and composed 4D expressions. This involves\nthree sub-problems: (i) modeling the temporal dynamics of expressions, (ii)\nlearning transitions between them, and (iii) deforming a generic mesh. We\npropose to encode the temporal evolution of expressions using the motion of a\nset of 3D landmarks, that we learn to generate by training a manifold-valued\nGAN (Motion3DGAN). To allow the generation of composed expressions, this model\naccepts two labels encoding the starting and the ending expressions.

Processing UHTC\ntransition metal carbides as standalone materials using additive manufacturing\n(AM) methods has not been fully realized due to their extremely slow atomic\ndiffusivities that impede sintering and large volume changes during indirect AM\nthat can induce defect structures. In this work, a two-step, reactive AM\napproach was studied for the formation of the ultra-high temperature ceramic\nTiCx. Readily available equipment including a polymer powder bed fusion AM\nmachine and a traditional tube furnace were used to produce UHTC cubes and\nlattice structures with sub-millimeter resolution. This processing scheme\nincorporated, (1) selective laser sintering of a Ti precursor mixed with a\nphenolic binder for green body shaping, and (2) ex-situ, isothermal gas-solid\nconversion of the green body in CH4 to form TiCx structures. Reactive\npost-processing in CH4 resulted in up to 98.2 wt% TiC0.90 product yield and a\nreduction in net-shrinkage during consolidation due to the volume expansion\nassociated with the conversion of Ti to TiC. Results indicated that reaction\nbonding associated with the Gibbs free energy release associated with TiC\nformation produced interparticle adhesion at low furnace processing\ntemperatures. The ability to bond highly refractory materials through this type\nof process resulted in structures that were crack-free and resisted fracture\nduring thermal shock testing. Broadly, the additive manufacturing approach\npresented could be useful for the production of many UHTC carbides that might\notherwise be incompatible with prevailing AM techniques that do not include\nreaction synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 19:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 00:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 02:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

These statements were combined using the\ntransitive property of logic: If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C.\nHowever, in combining successive statements for the Frauchiger-Renner gedanken\nexperiment we show that quantum mechanics does not obey transitivity and that\nthis invalidates their analysis. We also demonstrate that certain pairs of\npremises among the four statements are logically incompatible, meaning that\nthey cannot all be used at once. To produce the contradiction, Frauchiger and\nRenner choose a particular run, which they call the 'OK'-'OKbar' one. However,\nthe restriction to this case invalidates 3 of the 4 statements. Thus, there are\n3 separate problems with logic in the 2018 publication.

Unlike structural\nproperties, assessing dynamic properties in CG modeling is often unfeasible due\nto the accelerated dynamics of the CG models, which allows for more efficient\nstructural sampling. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the present series of\narticles is to establish a better correspondence between the FG and CG\ndynamics. To assess and compare dynamical properties in the FG and the\ncorresponding CG models, we utilize the excess entropy scaling relationship.\nFor Paper I of this series, we provide evidence that the FG and the\ncorresponding CG counterpart follow the same universal scaling relationship. By\ncarefully reviewing and examining the literature, we develop a new theory to\ncalculate excess entropies for the FG and CG systems while accounting for\nentropy representability. We demonstrate that the excess entropy scaling idea\ncan be readily applied to liquid water and methanol systems at both the FG and\nCG resolutions. For both liquids, we reveal that the scaling exponents remain\nunchanged from the coarse-graining process, indicating that the scaling\nbehavior is universal for the same underlying molecular systems. Combining this\nfinding with the concept of mapping entropy in CG models, we show that the\nmissing entropy plays an important role in accelerating the CG dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 21:09:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 16:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Along this line, this paper will investigate in detail how these\nsupplementary controllers may affect electromechanical oscillations, by means\nof small-signal stability analysis. The paper analyses two control strategies\nbased on the modulation of active-power injections (P-WAF) and reactive-power\ninjections (Q-WAF) in the VSC stations.

This work\nproposes the combination of a coding and decoding scheme to be used along with\nspatial signal processing as a means to provide URLLC over a fading channel.\nThe paper advocates the use of random linear codes (RLCs) over a massive MIMO\n(mMIMO) channel with standard zero-forcing detection and guessing random\nadditive noise decoding (GRAND). The performance of several schemes is assessed\nover a mMIMO flat fading channel. The proposed scheme greatly outperforms the\nequivalent scheme using 5G's polar encoding and decoding for signal-to-noise\nratios (SNR) of interest. While the complexity of the polar code is constant at\nall SNRs, using RLCs with GRAND achieves much faster decoding times for most of\nthe SNR range, further reducing latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 21:57:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 15:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

While existing methods try to handle occlusion with pose\npriors/constraints, data augmentation, or implicit reasoning, they still fail\nto generalize to unseen poses or occlusion cases and may make large mistakes\nwhen multiple people are present. Inspired by the remarkable ability of humans\nto infer occluded joints from visible cues, we develop a method to explicitly\nmodel this process that significantly improves bottom-up multi-person human\npose estimation with or without occlusions. First, we split the task into two\nsubtasks: visible keypoints detection and occluded keypoints reasoning, and\npropose a Deeply Supervised Encoder Distillation (DSED) network to solve the\nsecond one.

Although we have access to a large collection of signal models that\nare sufficiently accurate to infer the properties of black holes, for some\nsignals, small discrepancies in the models lead to systematic differences in\nthe inferred properties. In order to provide a single estimate for the\nproperties of the black holes, it is preferable to marginalize over the model\nuncertainty. Bayesian model averaging is a commonly used technique to\nmarginalize over multiple models, however, it is computationally expensive. An\nelegant solution is to simultaneously infer the model and model properties in a\njoint Bayesian analysis. In this work we demonstrate that a joint Bayesian\nanalysis can not only accelerate but also account for model-dependent\nsystematic differences in the inferred black hole properties. We verify this\ntechnique by analysing 100 randomly chosen simulated signals and also the real\ngravitational wave signal GW200129_065458. We find that not only do we infer\nstatistically identical properties as those obtained using Bayesian model\naveraging, but we can sample over a set of three models on average $2.5\\times$\nfaster. In other words, a joint Bayesian analysis that marginalizes over three\nmodels takes on average only $20\\%$ more time than a single model analysis. We\nthen demonstrate that this technique can be used to accurately and efficiently\nquantify the support for one model over another, thereby assisting in Bayesian\nmodel selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 23:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

This is especially important in high\nperformance computing contexts where even minor performance tweaks can\ntranslate into large savings in terms of computational resource use. To aid\nperformance analysis, developers may collect an execution trace - a\nchronological log of program activity during execution. As traces represent the\nfull history, developers can discover a wide array of possibly previously\nunknown performance issues, making them an important artifact for exploratory\nperformance analysis. However, interactive trace visualization is difficult due\nto issues of data size and complexity of meaning. Traces represent\nnanosecond-level events across many parallel processes, meaning the collected\ndata is often large and difficult to explore. The rise of asynchronous task\nparallel programming paradigms complicates the relation between events and\ntheir probable cause. To address these challenges, we conduct a continuing\ndesign study in collaboration with high performance computing researchers. We\ndevelop diverse and hierarchical ways to navigate and represent execution trace\ndata in support of their trace analysis tasks. Through an iterative design\nprocess, we developed Traveler, an integrated visualization platform for task\nparallel traces. Traveler provides multiple linked interfaces to help navigate\ntrace data from multiple contexts.

We present an observational study on a sequence of jets with\nthe data acquired with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). This sequence is peculiar in that an EUV\njet, $\\sim29\\arcsec$ long and with a dome-like base, appears to be a\nconsequence of a series of transition region (TR) micro-jets that are a few\narcsecs in length.We find that the occurrence of any TR micro-jets is always\nassociated with the change of geometry of micro-loops at the footpoints of the\nmicrojets. A bundle of TR flux ropes is seen to link a TR micro-jet to the\ndome-like structure at the base of the EUV jet. This bundle rises as a response\nto the TR micro-jets, with the rising motion eventually triggering the EUV jet.\nWe propose a scenario involving a set of magnetic reconnections, in which the\nseries of TR micro-jets are associated with the processes to remove the\nconstraints to the TR flux ropes and thus allow them to rise and trigger the\nEUV jet. Our study demonstrates that small-scale dynamics in the lower solar\natmosphere are crucial in understanding the energy and mass connection between\nthe corona and the solar lower atmosphere, even though many of them might not\npump mass and energy to the corona directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 01:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The move from pixels to 3D points, which\nis inspired by recent PIFu-style methods for 3D reconstruction, enables\nreasoning about the whole object, including its (self-)occluded parts. For a 3D\nquery point associated with a pixel-aligned image feature, we train a\nfully-connected neural network to predict: (i) the corresponding 3D object\ncoordinates, and (ii) the signed distance to the object surface, with the first\ndefined only for query points in the surface vicinity.

An important assumption underlying this approach is that all\nconfounders that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome of\ninterest are measured and included in the propensity score model. In the\nabsence of strong prior knowledge about potential confounders, researchers may\nagnostically want to adjust for a high-dimensional set of pre-treatment\nvariables. As such, variable selection procedure is needed for propensity score\nestimation. In addition, recent studies show that including variables related\nto treatment only in the propensity score model may inflate the variance of the\ntreatment effect estimates, while including variables that are predictive of\nonly the outcome can improve efficiency. In this paper, we propose a flexible\napproach to incorporating outcome-covariate relationship in the propensity\nscore model by including the predicted binary outcome probability (OP) as a\ncovariate. Our approach can be easily adapted to an ensemble of variable\nselection methods, including regularization methods and modern machine learning\ntools based on classification and regression trees. We evaluate our method to\nestimate the treatment effects on a binary outcome, which is possibly censored,\namong multiple treatment groups.

Twisted bilayer graphene (tbG) is proved to have\nhigher-order and real topology. However whether this conclusion can be extended\nto other two-dimensional twisted bilayer carbon materials and the mechanism\nbehind it lack explorations. In this paper, we identify the twisted bilayer\n$\\alpha$-graphyne (tbGPY) at large twisting angle as a real Chern insulator\n(also known as Stiefel-Whitney insulator) and a second-order topological\ninsulator. Our first-principles calculations suggest that the tbGPY at\n21.78$^\\circ$ is stable at 100 K with a larger bulk gap than the tbG. The\nnon-trivial topological indicators, including the real Chern number and a\nfractional charge, and the localized in-gap corner states are demonstrated from\nfirst-principles and tight-binding calculations. Moreover, with $\\mathcal\nC_{6z}$ symmetry, we prove the equivalence between the two indicators, and\nexplain the existence of the corner states. To decipher the real and\nhigher-order topology inherited from the Moir\\'e heterostructure, we construct\nan effective four band tight-binding model capturing the topology and\ndispersion of the tbGPY at large twisting angle. A topological phase transition\nto a trivial insulator is demonstrated by breaking the $\\mathcal C_{2y}$\nsymmetry of the effective model, which gives insights on the trivialization of\nthe tbGPY as reducing the twisting angle to 9.43$^\\circ$ suggested by our\nfirst-principles calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 01:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

However, the\nperformance of DML methods often highly depends on sampling methods to choose\neffective data from the embedding space in the training. In practice, the\nembeddings in the embedding space are obtained by some deep models, where the\nembedding space is often with barren area due to the absence of training\npoints, resulting in so called \"missing embedding\" issue. This issue may impair\nthe sample quality, which leads to degenerated DML performance. In this work,\nwe investigate how to alleviate the \"missing embedding\" issue to improve the\nsampling quality and achieve effective DML. To this end, we propose a\nDensely-Anchored Sampling (DAS) scheme that considers the embedding with\ncorresponding data point as \"anchor\" and exploits the anchor's nearby embedding\nspace to densely produce embeddings without data points. Specifically, we\npropose to exploit the embedding space around single anchor with Discriminative\nFeature Scaling (DFS) and multiple anchors with Memorized Transformation\nShifting (MTS). In this way, by combing the embeddings with and without data\npoints, we are able to provide more embeddings to facilitate the sampling\nprocess thus boosting the performance of DML. Our method is effortlessly\nintegrated into existing DML frameworks and improves them without bells and\nwhistles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 02:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

The challenge of new task learning is often exacerbated by the\nscarcity of data for the new categories due to rarity or cost. Here we explore\nthe important task of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) and its\nextreme data scarcity condition of one-shot. An ideal FSCIL model needs to\nperform well on all classes, regardless of their presentation order or paucity\nof data. It also needs to be robust to open-set real-world conditions and be\neasily adapted to the new tasks that always arise in the field. In this paper,\nwe first reevaluate the current task setting and propose a more comprehensive\nand practical setting for the FSCIL task. Then, inspired by the similarity of\nthe goals for FSCIL and modern face recognition systems, we propose our method\n-- Augmented Angular Loss Incremental Classification or ALICE.

However, the current approaches suffer from inconsistent shadow\npredictions across frames, especially when the illumination and background\ntextures change in a video. We make an observation that the inconsistent\npredictions are caused by the shadow feature inconsistency, i.e., the features\nof the same shadow regions show dissimilar proprieties among the nearby\nframes.In this paper, we present a novel Shadow-Consistent Correspondence\nmethod (SC-Cor) to enhance pixel-wise similarity of the specific shadow regions\nacross frames for video shadow detection. Our proposed SC-Cor has three main\nadvantages. Firstly, without requiring the dense pixel-to-pixel correspondence\nlabels, SC-Cor can learn the pixel-wise correspondence across frames in a\nweakly-supervised manner. Secondly, SC-Cor considers intra-shadow separability,\nwhich is robust to the variant textures and illuminations in videos. Finally,\nSC-Cor is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing\nshadow detectors with no extra computational cost. We further design a new\nevaluation metric to evaluate the temporal stability of the video shadow\ndetection results. Experimental results show that SC-Cor outperforms the prior\nstate-of-the-art method, by 6.51% on IoU and 3.35% on the newly introduced\ntemporal stability metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 06:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

To further reduce the\nmodel size, the components of the tensor train decomposition need to be\nquantized.

To deal with this difficulty,\nwe introduce a network distillation operation that separates the low rank\napproximation and the weight quantization in the network training.

Legged robots and\nmanipulator robots experience contact-noncontact discrete transitions, causing\nswitching of governing equations. Analysis of these robot systems have been a\nchallenge due to the lack of a global, unified model that is amenable to\nanalysis of the global behaviors. Composition operator theory has the potential\nto provide a global, unified representation of those heterogenous dynamical\nsystems. It is expected that, if the theory is applicable, those fundamentally\nchallenging robotics systems can be treated as linear dynamical systems in a\nlifted space. The current work addresses under which conditions a unified\nlinear representation exists in a global sense for a class of heterogenous\ndynamical systems and how the theory can be applied to those robotics problems.\nFirst, a kernel representation of composition operators is obtained, and\nconditions required for converting the kernel representation to a linear state\ntransition equation are established. This analysis results in an algorithm to\nconvert a class of heterogenous systems including hybrid and switched systems\ndirectly to a global, unified linear model.

Given a set $X$ of $n$\nelements, it asks to select a subset $S$ of $k \\ll n$ elements with maximum\n\\emph{diversity}, as quantified by the dissimilarities among the elements in\n$S$. In this paper, we focus on the diversity maximization problem with\nfairness constraints in the streaming setting. Specifically, we consider the\nmax-min diversity objective, which selects a subset $S$ that maximizes the\nminimum distance (dissimilarity) between any pair of distinct elements within\nit. Assuming that the set $X$ is partitioned into $m$ disjoint groups by some\nsensitive attribute, e.g., sex or race, ensuring \\emph{fairness} requires that\nthe selected subset $S$ contains $k_i$ elements from each group $i \\in [1,m]$.\nA streaming algorithm should process $X$ sequentially in one pass and return a\nsubset with maximum \\emph{diversity} while guaranteeing the fairness\nconstraint. Although diversity maximization has been extensively studied, the\nonly known algorithms that can work with the max-min diversity objective and\nfairness constraints are very inefficient for data streams.

This is essentially due to the nature of the traditional combinatorial\nalgorithms, often based on a trial-and-error process. RL aims at automating\nthis process. At this regard, this paper focuses on the application of RL for\nthe Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a famous combinatorial problem that belongs\nto the class of NP-Hard problems. In this work, first, the problem is modeled\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then the PPO method (which belongs to\nthe Actor-Critic class of Reinforcement learning methods) is applied. In a\nsecond phase, the neural architecture behind the Actor and Critic has been\nestablished, choosing to adopt a neural architecture based on the Convolutional\nneural networks, both for the Actor and the Critic. This choice resulted in\neffectively addressing problems of different sizes. Experiments performed on a\nwide range of instances show that the algorithm has good generalization\ncapabilities and can reach good solutions in a short time. Comparisons between\nthe algorithm proposed and the state-of-the-art solver OR-TOOLS show that the\nlatter still outperforms the Reinforcement learning algorithm.

We resolve this discrepancy by formulating the\nmulti-objective NAS problem as a quality diversity optimization (QDO) problem\nand introduce three quality diversity NAS optimizers (two of them belonging to\nthe group of multifidelity optimizers), which search for high-performing yet\ndiverse architectures that are optimal for application-specific niches, e.g.,\nhardware constraints.

These \"forked\" blockchains thus could encounter\nsimilar vulnerabilities that are propagated from Bitcoin/Ethereum during\nforking or subsequently commit fetching. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nstudy of detecting and investigating the propagated vulnerabilities in forked\nblockchain projects. To facilitate this study, we propose BlockScope, a novel\ntool that can effectively and efficiently detect multiple types of cloned\nvulnerabilities given an input of existing Bitcoin/Ethereum security patches.\nSpecifically, BlockScope adopts similarity-based code match and designs a new\nway of calculating code similarity to cover all the syntax-wide variant (i.e.,\nType-1, Type-2, and Type-3) clones. Moreover, BlockScope automatically extracts\nand leverages the contexts of patch code to narrow down the search scope and\nlocate only potentially relevant code for comparison. Our evaluation shows that\nBlockScope achieves good precision and high recall both at 91.8% (1.8 times\nhigher recall than that in ReDeBug).

More than 33 million objects in the ranges $G_{rvs} < 14$\nand $3100 <T_{eff} <14500 $, have new determinations of their mean radial\nvelocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide G$_{rvs}$ magnitudes for\nmost sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed\nfor a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community.\nThe GDR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial\nvelocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism\nphotometer BPRP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry\nare provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. GDR3\nincludes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470\nmillion and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and\nquasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some $800\\,000$\nastrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than $150\\,000$ Solar\nSystem objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions\nand individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra\nderived from the epoch BPRP spectral data are published for about 60\\,000\nasteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia\nAndromeda Photometric Survey (abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 13:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

For\nthis purpose, five ML models, namely BR, XGB, AdB, GB, and RF, were selected as\nbase and meta learners to construct the final Stacking EML. Methods: 40,044\nexperimental measurements, from 1928 to the present, available on the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website were used to train machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms. This database consists of 593 ion-target combinations\nacross the energy range of 0.037 to 985 MeV. For model training, the eleven\nmost important features were selected. The model evaluation was performed using\nseveral error metrics, including R-squared (R2), root-mean-squared-error\n(RMSE), mean-absolute-error (MAE), and mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE),\non both the training and test datasets.

As such, it calls\nfor different pre-training methods for specific scenarios, and the pre-trained\nmodels are likely to be limited by their universality and representation\nquality. In this work, we extend the recently proposed MAE style pre-training\nstrategy, RetroMAE, such that it may effectively support a wide variety of\nsentence representation tasks. The extended framework consists of two stages,\nwith RetroMAE conducted throughout the process. The first stage performs\nRetroMAE over generic corpora, like Wikipedia, BookCorpus, etc., from which the\nbase model is learned. The second stage takes place on domain-specific data,\ne.g., MS MARCO and NLI, where the base model is continuingly trained based on\nRetroMAE and contrastive learning. The pre-training outputs at the two stages\nmay serve different applications, whose effectiveness are verified with\ncomprehensive experiments. Concretely, the base model are proved to be\neffective for zero-shot retrieval, with remarkable performances achieved on\nBEIR benchmark. The continuingly pre-trained models further benefit more\ndownstream tasks, including the domain-specific dense retrieval on MS MARCO,\nNatural Questions, and the sentence embeddings' quality for standard STS and\ntransfer tasks in SentEval.

To satisfy such requirements, caching is\noften used at various levels and infrastructure layers. Application-level\ncaching -- or memoization -- is an increasingly used form of caching within the\napplication boundaries, which consists of storing the results of computations\nin memory to avoid re-computing them. This is typically manually done by\ndevelopers, who identify caching opportunities in the code and write additional\ncode to manage the cache content. The task of identifying caching opportunities\nis a challenge because it requires the analysis of workloads and code locations\nwhere it is feasible and beneficial to cache objects. To aid developers in this\ntask, there are approaches that automatically identify cacheable methods.\nAlthough such approaches have been individually evaluated, their effectiveness\nhas not been compared. We thus in this paper present an empirical evaluation to\ncompare the method recommendations made by the two existing application-level\ncaching approaches at the method level, namely APLCache and MemoizeIt, using\nseven open-source web applications. We analyse the recommendations made by each\napproach as well as the hits, misses and throughput achieved with their valid\ncaching recommendations. Our results show that the effectiveness of both\napproaches largely depends on the specific application, the presence of invalid\nrecommendations and additional configurations, such as the time-to-live. By\ninspecting the obtained results, we observed in which cases the recommendations\nof each approach fail and succeed, which allowed us to derive a set of seven\nlessons learned that give directions for future approaches to support\ndevelopers in the adoption of this type of caching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 14:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Classical\nmethods of multi-view stereo can avoid the ambiguity problems, but may require\na large number of viewpoints to generate an accurate model. In this work, we\npropose a novel learning-based multi-view stereo method to estimate 3D\ninformation.

In this work, geometric machine learning on graph data (e.g.\nfinite element solutions) is used as a means to establish a connection between\nnonlinear dimensional reduction techniques and plasticity models. Geometric\nlearning-based encoding on graphs allows the embedding of rich time-history\ndata onto a low-dimensional Euclidean space such that the evolution of plastic\ndeformation can be predicted in the embedded feature space.

Likely, the gaseous chemical content of these objects\ndirectly depends on the composition of the dust grain mantles formed before the\ncollapse. Directly retrieving the ice mantle composition is challenging, but it\ncan be done indirectly by observing the major components, such as NH3 and CH3OH\nat cm wavelengths, once they are released into the gas-phase during the warm\nprotostellar stage. We observed several CH3OH and NH3 lines toward three Class\n0 protostars in NGC1333 (IRAS 4A1, IRAS 4A2, and IRAS 4B), at high angular\nresolution (1\"; ~300 au) with the VLA interferometer at 24-26 GHz. Using a\nnon-LTE LVG analysis, we derived a similar NH3/CH3OH abundance ratio in the\nthree protostars (<0.5, 0.015-0.5, and 0.003-0.3 for IRAS 4A1, 4A2, and 4B,\nrespectively). Hence, we infer they were born from pre-collapse material with\nsimilar physical conditions. Comparing the observed abundance ratios with\nastrochemical model predictions, we constrained the dust temperature at the\ntime of the mantle formation to be ~17 K, which coincides with the average\ntemperature of the southern NGC 1333 diffuse cloud. We suggest that a brutal\nevent started the collapse that eventually formed IRAS 4A1, 4A2 and 4B,\nwhich,therefore, did not experience the usual pre-stellar core phase. This\nevent could be the clash of a bubble with NGC 1333 south, that has previously\nbeen evoked in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 15:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Despite the large body of existing works, however, one of their\ncore features has never been quantified in detail, namely their physical\nunclonability. This paper tackles this fundamental and yet largely unaddressed\nissue. In simulations and/or experiments, the sensitivity of diffraction-based\noptical responses is investigated with respect to various small alterations\nsuch as variation in the position, size, and number of the scatterers, as well\nas perturbations in the spatial alignment between the physical unclonable\nfunction (PUF) and the measurement apparatus. Our analysis focuses on 2D\noptical PUFs because of their relevance in integrated applications and the need\nto reply to security concerns that can be raised when the physical structure of\nthe geometry is accessible. Among the results of this study, the sensitivity\nanalysis shows that a positional perturbation of scatterers on the order of\n\\SI{30}{\\nano\\meter}, i.e., far below the wavelength of the probing laser light\nof \\SI{632}{\\nano\\meter} wavelength, is sufficient to invalidate the PUF\nresponse and thus detect a forgery attempt. These results support and quantify\nthe high adversarial efforts required to clone optical PUFs, even for 2D\nlayouts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 18:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

In communities with meritocratic governance or with\naspects thereof, a firm has the opportunity to affect the RE process in line\nwith their own agenda by gaining influence through active and symbiotic\nengagements.\n  Objective: The focus of this study has been to identify what aspects that\nfirms should consider when they assess their need of influencing the RE process\nin an OSS community, as well as what engagement practices that should be\nconsidered in order to gain this influence.\n  Method: Using a design science approach, 21 interviews with 18 industry\nprofessionals from 12 different software-intensive firms were conducted to\nexplore, design and validate an artifact for the problem context.\n  Results: A Community Strategy Framework (CSF) is presented to help firms\ncreate community strategies that describe if and why they need influence on the\nRE process in a specific (meritocratic) OSS community, and how the firm could\ngain it. The framework consists of aspects and engagement practices. The\naspects help determine how important an OSS project and its community is from\nbusiness and technical perspectives. A community perspective is used when\nconsidering the feasibility and potential in gaining influence. The engagement\npractices are intended as a tool-box for how a firm can engage with a community\nin order to build influence needed.\n  Conclusion: It is concluded from interview-based validation that the proposed\nCSF may provide support for firms in creating and tailoring community\nstrategies and help them to focus resources on communities that matter and gain\nthe influence needed on their respective RE processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 20:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}
