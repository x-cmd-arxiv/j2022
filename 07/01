Specifically, the classical idealized crack\nface tractions are that the shear component is zero, and that the normal\ncomponent is zero when the crack opens and identical to the intact material\nwhen the crack closes. Phase-field fracture models do not replicate this\nbehavior.\n  This work addresses this shortcoming by introducing an effective crack energy\ndensity that endows the regularized (finite volume) phase-field crack with the\neffective properties of an idealized sharp crack. The approach is based on\napplying the QR (upper triangular) decomposition of the deformation gradient\ntensor in the basis of the crack, enabling a transparent identification of the\ncrack deformation modes. By then relaxing over those modes that do not cost\nenergy, an effective energy is obtained that has the intact response when the\ncrack faces close and zero energy when the crack faces are open.\n  A highlight of this approach is that it lies completely in the setting of\nfinite deformation, enabling potential application to soft materials and other\nsettings with large deformation or rotations. The model is applied to\nnumerically study representative complex loadings, including (1) cyclic loading\non a cavity in a soft solid that shows the growth and closing of cracks in\ncomplex stress states; and (2) cyclic shear that shows a complex pattern of\ncrack branching driven by the closure of cracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 16:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

However, in many practical applications of federated\nlearning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be\nused to pre-train a model before starting federated training. Using four\nstandard federated learning benchmark datasets, we empirically study the impact\nof starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning.

Other\nequilibrium notions -- communication (Forges 1986) and certification (Forges &\nKoessler 2005) equilibria -- augment the game with a mediator that has the\npower to both send and receive messages to and from the players -- and, in\nparticular, to remember the messages. In this paper, we investigate both\nnotions in extensive-form games from a computational lens. We show that optimal\nequilibria in both notions can be computed in polynomial time, the latter under\na natural additional assumption known in the literature. Our proof works by\nconstructing a mediator-augmented game of polynomial size that explicitly\nrepresents the mediator's decisions and actions. Our framework allows us to\ndefine an entire family of equilibria by varying the mediator's information\npartition, the players' ability to lie, and the players' ability to deviate.\nFrom this perspective, we show that other notions of equilibrium, such as\nextensive-form correlated equilibrium, correspond to the mediator having\nimperfect recall. This shows that, at least among all these equilibrium\nnotions, the hardness of computation is driven by the mediator's imperfect\nrecall.

This phenomenon is known as symmetry fractionalization, and in\ngeneral it signals the presence of certain discrete 't Hooft anomalies. We\ndescribe this in detail in the context of free Maxwell theory in four\ndimensions. This understanding allows us to deduce the 't Hooft anomalies of\nnon-Abelian gauge theories with renormalization group flows into Maxwell theory\nby analyzing the fractional quantum numbers of dynamical magnetic monopoles. We\nillustrate this method in $SU(2)$ gauge theories with matter fermions in\ndiverse representations of the gauge group. For adjoint matter, we uncover a\nmixed anomaly involving the 0-form and 1-form symmetries, extending previous\nresults. For $SU(2)$ QCD with fundamental fermions, the 't Hooft anomaly for\nthe 0-form symmetries that is encoded by the fractionalization patterns of\nlines in the Maxwell phase is a consequence of the familiar perturbative\n(triangle) anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 16:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Both using the DAFNE main positron ring or\nthe smaller damping ring (accumulator) as pulse extender of the LINAC have been\nconsidered.\n  We here propose to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique performing\nan experiment on the DAFNE positron main ring, installing in a suitable vacuum\ngoniometer a thin Silicon crystal, bent in the (110) direction in order to\nprovide a ~1 mrad kick, and then simulating the extraction process with a\nvirtual septum: instead of performing a real extraction, the crossing of the\ngap of a septum magnet is simulated by detecting positrons at its position (at\nphase advance close to 1/4) by means of a Silicon pixel detector inserted in\nthe ring, in a secondary vacuum of a Roman pot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In clinical\npractice, bilateral symmetric comparison of brain hemispheres is usually used\nto locate pathological abnormalities. Recent research has explored asymmetries\nto assist with AIS segmentation. However, most previous symmetry-based work\nmixed different types of asymmetries when evaluating their contribution to AIS.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Asymmetry Disentanglement Network (ADN) to\nautomatically separate pathological asymmetries and intrinsic anatomical\nasymmetries in NCCTs for more effective and interpretable AIS segmentation. ADN\nfirst performs asymmetry disentanglement based on input NCCTs, which produces\ndifferent types of 3D asymmetry maps. Then a synthetic,\nintrinsic-asymmetry-compensated and pathology-asymmetry-salient NCCT volume is\ngenerated and later used as input to a segmentation network. The training of\nADN incorporates domain knowledge and adopts a tissue-type aware regularization\nloss function to encourage clinically-meaningful pathological asymmetry\nextraction. Coupled with an unsupervised 3D transformation network, ADN\nachieves state-of-the-art AIS segmentation performance on a public NCCT\ndataset. In addition to the superior performance, we believe the learned\nclinically-interpretable asymmetry maps can also provide insights towards a\nbetter understanding of AIS assessment.

To\nthis end, BEaTriX generates a broad, uniform, monochromatic, and collimated\nX-ray beam at 4.51 keV. [...] In BEaTriX, a micro-focus X-ray source with a\ntitanium anode is placed in the focus of a paraboloidal mirror, which generates\na parallel beam.

The flux\nper area unit varies from 10 to 50 photons/s/cm2 from one configuration to the\nother.

Users can benefit from customized\nAI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the\nprivacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT\ndevices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system\nco-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of\nmemory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized\ngraphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the\nlack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full\nback-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose\nQuantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit\nquantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to\nskip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The\nalgorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny\nTraining Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse\nupdates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time.

Firstly, we provide a new and simple proof that\nthe horizon cap prescription of Crossley-Glorioso-Liu for implementing the\nthermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour in the bulk is consistent with the KMS\nperiodicity and the ingoing boundary condition for the retarded propagator at\nany arbitrary frequency and momentum. The generalization to the hydrodynamic\nBjorken flow is achieved by a Weyl rescaling in which the dual black hole's\nevent horizon attains a constant surface gravity and area at late time although\nthe directions longitudinal and transverse to the flow expands and contract\nrespectively. The dual state's temperature and entropy density thus become\nconstants (instead of undergoing perfect fluid expansion) although no\ntime-translation symmetry ever emerges. Undoing the Weyl rescaling, the\ncorrelation functions can be computed systematically in a large proper time\nexpansion in inverse powers of the average of the two reparametrized proper\ntime arguments. The horizon cap has to be pinned to the non-equilibrium event\nhorizon so that regularity and consistency conditions are satisfied. This\nmirrors causality of Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the limit of perfect fluid\nexpansion, the Schwinger-Keldysh correlation functions with reparametrized\nspacetime arguments are simply thermal at an appropriate temperature. A\ngeneralized bi-local thermal structure holds to all orders.

The CMS experiment has observed the Higgs boson\nin numerous fermionic and bosonic decay channels, established its spin-parity\nquantum numbers, determined its mass and measured its production cross sections\nin various modes. Here the CMS Collaboration reports the most up-to-date\ncombination of results on the properties of the Higgs boson, including the most\nstringent limit on the cross section for the production of a pair of Higgs\nbosons, on the basis of data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV. Within the uncertainties, all these observations are\ncompatible with the predictions of the standard model of elementary particle\nphysics. Much evidence points to the fact that the standard model is a\nlow-energy approximation of a more comprehensive theory.

As is well-known, vacuum\nspherically symmetric diagonal tetrads lead to rather boring cases of constant\ntorsion scalars. We extend this statement to other possible horizon topologies,\nnamely, spherical, hyperbolic and planar horizons. All such cases are forced to\nhave constant torsion scalars to satisfy the anti-symmetric part of the field\nequations. We give a full classification of possible vacuum static solutions of\nthis sort. Furthermore, we discuss addition of time-dependence in all the above\ncases. We also show that if all the components of a diagonal tetrad depend only\non one coordinate, then the anti-symmetric part of the field equations is\nautomatically satisfied. This result applies to the flat horizon case with\nCartesian coordinates. For solutions with a planar symmetry (or a flat\nhorizon), one can naturally use Cartesian coordinates on the horizon. In this\ncase, we show that the presence of matter is required for existence of\nnon-trivial solutions. This is a novel and very interesting feature of these\nconstructions.

Our\noptimization takes into account the experimentally viable problem of turning-on\nand off of the external laser field. Optimising the shape of the pulse\nsignificantly boosts both power and efficiency of the charging process in\ncomparison to the known results.

Here we present evidence of coherent magnetism in the\n1T/1H-TaSe$_2$ heterobilayer by means of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy at 340 mK.

Under\ncertain screening lengths and core sizes, the minimum of the LGD energy, which\nconsists of Landau-Devonshire energy, Ginzburg polarization gradient energy,\nand electrostatic terms, leads to the spontaneous appearance of stable\nlabyrinth domain structures in the core. The labyrinths evolve from an initial\npolarization distribution consisting of arbitrarily small randomly oriented\nnanodomains. The equilibrium labyrinth structure is weakly influenced by\ndetails of the initial polarization distribution, such that one can obtain a\nquasi-continuum of nearly degenerate labyrinth structures, whose number is\nlimited only by the mesh discretization density. Applying a homogeneous\nelectric field to a nanoparticle with labyrinth domains, and subsequently\nremoving it, allows inducing changes to the labyrinth structure, as the maze\npolarity is controlled by a field projection on the particle polar axis. Under\nspecific conditions of the screening charge relaxation, the quasi-static\ndielectric susceptibility of the labyrinth structure can be negative,\npotentially leading to a negative capacitance effect.

However, it\nneglects the scattering by the dynamical quadrupoles generated by phonons,\nlimiting its accuracy.

Based on our\ndeep learning classifier developed to detect hateful videos and a large-scale\ndataset of over 350K videos, we find that Arabic videos targeting religious\nminorities are particularly prevalent in search results (30%) and first-level\nrecommendations (21%), and that 15% of overall captured recommendations point\nto hateful videos. Our personalized audit experiments suggest that gender and\nreligious identity can substantially affect the extent of exposure to hateful\ncontent. Our results contribute vital insights into the phenomenon of online\nradicalization and facilitate curbing online harmful content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 21:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 23:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Singular value decomposition (SVD) plays a vital role in\nthis compression strategy, approximating a learned matrix with fewer\nparameters. However, SVD minimizes the squared error toward reconstructing the\noriginal matrix without gauging the importance of the parameters, potentially\ngiving a larger reconstruction error for those who affect the task accuracy\nmore. In other words, the optimization objective of SVD is not aligned with the\ntrained model's task accuracy. We analyze this previously unexplored problem,\nmake observations, and address it by introducing Fisher information to weigh\nthe importance of parameters affecting the model prediction. This idea leads to\nour method: Fisher-Weighted SVD (FWSVD). Although the factorized matrices from\nour approach do not result in smaller reconstruction errors, we find that our\nresulting task accuracy is much closer to the original model's performance. We\nperform analysis with the transformer-based language models, showing our\nweighted SVD largely alleviates the mismatched optimization objectives and can\nmaintain model performance with a higher compression rate. Our method can\ndirectly compress a task-specific model while achieving better performance than\nother compact model strategies requiring expensive model pre-training.\nMoreover, the evaluation of compressing an already compact model shows our\nmethod can further reduce 9% to 30% parameters with an insignificant impact on\ntask accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 21:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

In addition, the detection model requires additional\nbounding box annotation which is costly and needs skilled annotators. These\nlead to inference delay and limit the captioning model to deploy in real-time\nrobotic surgery. For this purpose, we design an end-to-end detector and feature\nextractor-free captioning model by utilizing the patch-based shifted window\ntechnique.

SwinMLP-TranCAP replaces the multi-head attention module with\nwindow-based multi-head MLP. Such deployments primarily focus on image\nunderstanding tasks, but very few works investigate the caption generation\ntask. SwinMLP-TranCAP is also extended into a video version for video\ncaptioning tasks using 3D patches and windows.

They are widely used\nfor training robust deep neural networks (DNNs), but have not been\nmathematically and thoroughly analysed together. We study them and discover\nthree key issues: (1) We are more interested in adopting Self LC as it\nleverages its own knowledge and requires no auxiliary models. However, it is\nunclear how to adaptively trust a learner as the training proceeds. (2) Some\nmethods penalise while the others reward low-entropy (i.e., high-confidence)\npredictions, prompting us to ask which one is better. (3) Using the standard\ntraining setting, a learned model becomes less confident when severe noise\nexists. Self LC using high-entropy knowledge would generate high-entropy\ntargets.\n  To resolve the issue (1), inspired by a well-accepted finding, i.e., deep\nneural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise, we propose a\nnovel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to the\nlearning time and prediction entropy. Concretely, for any data point, we\nprogressively and adaptively trust its predicted probability distribution\nversus its annotated one if a network has been trained for a relatively long\ntime and the prediction is of low entropy. For the issue (2), the effectiveness\nof ProSelfLC defends entropy minimisation. By ProSelfLC, we empirically prove\nthat it is more effective to redefine a semantic low-entropy state and optimise\nthe learner toward it. To address the issue (3), we decrease the entropy of\nself knowledge using a low temperature before exploiting it to correct labels,\nso that the revised labels redefine low-entropy target probability\ndistributions.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments\nin both clean and noisy settings, and on both image and protein datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 22:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 12:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The rate of carbon\nproduction in stars depends on the radiative width of the Hoyle state. The\nradiative width can be deduced by combining three separately measured\nquantities, one of which is the $E0$ decay branching ratio. The $E0$ branching\nratio can be measured by exciting the Hoyle state in the $^{12}$C$(p,p')$\nreaction and measuring the pair decay of its Hoyle state and first $2^+$ state.\n  Purpose: To reduce the uncertainties in the carbon production rate in the\nuniverse by measuring a set of proton angular distributions for the population\nof the Hoyle state ($0^+_2$) and $2^+_1$ state in $^{12}$C in $^{12}$C$(p,p')$\nreactions between 10.20 and 10.70 MeV, used in the determination of the $E0$\nbranching ratio of the Hoyle state.\n  Method: Proton angular distributions populating the ground, first $2^+$, and\nthe Hoyle states in $^{12}$C were measured in $^{12}$C(p,p') reactions with a\nsilicon detector array covering $22^\\circ<\\theta<158^\\circ$ in 14 energy steps\nbetween 10.20 and 10.70 MeV with a thin ($60\\ \\mu$g/cm$^2$) $^{nat}$C target.\n  Results: Total cross-sections for each state were extracted and the\npopulation ratio between the $2^+_1$ and Hoyle state determined at each energy\nstep. By appropriately averaging these cross-sections and taking their ratio,\nthe equivalent population ratio can be extracted applicable for any thick\n$^{12}$C target used in pair-conversion measurements.\n  Conclusions: We present a general data set of high-precision $^{12}$C$(p,p')$\ncross-sections that make uncertainties resulting from the population of the\n$2^+_1$ and $0^+_2$ states by proton inelastic scattering negligible for any\nfuture measurements of the $E0$ branching ratio in $^{12}$C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 01:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

The upper critical fields $\\mu_0H_\\mathrm{c2}$ $\\sim$ 7 T were\ndetermined mostly from measurements of the electrical resistivity in applied\nmagnetic fields. The microscopic electronic properties were investigated by\nmeans of muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\\mu$SR) and nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) techniques. In the normal state, NMR relaxation data indicate\nan almost ideal metallic behavior, confirmed by band-structure calculations,\nwhich suggest a relatively high electronic density of states at the Fermi\nlevel, dominated by the Zr 4$d$ orbitals. The low-temperature superfluid\ndensity, obtained via transverse-field $\\mu$SR, suggests a fully-gapped\nsuperconducting state in Zr$_5$Pt$_3$ and Zr$_5$Pt$_3$C$_{0.3}$, with a\nzero-temperature gap $\\Delta_0$ = 1.20 and 0.60 meV and a magnetic penetration\ndepth $\\lambda_0$ = 333 and 493 nm, respectively. The exponential dependence of\nthe NMR relaxation rates below $T_c$ further supports a nodeless\nsuperconductivity. The absence of spontaneous magnetic fields below the onset\nof superconductivity, as determined from zero-field $\\mu$SR measurements,\nconfirms a preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state of\nZr$_5$Pt$_3$C$_x$. In contrast to a previous study, our $\\mu$SR and NMR results\nsuggest a conventional superconductivity in the Zr$_5$Pt$_3$C$_x$ family,\nindependent of the C content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 02:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Recent\nself-supervised text recognition methods attempted to utilize unlabeled real\nimages by introducing contrastive learning, which mainly learns the\ndiscrimination of the text images. Inspired by the observation that humans\nlearn to recognize the texts through both reading and writing, we propose to\nlearn discrimination and generation by integrating contrastive learning and\nmasked image modeling in our self-supervised method. The contrastive learning\nbranch is adopted to learn the discrimination of text images, which imitates\nthe reading behavior of humans.

By tuning the\n$\\Delta$, the strong $\\sigma\\text{-}\\sigma$ bond through sp$^2$ hybridization\nof a flat form of these monolayers can be changed to a stronger\n$\\sigma\\text{-}\\pi$ bond through sp$^3$ hybridization. Consequently, the band\ngaps of the monolayers are tuned due to a dislocation of the $s$- and\n$p$-orbitals towards the Fermi energy. The band gaps decrease with increasing\n$\\Delta$ for those flat monolayers, which have a band gap greater than $1.0$\neV, while no noticeable change or a flat dispersion of the band gap is seen for\nthe flat monolayers, that have a band gap less than $1.0$ eV. The decreased\nband gap causes a decrease in the excitation energy, and thus the static\ndielectric function, refractive index, and the optical conductivity are\nincreased. In contrast, the flat band gap dispersion of few monolayers in the\ngroup III-Nitride induces a reduction in the static dielectric function, the\nrefractive index, and the optical conductivity. We therefore confirm that\ntuning of the planar buckling can be used to control the physical properties of\nthese monolayers, both for an enhancement and a reduction of the optical\nproperties.

Then, on the basis of this finding, we develop\nan element-wise parameter selection focused on specific layers to further\nreduce the number of fine-tuning parameters. Experimental results show that our\napproach consistently prevents catastrophic forgetting compared to parameter\nselection from the whole model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 05:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Its popularity is, in part, because the\nfault-tolerance or accuracy threshold for surface codes is believed to be less\nstringent than competing schemes. This threshold is the noise level below which\ncomputational accuracy can be increased by increasing physical resources for\nnoise removal, and is an important engineering target for realising quantum\ndevices. The current conclusions about surface code thresholds are, however,\ndrawn largely from studies of probabilistic noise. While a natural assumption,\ncurrent devices experience noise beyond such a model, raising the question of\nwhether conventional statements about the thresholds apply. Here, we attempt to\nextend past proof techniques to derive the fault-tolerance threshold for\nsurface codes subjected to general noise with no particular structure.\nSurprisingly, we found no nontrivial threshold, i.e., there is no guarantee the\nsurface code prescription works for general noise. While this is not a proof\nthat the scheme fails, we argue that current proof techniques are likely unable\nto provide an answer. A genuinely new idea is needed, to reaffirm the\nfeasibility of surface code quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 06:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Even if a\ndecomposition technique might be appropriate, there are still many possible\ndecompositions for any large MIP and it may not be obvious which will be the\nmost effective. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the predictive\ncapabilities of a Machine Learning ranking (ML) function for predicting the\nquality of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) decompositions created via\nconstraint relaxation. In this analysis, the role of instance similarity and ML\nprediction quality is explored, as well as the benchmarking of a ML ranking\nfunction against existing heuristic functions. For this analysis, a new dataset\nconsisting of over 40000 unique decompositions sampled from across 24 instances\nfrom the MIPLIB2017 library has been established. These decompostions have been\ncreated by both a greedy relaxation algorithm as well as a population based\nmulti-objective algorithm, which has previously been shown to produce high\nquality decompositions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a ML ranking\nfunction is able to provide state-of-the-art predictions when benchmarked\nagainst existing heuristic ranking functions. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nby only considering a small set of features related to the relaxed constraints\nin each decomposition, a ML ranking function is still able to be competitive\nwith heuristic techniques. Such a finding is promising for future constraint\nrelaxation approaches, as these features can be used to guide decomposition\ncreation. Finally, we highlight where a ML ranking function would be beneficial\nin a decomposition creation framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 06:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

However, it\nincorporates the task transmission latency, which may become the bottleneck of\nlatency requirements. Data compression (DC) has been considered as one of the\npromising techniques to reduce the transmission latency. By compressing the\ncomputation tasks before transmitting, the transmission delay is reduced due to\nthe shrink transmitted data size, and the original computing task can be\nretrieved by employing data decompressing (DD) at the edge nodes or the centre\ncloud. Nevertheless, the DC and DD incorporate extra processing latency, and\nthe latency performance has not been investigated in the large-scale DC-enabled\nF-RAN. Therefore, in this work, the successful data compression probability\n(SDCP) is defined to analyse the latency performance of the F-RAN. Moreover, to\nanalyse the effect of compression offloading ratio (COR), a novel hybrid\ncompression mode is proposed based on the queueing theory. Based on this, the\nclosed-form result of SDCP in the large-scale DC-enabled F-RAN is derived by\ncombining the Matern cluster process and M/G/1 queueing model, and validated by\nMonte Carlo simulations. Based on the derived SDCP results, the effects of COR\non the SDCP is analysed numerically. The results show that the SDCP with the\noptimal COR can be enhanced with a maximum value of 0.3 and 0.55 as compared\nwith the cases of compressing all computing tasks at the edge and at the UE,\nrespectively. Moreover, for the system requiring the minimal latency, the\nproposed hybrid compression mode can alleviate the requirement on the backhaul\ncapacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 06:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Furthermore, the seismic signature of helium ionization\nprovides envelope properties while being almost independent of the outermost\nlayers.

The\nmodelling of six additional Kepler stars including 16 Cyg B reinforces the\nabove findings and also confirms that our approach is mostly independent from\nmodel uncertainties associated with the near-surface layers.

Two coupling schemes for\nthe $s$-wave kaon-baryon interaction are compared regarding the onset density\nof kaon condensation in the hyperon-mixed matter and equation of state for the\ndeveloped ($Y+K$) phase: One is the contact interaction scheme related to the\nnonlinear effective chiral Lagrangian. The other is the meson-exchange scheme,\nwhere the interaction vertices between the kaon field and baryons are described\nby exchange of mesons (sigma, sigma^* mesons for scalar coupling, and omega,\nrho, phi mesons for vector coupling). It is shown that in the meson exchange\nscheme, the contribution from the nonlinear scalar self-interaction gives rise\nto a repulsive effect for kaon effective energy, pushing up the onset density\nof kaon condensation as compared with the case of the contact interaction\nscheme. In general, the difference of kaon-baryon dynamics between the contact\ninteraction scheme and the meson-exchange scheme relies on the specific forms\nof the nonlinear self-interacting meson terms.

Specifically, first, the TBX-Att dataset contains\n2000 X-ray images with seven kinds of attributes for TB relational reasoning,\nwhich are annotated by experienced radiologists. It also includes the public\nTBX11K dataset with 11200 X-ray images to facilitate weakly supervised\ndetection. Second, we exploit a multi-scale feature interaction model for TB\narea classification and detection with attribute relational reasoning. The\nproposed model is evaluated on the TBX-Att dataset and will serve as a solid\nbaseline for future research. The code and data will be available at\nhttps://github.com/GangmingZhao/tb-attribute-weak-localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 07:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Nevertheless, backdoor\nattack, another famous threat to DNNs, has not been studied for deep hashing\nyet. Although various backdoor attacks have been proposed in the field of image\nclassification, existing approaches failed to realize a truly imperceptive\nbackdoor attack that enjoys invisible triggers and clean label setting\nsimultaneously, and they also cannot meet the intrinsic demand of image\nretrieval backdoor. In this paper, we propose BadHash, the first\ngenerative-based imperceptible backdoor attack against deep hashing, which can\neffectively generate invisible and input-specific poisoned images with clean\nlabel. Specifically, we first propose a new conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (cGAN) pipeline to effectively generate poisoned samples. For any given\nbenign image, it seeks to generate a natural-looking poisoned counterpart with\na unique invisible trigger. In order to improve the attack effectiveness, we\nintroduce a label-based contrastive learning network LabCLN to exploit the\nsemantic characteristics of different labels, which are subsequently used for\nconfusing and misleading the target model to learn the embedded trigger.

Antiferromagnets have been shown to host\nversions of these textures, which have gained significant attention because of\ntheir potential for terahertz dynamics, deflection free motion, and improved\nsize scaling due to the absence of stray field. Here we show that topological\nspin textures, merons and antimerons, can be generated at room temperature and\nreversibly moved using electrical pulses in thin film CuMnAs, a semimetallic\nantiferromagnet that is a testbed system for spintronic applications. The\nelectrical generation and manipulation of antiferromagnetic merons is a crucial\nstep towards realizing the full potential of antiferromagnetic thin films as\nactive components in high density, high speed magnetic memory devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 09:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

In this paper, we follow the single stage art\nand obtain further complexity-effectiveness balance by successfully getting rid\nof multi-scale testing. To achieve this goal, we abandon the widely-used\nconvolution network giving its limitation in exploring diverse visual patterns,\nand resort to fully attention based framework for robust representation\nlearning motivated by the success of Transformer. Besides applying Transformer\nfor global feature extraction, we devise a local branch composed of\nwindow-based multi-head attention and spatial attention to fully exploit local\nimage patterns.

However, the absence of\nlarge scale bug fix collections has made it difficult to effectively exploit\nreal bug fixes in the training of larger neural models in the past. In\ncontrast, artificial bugs -- produced by mutating existing source code -- can\nbe easily obtained at a sufficient scale and are therefore often preferred in\nthe training of existing approaches. Still, localization and repair models that\nare trained on artificial bugs usually underperform when faced with real bugs.\nThis raises the question whether bug localization and repair models trained on\nreal bug fixes are more effective in localizing and repairing real bugs.\n  We address this question by introducing RealiT, a pre-train-and-fine-tune\napproach for effectively learning to localize and repair real bugs from real\nbug fixes. RealiT is first pre-trained on a large number of artificial bugs\nproduced by traditional mutation operators and then fine-tuned on a smaller set\nof real bug fixes. Fine-tuning does not require any modifications of the\nlearning algorithm and hence can be easily adopted in various training\nscenarios for bug localization or repair (even when real training data is\nscarce). In addition, we found that training on real bug fixes with RealiT is\nempirically powerful by nearly doubling the localization performance of an\nexisting model on real bugs while maintaining or even improving the repair\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 09:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Aims: The aim of the\nstudy is to investigate the effects of the thermal Prandtl number on the\ntransition from anti-solar (slow equator, fast poles) to solar-like (fast\nequator, slow poles) differential rotation. Methods: Three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations in semi-global spherical wedge\ngeometry are used to model convection zones of solar-like stars. Results: The\noverall convective velocity amplitude increases as the Prandtl number decreases\nin accordance with earlier studies. The transition from anti-solar to\nsolar-like differential rotation is insensitive to the Prandtl number for\nPrandtl numbers below unity but for Prandtl numbers greater than unity,\nsolar-like differential rotation becomes significantly harder to excite.\nMagnetic fields and more turbulent regimes with higher fluid and magnetic\nReynolds numbers help in achieving solar-like differential rotation in\nnear-transition cases. Solar-like differential rotation occurs only in cases\nwith radially outward angular momentum transport at the equator. The dominant\ncontribution to such outward transport near the equator is due to prograde\npropagating thermal Rossby waves. Conclusions: The differential rotation is\nsensitive to the Prandtl number only for large Prandtl numbers in the parameter\nregime explored in the current study. Magnetic fields have a greater effect on\nthe differential rotation, although the inferred presence of a small-scale\ndynamo does not lead to drastically different results in the present study. The\ndominance of the thermal Rossby waves in the simulations is puzzling given the\nnon-detection in the Sun.

This discussion is tailored to applications in string\ncompactifications, explaining how to describe important physical couplings such\nas K\\\"ahler potentials and flux superpotentials near boundaries in moduli\nspaces.\n  Part II discusses a geometrical application with the construction of general\nmodels for asymptotic periods. Taking the constraints imposed by asymptotic\nHodge theory as consistency principles, we develop new methods for constructing\nthese periods. We explicitly carry out our program for all possible one- and\ntwo-moduli boundaries.\n  Part III discusses two applications of asymptotic Hodge theory in string\ncompactifications. The first investigates bounds put by the Weak Gravity\nConjecture in the setting of 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories arising\nfrom Type IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications. The second application studies flux\npotentials in asymptotic regimes in complex structure moduli space, where we\ndevelop two schemes for moduli stabilization. The first scheme sets up an\napproximation procedure for finding flux vacua divided in three steps: the\nsl(2)-approximation, the nilpotent orbit approximation, and the fully corrected\nresult. The second scheme constructs flux vacua with a small flux\nsuperpotential by using essential exponential corrections controlled by\nasymptotic Hodge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 09:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

The interplay of\npre-conditions and post-conditions determines a semantically justified partial\norder of the defined actions and serves to enforce integrity constraints. This\nform of specification allows the use of plan-generation algorithms to\ninvestigate, before the system is adopted, whether the proposed specification\nallows all desirable use cases, and effectively disallows undesirable ones.\nEspecially for legacy applications, implemented without a prior specification,\nProcess Mining techniques were employed to derive an implicit Petri net model\nfrom the analysis of a large number of traces registered in an execution log.\nHowever, if the system just begins to be used, and has a still empty execution\nlog, this sort of process mining discovery would not be feasible. This paper\nexplains how the Petri net model can be directly derived from the situation\ncalculus specification rules. The main gist is to provide evidence that the two\nmodels are complementary, not only because the Petri net model is derivable\nfrom the situation calculus model, but also in view of the distinct advantages\nof the two models. While the situation calculus model leads to planning and\nsimulated execution prior to implementation, the Petri net model can be\ndesigned to run in a restrictive mode, allowing an intuitive visualization of\nthe workable sequences.

Previous approaches use global feature modulation for\nSDRTV-to-HDRTV. Feature modulation scales and shifts the features in the\noriginal feature space, which has limited mapping capability. In addition, the\nglobal image mapping cannot restore detail in HDR frames due to the luminance\ndifferences in different regions of SDR frames. To resolve the appeal, we\npropose a two-stage solution. The first stage is a hierarchical Dynamic Context\nfeature mapping (HDCFM) model. HDCFM learns the SDR frame to HDR frame mapping\nfunction via hierarchical feature modulation (HME and HM ) module and a dynamic\ncontext feature transformation (DCT) module. The HME estimates the feature\nmodulation vector, HM is capable of hierarchical feature modulation, consisting\nof global feature modulation in series with local feature modulation, and is\ncapable of adaptive mapping of local image features. The DCT module constructs\na feature transformation module in conjunction with the context, which is\ncapable of adaptively generating a feature transformation matrix for feature\nmapping. Compared with simple feature scaling and shifting, the DCT module can\nmap features into a new feature space and thus has a more excellent feature\nmapping capability. In the second stage, we introduce a patch\ndiscriminator-based context generation model PDCG to obtain subjective quality\nenhancement of over-exposed regions. PDCG can solve the problem that the model\nis challenging to train due to the proportion of overexposed regions of the\nimage. The proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art objective and\nsubjective quality results. Specifically, HDCFM achieves a PSNR gain of 0.81 dB\nat a parameter of about 100K.

However, modifications to the standard CDM model may be\nrequired by the small-scale observations, and DM may be self-interacting (SIDM)\nor warm (WDM). Here we show that the diffractive lensing of gravitational waves\n(GWs) from binary black hole mergers by small halos ($\\sim10^3-10^6M_\\odot$;\nmini-halos) may serve as a clean probe to the nature of DM, free from the\ncontamination of baryonic processes in the DM studies based on dwarf/satellite\ngalaxies. The expected lensed GW signals and event rates resulting from CDM,\nWDM, and SIDM models are significantly different from each other, because of\nthe differences in halo density profiles and abundances predicted by these\nmodels. We estimate the detection rates of such lensed GW events for a number\nof current and future GW detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational Observatories (LIGO), the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Cosmic\nExplorer (CE), Gravitational-wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (GLOC), the\nDeci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO), and the Big\nBang Observer (BBO).

Other GW\ndetectors are unlikely to detect a significant number of such events within a\nlimited observational time period. However, if the inner slope of the mini-halo\ndensity profile is sufficiently steeper than the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\nprofile, e.g., the pseudo-Jaffe profile, one may be able to detect one to more\nthan hundred such GW events by ET and CE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 10:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

It\nprovides the continuous mapping for many critical applications, like the\nattribute estimation, object detection, segmentation and non-rigid\nregistration. However, previous studies mainly took the case-wise criteria,\nlike the mean square errors, as the optimization objectives. They ignored the\nvery important population-wise correlation criterion, which is exactly the\nfinal evaluation metric in many tasks. In this work, we propose to revisit the\nclassic regression tasks with novel investigations on directly optimizing the\nfine-grained correlation losses. We mainly explore two complementary\ncorrelation indexes as learnable losses: Pearson linear correlation (PLC) and\nSpearman rank correlation (SRC). The contributions of this paper are two folds.\nFirst, for the PLC on global level, we propose a strategy to make it robust\nagainst the outliers and regularize the key distribution factors. These efforts\nsignificantly stabilize the learning and magnify the efficacy of PLC. Second,\nfor the SRC on local level, we propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to ease the\nlearning of the exact ranking order among samples. Specifically, we convert the\nlearning for the ranking of samples into the learning of similarity\nrelationships among samples. We extensively validate our method on two typical\nultrasound image regression tasks, including the image quality assessment and\nbio-metric measurement. Experiments prove that, with the fine-grained guidance\nin directly optimizing the correlation, the regression performances are\nsignificantly improved. Our proposed correlation losses are general and can be\nextended to more important applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 11:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Personalized recommendation algorithms achieve\nthis goal by first building a profile of the user, either implicitly or\nexplicitly, and then matching items with this profile to find relevant content.\nThe more interpretable the profile and this \"matching function\" are, the easier\nit is to provide users with accurate and intuitive explanations, and also to\nlet them interact with the system. Indeed, for a user to see what the system\nhas already learned about her interests is of key importance for her to provide\nfeedback to the system and to guide it towards better understanding her\npreferences.\n  To this end, we propose a linear collaborative filtering recommendation model\nthat builds user profiles within the domain of item metadata, which is arguably\nthe most interpretable domain for end users. Our method is hence inherently\ntransparent and explainable. Moreover, since recommendations are computed as a\nlinear function of item metadata and the interpretable user profile, our method\nseamlessly supports interactive recommendation. In other words, users can\ndirectly tweak the weights of the learned profile for more fine-grained\nbrowsing and discovery of content based on their current interests.\n  We demonstrate the interactive aspect of this model in an online application\nfor discovering cultural events in Belgium.

Key to solving such problems is to exploit\nsparse dependency structures that exist between agents. For example, in wind\nfarm control a trade-off exists between maximising power and minimising stress\non the systems components. Dependencies between turbines arise due to the wake\neffect. We model such sparse dependencies between agents as a multi-objective\ncoordination graph (MO-CoG). In multi-objective reinforcement learning a\nutility function is typically used to model a users preferences over\nobjectives, which may be unknown a priori. In such settings a set of optimal\npolicies must be computed. Which policies are optimal depends on which\noptimality criterion applies. If the utility function of a user is derived from\nmultiple executions of a policy, the scalarised expected returns (SER) must be\noptimised. If the utility of a user is derived from a single execution of a\npolicy, the expected scalarised returns (ESR) criterion must be optimised. For\nexample, wind farms are subjected to constraints and regulations that must be\nadhered to at all times, therefore the ESR criterion must be optimised. For\nMO-CoGs, the state-of-the-art algorithms can only compute a set of optimal\npolicies for the SER criterion, leaving the ESR criterion understudied. To\ncompute a set of optimal polices under the ESR criterion, also known as the ESR\nset, distributions over the returns must be maintained. Therefore, to compute a\nset of optimal policies under the ESR criterion for MO-CoGs, we present a novel\ndistributional multi-objective variable elimination (DMOVE) algorithm. We\nevaluate DMOVE in realistic wind farm simulations. Given the returns in\nreal-world wind farm settings are continuous, we utilise a model known as\nreal-NVP to learn the continuous return distributions to calculate the ESR set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 12:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

However, deep neural networks generally require plenty of\nlabeled training data and are vulnerable to domain shifts between training and\ntest data. While typical intensity shifts can be mitigated by keypoint-based\nregistration, these methods still suffer from geometric domain shifts, for\ninstance, due to different fields of view. As a remedy, in this work, we\npresent a novel approach to geometric domain adaptation for image registration,\nadapting a model from a labeled source to an unlabeled target domain. We build\non a keypoint-based registration model, combining graph convolutions for\ngeometric feature learning with loopy belief optimization, and propose to\nreduce the domain shift through self-ensembling. To this end, we embed the\nmodel into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We extend the Mean Teacher to this\ncontext by 1) adapting the stochastic augmentation scheme and 2) combining\nlearned feature extraction with differentiable optimization.

Two\nsuch shortcomings are (i) their computational inefficiency relative to\nclassical numerical methods, and (ii) the non-interpretability of a trained DNN\nmodel. In this work we present ASPINN, an anisotropic extension of our earlier\nwork called SPINN--Sparse, Physics-informed, and Interpretable Neural\nNetworks--to solve PDEs that addresses both these issues. ASPINNs generalize\nradial basis function networks. We demonstrate using a variety of examples\ninvolving elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs that the special architecture we propose\nis more efficient than generic DNNs, while at the same time being directly\ninterpretable. Further, they improve upon the SPINN models we proposed earlier\nin that fewer nodes are require to capture the solution using ASPINN than using\nSPINN, thanks to the anisotropy of the local zones of influence of each node.\nThe interpretability of ASPINN translates to a ready visualization of their\nweights and biases, thereby yielding more insight into the nature of the\ntrained model. This in turn provides a systematic procedure to improve the\narchitecture based on the quality of the computed solution.

In this paper, by exploiting absolute-value\nsymmetry and other properties in the sparsity-inducing regularizer, we propose\na new algorithm, called the Doubly Majorized Algorithm (DMA), for this class of\nproblems.

We\nexplore a particular form of composition based on neural modules and present a\nset of RL problems that intuitively admit compositional solutions. Empirically,\nwe demonstrate that neural composition indeed captures the underlying structure\nof this space of problems. We further propose a compositional lifelong RL\nmethod that leverages accumulated neural components to accelerate the learning\nof future tasks while retaining performance on previous tasks via off-line RL\nover replayed experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 13:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

We examine their\nparameterization, then their behavior with respect to training data quantities\nin semi-supervised settings. Correct transfer of these methods to surgery, as\ndescribed and conducted in this work, leads to substantial performance gains\nover generic uses of SSL - up to 7.4% on phase recognition and 20% on tool\npresence detection - as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised phase\nrecognition approaches by up to 14%. Further results obtained on a highly\ndiverse selection of surgical datasets exhibit strong generalization\nproperties.

The family of\ncycles under consideration must satisfy two properties: it must be uncrossable\nand allow for an oracle access that finds a weight-minimal cycle in that family\nfor given nonnegative edge weights or (in planar graphs) the union of all\nremaining cycles in that family after deleting a given subset of edges.\n  Our setting generalizes many problems that were studied separately in the\npast. For example, three families that satisfy the above properties are (i) all\ncycles in a directed or undirected graph, (ii) all odd cycles in an undirected\ngraph, and (iii) all cycles in an undirected graph that contain precisely one\ndemand edge, where the demand edges form a subset of the edge set. The latter\nfamily (iii) corresponds to the classical disjoint paths problem in fully\nplanar and bounded-genus instances.

Both of these systems have nonlocal Coulomb-like interactions among\ntheir constituent particles, namely, the electrostatic interactions in the case\nof the driven electrolyte, and the chemotactic forces mediated by\nfast-diffusing signals in the case of self-chemotactic systems.

Such stars have been given the name of Main-sequence Radio Pulse\nemitters (MRPs). The phenomenon characterizing MRPs is very similar to that\nexhibited by planets like the Jupiter. However, one important aspect in which\nthe MRPs differ from aurorae exhibited by planets is the upper cut-off\nfrequency of the ECME spectrum. While Jupiter's upper cut-off frequency was\nfound to correspond to its maximum surface magnetic field strength, the same\nfor MRPs are always found to be much smaller than the frequencies corresponding\nto their maximum surface magnetic field strength. In this paper, we report the\nwideband observations (0.4--4.0 GHz) of the MRPs HD 35298 that enabled us to\nlocate the upper cut-off frequency of its ECME spectrum.

This embedding process is very costly in terms of both\ncomputational time and space. Part of the reason for this is the optimisation\nof hyperparameters, which involves repeatedly sampling, by random, guided, or\nbrute-force selection, from a large hyperparameter space and testing the\nresulting embeddings for their quality. However, not all hyperparameters in\nthis search space will be equally important. In fact, with prior knowledge of\nthe relative importance of the hyperparameters, some could be eliminated from\nthe search altogether without significantly impacting the overall quality of\nthe outputted embeddings. To this end, we ran a Sobol sensitivity analysis to\nevaluate the effects of tuning different hyperparameters on the variance of\nembedding quality. This was achieved by performing thousands of embedding\ntrials, each time measuring the quality of embeddings produced by different\nhyperparameter configurations. We regressed the embedding quality on those\nhyperparameter configurations, using this model to generate Sobol sensitivity\nindices for each of the hyperparameters. By evaluating the correlation between\nSobol indices, we find substantial variability in the hyperparameter\nsensitivities between knowledge graphs, with differing dataset characteristics\nbeing the probable cause of these inconsistencies.

While conventionally\na DPP is parameterized by a symmetric kernel matrix, removing this symmetry\nconstraint, resulting in nonsymmetric DPPs (NDPPs), leads to significant\nimprovements in modeling power and predictive performance. Recent work has\nstudied an approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for\nNDPPs restricted to size-$k$ subsets (called $k$-NDPPs). However, the runtime\nof this approach is quadratic in $n$, making it infeasible for large-scale\nsettings. In this work, we develop a scalable MCMC sampling algorithm for\n$k$-NDPPs with low-rank kernels, thus enabling runtime that is sublinear in\n$n$. Our method is based on a state-of-the-art NDPP rejection sampling\nalgorithm, which we enhance with a novel approach for efficiently constructing\nthe proposal distribution. Furthermore, we extend our scalable $k$-NDPP\nsampling algorithm to NDPPs without size constraints. Our resulting sampling\nmethod has polynomial time complexity in the rank of the kernel, while the\nexisting approach has runtime that is exponential in the rank. With both a\ntheoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets, we verify that our\nscalable approximate sampling algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than\nexisting sampling approaches for $k$-NDPPs and NDPPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 15:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

However, robot motions are mostly planned and preprogrammed with a\nnotable lack of adaptivity to task changes. Even for slightly changed tasks,\nthe whole system must be reprogrammed by robotics experts. Therefore, it is\nhighly desirable to have a flexible motion planning method, with which robots\ncan adapt to specific task changes in unstructured environments, such as\nproduction systems or warehouses, with little or no intervention from\nnon-expert personnel.

To achieve adaptive motion plans for a\nspecific application environment, e.g., desk assembly or warehouse\nloading/unloading, a library is built by abstracting features of common human\ndemonstrated tasks. The definition of semantical similarity between features in\nthe library and features of a new task is proposed and further used to\nconstruct the reward function in RL. The RL policy can automatically generate\nmotion plans for a new task if it determines that new task constraints can be\nsatisfied with the current library and request additional human demonstrations.\nMultiple experiments conducted on common tasks and scenarios demonstrate that\nthe proposed user-guided RL-assisted motion planning method is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 15:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Binary-merging systems with favorable orientation\nmay host two almost symmetric relics, named double radio relics. Double radio\nrelics are seen preferentially edge-on and, thus, constitute a privileged\nsample for statistical studies. Their polarization and Faraday rotation\nproperties give direct access to the relics origin and magnetic fields. In this\npaper, we present a polarization and Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis study of\nfour clusters hosting double radio relics, namely 8C 0212+703, Abell 3365, PLCK\nG287.0+32.9, previously missing polarization studies, and ZwCl 2341+0000, for\nwhich conflicting results have been reported. We used 1-2 GHz Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array observations. We also provide an updated compilation of known\ndouble radio relics with important observed quantities. We studied their\npolarization and Faraday rotation properties at 1.4 GHz and we searched for\ncorrelations between fractional polarization and physical resolution, distance\nfrom the cluster center, and shock Mach number. The weak correlations found\nbetween these quantities are well reproduced by state-of-the-art\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of radio relics, confirming that merger\nshock waves propagate in a turbulent medium with tangled magnetic fields. Both\nexternal and internal Faraday depolarization should play a fundamental role in\ndetermining the polarization properties of radio relics at 1.4 GHz. Although\nthe number of double radio relics with RM information is still low, their\nFaraday rotation properties (i.e., rest-frame RM and RM dispersion below 40 rad\nm$^{-2}$ and non-Gaussian RM distribution) can be explained in the scenario in\nwhich shock waves with Mach numbers larger than 2.5 propagate along the plane\nof the sky and compress the turbulent intra-cluster medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 15:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

This work is\nthe first to explore self-supervised learning for estimation of monocular depth\nof future unobserved frames of a video. Existing works rely on a large number\nof annotated samples to generate the probabilistic prediction of depth for\nunseen frames. However, this makes it unrealistic due to its requirement for\nlarge amount of annotated depth samples of video. In addition, the\nprobabilistic nature of the case, where one past can have multiple future\noutcomes often leads to incorrect depth estimates. Unlike previous methods, we\nmodel the depth estimation of the unobserved frame as a view-synthesis problem,\nwhich treats the depth estimate of the unseen video frame as an auxiliary task\nwhile synthesizing back the views using learned pose. This approach is not only\ncost effective - we do not use any ground truth depth for training (hence\npractical) but also deterministic (a sequence of past frames map to an\nimmediate future). To address this task we first develop a novel depth\nforecasting network DeFNet which estimates depth of unobserved future by\nforecasting latent features. Second, we develop a channel-attention based pose\nestimation network that estimates the pose of the unobserved frame. Using this\nlearned pose, estimated depth map is reconstructed back into the image domain,\nthus forming a self-supervised solution.

While work-efficient serial and\nmultithreaded algorithms for computing EMST are known, designing an efficient\nGPU algorithm is challenging due to a complex branching structure, data\ndependencies, and load imbalances. In this paper, we propose a single-tree\nBor\\r{u}vka-based algorithm for computing EMST on GPUs. We use an efficient\nnearest neighbor algorithm and reduce the number of the required distance\ncalculations by avoiding traversing subtrees with leaf nodes in the same\ncomponent.

We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various 2D and 3D datasets,\nshow and compare it with the current state-of-the-art open-source CPU\nimplementations. We demonstrate 4-24x speedup over the fastest multi-threaded\nimplementation.

Simultaneously, coal dominates the electricity grid, providing\nroughly three-quarters of electricity today. We present results from the first\nof a kind model to handle high uncertainty, which uses parametric analysis\ninstead of stochastic analysis for grid balancing based on economic despatch\nthrough 2030, covering 30-minute resolution granularity at a national level.\nThe model assumes a range of growing demand, supply options, prices, and other\nuncertain inputs. It calculates the lowest cost portfolio across a spectrum of\nparametric uncertainty. We apply simplifications to handle the intersection of\ncapacity planning with optimized despatch. Our results indicate that very high\nRE scenarios are cost-effective, even if a measurable fraction would be surplus\nand thus discarded (\"curtailed\"). We find that high RE without storage as well\nas existing slack in coal- and gas-powered capacity are insufficient to meet\nrising demand on a real-time basis, especially adding time-of-day balancing.\nStorage technologies prove valuable but remain expensive compared to the 2019\nportfolio mix, due to issues of duty cycling like seasonal variability, not\nmerely inherent high capital costs. However, examining alternatives to\nbatteries for future growth finds all solutions for peaking power are even more\nexpensive. For balancing at peak times, a smarter grid that applies demand\nresponse may be cost-effective.

A temperature difference was\ngenerated between the hydrofoil and mainstream by installing an aluminum\nnitride heater in a NACA0015 hydrofoil fabricated from copper. A cavitation\nexperiment was performed in a high-temperature water cavitation tunnel at the\nInstitute of Fluid Science, Tohoku University. The effect of heating on\ncavitating flow was evaluated by changing the mainstream velocity and pressure,\nnamely the cavitation number, at a fixed heater power of 860 W. Results showed\nthat the heat transfer from the hydrofoil affected cavitating flow in terms of\nthe cavity length, cavity aspect, and periodicity. The effect on the cavity\nlength became stronger at a lower velocity owing to a higher hydrofoil\ntemperature. The variation in periodicity implied that the heating effect\nreduced the unsteadiness of cavitation. A modified cavitation number was\nproposed by considering the heat transfer from the heated wall. A thermal\ncorrection term was derived by considering that the fluid temperature close to\nthe heated hydrofoil was affected by the turbulent convective heat transfer\nbetween the mainstream and hydrofoil. The corrected cavitation number can be\nconsidered as a parameter that describes the cavity length in the isothermal\nand heated cases in a unified expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 13:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

In the world of increasingly congested radio\nfrequencies, radars must adapt to avoid interference. Many radar systems employ\nthe prediction action cycle to proactively determine transmission mode while\nspectrum sharing. This method constructs and implements a model of the\nenvironment to predict unused frequencies, and then transmits in this predicted\navailability. For these selection strategies, performance is directly reliant\non the quality of the underlying environmental models. In order to keep up with\na changing environment, these models can employ changepoint detection.\nChangepoint detection is the identification of sudden changes, or changepoints,\nin the distribution from which data is drawn.

However, few studies have attempted to integrate both strategies to\nbetter facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end,\nthis study proposes a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate\nadaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free intersection based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework. The first layer uses a\ncentralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size of\neach platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e.,\nefficiency, fairness and energy saving). The second layer employs a\ndecentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple platoons passing through\nthe intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or\nindependent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an\nefficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon\nsizes and passing priorities respectively in the two layers. The model is\nvalidated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).\nThe simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve\nsatisfactory convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in\nresponse to varying traffic conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at\nthe intersection. By comparison with other control methods, the model manifests\nits superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination\nstrategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on\nreducing travel time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 02:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Recent work has focused on studying the\ncomputation of \"sufficient reasons\", a kind of explanation in which given a\ndecision tree $T$ and an instance $x$, one explains the decision $T(x)$ by\nproviding a subset $y$ of the features of $x$ such that for any other instance\n$z$ compatible with $y$, it holds that $T(z) = T(x)$, intuitively meaning that\nthe features in $y$ are already enough to fully justify the classification of\n$x$ by $T$. It has been argued, however, that sufficient reasons constitute a\nrestrictive notion of explanation, and thus the community has started to study\ntheir probabilistic counterpart, in which one requires that the probability of\n$T(z) = T(x)$ must be at least some value $\\delta \\in (0, 1]$, where $z$ is a\nrandom instance that is compatible with $y$. Our paper settles the\ncomputational complexity of $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons over decision trees,\nshowing that both (1) finding $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal in\nsize, and (2) finding $\\delta$-sufficient-reasons that are minimal\ninclusion-wise, do not admit polynomial-time algorithms (unless P=NP). This is\nin stark contrast with the deterministic case ($\\delta = 1$) where\ninclusion-wise minimal sufficient-reasons are easy to compute. By doing this,\nwe answer two open problems originally raised by Izza et al. On the positive\nside, we identify structural restrictions of decision trees that make the\nproblem tractable, and show how SAT solvers might be able to tackle these\nproblems in practical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 21:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Most COVID-19 deaths and economic losses are\nreported from densely crowded cities. It is comprehensible that the effective\ncontrol and prevention of epidemic/pandemic infectious diseases is vital.\nAccording to WHO, testing and diagnosis is the best strategy to control\npandemics. Scientists worldwide are attempting to develop various innovative\nand cost-efficient methods to speed up the testing process. This paper\ncomprehensively evaluates the applicability of the recent top ten\nstate-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatically\ndetecting COVID-19 infection using chest X-ray images. Moreover, it provides a\ncomparative analysis of these models in terms of accuracy. This study\nidentifies the effective methodologies to control and prevent infectious\nrespiratory diseases. Our trained models have demonstrated outstanding results\nin classifying the COVID-19 infected chest x-rays. In particular, our trained\nmodels MobileNet, EfficentNet, and InceptionV3 achieved a classification\naverage accuracy of 95\\%, 95\\%, and 94\\% test set for COVID-19 class\nclassification, respectively. Thus, it can be beneficial for clinical\npractitioners and radiologists to speed up the testing, detection, and\nfollow-up of COVID-19 cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 02:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Using techniques\nfrom topological data analysis, namely persistent homology, the topological\nfeatures of a simple feedforward neural network's layer representations of a\nmodified torus with a Klein bottle-like twist were computed. The network\nappeared to approximate homeomorphisms in early layers, before significantly\nchanging the topology of the data in deeper layers. The resulting noise\nhampered the ability of persistent homology to compute these features, however\nsimilar topological features seemed to persist longer in a network with a\nbijective activation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 00:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

In classic models of complex systems where structure and dynamics\nare considered homogeneous, criticality is restricted to phase transitions,\nleading either to robust (ordered) or adaptive (chaotic) phases in most of the\nparameter space. Many real-world complex systems, however, are not homogeneous.\nSome elements change in time faster than others, with slower elements (usually\nthe most relevant) providing robustness, and faster ones being adaptive.\nStructural patterns of connectivity are also typically heterogeneous,\ncharacterized by few elements with many interactions and most elements with\nonly a few. Here we take a few traditionally homogeneous dynamical models and\nexplore their heterogeneous versions, finding evidence that heterogeneity\nextends criticality. Thus, parameter fine-tuning is not necessary to reach a\nphase transition and obtain the benefits of (homogeneous) criticality. Simply\nadding heterogeneity can extend criticality, making the search/evolution of\ncomplex systems faster and more reliable. Our results add theoretical support\nfor the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneity in physical, social, and\ntechnological systems, as natural selection can exploit heterogeneity to evolve\ncomplexity \"for free\". In artificial systems and biological design,\nheterogeneity may also be used to extend the parameter range that allows for\ncriticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 16:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Portfolio construction refers\nto the allocation of different sector stocks optimally to achieve a maximum\nreturn by taking a minimum risk. A good portfolio can help investors earn\nmaximum profit by taking a minimum risk. Beginning with Dow Jones Theory a lot\nof advancement has happened in the area of building efficient portfolios. In\nthis project, we have tried to predict the future value of a few stocks from\nsix important sectors of the Indian economy and also built a portfolio. As part\nof the project, our team has conducted a study of the performance of various\nTime series, machine learning, and deep learning models in stock price\nprediction on selected stocks from the chosen six important sectors of the\neconomy. As part of building an efficient portfolio, we have studied multiple\nportfolio optimization theories beginning with the Modern Portfolio theory. We\nhave built a minimum variance portfolio and optimal risk portfolio for all the\nsix chosen sectors by using the daily stock prices over the past five years as\ntraining data and have also conducted back testing to check the performance of\nthe portfolio. We look forward to continuing our study in the area of stock\nprice prediction and asset allocation and consider this project as the first\nstepping stone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 10:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}
