Existing approaches for estimating treatment effects from\nlongitudinal observational data are usually built upon a strong assumption of\n\"unconfoundedness\", which is hard to fulfill in real-world practice. In this\npaper, we propose the Variational Temporal Deconfounder (VTD), an approach that\nleverages deep variational embeddings in the longitudinal setting using proxies\n(i.e., surrogate variables that serve for unobservable variables).\nSpecifically, VTD leverages observed proxies to learn a hidden embedding that\nreflects the true hidden confounders in the observational data. As such, our\nVTD method does not rely on the \"unconfoundedness\" assumption. We test our VTD\nmethod on both synthetic and real-world clinical data, and the results show\nthat our approach is effective when hidden confounding is the leading bias\ncompared to other existing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 16:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Through the\nlens of conjugate feature duality, we cast the weighted kernel principal\ncomponent analysis problem for MvSC and develop a modified weighted conjugate\nfeature duality to formulate dual variables.

In the self-supervised learning studies, it has been highlighted\nthat a quality of representation (embedding) space matters and directly affects\na downstream task performance. In this study, a quality of the representation\nspace is analyzed visually and analytically in terms of linear separability for\ndifferent classes on a real and fake news dataset. To further add\ninterpretability to a classification model, a modification of Class Activation\nMapping (CAM) is proposed. The modified CAM provides a CAM score for each word\ntoken, where the CAM score on a word token denotes a level of focus on that\nword token to make the prediction. Finally, it is shown that the naive BERT\nmodel topped with a learnable linear layer is enough to achieve robust\nperformance while being compatible with CAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 17:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The forcing is obtained by training a deep\nfully connected neural network, using a high polynomial order simulation but\nonly for a short time frame. With this corrective forcing, we can run the low\npolynomial order simulation faster (with large time steps and low cost per time\nstep) while improving its accuracy.\n  We explored this idea for a 1D Burgers' equation in (Marique and Ferrer, CAF\n2022), and we have extended this work to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, with\nand without a Large Eddy Simulation closure model. We test the methodology with\nthe turbulent Taylor Green Vortex case and for various Reynolds numbers (30,\n200 and 1600). In addition, the Taylor Green Vortex evolves with time and\ncovers laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes, as time progresses.\n  The proposed methodology proves to be applicable to a variety of flows and\nregimes. The results show that the corrective forcing is effective in all\nReynolds numbers and time frames (excluding the initial flow development). We\ncan train the corrective forcing with a polynomial order of 8, to increase the\naccuracy of simulations from a polynomial order 3 to 6, when correcting outside\nthe training time frame. The low order correct solution is 4 to 5 times faster\nthan a simulation with comparable accuracy (polynomial order 6).\n  Additionally, we explore changes in the hyperparameters and use transfer\nlearning to speed up the training. We observe that it is not useful to train a\ncorrective forcing using a different flow condition.

Since the network dependent\nterm in this decomposition is unaffected by the signals sent by the government,\nthis characterization simplifies the problem of finding the optimal information\ndisclosure policies. We find explicit conditions, in terms of the risk aversion\nand prudence, under which no disclosure, full disclosure, exaggeration and\ndownplay are the optimal policies. The structural decomposition results are\nalso helpful in studying other forms of interventions like incentive design and\nnetwork design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

This shows that such action-spaces force a polynomial lower bound\nrather than a logarithmic lower bound, as shown by \\cite{lattimore2017end}, in\ndiscrete (i.e., well-separated) action spaces. Furthermore, while the previous\nresult is shown to hold only in the asymptotic regime (as $n \\to \\infty$), our\nresult for these \"locally rich\" action spaces is any-time.

The recently\nproposed CLIPstyler has solved this problem, which is able to perform style\ntransfer based only on the provided description of the style image. Although\nCLIPstyler can achieve good performance when landscapes or portraits appear\nalone, it can blur the people and lose the original semantics when people and\nlandscapes coexist. Based on these issues, we demonstrate a novel framework\nthat uses a pre-trained CLIP text-image embedding model and guides image style\ntransfer through an FCN semantic segmentation network. Specifically, we solve\nthe portrait over-styling problem for both selfies and real-world landscape\nwith human subjects photos, enhance the contrast between the effect of style\ntransfer in portrait and landscape, and make the degree of image style transfer\nin different semantic parts fully controllable. Our Generative Artisan resolve\nthe failure case of CLIPstyler and yield both qualitative and quantitative\nmethods to prove ours have much better results than CLIPstyler in both selfies\nand real-world landscape with human subjects photos.

For a sequence of such matching queue systems parameterized by\n$n$, when the arrival rates of all categories tend to infinity in concert as\n$n$ tends to infinity, we obtain a heavy traffic limit of the appropriately\nscaled queue length vector under mild assumptions, which is characterized by a\ncoupled stochastic integral equation with a scalar-valued non-linear term.

To conduct transactions, a\nsender and a receiver can either establish a direct payment channel with a\nfunding blockchain transaction or leverage existing channels in a multi-hop\npayment. The security of PCNs usually relies on the synchrony of the underlying\nblockchain, i.e., evidence of misbehavior needs to be published on the\nblockchain within a time limit. Alternative payment channel proposals that do\nnot require blockchain synchrony rely on quorum certificates and use a\ncommittee to register the transactions of a channel. However, these proposals\ndo not support multi-hop payments, a limitation we aim to overcome. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that it is in fact impossible to design a multi-hop\npayment protocol with both network asynchrony and faulty channels, i.e.,\nchannels that may not correctly follow the protocol. We then detail two\ncommittee-based multi-hop payment protocols that respectively assume\nsynchronous communications and possibly faulty channels, or asynchronous\ncommunication and correct channels. The first protocol relies on possibly\nfaulty committees instead of the blockchain to resolve channel disputes, and\nenforces privacy properties within a synchronous network. The second one relies\non committees that contain at most f faulty members out of 3f+1 and\nsuccessively delegate to each other the role of eventually completing a\nmulti-hop payment. We show that both protocols satisfy the security\nrequirements of a multi-hop payment and compare their communication complexity\nand latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 22:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 12:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

To this end, we develop a novel face deblurring\nsystem based on the dual camera fusion technique for mobile phones.

Our experiments demonstrate the advantage and robustness\nof our system against alternative single-image, multi-frame, face-specific, and\nvideo deblurring algorithms as well as commercial products.

With the decreasing caregiver\npopulation on a global scale, it is important that the future of intelligent\nliving environments can detect falls during ADLs while being able to track the\nindoor location of the elderly in the real world.

The underlying coronal\nmass ejection (CME) originating from a quiescent filament region becomes a 440\nkm/s magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 au after ~5 days. The prolonged CME acceleration\n(for about 24 hrs) coincides with the time profiles of the post-eruption arcade\nintensity and reconnected flux. Chen et al. (2019) obtain lower speed since\nthey assumed that the CME does not accelerate after about 12 hrs. The presence\nof multiple coronal holes near the filament channel and the high-speed wind\nfrom them seem to have the combined effect of producing complex rotation in the\ncorona and IP medium resulting in a high-inclination MC. The Dst time profile\nin the main phase steepens significantly (rapid increase in storm intensity)\ncoincident with the density increase (prominence material) in the second half\nof the MC. Simulations using the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere\n(CIMI) model shows that a higher ring current energy results from larger\ndynamic pressure in MCs. Furthermore, the Dst index is highly correlated with\nthe main-phase time integral of the ring current injection that includes\ndensity, consistent with the simulations. A complex temporal structure develops\nin the storm main phase if the underlying MC has a complex density structure\nduring intervals of southward interplanetary magnetic field. We conclude that\nthe high intensity of the storm results from the prolonged CME acceleration,\ncomplex rotation, and the high density in the 1-au MC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 01:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Amortized\nvariational inference addresses these challenges via a neural network that\napproximates the posterior distribution not only for one instance of data, but\na distribution of data pertaining to a specific inverse problem. During\ninference, the neural network -- in our case a conditional normalizing flow --\nprovides posterior samples at virtually no cost. However, the accuracy of\namortized variational inference relies on the availability of high-fidelity\ntraining data, which seldom exists in geophysical inverse problems due to the\nEarth's heterogeneity. In addition, the network is prone to errors if evaluated\nover out-of-distribution data. As such, we propose to increase the resilience\nof amortized variational inference in the presence of moderate data\ndistribution shifts. We achieve this via a correction to the latent\ndistribution that improves the posterior distribution approximation for the\ndata at hand. The correction involves relaxing the standard Gaussian assumption\non the latent distribution and parameterizing it via a Gaussian distribution\nwith an unknown mean and (diagonal) covariance. These unknowns are then\nestimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the corrected\nand the (physics-based) true posterior distributions. While generic and\napplicable to other inverse problems, by means of a linearized seismic imaging\nexample, we show that our correction step improves the robustness of amortized\nvariational inference with respect to changes in the number of seismic sources,\nnoise variance, and shifts in the prior distribution. This approach provides a\nseismic image with limited artifacts and an assessment of its uncertainty at\napproximately the same cost as five reverse-time migrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 02:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 23:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 18:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

One way to reduce noise is to use longer exposure\nduring the capture. However, in the presence of motion (scene or camera\nmotion), longer exposures lead to motion blur, resulting in loss of image\ninformation. This creates a trade-off between these two kinds of image\ndegradations: motion blur (due to long exposure) vs. noise (due to short\nexposure), also referred as a dual image corruption pair in this paper. With\nthe rise of cameras capable of capturing multiple exposures of the same scene\nsimultaneously, it is possible to overcome this trade-off. Our key observation\nis that although the amount and nature of degradation varies for these\ndifferent image captures, the semantic content remains the same across all\nimages. To this end, we propose a method to leverage these multi exposure\ncaptures for robust inference under low-light and motion. Our method builds on\na feature consistency loss to encourage similar results from these individual\ncaptures, and uses the ensemble of their final predictions for robust visual\nrecognition.

However, the results of a simulation usually have a high degree of error\ndue to the uncertainty in the values of some variables, because they are not\nknown, or because their measurement may be imprecise, erroneous, or impossible\nto perform in real time.

Inspired by the idea of\ninsurance, we innovatively propose a decentralized file storage protocol in\nblockchain, named as FileInsurer, to achieve both scalability and reliability.\nWhile ensuring scalability by distributed storage, FileInsurer guarantees\nreliability by enhancing robustness and fully compensating for the file loss.\nSpecifically, under mild conditions, we prove that no more than 0.1\\% value of\nall files should be compensated even if half of the storage collapses.\nTherefore, only a relatively small deposit needs to be pledged by storage\nproviders to cover the potential file loss. Because of lower burdens of\ndeposit, storage providers have more incentives to participate in the storage\nnetwork.

MAR contains the following two\nindispensable components: cell running masking and bridging classifier.\nSpecifically, to enable the ViT to perceive the details beyond the visible\npatches easily, cell running masking is presented to preserve the\nspatio-temporal correlations in videos, which ensures the patches at the same\nspatial location can be observed in turn for easy reconstructions.\nAdditionally, we notice that, although the partially observed features can\nreconstruct semantically explicit invisible patches, they fail to achieve\naccurate classification. To address this, a bridging classifier is proposed to\nbridge the semantic gap between the ViT encoded features for reconstruction and\nthe features specialized for classification. Our proposed MAR reduces the\ncomputational cost of ViT by 53% and extensive experiments show that MAR\nconsistently outperforms existing ViT models with a notable margin.

Intuitively, biomimetic mechanisms are crucial to\nunderstanding and improving SNNs. For example, the associative long-term\npotentiation (ALTP) phenomenon suggests that in addition to learning mechanisms\nbetween neurons, there are associative effects within neurons. However, most\nexisting methods only focus on the former and lack exploration of the internal\nassociation effects. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Internal\nAssociation~(AIA) neuron model to establish previously ignored influences\nwithin neurons. Consistent with the ALTP phenomenon, the AIA neuron model is\nadaptive to input stimuli, and internal associative learning occurs only when\nboth dendrites are stimulated at the same time. In addition, we employ weighted\nweights to measure internal associations and introduce intermediate caches to\nreduce the volatility of associations. Extensive experiments on prevailing\nneuromorphic datasets show that the proposed method can potentiate or depress\nthe firing of spikes more specifically, resulting in better performance with\nfewer spikes.

Our proposed\nquad-domain network for MAR, referred to as Quad-Net, takes little additional\ncomputational cost since the Fourier transform is highly efficient, and works\nacross the four receptive fields to learn both global and local features as\nwell as their relations. Specifically, we first design a Sinogram-Fourier\nRestoration Network (SFR-Net) in the sinogram domain and its Fourier space to\nfaithfully inpaint metal-corrupted traces. Then, we couple SFR-Net with an\nImage-Fourier Refinement Network (IFR-Net) which takes both an image and its\nFourier spectrum to improve a CT image reconstructed from the SFR-Net output\nusing cross-domain contextual information. Quad-Net is trained on clinical\ndatasets to minimize a composite loss function. Quad-Net does not require\nprecise metal masks, which is of great importance in clinical practice. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the superiority of Quad-Net over the\nstate-of-the-art MAR methods quantitatively, visually, and statistically. The\nQuad-Net code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/longzilicart/Quad-Net.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 07:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 01:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Besides, the performance of fine-tuning\nstrongly relies on the amount of downstream data, while in practice, the\nscenarios with scarce data are common. Recent studies in the natural language\nprocessing (NLP) field show that prompt tuning, a new paradigm for tuning,\nalleviates the above issues and achieves promising results in various NLP\ntasks. In prompt tuning, the prompts inserted during tuning provide\ntask-specific knowledge, which is especially beneficial for tasks with\nrelatively scarce data. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the usage and\neffect of prompt tuning in code intelligence tasks. We conduct prompt tuning on\npopular pre-trained models CodeBERT and CodeT5 and experiment with three code\nintelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code\ntranslation.

The\nformation and maintenance of calcium homeostasis are closely related to the\nspatial distribution of calcium channels. In the current paper, a theoretical\nframework is established by abstracting the spatial distribution of the calcium\nchannels as a nonlinear biological complex network with calcium channels as\nnodes and Ca$^{2+}$ as edges. A dynamical model for a RyR is adopted to\ninvestigate the effect of spatial distribution on calcium oscillation. The\nmean-field model can be well reproduced from the complete graph and dense\nErd\\\"os-R\\'enyi network. The synchronization of RyRs is found important to\ngenerate a global calcium oscillation. The clique graph with a cluster\nstructure can not produce a global oscillation due to the failure of\nsynchronization between clusters. A more realistic geometric network is\nconstructed in a two-dimensional plane based on the experimental information\nabout the RyR arrangement of clusters and the frequency distribution of cluster\nsizes. Different from the clique graph, the global oscillation can be generated\nwith reasonable parameters on the geometric network.

To combine their respective\nmerits in accuracy and completeness, meantime reducing the demand for expensive\nlabeled data, this paper explores a novel semi-supervised setting of\nlearning-based MVS problem that only a tiny part of the MVS data is attached\nwith dense depth ground truth. However, due to huge variation of scenarios and\nflexible setting in views, semi-supervised MVS problem (Semi-MVS) may break the\nbasic assumption in classic semi-supervised learning, that unlabeled data and\nlabeled data share the same label space and data distribution. To handle these\nissues, we propose a novel semi-supervised MVS framework, namely SE-MVS.

To deal with the problem that one image has been pasted with several\nforegrounds coming from different images and needs to harmonize them towards\ndifferent domain directions without any mask as input, we propose a new\nsemantic-guided multi-mask image harmonization task. Different from the\nprevious single-mask image harmonization task, each inharmonious image is\nperturbed with different methods according to the semantic segmentation masks.\nTwo challenging benchmarks, HScene and HLIP, are constructed based on $150$ and\n$19$ semantic classes, respectively. Furthermore, previous baselines focus on\nregressing the exact value for each pixel of the harmonized images. The\ngenerated results are in the `black box' and cannot be edited.

These distortions become significant under fast camera/scene motions.\nUndoing effects of RS is sometimes addressed as a spatial problem, where\nobjects need to be rectified/displaced in order to generate their correct\nglobal shutter (GS) frame. However, the cause of the RS effect is inherently\ntemporal, not spatial. In this paper we propose a space-time solution to the RS\nproblem. We observe that despite the severe differences between their xy\nframes, a RS video and its corresponding GS video tend to share the exact same\nxt slices -- up to a known sub-frame temporal shift. Moreover, they share the\nsame distribution of small 2D xt-patches, despite the strong temporal aliasing\nwithin each video. This allows to constrain the GS output video using\nvideo-specific constraints imposed by the RS input video.

(ii) Learning\nto correctly merge an ensemble of such GS \"proposals\" using a dedicated\nMergeNet.

This paper\nfocuses on the maximization of bi-quadratic forms, which leads to a rank-one\napproximation problem that is equivalent to computing the M-spectral radius and\nits corresponding eigenvectors. Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound of\nthe M-spectral radius for nonnegative fourth-order partially symmetric (PS)\ntensors, which can be considered as an approximation of the M-spectral radius.\nFurthermore, we showed that the proposed upper bound can be obtained more\nefficiently, if the nonnegative fourth-order PS-tensors is a member of certain\nmonoid semigroups.

Here we test the feasibility of using the mean\nradial motion of stars in the stellar halo to constrain the rate of change of\nmass in the Galaxy, for example, due to decay of dark matter into invisible\ndark sector particles or more conservatively from the settling of baryons. In\nthe current $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm of structure formation, the stellar halo is\nformed by accretion of satellites onto the host galaxy. Over time, as the\nsatellites disrupt and phase mix, the mean radial motion $\\langle V_{R}\n\\rangle$ of the stellar halo is eventually expected to be close to zero. But\nmost halos have substructures due to incomplete mixing of specific accretion\nevents and this can lead to nonzero $\\langle V_{R} \\rangle$ in them.

This premise led to a proliferation of\nmethods offering techniques to learn and predict labels together, for example\nwhere the prediction for one label influences predictions for other labels.\nEven though it is now acknowledged that in many contexts a model of dependence\nis not required for optimal performance, such models continue to outperform\nindependent models in some of those very contexts, suggesting alternative\nexplanations for their performance beyond label dependence, which the\nliterature is only recently beginning to unravel.

We test SeS-GCN on CHICO for two\nimportant perception tasks in robotics: human pose forecasting, where it\nreaches an average error of 85.3 mm (MPJPE) at 1 sec in the future with a run\ntime of 2.3 msec, and collision detection, by comparing the forecasted human\nmotion with the known cobot motion, obtaining an F1-score of 0.64.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 12:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

These extra\ncharacters account for about one-third of the phonemes in Hawaiian, so\nincluding them makes a big difference to reading comprehension and\npronunciation. However, transliterating between older and newer texts is a\nlaborious task when performed manually. We introduce two related methods to\nhelp solve this transliteration problem automatically, given that there were\nnot enough data to train an end-to-end deep learning model. One method is\nimplemented, end-to-end, using finite state transducers (FSTs). The other is a\nhybrid deep learning approach which approximately composes an FST with a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN). We find that the hybrid approach outperforms\nthe end-to-end FST by partitioning the original problem into one part that can\nbe modelled by hand, using an FST, and into another part, which is easily\nsolved by an RNN trained on the available data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

Musical timbres are\ngiven by the superposition of sinusoidal signals, corresponding to longitudinal\nacoustic waves. Colors are produced by the superposition of transverse\nelectromagnetic waves in the domain of visible light. Regarding human\nperception, specific timbre variations provoke effects similar to color\nvariations, for example, a rising tension or a relaxation effect. We aim to\ncreate a computational framework to modulate timbres and colors. To this end,\nwe consider categorical groupoids, where colors (timbres) are objects and color\nvariations (timbre variations) are morphisms, and functors between them, which\nare induced by continuous maps. We also sketch some gestural variations of this\nscheme. Thus, we try to soften the differences and focus on the similarity of\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 14:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}
