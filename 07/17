Along\nthis line, this paper provides a systematic survey on three main game models\nwidely employed in adversarial games, i.e., zero-sum normal-form and\nextensive-form games, Stackelberg (security) games, zero-sum differential\ngames, from an array of perspectives, including basic knowledge of game models,\n(approximate) equilibrium concepts, problem classifications, research\nfrontiers, (approximate) optimal strategy seeking techniques, prevailing\nalgorithms, and practical applications.

Several papers\nhave proposed watermarking methods that claim to be empirically resistant to\ndifferent types of removal attacks, but these new techniques often fail in the\nface of new or better-tuned adversaries.

In cryptographic\nself-selection, each round $r$ has a seed $Q_r$. In round $r$, each account\nowner is asked to digitally sign $Q_r$, hash their digital signature to produce\na credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A\npublicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the\ndistribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution\nof stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring\ncredential is the leader for round $r$, and their credential becomes the seed\n$Q_{r+1}$. Such protocols leave open the possibility of a selfish-mining style\nattack: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring\ncredentials in round $r$ can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in\norder to influence the seed for round $r+1$. Indeed, the user can pre-compute\ntheir credentials for round $r+1$ for each potential seed, and broadcast only\nthe credential (among those with a low enough score to be the leader) that\nproduces the most favorable seed.\n  We consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of\nrounds in which an account they own is the leader. We show such an adversary\nalways benefits from deviating from the intended protocol, regardless of the\nfraction of the stake controlled. We characterize the optimal strategy; first\nby proving the existence of optimal positive recurrent strategies whenever the\nadversary owns last than $38\\%$ of the stake.

Berge\nconjectured that a digraph $D$ is $\\alpha$-diperfect if and only if $D$ does\nnot contain an anti-directed odd cycle as an induced subdigraph. In this paper,\nwe show that this conjecture is false by exhibiting an infinite family of\norientations of complements of odd cycles with at least seven vertices that are\nnot $\\alpha$-diperfect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 19:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 16:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

We frame this as the ability to learn to generalise\ncompositionally. And, we will refer to behaviours making use of this ability as\ncompositional learning behaviours (CLBs).\n  A central problem to learning CLBs is the resolution of a binding problem\n(BP) (by learning to, firstly, segregate the supportive stimulus components\nfrom the observation of multiple stimuli, and then, combine them in a single\nepisodic experience). While it is another feat of intelligence that human\nbeings perform with ease, it is not the case for state-of-the-art artificial\nagents.\n  Thus, in order to build artificial agents able to collaborate with human\nbeings, we propose to develop a novel benchmark to investigate agents'\nabilities to exhibit CLBs by solving a domain-agnostic version of the BP.

Methods:\nWe developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters\nthat spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal\nbeam-specific planning target volume. The software optimizes patient-specific\nridge filter and uses a Monte Carlo calculation engine, based on Geant4, to\nprovide dose and LET influence matrices.

We then demonstrate that LAVA performs competitively with the current\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised and weakly-supervised pretraining techniques\non UCF-101 and HMDB-51 video action recognition while using a fraction of the\nunlabeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 21:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

MOEs are key parameters in determining the quality\nof service at signalized intersections. Specifically, this study investigates\nthe use of drone raw data at a busy three-way signalized intersection in\nAthens, Greece, and builds on the open data initiative of the pNEUMA\nexperiment. Using a microscopic approach and shockwave analysis on data\nextracted from realtime videos, we estimated the maximum queue length, whether,\nwhen, and where a spillback occurred, vehicle stops, vehicle travel time and\ndelay, crash rates, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and fundamental diagrams.\nResults of the various MOEs were found to be promising, which confirms that the\nuse of traffic data collected by drones has many applications. We also\ndemonstrate that estimating MOEs in real-time is achievable using drone data.\nSuch models have the ability to track individual vehicle movements within\nstreet networks and thus allow the modeler to consider any traffic conditions,\nranging from highly under-saturated to highly over-saturated conditions. These\nmicroscopic models have the advantage of capturing the impact of transient\nvehicle behavior on various MOEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 21:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel adversarial attack method to generate noises for single object\ntracking under black-box settings, where perturbations are merely added on\ninitial frames of tracking sequences, which is difficult to be noticed from the\nperspective of a whole video clip. Specifically, we divide our algorithm into\nthree components and exploit reinforcement learning for localizing important\nframe patches precisely while reducing unnecessary computational queries\noverhead. Compared to existing techniques, our method requires fewer queries on\ninitialized frames of a video to manipulate competitive or even better attack\nperformance. We test our algorithm in both long-term and short-term datasets,\nincluding OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method on three mainstream types of trackers:\ndiscrimination, Siamese-based, and reinforcement learning-based trackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 00:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

In classification tasks with a small number of\nclasses or binary detection, the amount of information transferred from the\nteacher to the student is restricted, thus limiting the utility of knowledge\ndistillation. Performance can be improved by leveraging information of possible\nsubclasses within the classes. To that end, we propose the so-called Subclass\nKnowledge Distillation (SKD), a process of transferring the knowledge of\npredicted subclasses from a teacher to a smaller student. Meaningful\ninformation that is not in the teacher's class logits but exists in subclass\nlogits (e.g., similarities within classes) will be conveyed to the student\nthrough the SKD, which will then boost the student's performance. Analytically,\nwe measure how much extra information the teacher can provide the student via\nthe SKD to demonstrate the efficacy of our work. The framework developed is\nevaluated in clinical application, namely colorectal polyp binary\nclassification. It is a practical problem with two classes and a number of\nsubclasses per class. In this application, clinician-provided annotations are\nused to define subclasses based on the annotation label's variability in a\ncurriculum style of learning. A lightweight, low-complexity student trained\nwith the SKD framework achieves an F1-score of 85.05%, an improvement of 1.47%,\nand a 2.10% gain over the student that is trained with and without conventional\nknowledge distillation, respectively. The 2.10% F1-score gap between students\ntrained with and without the SKD can be explained by the extra subclass\nknowledge, i.e., the extra 0.4656 label bits per sample that the teacher can\ntransfer in our experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 03:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Although AT leads to promising results, training on a\nspecific threat model fails to generalize to other types of perturbations.

Of enduring\nrelevance to science and technology is silicon's nanomechanical behaviour\nincluding phase transformation, amorphization and dislocations generation,\nparticularly in the context of molecular dynamics and materials research.

This paper examines how well\nan unconventional combination of two well-known potentials - the Tersoff and\nStillinger-Weber - can perform in simulating that complexity.

Using the equivalence of indeterminates modulo the square\nof the maximal ideal, we compute the Gr\\\"obner fan of the linear part of the\nideal quickly and determine which indeterminates should be in $Z$ when we are\nlooking for optimal re-embeddings. Specific applications include re-embeddings\nof border basis schemes where $\\mathcal{O}\\subseteq K[x,y]$ and where\n$\\mathcal{O}$ consists of all terms up to some degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 08:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Assuming the text length is $n$ and the pattern\nlength is $m$, this problem can naively be solved in time $O(nm)$. In Knuth,\nMorris and Pratt's seminal paper of 1977, an automaton, was developed that\nallows solving this problem in time $O(n)$ for any alphabet.\n  This automaton, which we will refer to as the {\\em KMP-automaton}, has proven\nuseful in solving many other problems. A notable example is the {\\em\nparameterized pattern matching} model. In this model, a consistent renaming of\nsymbols from $\\Sigma$ is allowed in a match. The parameterized matching\nparadigm has proven useful in problems in software engineering, computer\nvision, and other applications.\n  It has long been suspected that for texts where the symbols are uniformly\nrandom, the naive algorithm will perform as well as the KMP algorithm. In this\npaper we examine the practical efficiency of the KMP algorithm vs. the naive\nalgorithm on a randomly generated text. We analyse the time under various\nparameters, such as alphabet size, pattern length, and the distribution of\npattern occurrences in the text. We do this for both the original exact\nmatching problem and parameterized matching. While the folklore wisdom is\nvindicated by these findings for the exact matching case, surprisingly, the KMP\nalgorithm works significantly faster than the naive in the parameterized\nmatching case.\n  We check this hypothesis for DNA texts, and observe a similar behaviour as in\nthe random text. We also show a very structured case where the automaton is\nmuch more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 09:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Thanks to the development of unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA), some works attempt to transfer the knowledge from a\nlabel-sufficient source domain to a label-free target domain under domain shift\nwith UDA. However, it requires the coexistence of source and target data, which\nmight be impractical for source data due to the privacy or storage issues. In\nthis paper, we take the first step towards the source-free unsupervised domain\nadaptation (SFUDA) in a simple yet efficient manner for BIQA to tackle the\ndomain shift without access to the source data. Specifically, we cast the\nquality assessment task as a rating distribution prediction problem. Based on\nthe intrinsic properties of BIQA, we present a group of well-designed\nself-supervised objectives to guide the adaptation of the BN affine parameters\ntowards the target domain. Among them, minimizing the prediction entropy and\nmaximizing the batch prediction diversity aim to encourage more confident\nresults while avoiding the trivial solution. Besides, based on the observation\nthat the IQA rating distribution of single image follows the Gaussian\ndistribution, we apply Gaussian regularization to the predicted rating\ndistribution to make it more consistent with the nature of human scoring.\nExtensive experimental results under cross-domain scenarios demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our proposed method to mitigate the domain shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 09:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 09:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

The main reason for\nthis is that the distributions between training and real-world data are\nmisaligned, and because of that, it is unstable of GAN inversion for real image\nediting. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN prior based editing framework to\ntackle the out-of-domain inversion problem with a composition-decomposition\nparadigm. In particular, during the phase of composition, we introduce a\ndifferential activation module for detecting semantic changes from a global\nperspective, \\ie, the relative gap between the features of edited and unedited\nimages. With the aid of the generated Diff-CAM mask, a coarse reconstruction\ncan intuitively be composited by the paired original and edited images. In this\nway, the attribute-irrelevant regions can be survived in almost whole, while\nthe quality of such an intermediate result is still limited by an unavoidable\nghosting effect. Consequently, in the decomposition phase, we further present a\nGAN prior based deghosting network for separating the final fine edited image\nfrom the coarse reconstruction.

The robustness and flexibility of our method is also validated on\nboth scenarios of single attribute and multi-attribute manipulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 10:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

In this work, we propose a novel fashion-focused V+L\nrepresentation learning framework, dubbed as FashionViL. It contains two novel\nfashion-specific pre-training tasks designed particularly to exploit two\nintrinsic attributes with fashion V+L data. First, in contrast to other domains\nwhere a V+L data point contains only a single image-text pair, there could be\nmultiple images in the fashion domain. We thus propose a Multi-View Contrastive\nLearning task for pulling closer the visual representation of one image to the\ncompositional multimodal representation of another image+text. Second, fashion\ntext (e.g., product description) often contains rich fine-grained concepts\n(attributes/noun phrases).

The players produce\noutputs for a set of activities, and the winning criteria of the contests are\nbased on these outputs. We consider two variations of the model: (i) players\nhave costs for producing outputs; (ii) players do not have costs but have\ngeneralized budget constraints. We observe that these games are exact potential\ngames and hence always have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The price of\nanarchy is $2$ for the budget model, but can be unbounded for the cost model.\nOur main results are for the computational complexity of these games. We prove\nthat for general versions of the model exactly or approximately computing a\nbest response is NP-hard.

To remedy these issues we introduce a framework\nfor repairing unsafe NNs w.r.t. safety specification, that is by utilizing\nsatisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Our method is able to search for\na new, safe NN representation, by modifying only a few of its weight values.

The effect of tidal dissipation on $\\dot{P}_b$ has\nbeen thought of as negligible. Here, we investigate the data for possible\neffects of tidal dissipation on $\\dot{P}_b$. The possibility of the tidal\ndissipation as a contributor to $\\dot{P}_b$ in a large sample of millisecond\npulsar binaries is investigated in detail. We collected a large sample of\npulsar binaries with measured $\\dot{P}_b$. All of the systems are millisecond\npulsars. The residual $\\dot{P}^{Res}_b$ of these systems was obtained by\nsubtracting the three normal effects, that is to say the effect of Shklovskii,\nline-of-sight acceleration, and gravitational radiation. Assuming that tidal\ndissipation is responsible for such a residual $\\dot{P}^{Res}_b$, the tidal\nparameters of these systems can be calculated and compared with the tidal\nmodels. The residual $\\dot{P}^{Res}_b$ is distributed over the half positive\nand half negative. The dynamical tidal model can explain the residual\n$\\dot{P}_b$ of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries. And the Love number of\nthe main-sequence companion of \\object{PSR J1227-4853} can be derived as a\nreasonable value $k_2=0.177^{+0.098}_{-0.058}$ with the equilibrium tidal\nmodel. Those results are compatible with the scenario of tidal dissipation.\nAdditionally, a weak correlation between the tidal parameter and orbital period\nis revealed, likely originating in the tidal process of the recycled stage\nwhich is worthy of further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 13:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is the most\npopular implementation of serverless computing, representing applications as\nevent-driven and stateless functions. However, existing studies report that\nfunctions of FaaS applications severely suffer from cold-start latency. In this\npaper, we propose an approach namely FaaSLight to accelerating the cold start\nfor FaaS applications through application-level optimization. We first conduct\na measurement study to investigate the possible root cause of the cold start\nproblem of FaaS. The result shows that application code loading latency is a\nsignificant overhead. Therefore, loading only indispensable code from FaaS\napplications can be an adequate solution. Based on this insight, we identify\ncode related to application functionalities by constructing the function-level\ncall graph, and separate other code (i.e., optional code) from FaaS\napplications. The separated optional code can be loaded on demand to avoid the\ninaccurate identification of indispensable code causing application failure. In\nparticular, a key principle guiding the design of FaaSLight is inherently\ngeneral, i.e., platform- and language-agnostic. The evaluation results on\nreal-world FaaS applications show that FaaSLight can significantly reduce the\ncode loading latency (up to 78.95%, 28.78% on average), thereby reducing the\ncold-start latency. As a result, the total response latency of functions can be\ndecreased by up to 42.05% (19.21% on average).

The\nfree-wave spectrum of modulated wave trains broadens owing to nonlinear\nquasi-resonant interaction. This enhances bound-wave production at high\nwavenumbers. The phases of all the wave components nearly coincide at peak\nmodulation and enhance amplification.

Zero-shot TAD\n(ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize\nany unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with\nsignificantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image\nclassification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to\ntackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an\noff-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification.

To overcome this\nproblem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection\nmodel via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively\neliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking\nthe route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction\nmechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization.\nExtensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.

Our ab-initio calculation,\nconsistent with experimental result, suggests strong hybridization between Nb-\nand Cr-derived states near the Fermi level. In the chiral helimagnetic state\n(below the Curie temperature Tc), we observe exchange splitting of the energy\nbands crossing EF, which follows the temperature evolution of the magnetic\nmoment, suggesting an important role of the conduction electrons in the\nlong-range magnetic ordering.

One of the many advantages\nof federated learning is that training data stay on devices (such as\nsmartphones), and only learned models are shared with a centralized server.

This result\nis derived under the assumption of the space expansion described by the\nstandard FLRW metric. In this paper, an alternative metric is applied and the\nmodified Newtonian equations are derived for the space expansion described by\nthe conformal FLRW metric. As shown by Vavry\\v{c}uk (Frontiers in Physics,\n2022), this metric is advantageous, because it properly predicts the cosmic\ntime dilation and fits the SNe Ia luminosity observations with no need to\nintroduce dark energy. Surprisingly, the Newtonian equations based on the\nconformal FLRW metric behave quite differently than those based on the standard\nFLRW metric. In contrast to the common opinion that local systems resist the\nspace expansion, the results for the conformal metric indicate that all local\nsystems expand according to the Hubble flow. The evolution of the local systems\nwith cosmic time is exemplified on numerical modelling of spiral galaxies. The\nsize of the spiral galaxies grows consistently with observations and a typical\nspiral pattern is well reproduced. The theory predicts flat rotation curves\nwithout an assumption of dark matter surrounding the galaxy. The theory\nresolves challenges to the $\\Lambda$CDM model such as the problem of faint\nsatellite galaxies, baryonic Tully-Fisher relation or the radial acceleration\nrelation.

The TESS light curves demonstrate that the\noccurrence of superhumps in these types of CVs is not an exception but quite\ncommon. For 8 systems new or improved values for the orbital period are\nmeasured. In TV Col the long-sought optical manifestation of the white dwarf\nspin period is first seen in form of its orbital sideband. The mystery of\nmultiple photometric periods observed in CP Pup in the past is explained by\nirregularly occurring anomalous states which are reflected in the light curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 15:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Variational algorithms, which form one main class of\ncomputations on NISQ platforms, produce a number of similar yet not identical\nquantum ``ansatz'' circuits. In this work, we present a transpilation\nmethodology optimized for variational algorithms under potentially changing\nerror rates.

Here we show that\nhumans do plan and perform optimal control strategies on uneven terrain. Rather\nthan maintain constant speed, they make purposeful, anticipatory speed\nadjustments that are consistent with minimizing energy expenditure.

However, there are few\nsystematic studies of averaging and forecast skill with modern forecasts, and\nit is therefore not clear how much improvement in forecast performance is\nproduced via averaging. Here we present a direct investigation of averaging\neffects, based on data from operational numerical weather forecasts. Data is\nanalyzed for precipitation and surface temperature, for lead times of roughly 1\nto 7 days, and for time- and space-averaging diameters of 1 to 7 days and 100\nto 4500 km, respectively. For different geographic locations, the effects of\ntime- or space-averaging can be different, and while no clear geographical\npattern is seen for precipitation, a clear spatial pattern is seen for\ntemperature. For temperature, in general, time averaging is most effective near\ncoastlines, also effective over land, and least effective over oceans. Based on\nall locations globally, time averaging was less effective than one might\nexpect. To help understand why time averaging may sometimes be minimally\neffective, a stochastic model is analyzed as a synthetic weather time series,\nand analytical formulas are presented for the decorrelation time. In effect,\nwhile time averaging creates a time series that is visually smoother, it does\nnot necessarily cause a substantial increase in the predictability of the time\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 02:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Initially, each image was paired with biometric data age, ethnicity,\nsex, presence and duration of diabetes a HDL/LDL ratios as well as any CVD\nevent wtihin 5 years of the retinal image acquisition. A risk score based on\nFramingham equations was calculated. The real CVD event rate was also\ndetermined for the individuals and overall population. Finally, ORAiCLE was\ntrained using only age, ethnicity, sex plus retinal images. Results: Compared\nto Framingham-based score, ORAiCLE was up to 12% more accurate in prediciting\ncardiovascular event in he next 5-years, especially for the highest risk group\nof people. The reliability and accuracy of each of the restrictive models was\nsuboptimal to ORAiCLE performance ,indicating that it was using data from both\nsets of data to derive its final results. Conclusion: Retinal photography is\ninexpensive and only minimal training is required to acquire them as fully\nautomated, inexpensive camera systems are now widely available.

Random-like behavior, a continuous broadband power\nspectrum, and a weak baseline condition dependency are all characteristics of\nchaotic systems. Chaos could be helpful in the three functional components of\ncompression, encryption, and modulation in a digital communication system. To\nsuccessfully use chaos theory in cryptography, chaotic maps must be built in\nsuch a way that the entropy they produce can provide the necessary confusion\nand diffusion. A chaotic map is used in the first layer of such cryptosystems\nto create confusion, and a second chaotic map is used in the second layer to\ncreate diffusion and create a ciphertext from a plaintext. A secret key\ngeneration mechanism and a key exchange method are frequently left out, and\nmany researchers just assume that these essential components of any effective\ncryptosystem are always accessible. We review such cryptosystems by using a\ncryptosystem of our design, in which confusion in plaintext is created using\nArnold's Cat Map, and logistic mapping is employed to create sufficient\ndispersion and ultimately get a matching ciphertext.
