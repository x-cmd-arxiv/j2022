PnP yields state-of-the-art results, but its theoretical\naspects are not well understood. This work considers the question: Similar to\nclassical compressed sensing (CS), can we theoretically recover the\nground-truth via PnP under suitable conditions on the denoiser and the sensing\nmatrix? One hurdle is that since PnP is an algorithmic framework, its solution\nneed not be the minimizer of some objective function. It was recently shown\nthat a convex regularizer $\\Phi$ can be associated with a class of linear\ndenoisers such that PnP amounts to solving a convex problem involving $\\Phi$.\nMotivated by this, we consider the PnP analog of CS: minimize $\\Phi(x)$ s.t.\n$Ax=A\\xi$, where $A$ is a $m\\times n$ random sensing matrix, $\\Phi$ is the\nregularizer associated with a linear denoiser $W$, and $\\xi$ is the\nground-truth. We prove that if $A$ is Gaussian and $\\xi$ is in the range of\n$W$, then the minimizer is almost surely $\\xi$ if $rank(W)\\leq m$, and almost\nnever if $rank(W)> m$. Thus, the range of the PnP denoiser acts as a signal\nprior, and its dimension marks a sharp transition from failure to success of\nexact recovery. We extend the result to subgaussian sensing matrices, except\nthat exact recovery holds only with high probability. For noisy measurements $b\n= A \\xi + \\eta$, we consider a robust formulation: minimize $\\Phi(x)$ s.t.\n$\\|Ax-b\\|\\leq\\delta$. We prove that for an optimal solution $x^*$, with high\nprobability the distortion $\\|x^*-\\xi\\|$ is bounded by $\\|\\eta\\|$ and $\\delta$\nif the number of measurements is large enough. In particular, we can derive the\nsample complexity of CS as a function of distortion error and success rate.

The MVPF\ngives policymakers important information about the equity-efficiency trade-off\nthat is not necessarily conveyed by absolute welfare measures. However, I show\nin this paper that the usefulness of MVPF for comparative welfare analysis is\nlimited, because it suffers from several empirically important economic\nparadoxes and statistical irregularities. There are also several practical\nissues in using the MVPF to aggregate welfare across policies or across\npopulation subgroups. To address these problems, I develop a new axiomatic\nframework to construct a measure that quantifies the equity-efficiency\ntrade-off in a better way. I do so without compromising on the core features of\nthe MVPF: its unit-free property, and the main preference orderings underlying\nit. My axiomatic framework delivers a unique (econo)metric that I call the\nRelative Policy Value (RPV), which can be weighted to conduct both comparative\nand absolute welfare analyses (or a hybrid combination thereof) and to\nintuitively aggregate welfare (without encountering the issues in MVPF-based\naggregation). I also propose computationally convenient methods to make\nuniformly valid statistical inferences on welfare measures. After reanalyzing\nseveral government policies using my new econometric methods, I conclude that\nthere is substantial economic and statistical uncertainty about welfare of some\npolicies that were previously reported to have very high or even \"precisely\nestimated infinite\" MVPF values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 16:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Then we calculate and compare the polarized structures of\nnuclei extracted from both scenarios. Also the Bjorken and ELT sum rules are\ncalculated using the moments of structure functions. The results are compared\nwith experimental data and the differences are investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 17:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

OSLS subsumes domain adaptation under label shift and\nPositive-Unlabeled (PU) learning. The learner's goals here are two-fold: (a)\nestimate the target label distribution, including the novel class; and (b)\nlearn a target classifier. First, we establish necessary and sufficient\nconditions for identifying these quantities. Second, motivated by advances in\nlabel shift and PU learning, we propose practical methods for both tasks that\nleverage black-box predictors. Unlike typical Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA)\nproblems, which tend to be ill-posed and amenable only to heuristics, OSLS\noffers a well-posed problem amenable to more principled machinery. Experiments\nacross numerous semi-synthetic benchmarks on vision, language, and medical\ndatasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform OSDA baselines,\nachieving 10--25% improvements in target domain accuracy. Finally, we analyze\nthe proposed methods, establishing finite-sample convergence to the true label\nmarginal and convergence to optimal classifier for linear models in a Gaussian\nsetup.

As typical measures\neither involve minimization procedures or a computational cost exponential in\nthe number of qubits $N$, it is notoriously hard to characterize for many-body\nstates. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness, as quantified by the\nrecently introduced Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropies (SREs), can be computed\nefficiently for matrix product states (MPSs). Specifically, given an MPS of\nbond dimension $\\chi$ and integer R\\'enyi index $n>1$, we show that the SRE can\nbe expressed in terms of the norm of an MPS with bond dimension $\\chi^{2n}$.\nFor translation-invariant states, this allows us to extract it from a single\ntensor, the transfer matrix, while for generic MPSs this construction yields a\ncomputational cost linear in $N$ and polynomial in $\\chi$. We exploit this\nobservation to revisit the study of ground-state nonstabilizerness in the\nquantum Ising chain, providing accurate numerical results up to large system\nsizes.

We use ancillary data to validate the 940 AGN\nidentifications, finding 83 percent of sources have AGN classifications from\nSED fitting and/or photometric identifications, yielding 160 new AGN\nidentifications. Considering the multi-wavelength classifications, brightness\ntemperature criteria select over half of radio-excess sources, 32 percent of\nsources classified as radio-quiet AGN, and 20 percent of sources classified as\nstar-forming galaxies. Infrared colour-colour plots and comparison with what we\nwould expect to detect based on peak brightness in 6 arcsec LOFAR maps, imply\nthat the star-forming galaxies and sources at low flux densities have a mixture\nof star-formation and AGN activity. We separate the radio emission from\nstar-formation and AGN in unresolved, $T_b$-identified AGN with no significant\nradio excess and find the AGN comprises $0.49\\pm 0.16$ of the radio luminosity.\nOverall the non-radio excess AGN show evidence for having a variety of\ndifferent radio emission mechanisms, which can provide different pathways for\nAGN and galaxy co-evolution. This validation of AGN identification using\nbrightness temperature at low frequencies opens the possibility for securely\nselecting AGN samples where ancillary data is inadequate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Here we show that the\ndisruptions of low-mass carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) by hybrid\nHelium-CO (HeCO) WDs during their merger could explain the origin and\nproperties of such SNe. We make use of detailed multi-dimensional\nhydrodynamical-thermonuclear (FLASH) simulations models of HeCO-CO WD-WD\nmergers to characterize such explosions. We find that the accretion of CO\nmaterial onto a HeCO-WD heats its He-shell and eventually leads to its \"weak\"\ndetonation and ejection and the production of a sub-energetic $\\sim10^{49}$erg\nCa-rich SN, while leaving the CO core of the HeCO-WD intact as a hot remnant\nwhite dwarf, possibly giving rise to X-ray emission as it cools down. We model\nthe detailed light-curve and spectra of such explosions to find an excellent\nagreement with observations of Ia/c Ca-rich SNe. In these models most of the He\nis burned, producing Ia/c Ca-rich SNe but higher He-enrichment levels might\npotentially also explain the Ib Ca-rich SNe. We thereby provide a viable,\nconsistent model for the origins of Ca-rich. These findings can shed new light\non the role of Ca-rich in the chemical evolution of galaxies and the\nintra-cluster medium, and their contribution to the observed 511 kev signal in\nthe Galaxy originating from positrons produced from ${}^{44}\\textrm{Ti}$ decay.\nFinally, the origins of such SNe points to the key-role of HeCO WDs as SN\nprogenitors, and their potential role as progenitors of other thermonuclear SNe\nincluding normal type Ia SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

It converts a\nphoton to a single electron making it very difficult to detect because of the\nreadout noise of the electronics. To overcome this there are two strategies,\neither to amplify the signal to make it larger than the readout noise (used in\nthe so called gain or amplified detectors), or to lower the readout noise in a\nstandard image sensor. For a long time, only amplified detectors were able to\ndo some photon counting. Since the first photon counting systems in the\nvisible, developed by Boksenberg and his collaborators in 1972, many groups\naround the world improved photon counting techniques. In the 2000's in the\nvisible, EMCCDs (electron multiplying charge coupled devices) allowed to\nreplace the classical image intensifier photon counting systems by solid state\ndevices and improved a lot the QE. But EMCCDs suffer from several issues, and\nthe most important of them is the excess noise factor which prevents to know\nthe exact incoming number of photons in the case of multiple photons per pixel.\nIn the infrared there was no equivalent to EMCCDs up to the development of\ne-APD sensors and cameras made with HgCdTe material (electron initiated\navalanche photo diode). With an excess noise factor near 1 at low temperatures,\nphoton counting is possible with these devices but only in the infrared. We\nwill show that having excess noise factor prevents from being able to do\nmultiple photon counting (quanta imaging) and the only solution is to lower the\nreadout noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Because testing some program\nbranches requires navigating complex semantic input requirements, FP4\nadditionally leverages the programmability of P4 by instrumenting the tested\nprogram to pass coverage information back to the tester through the packet\nheader.\n  We present case studies showing that FP4 can validate both safety and\nstateful properties, improves efficiency over existing random packet generation\nbaselines, and reaches 100% coverage in under a minute on a wide range of\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

In this work, numerical\nsimulations of biomass dust explosions are conducted with the open-source CFD\ncode OpenFOAM. The multi-phase (gas-solid) flow is treated in an\nEulerian-Lagrangian framework, using a two-way coupling regime and considering\nthe reactions of biomass conversion (moisture evaporation, devolatilization,\nand char oxidation), the combustion of volatile gases, and convective and\nradiative heat transfer. The model is validated with pressure-time and\nconcentration-dependent experimental measurements of two biomass samples.\nResults suggest that the characteristics of the cold-flow (\\i.e. turbulence\nlevels, actual dust concentration, spatial distribution of the dust cloud, and\nturbophoresis effect) govern the course of the explosion process, and depend\nstrongly on particle size, dust concentration, and ignition delay time effects.\nThese findings may be relevant in the design of better dust explosion testing\ndevices and to the reexamination of the guidelines for the operation of the\nexperiment.

The state-of-the-art Walsh chemical kinetics code\nis utilised for modeling chemical evolution. This code has been upgraded to\naccount for the time-evolving sizes of solids.

The modelled chemical evolution\nwith grain growth leads to increased abundances of H$_{2}$O ice. For carbon in\nthe inner disk, grain growth leads CO gas to overtake CO$_{2}$ ice as dominant\ncarrier, and in the outer disk, CH$_{4}$ ice to become the dominant carrier.\nOverall, a constant grain size adopted from a grain evolution model leads to\nalmost identical chemical evolution, when compared with chemical evolution with\nevolving grain sizes.

Traditional approaches rely on feature-space similarity and\nheroic assumptions on the data. In this paper, we introduce unsupervised\nlearning under Latent Label Shift (LLS), where we have access to unlabeled data\nfrom multiple domains such that the label marginals $p_d(y)$ can shift across\ndomains but the class conditionals $p(\\mathbf{x}|y)$ do not. This work\ninstantiates a new principle for identifying classes: elements that shift\ntogether group together. For finite input spaces, we establish an isomorphism\nbetween LLS and topic modeling: inputs correspond to words, domains to\ndocuments, and labels to topics. Addressing continuous data, we prove that when\neach label's support contains a separable region, analogous to an anchor word,\noracle access to $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ suffices to identify $p_d(y)$ and\n$p_d(y|\\mathbf{x})$ up to permutation. Thus motivated, we introduce a practical\nalgorithm that leverages domain-discriminative models as follows: (i) push\nexamples through domain discriminator $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$; (ii) discretize the\ndata by clustering examples in $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ space; (iii) perform\nnon-negative matrix factorization on the discrete data; (iv) combine the\nrecovered $p(y|d)$ with the discriminator outputs $p(d|\\mathbf{x})$ to compute\n$p_d(y|x) \\; \\forall d$.

It is still unclear if an attacker is able to create audio signal\nperturbations that can be well perceived by human beings in addition to its\nattack effectiveness. This is particularly important for music signals as they\nare carefully crafted with human-enjoyable audio characteristics.\n  In this work, we formulate the adversarial attack against music signals as a\nnew perception-aware attack framework, which integrates human study into\nadversarial attack design. Specifically, we conduct a human study to quantify\nthe human perception with respect to a change of a music signal. We invite\nhuman participants to rate their perceived deviation based on pairs of original\nand perturbed music signals, and reverse-engineer the human perception process\nby regression analysis to predict the human-perceived deviation given a\nperturbed signal. The perception-aware attack is then formulated as an\noptimization problem that finds an optimal perturbation signal to minimize the\nprediction of perceived deviation from the regressed human perception model.

Since the\ncoupling mechanisms are complex, safe levels or frequencies of emission that\nwould not interfere with CMB measurements cannot always be determined through\nstraightforward calculations. We discuss models of interference for various\ntypes of RFI relevant to CMB-S4, mitigation strategies, and the potential\nimpacts on survey sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 22:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 20:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Recent studies of\nSiPMs in communication focus on the speed rather than the power consumption of\nthe receiver. The gain bandwidth product (GBP) of the amplifiers in these\npost-SiPM readout circuits is significantly higher than the target data rate.\nAdditionally, the SiPM experiments for optical communication are performed\nusing an offline method which uses instruments including oscilloscopes and\npersonal computers to process chunks of the transmitted data. In this work, we\nhave developed an embedded real-time FPGA-based system to evaluate a\ncommercially available 1 mm-sq SiPM. The implemented real-time system achieves\ndata rates from 10 kbps to 1 Mbps with a BER below 1E-3 approaching the Poisson\nlimit. Results showed that reducing either the dark count rate or the data rate\nleads to lower dark counts per bit time, hence less power penalty to maintain a\nPE of 1E-3. The numerically simulated results indicated that to maintain the\nPoisson limit, the minimum GBP of the amplifier in the post-SiPM readout\ncircuit is 120 MHz based on the proposed setup within the tested data rates.\nThis GBP limitation is determined by the noise floor of the read-out circuit.\nThe analysis of the minimum GBP and electrical power consumption of the\nreceiver in photon counting and BER enables the potential future adoption of\nthis receiver technology when high optical sensitivity is required, such as\nvisible light communications (VLC) for low energy and low data rate IoT\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 22:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 22:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 12:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

In this\ndirection, two frameworks are introduced. The first one called Nested\nDistributed DDP (ND-DDP), is a three-level architecture which employs ADMM for\nenforcing a consensus between all agents, an augmented Lagrangian layer for\nsatisfying local constraints and DDP as each agent's optimizer. In the second\napproach, both consensus and local constraints are handled with ADMM, yielding\na two-level architecture called Merged Distributed DDP (MD-DDP), which further\nreduces computational complexity.

How to\nefficiently and effectively model the 3D self-attention of video data has been\na great challenge for transformers. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Patch\nShift (TPS) method for efficient 3D self-attention modeling in transformers for\nvideo-based action recognition. TPS shifts part of patches with a specific\nmosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, thus converting a vanilla spatial\nself-attention operation to a spatiotemporal one with little additional cost.\nAs a result, we can compute 3D self-attention using nearly the same computation\nand memory cost as 2D self-attention.

So far, it's still considered one\nof the most efficient PSI-CA protocols and the most cited(more than 170\ncitations) PSI-CA paper based on the Google Scholar search.\n  However, when we tried to implement this protocol, we couldn't get the\ncorrect result of the test data. Since the original paper lacks of experimental\nresults to verify the protocol's correctness, we looked deeper into the\nprotocol and found out it made a fundamental mistake. Needless to say, its\ncorrectness analysis and security proof are also wrong.\n  In this paper, we will point out this PSI-CA protocol's mistakes, and provide\nthe correct version of this protocol as well as the PSI protocol developed from\nthis protocol. We also present a new security proof and some experimental\nresults of the corrected protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 03:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

These tasks must be scheduled on\nresource-constrained devices such that the performance goals and the\nrequirements of the application are met. This is a difficult scheduling problem\nthat requires handling multiple scheduling dimensions, and variations in\nresource usage and availability. In practice, system designers manually tune\nparameters for their specific hardware and application, which results in poor\ngeneralization and increases the development burden. In this work, we highlight\nthe emerging need for scheduling CPU resources at runtime in sense-react\nsystems. We study three canonical applications (face tracking, robot\nnavigation, and VR) to first understand the key scheduling requirements for\nsuch systems. Armed with this understanding, we develop a scheduling framework,\nCatan, that dynamically schedules compute resources across different components\nof an app so as to meet the specified application requirements. Through\nexperiments with a prototype implemented on a widely-used robotics framework\n(ROS) and an open-source AR/VR platform, we show the impact of system\nscheduling on meeting the performance goals for the three applications, how\nCatan is able to achieve better application performance than hand-tuned\nconfigurations, and how it dynamically adapts to runtime variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 04:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2022 17:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Another problem that plagues\nindustry deployments of machine learning (ML) solutions is concept drift\ndetection, which becomes more challenging in the presence of missing values.\nAlthough data imputation and concept drift detection have been studied\nextensively, little work has attempted a combined study of the two phenomena,\ni.e., concept drift detection in the presence of sparsity. In this work, we\ncarry out a systematic study of the following: (i) different patterns of\nmissing values, (ii) various statistical and ML based data imputation methods\nfor different kinds of sparsity, (iii) several concept drift detection methods,\n(iv) practical analysis of the various drift detection metrics, (v) selecting\nthe best concept drift detector given a dataset with missing values based on\nthe different metrics.

The original DST \\textit{leaks} the lowest\nfrequency (DC: direct current) components of signals into high frequency (AC:\nalternating current) subbands. This property is not desired in many\napplications, particularly image processing, since most of the frequency\ncomponents in natural images concentrate in DC subband. The characteristic of\nfilter banks whereby they do not leak DC components into the AC subbands is\ncalled \\textit{regularity}. While an R-DST has been proposed, it has no fast\nimplementation because of the singular value decomposition (SVD) in its\ninternal algorithm. In contrast, the proposed regularity-constrained fast sine\ntransform (R-FST) is obtained by just appending a regularity constraint matrix\nas a postprocessing of the original DST. When the DST size is $M\\times M$\n($M=2^\\ell$, $\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$), the regularity constraint matrix is\nconstructed from only $M/2-1$ rotation matrices with the angles derived from\nthe output of the DST for the constant-valued signal (i.e., the DC signal).\nSince it does not require SVD, the computation is simpler and faster than the\nR-DST while keeping all of its beneficial properties. An image processing\nexample shows that the R-FST has fine frequency selectivity with no DC leakage\nand higher coding gain than the original DST. Also, in the case of $M=8$, the\nR-FST saved approximately $0.126$ seconds in a 2-D transformation of $512\\times\n512$ signals compared with the R-DST because of fewer extra operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 05:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

The current study, using\na three-dimensional incompressible computational fluid dynamics model with a\nfluid-structure interaction approach, aims to quantify how energy reflection\nand dissipation vary with different degrees of rigidity and vegetation density\nof a coastal forest.\n  We represent tree trunks as cylinders and use the elastic modulus of hardwood\ntrees such as pine or oak to characterize the rigidity of these cylinders. The\nnumerical results show that energy reflection increases with rigidity only for\na single cylinder. In the presence of multiple cylinders, the difference in\nenergy reflection created by varying rigidity diminishes as the number of\ncylinders increases. Instead of rigidity, we find that the blockage area\ncreated by the presence of multiple tree trunks dominates energy reflection. As\ntree trunks are deformed by the hydrodynamic forces, they alter the flow field\naround them, causing turbulent kinetic energy generation in the wake region. As\na consequence, trees dissipate flow energy, highlighting coastal forests\nreducing the onshore energy flux of tsunamis by means of both reflection and\ndissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 05:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

In this paper,\nwe argue that neither of the assumptions applies to SGG: there are numerous\nnoisy ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions and harm\nthe training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel NoIsy\nlabel CorrEction and Sample Training strategy for SGG: NICEST. Specifically, it\nconsists of two parts: NICE and NIST, which rule out these noisy label issues\nby generating high-quality samples and the effective training strategy,\nrespectively. NICE first detects noisy samples and then reassigns them more\nhigh-quality soft predicate labels. NIST is a multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation based training strategy, which enables the model to learn unbiased\nfusion knowledge. And a dynamic trade-off weighting strategy in NIST is\ndesigned to penalize the bias of different teachers. Due to the model-agnostic\nnature of both NICE and NIST, our NICEST can be seamlessly incorporated into\nany SGG architecture to boost its performance on different predicate\ncategories. In addition, to better evaluate the generalization of SGG models,\nwe further propose a new benchmark VG-OOD, by re-organizing the prevalent VG\ndataset and deliberately making the predicate distributions of the training and\ntest sets as different as possible for each subject-object category pair. This\nnew benchmark helps disentangle the influence of subject-object category based\nfrequency biases.

In contrast to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which aims at\nautomating neural network architecture design, active learning aims at\nautomating training data selection.

Active\nlearning alleviates the expensive data annotation issue through incrementally\ntraining models powered with efficient data selection. Instead of annotating\nall unlabeled samples, it iteratively selects and annotates the most valuable\nsamples.

Gravitational\nperturbation from the planet can increase the relative velocities of\nplanetesimals at the mean motion resonances to very high values and impede\naccretion at those locations. However, gas drag can also align the orbital\npericenters of equal-size planetesimals in certain disk locations and make them\ndynamically quiet and \"accretion-friendly\" locations for planetesimals of\nsimilar sizes. Following the previous paper, where we investigated the effect\nof a Jupiter-like planet on an external planetesimal disk, we generalize our\nfindings to extrasolar planetary systems by varying the planet parameters. In\nparticular, we focus on the dependence of the planetesimal relative velocities\non the mass and eccentricity of the existing planet. We found that the velocity\ndispersion of identical-mass particles increases monotonically with increasing\nplanet mass. Meanwhile, the dependence of the relative velocity between\ndifferent-mass planetesimals on their mass ratio becomes weaker as the planet\nmass increases. While the relative velocities generally increases with\nincreasing planet eccentricity, the velocity dispersion of smaller-mass\nparticles ($m \\lesssim 10^{18}~\\rm{g}$) is almost independent of planet\neccentricity owing to their strong coupling to gas.

Across\nmultiple protocols, the hydrogels consistently exhibit power-law\nviscoelasticity in the linear viscoelastic regime with an exponent $\\beta =\n0.03$, suggesting a dense fractal meso-structure, with predicted fractal\ndimension $d_f = 2.48$. In the nonlinear viscoelastic regime, the hydrogel\nundergoes stiffening and energy dissipation, indicating simultaneous alignment\nand unfolding of the folded proteins. Remarkably, this behaviour is highly\nreversible, as the value of $\\beta$, $d_f$ and the viscoelastic moduli return\nto their equilibrium value, even after multiple cycles of deformation. This\nhighlights a previously unrevealed diversity of viscoelastic properties that\noriginate on the mesoscopic scale.

An intuitive approach for video deblurring\nincludes two steps: a) detecting the blurry region in the current frame; b)\nutilizing the information from clear regions in adjacent frames for current\nframe deblurring. To realize this process, our idea is to detect the pixel-wise\nblur level of each frame and combine it with video deblurring. To this end, we\npropose a novel framework that utilizes the motion magnitude prior (MMP) as\nguidance for efficient deep video deblurring. Specifically, as the pixel\nmovement along its trajectory during the exposure time is positively correlated\nto the level of motion blur, we first use the average magnitude of optical flow\nfrom the high-frequency sharp frames to generate the synthetic blurry frames\nand their corresponding pixel-wise motion magnitude maps. We then build a\ndataset including the blurry frame and MMP pairs. The MMP is then learned by a\ncompact CNN by regression. The MMP consists of both spatial and temporal blur\nlevel information, which can be further integrated into an efficient recurrent\nneural network (RNN) for video deblurring.

In this work, we\npropose the random feature method (RFM) for solving PDEs, a natural bridge\nbetween traditional and machine learning-based algorithms. RFM is based on a\ncombination of well-known ideas: 1. representation of the approximate solution\nusing random feature functions; 2. collocation method to take care of the PDE;\n3. the penalty method to treat the boundary conditions, which allows us to\ntreat the boundary condition and the PDE in the same footing. We find it\ncrucial to add several additional components including multi-scale\nrepresentation and rescaling the weights in the loss function. We demonstrate\nthat the method exhibits spectral accuracy and can compete with traditional\nsolvers in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we find that RFM\nis particularly suited for complex problems with complex geometry, where both\ntraditional and machine learning-based algorithms encounter difficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 09:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Characterisation of structural\nsimilarity across this length scale is key to bridging the gap between local\natomic structure (using atomic resolution techniques such as High Resolution\nScanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM)) and the macro-scale (using\nbulk techniques such as powder X-ray and neutron diffraction). The use of SEND\ntechnique allows for structural investigation of a broad range of samples, due\nto the techniques ability to operate with low electron dosage and its tolerance\nfor sample thickness, relative to HR-STEM. This, coupled with the capacity for\ndata collection over a wide areas and the automation of this collection, allows\nfor statistically representative sampling of the microstructure. Also due to\nthese factors, SEND generates large datasets and as a result automated/\nsemi-automated data processing workflows are required to aid in maximal\nextraction of useful information. As such, this paper outlines a versatile,\ndata-driven approach for producing domain maps, as well as a statistical\napproach for assessing their applicability. The production of such domain maps\nfor a dataset can help highlight nuance in the microstructure, as well as\nimprove the manageability of that dataset for further investigation. The\nworkflow outlined utilises a Variational AutoEncoder to identify and learn the\nsources of variance in the diffraction signal and this, in combination with\nclustering techniques, is used to produce domain maps for a set of varied\nexample cases. This approach: is agnostic to domain crystallinity; requires no\nprior knowledge of crystal structure; and does not require the, potentially\nprohibitive, simulation of a library of appropriate diffraction patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 09:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Recently,\nDirected Greybox Fuzzers (DGFs) propose an alternative strategy that goes\nbeyond \"just\" coverage: driving testing toward specific code targets by\nselecting \"closer\" seeds. DGFs go through different phases: exploration (i.e.,\nreaching interesting locations) and exploitation (i.e., triggering bugs). In\npractice, DGFs leverage coverage to directly measure exploration, while\nexploitation is, at best, measured indirectly by alternating between different\ntargets. Specifically, we observe two limitations in existing DGFs: (i) they\nlack precision in their distance metric, i.e., averaging multiple paths and\ntargets into a single score (to decide which seeds to prioritize), and (ii)\nthey assign energy to seeds in a round-robin fashion without adjusting the\npriority of the targets (exhaustively explored targets should be dropped).\n  We propose FishFuzz, which draws inspiration from trawl fishing: first\ncasting a wide net, scraping for high coverage, then slowly pulling it in to\nmaximize the harvest. The core of our fuzzer is a novel seed selection strategy\nthat builds on two concepts: (i) a novel multi-distance metric whose precision\nis independent of the number of targets, and (ii) a dynamic target ranking to\nautomatically discard exhausted targets. This strategy allows FishFuzz to\nseamlessly scale to tens of thousands of targets and dynamically alternate\nbetween exploration and exploitation phases. We evaluate FishFuzz by leveraging\nall sanitizer labels as targets. Extensively comparing FishFuzz against modern\nDGFs and coverage-guided fuzzers shows that FishFuzz reached higher coverage\ncompared to the direct competitors, reproduces existing bugs (70.2% faster),\nand finally discovers 25 new bugs (18 CVEs) in 44 programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 09:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a\ndeconfined state of QCD matter, made of free quarks and gluons, called\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) is expected to be formed. To probe such an\nenvironment, the study of quarkonium production is an important tool as the\nheavy quarks are produced during the initial stage of the collision and\nexperience the entire medium evolution. Surprisingly, in small colliding\nsystems as pp and p--Pb, QGP-like behaviours are observed when selecting high\nmultiplicity events. The physics interpretation of these behaviours remains\nunclear. However, multiparton interaction is one of the main promising\nscenarios to explain such observation.

In this study, we developed\nnumerical simulations to study the impact of a 2D hill on the sound propagation\nfor a turbine in non flat terrain. The simulations employed a propagation model\nderived from the linearized Euler equations, solved in a moving frame following\nthe wavefront. The wind turbine noise was modeled using a point source\napproach. The flow structure in the atmospheric boundary layer and the wind\nturbine wake were obtained from large-eddy simulations. We find that the wind\nturbine wake acts as a waveguide that focuses sound propagation towards the\nground. This effect is most pronounced for the flat terrain case and when the\nturbine is placed on the hill. The sound attenuation is more localized and\ncloser to the turbine when the wind turbine is placed on the hilltop than in\nthe flat case. As the wind speed increases, the sound focusing is observed\ncloser to the turbine. For a turbine placed in front of the hill, the sound\npropagation is mainly determined by the flow over the hill. This demonstrates\nthat terrain topography can have surprising effects on wind turbine noise\npropagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 09:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

However,\nthese architectures are intrinsically imperfect as they fail to exhibit\nlong-range interactions and spatial dependencies leading to a severe\nperformance drop in the segmentation of medical images with variable shapes and\nstructures. Transformers, preliminary proposed for sequence-to-sequence\nprediction, have arisen as surrogate architectures to precisely model global\ninformation assisted by the self-attention mechanism. Despite being feasibly\ndesigned, utilizing a pure Transformer for image segmentation purposes can\nresult in limited localization capacity stemming from inadequate low-level\nfeatures. Thus, a line of research strives to design robust variants of\nTransformer-based U-Net. In this paper, we propose Trans-Norm, a novel deep\nsegmentation framework which concomitantly consolidates a Transformer module\ninto both encoder and skip-connections of the standard U-Net. We argue that the\nexpedient design of skip-connections can be crucial for accurate segmentation\nas it can assist in feature fusion between the expanding and contracting paths.\nIn this respect, we derive a Spatial Normalization mechanism from the\nTransformer module to adaptively recalibrate the skip connection path.\nExtensive experiments across three typical tasks for medical image segmentation\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TransNorm.

Recently, the\ndeployed DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to Trojan attacks, which\nmanipulate model parameters with bit flips to inject a hidden behavior and\nactivate it by a specific trigger pattern. However, all existing Trojan attacks\nadopt noticeable patch-based triggers (e.g., a square pattern), making them\nperceptible to humans and easy to be spotted by machines. In this paper, we\npresent a novel attack, namely hardly perceptible Trojan attack (HPT).

Almost all existing works follow the \"only look once\" framework that\nexploits a single model to directly capture the complex cross- and self-modal\nrelations among video-query pairs and retrieve the relevant segment. However,\nwe argue that these methods have overlooked two indispensable characteristics\nof an ideal localization method: 1) Frame-differentiable: considering the\nimbalance of positive/negative video frames, it is effective to highlight\npositive frames and weaken negative ones during the localization. 2)\nBoundary-precise: to predict the exact segment boundary, the model should\ncapture more fine-grained differences between consecutive frames since their\nvariations are often smooth. To this end, inspired by how humans perceive and\nlocalize a segment, we propose a two-step human-like framework called\nSkimming-Locating-Perusing (SLP). SLP consists of a Skimming-and-Locating (SL)\nmodule and a Bi-directional Perusing (BP) module. The SL module first refers to\nthe query semantic and selects the best matched frame from the video while\nfiltering out irrelevant frames. Then, the BP module constructs an initial\nsegment based on this frame, and dynamically updates it by exploring its\nadjacent frames until no frame shares the same activity semantic. Experimental\nresults on three challenging benchmarks show that our SLP is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art methods and localizes more precise segment boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 10:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

In observations they are usually\ndefined by setting a maximum separation in the sky and in velocity along the\nline of sight, and finding galaxies within these ranges. However, when\nobserving the sky, projection effects can affect the results, by creating\nspurious pairs that are not close in physical distance. In this work we mimic\nthese observational techniques to find pairs in The Three Hundred simulations\nof clusters of galaxies. The galaxies' 3D coordinates are projected into 2D,\nwith Hubble flow included for their line-of-sight velocities. The pairs found\nare classified into \"good\" or \"bad\" depending on whether their 3D separations\nare within the 2D spatial limit or not.

Unfortunately, the\nerror models required to do this type of fusion are not well understood, with\nmany different approaches being put forward. Recently, a few systems have\nachieved good results by having their networks predict probability\ndistributions rather than single values. We propose using this approach to fuse\na learned single-view depth prior into a standard 3D reconstruction system.\n  Our system is capable of incrementally producing dense depth maps for a set\nof keyframes. We train a deep neural network to predict discrete, nonparametric\nprobability distributions for the depth of each pixel from a single image.

Evaluating a semi-local DFA\nnon-self-consistently on the Hartree-Fock (HF) density is often recommended as\na computationally cheap remedy for delocalization errors. For sophisticated\nmeta-GGAs like SCAN, this approach can achieve remarkable accuracy. When this\nHF-DFT (or DFA@HF) significantly improves over the DFA, it is often presumed\nthat the HF density is more accurate than the self-consistent DFA density. By\napplying the metrics of density-corrected density functional theory (DFT), we\nshow that HF-DFT works for barrier heights by making a localizing charge\ntransfer error or density over-correction, thereby producing a\nsomewhat-reliable cancellation of density- and functional-driven errors for the\nenergy. A quantitative analysis of the charge transfer errors in a few\ntransition states confirms this trend. We do not have the exact functional and\nexact densities that are needed to evaluate the exact density- and\nfunctional-driven errors for the large BH76 database of barrier heights.\nInstead, we have identified and used three non-local proxy functionals (the\nSCAN 50% global hybrid, the range-separated hybrid LC-$\\omega$PBE, and\nSCAN-FLOSIC) and their self-consistent densities. These functionals yield\nreasonably accurate self-consistent barrier heights, and their self-consistent\ntotal energies are nearly piecewise linear in fractional electron number - two\nimportant points of similarity to the exact functional. We argue that\ndensity-driven errors of the energy in a self-consistent density functional\ncalculation are second-order in the density error, and that large\ndensity-driven errors arise primarily from incorrect electron transfers over\nlength scales larger than the diameter of an atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 13:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 21:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 14:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a\npiecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML\npipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence\nof slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not\nwork well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these\nchallenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained\nimplementations slows down the adoption of CO layers.\n  In this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic\nperspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate\ndifferentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many\napproaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones.\nBased on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source\nJulia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into\na differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines\ncontaining such layers.

However, the limited discriminability of learned representation\nmanifests there is still plenty to go for making a stronger vision learner.\nTowards this goal, we propose Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE), a new\nself-supervised pre-training method for learning more comprehensive and capable\nvision representations. By elaboratively unifying contrastive learning (CL) and\nmasked image model (MIM) through novel designs, CMAE leverages their respective\nadvantages and learns representations with both strong instance\ndiscriminability and local perceptibility. Specifically, CMAE consists of two\nbranches where the online branch is an asymmetric encoder-decoder and the\ntarget branch is a momentum updated encoder. During training, the online\nencoder reconstructs original images from latent representations of masked\nimages to learn holistic features. The target encoder, fed with the full\nimages, enhances the feature discriminability via contrastive learning with its\nonline counterpart. To make CL compatible with MIM, CMAE introduces two new\ncomponents, i.e. pixel shift for generating plausible positive views and\nfeature decoder for complementing features of contrastive pairs. Thanks to\nthese novel designs, CMAE effectively improves the representation quality and\ntransfer performance over its MIM counterpart.

The relaxation\nmechanism which produces this cusp gives insight into those which are active in\nhigh-resolution simulations of first halo formation in Cold or Warm Dark Matter\nuniverses, and, indeed, a simple argument suggests that the same power-law\nindex $\\gamma=-12/7$ should describe the prompt cusps formed during the\ncollapse of generic peaks, independent of any symmetry assumption. Further work\nis needed to investigate whether additional factors are required to explain the\nslightly flatter exponent, $\\gamma\\approx -1.5$, found in high-resolution\nnumerical simulations of peak collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 14:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 16:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

With the current ability of\nultrathin noble metal film deposition down to a few monolayers in thickness,\nthere is a need for an analytical expression of the thickness dependent complex\ndielectric function for predicting optical properties for arbitrary\nthicknesses. The free and bound electron contributions to the dielectric\nfunction are dealt with independently, since their influences affect separate\nwavelengths ranges. The former is dealt within the Drude model framework for\nlarge wavelengths with appropriately addressed damping constant and plasma\nfrequency parameters to account for thickness dependence. Applying our\npreviously developed method, we determine these parameters for specific film\nthicknesses, based on refractive index experimental values for Ag and Au thin\nfilms. Fitting separately each one of these parameters allowed us to find an\nanalytical expression for their dependence on arbitrary film thickness and\nconsequently for the free electron contribution. Concerning bound electrons, it\nis seen that its contribution for small wavelengths is the same for all\nanalyzed thicknesses and may be set equal to the bulk bound contribution.\nTaking all these facts into account, the complex dielectric function can be\nrewritten analytically, in terms of the bulk dielectric function plus\ncorrective film thickness dependent terms. In particular, the fitting process\nfor the damping constant allows us to determine that the electron scattering at\nthe film boundary is mainly diffusive (inelastic) for both silver and gold thin\nfilms.

To examine phase transformation kinetics, a\nspecial emphasis is placed on the jump condition for the axiom of entropy\ninequality, thereby recovering the conventional result that stable phase\nequilibrium coincides with continuity of temperature, pressure, and free\nenthalpy across the phase boundary. Moreover, this jump condition leads to the\nformulation of a constitutive relation for the phase transformation mass flux,\n$-\\left[\\left[\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{q}\\right]\\right]\\cdot\\mathbf{n}^{\\Gamma}/\\left[\\left[s\\right]\\right]$,\nwhere $\\left[\\left[\\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{q}\\right]\\right]\\cdot\\mathbf{n}^{\\Gamma}$\nis the jump in entropy flux normal to, and across the phase interface $\\Gamma$,\nand $\\left[\\left[s\\right]\\right]$ is the corresponding jump in entropy.

Researchers have explored\nsubgoal labeled instructional materials with explanations in traditional\nproblem solving and within tutoring systems to help novices learn to subgoal.\nHowever, only a little research is found on problem-solving strategies in\nrelationship with subgoal learning. Also, these strategies are under-explored\nwithin computer-based tutors and learning environments. Backward\nproblem-solving strategy is closely related to the process of subgoaling, where\nproblem solving iteratively refines the goal into a new subgoal to reduce\ndifficulty. In this paper, we explore a training strategy for backward strategy\nlearning within an intelligent logic tutor that teaches logic proof\nconstruction. The training session involved backward worked examples (BWE) and\nproblem-solving (BPS) to help students learn backward strategy towards\nimproving their subgoaling and problem-solving skills. To evaluate the training\nstrategy, we analyzed students' 1) experience with and engagement in learning\nbackward strategy, 2) performance, and 3) proof construction approaches in new\nproblems that they solved independently without tutor help after each level of\ntraining and in post-test. Our results showed that, when new problems were\ngiven to solve without any tutor help, students who were trained with both BWE\nand BPS outperformed students who received none of the treatment or only BWE\nduring training. Additionally, students trained with both BWE and BPS derived\nsubgoals during proof construction with significantly higher efficiency than\nthe other two groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Prior evaluations showed that these systems improve\nlearning in terms of test scores, or task completion efficiency. However,\ncrucial aspects which can impact learning or reveal insights important for\nfuture improvement of such systems are ignored in these evaluations. These\naspects include inherent fallibility of current state-of-the-art, students'\nprogramming behavior in response to correct/incorrect feedback, and\neffective/ineffective system components. Consequently, a great deal of\nknowledge is yet to be discovered about such systems. In this paper, we apply a\nmulti-criteria evaluation with 5 criteria on a data-driven feedback system\nintegrated within a block-based novice programming environment. Each criterion\nin the evaluation reveals a unique pivotal aspect of the system: 1) How\naccurate the feedback system is; 2) How it guides students throughout\nprogramming tasks; 3) How it helps students in task completion; 4) What happens\nwhen it goes wrong; and 5) How students respond generally to the system. Our\nevaluation results showed that the system was helpful to students due to its\neffective design and feedback representation despite being fallible. However,\nnovices can be negatively impacted by this fallibility due to high reliance and\nlack of self-evaluation. The negative impacts include increased working time,\nimplementation, or submission of incorrect/partially correct solutions. The\nevaluation results reinforced the necessity of multi-criteria system\nevaluations while revealing important insights helpful to ensuring proper usage\nof data-driven feedback systems, designing fallibility mitigation steps, and\ndriving research for future improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

In multiphase flow, i.e., where the\nfluid consists, e.g., of a liquid and a gaseous phase, these techniques could\nalso provide valuable insights into the internal flow of droplets and ligaments\nand thus into their dynamics. However, since such structures tend to act as\nentities, high translational and rotational velocities often obfuscate their\ndetail. As a remedy, we present a method for deriving a droplet-local velocity\nfield, using a decomposition of the original velocity field removing\ntranslational and rotational velocity parts, and adapt path- and streaklines.\nGenerally, the resulting integral lines are thus shorter and less tangled,\nwhich simplifies their analysis. We demonstrate and discuss the utility of our\napproach on droplets in two-phase flow data and visualize the removed velocity\nparts employing glyphs for context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 14:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 10:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

We\nmodel the disturbances by Gaussian noise and use the mean first hitting time\nwhen the state hits the boundary of a secure domain, that is a subset of the\nbasin of the attraction, to measure the synchronization stability. Based on the\ninvariant probability distribution of a system of phase oscillators subject to\nGaussian disturbances, we propose an optimization method to increase the mean\nfirst hitting time, and thus increase the synchronization stability. In this\nmethod, a new metric for the synchronization stability is defined as the\nprobability of the state being absent from the secure domain, which reflects\nthe impact of all the system parameters and the strength of the disturbances.\nFurthermore, by this new metric, one may identify those edges which may lead to\ndesynchronization with a high risk. A case study shows that the mean first\nhitting time is dramatically increased after solving the corresponding\noptimization problems and the vulnerable edges are effectively identified. It\nis also found that optimizing the synchronization by maximizing the order\nparameter or the phase cohesiveness may dramatically increase the value of the\nmetric and decrease the mean first hitting time, thus decrease the\nsynchronization stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 02:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 10:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 08:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}
