We perform detailed simulations of the angular\ndistributions of lepton pairs from the decay of $N$ produced in two-body and\nthree-body decays of $B$ mesons.

However, there are many\nknown methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. In\nthis paper, we systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based\nscience. We show that data leakage is indeed a widespread problem and has led\nto severe reproducibility failures. Specifically, through a survey of\nliterature in research communities that adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields\nwhere errors have been found, collectively affecting 329 papers and in some\ncases leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we\npresent a fine-grained taxonomy of 8 types of leakage that range from textbook\nerrors to open research problems.\n  We argue for fundamental methodological changes to ML-based science so that\ncases of leakage can be caught before publication. To that end, we propose\nmodel info sheets for reporting scientific claims based on ML models that would\naddress all types of leakage identified in our survey. To investigate the\nimpact of reproducibility errors and the efficacy of model info sheets, we\nundertake a reproducibility study in a field where complex ML models are\nbelieved to vastly outperform older statistical models such as Logistic\nRegression (LR): civil war prediction. We find that all papers claiming the\nsuperior performance of complex ML models compared to LR models fail to\nreproduce due to data leakage, and complex ML models don't perform\nsubstantively better than decades-old LR models. While none of these errors\ncould have been caught by reading the papers, model info sheets would enable\nthe detection of leakage in each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 16:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative\nnetworking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS\nor the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing\nthe two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily\nenvisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment\nsuch as walls and furniture.

However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem\nthan supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods\ndirectly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method.

Building on this qualitative implication we make two contributions.\nFirst, we introduce effective invariance (EI), a simple and reasonable measure\nof model invariance which does not rely on image labels. Given predictions on a\ntest image and its transformed version, EI measures how well the predictions\nagree and with what level of confidence. Second, using invariance scores\ncomputed by EI, we perform large-scale quantitative correlation studies between\ngeneralization and invariance, focusing on rotation and grayscale\ntransformations.

The new technique exploits the Koopman\nrepresentation of the solution of the equations of motion to develop an energy\noptimal inverse control methodology. The operator theory can reformulate a\nnonlinear dynamical system of finite dimension into a linear system with an\ninfinite number of dimensions. As a results, the state of any nonlinear\ndynamics is represented as a linear combination of high-order orthogonal\npolynomials, which creates the state transition polynomial map of the solution.\nSince the optimal control technique can be reduced to a two-points boundary\nvalue problem, the Koopman map is used to connect the state and control\nvariables in time, such that optimal values are obtained through map inversion\nand polynomial evaluation. The new technique is applied to rendezvous\napplications in space, where the relative motion between two satellites is\nmodelled with a high-order polynomial series expansion of the Lagrangian of the\nsystem, such that the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations represent the reduction of\nthe high-order model to a linear truncation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 17:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

To explicitly address this disadvantage, this study presents\na novel driver behavior model that aims to capture the resource rationality and\nstochasticity of the human driver's behaviors in realistic longitudinal driving\nscenarios. The resource rationality principle can provide a theoretic framework\nto better understand the human cognition processes by modeling human's internal\ncognitive mechanisms as utility maximization subject to cognitive resource\nlimitations, which can be represented as finite and time-varying preview\nhorizons in the context of driving. An inverse resource rational-based\nstochastic inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRR-SIRL) is proposed to\nlearn a distribution of the planning horizon and cost function of the human\ndriver with a given series of human demonstrations. A nonlinear model\npredictive control (NMPC) with a time-varying horizon approach is used to\ngenerate driver-specific trajectories by using the learned distributions of the\nplanning horizon and the cost function of the driver. The simulation\nexperiments are carried out using human demonstrations gathered from the\ndriver-in-the-loop driving simulator.

Generalizing the exploitation of coherent\nphonon-phonon interactions to nonlinear couplings among other types of\ncollective modes would open unprecedented opportunities in the design of novel\ndynamic functionalities in solids. For example, the collective excitations of\nmagnetic order - magnons - can efficiently transfer information via spin\ncurrent flow, and their coherent and nonlinear control would provide an\nattractive route to achieve faster signal processing for next-generation\ninformation technologies. Here, we discover that intense terahertz (THz) fields\ncan initiate processes of magnon upconversion via coherent magnon-magnon\ninteractions - a phenomenon that opens the paradigm of nonlinear coupled\nmagnonics. By using a suite of advanced spectroscopic tools, including a newly\ndemonstrated two-dimensional (2D) THz polarimetry technique enabled by\nsingle-shot detection, we unveil the unidirectional nature of coupling between\ndistinct magnon modes of a canted antiferromagnet. Calculations of spin\ndynamics further suggest that this coupling is a universal feature of\nantiferromagnets with canted magnetic moments.

As OQS evolution is non-unitary, implementation\non quantum computers -- limited to unitary operations -- is challenging. We\npresent a general framework for OQSs where the system's $d \\times d$ density\nmatrix is recast as a $d^{2}$ wavefunction which can be evolved by unitary\ntransformations. This theory has two significant advantages over conventional\napproaches: (i) the wavefunction requires only an $n$-qubit, compared to\n$2n$-qubit, bath for an $n$-qubit system and (ii) the purification includes\ndynamics of any pure-state universe. We demonstrate this method on a two-level\nsystem in a zero temperature amplitude damping channel and a two-site quantum\nIsing model. Quantum simulation and experimental-device results agree with\nclassical calculations, showing promise in simulating non-unitary operations on\nNISQ quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 17:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 20:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

We here explore the interplay\nbetween local resetting and geometric confinement in a system consisting of two\nspecies of diffusive particles: \"bath\" particles, and \"tracers\" which undergo\nlocal resetting.

Upon\nvarying the ratio of the degree of geometric confinement over particle\ndiffusivity, the system is found to transition between two states.

The first design is motivated by the observation that using a\npretrained MAE to extract the features as the BERT prediction target for masked\ntokens can achieve better pretraining performance. Therefore, we add a momentum\nencoder in parallel with the original MAE encoder, which bootstraps the\npretraining performance by using its own representation as the BERT prediction\ntarget. In the second design, we introduce target-specific information (e.g.,\npixel values of unmasked patches) from the encoder directly to the decoder to\nreduce the pressure on the encoder of memorizing the target-specific\ninformation. Thus, the encoder focuses on semantic modeling, which is the goal\nof BERT pretraining, and does not need to waste its capacity in memorizing the\ninformation of unmasked tokens related to the prediction target.

As a step towards answering these\nquestions we consider real analytic CFT data, where in the absence of\nlogarithms, the radius is set by singularities of the complex metric reached by\nanalytically continuing the Fefferman-Graham radial coordinate. With the\nconformal boundary at the origin of the complex radial plane, real Lorentzian\nsubmanifolds appear as piecewise paths built from radial rays and arcs of\ncircles centred on the origin.

However, the dynamics of these winds is\nunderstood primarily via their illumination from a single central source. The\nDoppler shift seen in resonance lines is a useful tool for inferring these\ndynamics, but the mapping from that Doppler shift to the radial distance from\nthe source is ambiguous. Binary systems can reduce this ambiguity by providing\na second light source at a known radius in the wind, seen from orbitally\nmodulated directions. From the nature of the collision between the winds, a\nmassive companion also provides unique additional information about wind\nmomentum fluxes. Since massive stars are strong ultraviolet (UV) sources, and\nUV resonance line opacity in the wind is strong, UV instruments with a high\nresolution spectroscopic capability are essential for extracting this dynamical\ninformation. Polarimetric capability also helps to further resolve ambiguities\nin aspects of the wind geometry that are not axisymmetric about the line of\nsight, because of its unique access to scattering direction information.

We\nanalyze the behavior of 48 users over a span of 8 weeks (over 200k audio-visual\nshort posts analyzed) and estimate how contagious the users with whom they\nengage with are on social media. As per the theory of diffusion, we account for\nthe videos a user watches during this time (inflow) and the daily engagements;\nliking, sharing, downloading or creating new videos (outflow) to estimate\ncontagion. To validate our approach and analysis, we obtain human feedback on\nthese 48 social media platform users with an online study by collecting\nresponses of about 150 participants. We report users who interact with more\nnumber of creators on the platform are 12% less prone to contagion, and those\nwho consume more content of `negative' sentiment are 23% more prone to\ncontagion. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 18:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Despite the\nremarkable progress, most of the previous deep clustering works still suffer\nfrom two limitations. First, many of them focus on some distribution-based\nclustering loss, lacking the ability to exploit sample-wise (or\naugmentation-wise) relationships via contrastive learning. Second, they often\nneglect the indirect sample-wise structure information, overlooking the rich\npossibilities of multi-scale neighborhood structure learning. In view of this,\nthis paper presents a new deep clustering approach termed Image clustering with\ncontrastive learning and multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (IcicleGCN),\nwhich bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning and\nmulti-scale neighborhood structure learning for the image clustering task. The\nproposed IcicleGCN framework consists of four main modules, namely, the\nCNN-based backbone, the Instance Similarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster\nStructure Learning and Instance reconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the\nMulti-scale GCN module (M-GCN). Specifically, with two random augmentations\nperformed on each image, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is\nutilized to learn the representations for the augmented samples, which are then\nfed to ISM and JC-SLIM for instance-level and cluster-level contrastive\nlearning, respectively. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure\nlearning, two streams of GCNs and an auto-encoder are simultaneously trained\nvia (i) the layer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the\njoint self-adaptive learning that ensures their last-layer output distributions\nto be consistent. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 19:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

We\nstudy this problem, and find that FMs such as CLIP may not be robust to various\ngroup shifts. Across 9 robustness benchmarks, zero-shot classification with\ntheir embeddings results in gaps of up to 80.7 percentage points (pp) between\naverage and worst-group accuracy. Unfortunately, existing methods to improve\nrobustness require retraining, which can be prohibitively expensive on large\nfoundation models. We also find that efficient ways to improve model inference\n(e.g., via adapters, lightweight networks with FM embeddings as inputs) do not\nconsistently improve and can sometimes hurt group robustness compared to\nzero-shot (e.g., increasing the accuracy gap by 50.1 pp on CelebA).

Multiple\nequilibria have also been found as a function of atmospheric CO2, with a\nsubtropical SST nearly 10 K higher in the cloud-free state, and with suggested\nrelevance to warm-climate dynamics. In this study, we use a mixed-layer model\nwith an added surface energy balance and the ability to simulate both the\ncloud-covered and cloud-free states to study both types of multiple equilibria\nand the corresponding hysteresis. The model's simplicity and computational\nefficiency allow us to explore the mechanisms critical to the stratocumulus\ncloud instability and hysteresis as well as isolate key processes that allow\nfor multiple equilibria via mechanism denial experiments not possible with a\nfull-complexity model. For the hysteresis in fixed-SST, we find that decoupling\ncan occur due to either enhanced entrainment warming or a reduction in\ncloud-top longwave cooling. The critical SST at which decoupling occurs is\nhighly sensitive to precipitation and entrainment parameterizations. In the CO2\nhysteresis, decoupling occurs in the simple model used even without the\ninclusion of an active SST and SST-cloud cover feedbacks, and the width of the\nhysteresis displays the same sensitivities as the fixed-SST case. Overall, the\nsimple model analysis and results motivate further studies using higher\ncomplexity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 19:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Despite the remarkable progress of such spotting\nparadigm, an important limitation is that the performance of text recognition\ndepends heavily on the precision of text detection, resulting in the potential\nerror propagation from detection to recognition. In this work, we propose the\nsingle shot Self-Reliant Scene Text Spotter v2 (SRSTS v2), which circumvents\nthis limitation by decoupling recognition from detection while optimizing two\ntasks collaboratively. Specifically, our SRSTS v2 samples representative\nfeature points around each potential text instance, and conducts both text\ndetection and recognition in parallel guided by these sampled points. Thus, the\ntext recognition is no longer dependent on detection, thereby alleviating the\nerror propagation from detection to recognition. Moreover, the sampling module\nis learned under the supervision from both detection and recognition, which\nallows for the collaborative optimization and mutual enhancement between two\ntasks. Benefiting from such sampling-driven concurrent spotting framework, our\napproach is able to recognize the text instances correctly even if the precise\ntext boundaries are challenging to detect.

It is an enormous\nchallenge to understand such diversified data, especially via extracting the\nattribute-value pairs in text sequences with the aid of helpful image regions.\nAlthough a series of previous works have been dedicated to this task, there\nremain seldomly investigated obstacles that hinder further improvements: 1)\nParameters from up-stream single-modal pretraining are inadequately applied,\nwithout proper jointly fine-tuning in a down-stream multi-modal task. 2) To\nselect descriptive parts of images, a simple late fusion is widely applied,\nregardless of priori knowledge that language-related information should be\nencoded into a common linguistic embedding space by stronger encoders. 3) Due\nto diversity across products, their attribute sets tend to vary greatly, but\ncurrent approaches predict with an unnecessary maximal range and lead to more\npotential false positives. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a\nnovel approach to boost multi-modal e-commerce attribute value extraction via\nunified learning scheme and dynamic range minimization: 1) Firstly, a unified\nscheme is designed to jointly train a multi-modal task with pretrained\nsingle-modal parameters. 2) Secondly, a text-guided information range\nminimization method is proposed to adaptively encode descriptive parts of each\nmodality into an identical space with a powerful pretrained linguistic model.\n3) Moreover, a prototype-guided attribute range minimization method is proposed\nto first determine the proper attribute set of the current product, and then\nselect prototypes to guide the prediction of the chosen attributes.

STEER does not necessitate changes to conventional\nbeam alignment methodologies nor additional over-the-air feedback, making it\ncompatible with existing cellular standards. Instead, STEER uses conventional\nbeam alignment to identify the general directions beams should be steered, and\nthen it makes use of a minimal number of self-interference measurements to\njointly select transmit and receive beams that deliver high gain in these\ndirections while coupling low self-interference. We implement STEER on an\nindustry-grade 28 GHz phased array platform and use further simulation to show\nthat full-duplex operation with beams selected by STEER can notably outperform\nboth half-duplex and full-duplex operation with beams chosen via conventional\nbeam selection. For instance, STEER can reliably reduce self-interference by\nmore than 20 dB and improve SINR by more than 10 dB, compared to conventional\nbeam selection.

The development of video-text retrieval has been considerably\npromoted by large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training, which primarily\nfocuses on coarse-grained or fine-grained contrast. However, cross-grained\ncontrast, which is the contrast between coarse-grained representations and\nfine-grained representations, has rarely been explored in prior research.\nCompared with fine-grained or coarse-grained contrasts, cross-grained contrast\ncalculate the correlation between coarse-grained features and each fine-grained\nfeature, and is able to filter out the unnecessary fine-grained features guided\nby the coarse-grained feature during similarity calculation, thus improving the\naccuracy of retrieval.

Glass forming liquids or structural glasses are found very often\nin three dimensions. However, in two dimensions(2D) it is believed that both\nspin glass and structural glass can never exist at a finite temperature because\nthey are destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Using a large-scale quantum Monte\nCarlo simulation, we discover a quantum-mechanically driven 2D glass phase at\nfinite temperatures. Our platform is an Ising spin model with a quantum\ntransverse field on a frustrated triangular lattice. How the present glass\nphase is formed is understood by the following three steps. First, by the\ninterplay of geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuation, part of the spins\nspontaneously form an antiferromagnetic honeycomb spin-superstructure. Then,\nsmall randomness in the bond interaction works as a relevant perturbation to\nthis superstructure and breaks it up into {\\it domains}, making it a structural\nglass. The glassiness of the superstructure, in turn, generates an emergent\nrandom magnetic field acting on the remaining fluctuating spins and freezes\nthem.

Linear polarization of the background emission\nis depolarized by Faraday rotation of inhomogeneous magnetized plasma of the\nintervening galaxies. Exploring the depolarizing intervening galaxies (DINGs)\ncan be a powerful tool to investigate the cosmological evolution of the\ngalactic magnetic field. In this paper, we investigate the effects of DINGs on\nbackground radio emission using theoretical DING models. We find that complex\nstructures of galaxy result in complicated depolarization features and the\nFaraday dispersion functions (FDFs), but, for the features of depolarizations\nand FDFs, the global component of magnetic fields is important. We show the\nsimplest results with ring magnetic field in the galactic disk. We find that\nthe degree of depolarization significantly depends on the inclination angle and\nthe impact parameter of the DING. We found that the larger the standard\ndeviation, the more likely it is that depolarization will occur. The FDF\nrepresents the RM structure within the beam. The FDF exhibits multi-components\ndue mainly to the RM structure within the beam and the fraction of the DING\nthat covers the background emission (the filling factor). The peak Faraday\ndepth of the FDF is different from the beam-averaged RM of the DING.

In this\npaper, we aim to develop a technique that can achieve a good trade-off between\nprivacy protection and data usability for person ReID. To achieve this, we\npropose a novel de-identification method designed explicitly for person ReID,\nnamed Person Identify Shift (PIS). PIS removes the absolute identity in a\npedestrian image while preserving the identity relationship between image\npairs. By exploiting the interpolation property of variational auto-encoder,\nPIS shifts each pedestrian image from the current identity to another with a\nnew identity, resulting in images still preserving the relative identities.\nExperimental results show that our method has a better trade-off between\nprivacy-preserving and model performance than existing de-identification\nmethods and can defend against human and model attacks for data privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 06:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Due to the\nutilization of differential privacy, it offers a guarantee of privacy in\ntheory. Meanwhile, the loss of accuracy is very slight. This method first\nconverts the original image to the frequency domain and removes the direct\ncomponent termed DC. Then a privacy budget allocation method can be learned\nbased on the loss of the back-end face recognition network within the\ndifferential privacy framework.

In particular, these algorithms have been\nshown to deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions using CNN denoisers. Since\nthe regularization is performed in an ad-hoc manner in PnP and RED,\nunderstanding their convergence has been an active research area. Recently, it\nwas observed in many works that iterate convergence of PnP and RED can be\nguaranteed if the denoiser is averaged or nonexpansive. However, integrating\nnonexpansivity with gradient-based learning is a challenging task -- checking\nnonexpansivity is known to be computationally intractable. Using numerical\nexamples, we show that existing CNN denoisers violate the nonexpansive property\nand can cause the PnP iterations to diverge. In fact, algorithms for training\nnonexpansive denoisers either cannot guarantee nonexpansivity of the final\ndenoiser or are computationally intensive. In this work, we propose to\nconstruct averaged (contractive) image denoisers by unfolding ISTA and ADMM\niterations applied to wavelet denoising and demonstrate that their\nregularization capacity for PnP and RED can be matched with CNN denoisers.

As natural convection can impede the accumulation of\nsalt, establishing a relation between its occurrence and the value of physical\nparameters such as evaporation rate, height of the slab or porosity is crucial.\nOne step towards determining when gravitational instabilities can arise is to\ncompute the ground-state salinity, that evolves due to the uniform upwards flow\ncaused by evaporation. The resulting salt concentration profile exhibits a\nsharply increasing salt concentration near the surface, which can lead to a\ngravitationally unstable setting. In this work, this ground state is\nanalytically derived within the framework of Sturm-Liouville theory. Then, the\nmethod of linear stability in conjunction with the quasi-steady state approach\nis employed to investigate the occurrence of instabilities. These instabilities\ncan develop and grow over time depending on the Rayleigh number and the\ndimensionless height of the porous medium. To calculate the critical Rayleigh\nnumber, which can determine the stability of a particular system, the\neigenvalues of the linear perturbation equations have to be computed.

Finally, a 2-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulation of the full equation system via the finite volume method is employed\nto validate the time of onset of convective instabilities predicted by the\nlinear theory.

However, most of existing methods\ntypically overlook such important characteristic and thus fail to distinguish\nand model the potential multiple interests of a user, impeding accurate\nrecommendation of the next piece of news.

To adopt a richer characterization\nfor argument strength in real-world applications, we provide a novel\nquantitative method called fuzzy labeling for fuzzy argumentation systems. For\nfuzzy labeling, the argument strength is represented as a triple consisting of\nacceptability, rejectability, and undecidability degree.

For the purpose of evaluating arguments, we provide a\nnew way to establish gradual semantics by fuzzy labeling, which is crucial in\nthe evaluation process.

This paper presents DuetFace, a\nnovel privacy-preserving face recognition method that employs collaborative\ninference in the frequency domain. Starting from a counterintuitive discovery\nthat face recognition can achieve surprisingly good performance with only\nvisually indistinguishable high-frequency channels, this method designs a\ncredible split of frequency channels by their cruciality for visualization and\noperates the server-side model on non-crucial channels. However, the model\ndegrades in its attention to facial features due to the missing visual\ninformation. To compensate, the method introduces a plug-in interactive block\nto allow attention transfer from the client-side by producing a feature mask.\nThe mask is further refined by deriving and overlaying a facial region of\ninterest (ROI). Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in protecting face images from undesired\nvisual inspection, reconstruction, and identification while maintaining high\ntask availability and performance.

Addressing this knowledge gap requires\ncomprehensive observations of diabetes driver behavior and physiology in\nchallenging settings where crashes are more likely to occur, such as\nstop-controlled traffic intersections, as in the current study of drivers with\nType 1 Diabetes (T1DM). Methods: 32 active drivers from around Omaha, NE\nparticipated in 4-week, real-world study. Each participant's own vehicle was\ninstrumented with an advanced telematics and camera system collecting driving\nsensor data and video. Videos were analyzed using computer vision models\ndetecting traffic elements to identify stop signs. Stop sign detections and\ndriver stopping trajectories were clustered to geolocate and extract\ndriver-visited stop intersections. Driver videos were then annotated to record\nstopping behavior and key traffic characteristics. Stops were categorized as\nsafe or unsafe based on traffic law. Results: Mixed effects logistic regression\nmodels examined how stopping behavior (safe vs. unsafe) in T1DM drivers was\naffected by 1) abnormal sleep, 2) obesity, and 3) poor glucose control.

Moreover, the state of the art mostly focuses\non suppressing a single large bounding box in input by overlapping it with the\npatch directly. Suppressing objects near the patch is a different, more complex\ntask. In this work, we have evaluated the existing approaches to generate\ninconspicuous patches. We have adapted methods, originally developed for\ndifferent computer vision tasks, to the object detection use case with YOLOv3\nand the COCO dataset. We have evaluated two approaches to generate naturalistic\npatches: by incorporating patch generation into the GAN training process and by\nusing the pretrained GAN. For both cases, we have assessed a trade-off between\nperformance and naturalistic patch appearance. Our experiments have shown, that\nusing a pre-trained GAN helps to gain realistic-looking patches while\npreserving the performance similar to conventional adversarial patches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 08:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Recent work explicitly learns multiple modes of the conditional\ndistribution via a deterministic network, which however can only cover a fixed\nnumber of modes within a limited range.

However, 2D joint detection is usually incomplete\nand with wrong identity assignments due to limited observation angle, which\nleads to noisy 3D triangulation results.

And finally, basic choreomusical rules should be\nobserved, and the motion generated should be diverse. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ChoreoGraph, which choreographs high-quality dance\nmotion for a given piece of music over a Dynamic Graph. A data-driven learning\nstrategy is proposed to evaluate the aesthetic style and rhythmic connections\nbetween music and motion in a progressively learned cross-modality embedding\nspace.

Link\nprediction in complex networks aims to estimate the likelihood that a link\nbetween two nodes is missing from the network. Links can be missing due to\nimperfections in data collection or simply because they are yet to appear.\nDiscovering new relationships between entities in networked data has attracted\nresearchers' attention in various domains such as sociology, computer science,\nphysics, and biology.

We attribute this to the creation of a\ncavity in the accretion disk after the tidal disruption of a star in a\nretrograde orbit with respect to the accretion disk rotation, making a TDE our\nfavoured interpretation of the flare. We also show how the host galaxy shows a\npoint-like, compact profile, no evidence for an extended component and a\nrelatively low mass, unlike what expected from an AGN host galaxy at z=0.147. A\ncompact host galaxy may result in an increased TDE rate, strengthening our\ninterpretation of the event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 11:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The problem asks to disconnect the graph at minimum cost.\n  While the $st$-cut version of the problem is known to be NP-hard, the above\nglobal cut version is known to admit a quasi-polynomial randomized $n^{O(\\log\n\\mathrm{OPT})}$-time algorithm due to Ghaffari, Karger, and Panigrahi [SODA\n2017]. They consider this as ``strong evidence that this problem is in P''. We\nshow that this is actually not the case.

The key step for the\nlower bound is a proof that Global Label Min-Cut is W[1]-hard when\nparameterized by the number of uncut labels. In other words, the problem is\ndifficult in the regime where almost all labels need to be cut to disconnect\nthe graph. To turn this lower bound into a quasi-polynomial-time lower bound,\nwe also needed to revisit the framework due to Marx [Theory Comput. 2010] of\nproving lower bounds assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis through the Subgraph\nIsomorphism problem parameterized by the number of edges of the pattern.

However,\nin the past decades, numerous works have shown that TTV-characterised planets\ntend to have a lower densities than RV-characterised planets. Re-analysing 34\nKepler planets in the super-Earth to sub-Neptunes range using the RIVERS\napproach, we show that at least part of these discrepancies was due to the way\ntransit timings were extracted from the light curve, which had a tendency to\nunder-estimate the TTV amplitudes. We recover robust mass estimates (i.e. low\nprior dependency) for 23 of the planets. We compare these planets the\nRV-characterised population. A large fraction of these previously had a\nsurprisingly low density now occupy a place of the mass-radius diagram much\ncloser to the bulk of the known planets, although a slight shift toward lower\ndensities remains, which could indicate that the compact multi-planetary\nsystems characterised by TTVs are indeed composed of planets which are\ndifferent from the bulk of the RV-characterised population. These results are\nespecially important for obtaining an unbiased view of the compact\nmulti-planetary systems detected by Kepler, TESS, and the upcoming PLATO\nmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 13:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Yet, even the simplest microprocessors\nimplement pipelines with concurrently-accessed resources, such as the memory\nbus shared by fetch and memory stages. Although their in-order pipelines are,\nby nature, very deterministic, the bus can cause out-of-order accesses to the\nmemory and, therefore, timing anomalies: local timing effects that can have\nglobal effects but that cannot be easily composed to estimate the global WCET.\nTo cope with this situation, WCET analyses have to generate important\nover-estimations in order to preserve safety of the computed times or have to\nexplicitly track all possible executions. In the latter case, the presence of\nout-of-order behavior leads to a combinatorial blowup of the number of pipeline\nstates for which efficient state abstractions are difficult to design. This\npaper proposes instead a compact and exact representation of the timings in the\npipeline, using eXecution Decision Diagram (XDD) [1].

However, not all subsequent publications confirmed\nthis result and proposed other models that were shown to outperform BERT4Rec in\neffectiveness. In this paper we systematically review all publications that\ncompare BERT4Rec with another popular Transformer-based model, namely SASRec,\nand show that BERT4Rec results are not consistent within these publications. To\nunderstand the reasons behind this inconsistency, we analyse the available\nimplementations of BERT4Rec and show that we fail to reproduce results of the\noriginal BERT4Rec publication when using their default configuration\nparameters. However, we are able to replicate the reported results with the\noriginal code if training for a much longer amount of time (up to 30x) compared\nto the default configuration.

However, in FL, users with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics can\ndeteriorate the performance of the global model. Specifically, the global model\nsuffers from the weight divergence challenge owing to non-IID data. To address\nthe aforementioned challenge, we propose a novel diffusion strategy of the\nmachine learning (ML) model (FedDif) to maximize the FL performance with\nnon-IID data. In FedDif, users spread local models to neighboring users over\nD2D communications. FedDif enables the local model to experience different\ndistributions before parameter aggregation. Furthermore, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that FedDif can circumvent the weight divergence challenge. On the\ntheoretical basis, we propose the communication-efficient diffusion strategy of\nthe ML model, which can determine the trade-off between the learning\nperformance and communication cost based on auction theory. The performance\nevaluation results show that FedDif improves the test accuracy of the global\nmodel by 10.37% compared to the baseline FL with non-IID settings.

Although it might be\nnot necessary to require the drivers to intervene on most occasions, it is\nstill important to improve drivers' situation awareness (SA) in unexpected\ndriving scenarios to improve their trust in and acceptance of AVs. In this\nstudy, we conceptualized SA at the levels of perception (SA L1), comprehension\n(SA L2), and projection (SA L3), and proposed an SA level-based explanation\nframework based on explainable AI. Then, we examined the effects of these\nexplanations and their modalities on drivers' situational trust, cognitive\nworkload, as well as explanation satisfaction. A three (SA levels: SA L1, SA L2\nand SA L3) by two (explanation modalities: visual, visual + audio)\nbetween-subjects experiment was conducted with 340 participants recruited from\nAmazon Mechanical Turk. The results indicated that by designing the\nexplanations using the proposed SA-based framework, participants could redirect\ntheir attention to the important objects in the traffic and understand their\nmeaning for the AV system. This improved their SA and filled the gap of\nunderstanding the correspondence of AV's behavior in the particular situations\nwhich also increased their situational trust in AV. The results showed that\nparticipants reported the highest trust with SA L2 explanations, although the\nmental workload was assessed higher in this level. The results also provided\ninsights into the relationship between the amount of information in\nexplanations and modalities, showing that participants were more satisfied with\nvisual-only explanations in the SA L1 and SA L2 conditions and were more\nsatisfied with visual and auditory explanations in the SA L3 condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 14:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

QPEs in GSN 069 are a transient phenomenon with\na lifetime > 1.05 yr. The QPE intensity and recurrence time oscillate and allow\nfor alternating strong-weak QPEs and long-short recurrence times to be defined.\nIn observations with QPEs, the quiescent level exhibits a quasi-periodic\noscillation with a period equal to the average separation between consecutive\nQPEs. The QPE spectral evolution is consistent with thermal emission from a\nvery compact region that heats up quickly and subsequently cools down via X-ray\nemission while expanding by a factor of ~3 in radius.

A better understanding of\nthe heat extraction mechanism is established by considering the reservoir\nresponse and the wellbore heat exchange. Sensitivity analyses are performed for\ndifferent injection temperatures and flow rates for 50 years. Results show that\nthe wellbore effect is multiple times higher than the reservoir response to the\nproduction temperature. Furthermore, lowering the injection temperature\neventuates to a smaller temperature reduction at the subsurface, enhancing the\noverall heat extraction potential with a minor impact on thermal breakthrough.\nThe cold region developed around the injection wellbore may affect the\nproduction fluid temperature due to its proximity to the production wellbore.\nTo reach higher heat extraction efficiency, it is essential to use sufficient\nwellbore spacing. CO2 can be used as working fluid for over 50 years as it does\nnot show significant thermal breakthrough and temperature plume evolution in\nthe reservoir under studied conditions. CO2 shows lower temperature reduction\nfor all injection rates and temperatures for 50 years of operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 14:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Moreover, we prove\nthat $C(n,K_{s,t})=\\Omega(n^{2/3})$ for $t\\geqslant s\\geqslant 7$.\n  \\item When $H$ is a star with at least $4$ leaves, a matching of size at\nleast $4$, or a path of length at least $7$, we give the new lower bound for\n$C(n,H)$. We also show that for any graph $H$ with at least $6$ edges, $C(n,H)$\nis polynomial in $n$. All of these improve the corresponding results obtained\nby Alon and Ben-Eliezer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 15:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 13:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

The shock shows an ellipsoidal structure, expands in\nall directions, and encloses the whole Sun as viewed from both SOHO and STEREO\nA, which results from the large expansion of the CME flux rope and its fast\nacceleration. The structure and potential impacts of the shock are mainly\ndetermined by its radial and lateral expansions. The CME and shock arrive at\nParker Solar Probe and STEREO A. Only based on the remote sensing observations,\nit is difficult to predict whether and when the CME/shock would arrive at the\nEarth.

Existing verification method for point cloud model is time-expensive\nand computationally unattainable on large networks. Additionally, they cannot\nhandle the complete PointNet model with joint alignment network (JANet) that\ncontains multiplication layers, which effectively boosts the performance of 3D\nmodels. This motivates us to design a more efficient and general framework to\nverify various architectures of point cloud models. The key challenges in\nverifying the large-scale complete PointNet models are addressed as dealing\nwith the cross-non-linearity operations in the multiplication layers and the\nhigh computational complexity of high-dimensional point cloud inputs and added\nlayers. Thus, we propose an efficient verification framework, 3DVerifier, to\ntackle both challenges by adopting a linear relaxation function to bound the\nmultiplication layer and combining forward and backward propagation to compute\nthe certified bounds of the outputs of the point cloud models. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that 3DVerifier outperforms existing\nverification algorithms for 3D models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.\nNotably, our approach achieves an orders-of-magnitude improvement in\nverification efficiency for the large network, and the obtained certified\nbounds are also significantly tighter than the state-of-the-art verifiers.

However, most works assume that when\na node activates, it selects the neighbor to contact based on a fixed\nprobability (e.g., uniformly at random), a choice that ignores the optimization\nlandscape at the moment of activation. Instead, in this work we introduce an\noptimization-aware selection rule that chooses the neighbor providing the\nhighest dual cost improvement (a quantity related to a dualization of the\nproblem based on consensus). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent\n(CD) method with the Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our\nsetting however, only a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration\n(because each node can communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing\nliterature on GS methods does not apply. To overcome this difficulty, we\ndevelop a new analytical framework for smooth and strongly convex $f_i$ that\ncovers the class of set-wise CD algorithms -- a class that directly applies to\ndecentralized scenarios, but is not limited to them -- and we show that the\nproposed set-wise GS rule achieves a speedup factor of up to the maximum degree\nin the network (which is in the order of $\\Theta(n)$ for highly connected\ngraphs).

Graph representation learning techniques\non brain functional networks can facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers\nfor clinical phenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. However, current graph\nlearning techniques have several issues on brain network mining. Firstly, most\ncurrent graph learning models are designed for unsigned graph, which hinders\nthe analysis of many signed network data (e.g., brain functional networks).\nMeanwhile, the insufficiency of brain network data limits the model performance\non clinical phenotypes predictions. Moreover, few of current graph learning\nmodel is interpretable, which may not be capable to provide biological insights\nfor model outcomes.

In\nthis survey paper, we define the Session-based Cyberbullying Detection\nframework that encapsulates the different steps and challenges of the problem.\nBased on this framework, we provide a comprehensive overview of session-based\ncyberbullying detection in social media, delving into existing efforts from a\ndata and methodological perspective. Our review leads us to propose\nevidence-based criteria for a set of best practices to create session-based\ncyberbullying datasets. In addition, we perform benchmark experiments comparing\nthe performance of state-of-the-art session-based cyberbullying detection\nmodels as well as large pre-trained language models across two different\ndatasets. Through our review, we also put forth a set of open challenges as\nfuture research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 18:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

The nominal computational\ncost of solving a rank-$r$ reduced-order model (ROM) based on time-dependent\nbasis, a.k.a. TDB-ROM, is roughly equal to that of solving the full-order model\nfor $r$ random samples. As of now, this nominal performance can only be\nachieved for linear or quadratic SPDEs -- at the expense of a highly intrusive\nprocess. On the other hand, for problems with non-polynomial nonlinearity, the\ncomputational cost of solving the TDB evolution equations is the same as\nsolving the full-order model. In this work, we present an adaptive sparse\ninterpolation algorithm that enables stochastic TDB-ROMs to achieve nominal\ncomputational cost for generic nonlinear SPDEs. Our algorithm constructs a\nlow-rank approximation for the right hand side of the SPDE using the discrete\nempirical interpolation method (DEIM). The presented algorithm does not require\nany offline computation and as a result the low-rank approximation can adapt to\nany transient changes of the dynamics on the fly. We also propose a\nrank-adaptive strategy to control the error of the sparse interpolation. Our\nalgorithm achieves computational speedup by adaptive sampling of the state and\nrandom spaces. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach for two test cases:\n(1) one-dimensional stochastic Burgers' equation, and (2) two-dimensional\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to one-hundred-dimensional random\nperturbations. In all cases, the presented algorithm results in orders of\nmagnitude reduction in the computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 16:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 16:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

However, privacy concerns make it\nchallenging to exchange data while preserving confidentiality. Federated\nLearning (FL) is a promising solution that enables collaborative training\nthrough exchange of model parameters instead of raw data. However, most\nexisting FL solutions work under the assumption that participating clients are\n\\emph{honest} and thus can fail against poisoning attacks from malicious\nparties, whose goal is to deteriorate the global model performance. In this\nwork, we propose a robust aggregation rule called Distance-based Outlier\nSuppression (DOS) that is resilient to byzantine failures. The proposed method\ncomputes the distance between local parameter updates of different clients and\nobtains an outlier score for each client using Copula-based Outlier Detection\n(COPOD). The resulting outlier scores are converted into normalized weights\nusing a softmax function, and a weighted average of the local parameters is\nused for updating the global model. DOS aggregation can effectively suppress\nparameter updates from malicious clients without the need for any\nhyperparameter selection, even when the data distributions are heterogeneous.\nEvaluation on two medical imaging datasets (CheXpert and HAM10000) demonstrates\nthe higher robustness of DOS method against a variety of poisoning attacks in\ncomparison to other state-of-the-art methods.

However, most existing methods\nrely on the temporal structure of a sequence of measurements but do not take\naccount of the spatial structure between buses and transmission lines. To\naddress this issue, we propose a spatiotemporal deep network, PowerFDNet, for\nthe SFDIA detection in AC-model power grids.

We thus explore an\nalgebraic approach relying on semirings that unifies different generalizations\nof BINARY-CSPs (such as the counting, the list, and the weighted versions), and\nthat facilitates a general algorithmic approach to efficiently solving them.\nThe latter is inspired by the (component) twin-width parameter introduced by\nBonnet et al., which we generalize via edge-labelled graphs in order to\nformulate it to arbitrary binary constraints.
