Indeed, NNs\noften decisively outperform traditional algorithms. One area that is only\nrecently attracting significant interest is using NNs for designing numerical\nsolvers, particularly for discretized partial differential equations. Several\nrecent papers have considered employing NNs for developing multigrid methods,\nwhich are a leading computational tool for solving discretized partial\ndifferential equations and other sparse-matrix problems. We extend these new\nideas, focusing on so-called relaxation operators (also called smoothers),\nwhich are an important component of the multigrid algorithm that has not yet\nreceived much attention in this context. We explore an approach for using NNs\nto learn relaxation parameters for an ensemble of diffusion operators with\nrandom coefficients, for Jacobi type smoothers and for 4Color GaussSeidel\nsmoothers. The latter yield exceptionally efficient and easy to parallelize\nSuccessive Over Relaxation (SOR) smoothers. Moreover, this work demonstrates\nthat learning relaxation parameters on relatively small grids using a two-grid\nmethod and Gelfand's formula as a loss function can be implemented easily.\nThese methods efficiently produce nearly-optimal parameters, thereby\nsignificantly improving the convergence rate of multigrid algorithms on large\ngrids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 12:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The\ndetection of a shift from the training distribution of individual datapoints\nhas gained attention. A number of techniques have been proposed for such\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection. But in many applications, the inputs to a\nmachine learning model form a temporal sequence. Existing techniques for OOD\ndetection in time-series data either do not exploit temporal relationships in\nthe sequence or do not provide any guarantees on detection. We propose using\ndeviation from the in-distribution temporal equivariance as the non-conformity\nmeasure in conformal anomaly detection framework for OOD detection in\ntime-series data.Computing independent predictions from multiple conformal\ndetectors based on the proposed measure and combining these predictions by\nFisher's method leads to the proposed detector CODiT with guarantees on false\ndetection in time-series data.

Recent NeRF-based methods\ngenerate more natural talking videos, as they better capture the 3D structural\ninformation of faces. However, a specific model needs to be trained for each\nidentity with a large dataset. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Facial\nRadiance Fields (DFRF) for few-shot talking head synthesis, which can rapidly\ngeneralize to an unseen identity with few training data. Different from the\nexisting NeRF-based methods which directly encode the 3D geometry and\nappearance of a specific person into the network, our DFRF conditions face\nradiance field on 2D appearance images to learn the face prior. Thus the facial\nradiance field can be flexibly adjusted to the new identity with few reference\nimages. Additionally, for better modeling of the facial deformations, we\npropose a differentiable face warping module conditioned on audio signals to\ndeform all reference images to the query space. Extensive experiments show that\nwith only tens of seconds of training clip available, our proposed DFRF can\nsynthesize natural and high-quality audio-driven talking head videos for novel\nidentities with only 40k iterations.

The\nexistence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantum theory is generally\nconsidered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical\nworldview. However, this perspective is undermined by the fact that there exist\noperational theories which exhibit nontrivial uncertainty relations but which\nare consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admit of a\ngeneralized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what\naspects of uncertainty relations, if any, cannot be realized in this way and so\nconstitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. We here consider uncertainty\nrelations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of\nbinary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of Pauli X and Pauli Z\nobservables in quantum theory). We show that, for a class of theories\nsatisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of this\npredictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear\ncurve. Because qubit quantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the\nfact that its predictability tradeoff describes a section of a circle is a\nviolation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example of\nhow the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality.\nWe also deduce the implications for a selected group of operational foils to\nquantum theory and consider the generalization to three measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 17:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 23:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

Since manual decomposition of large scale applications\ncan be laborious and error-prone, AI-based systems to detect decomposition\nstrategies are gaining popularity. However, the usefulness of these approaches\nis limited by the expressiveness of the program representation and their\ninability to model the application's dependency on critical external resources\nsuch as databases. Consequently, partitioning recommendations offered by\ncurrent tools result in architectures that result in (a) distributed monoliths,\nand/or (b) force the use of (often criticized) distributed transactions. This\nwork attempts to overcome these challenges by introducing CARGO({short for\n[C]ontext-sensitive l[A]bel p[R]opa[G]ati[O]n})-a novel un-/semi-supervised\npartition refinement technique that uses a context- and flow-sensitive system\ndependency graph of the monolithic application to refine and thereby enrich the\npartitioning quality of the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

Existing\nmethods in unbiased learning to rank typically rely on click modeling or\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW). Unfortunately, the search engines are faced\nwith severe long-tail query distribution, where neither click modeling nor IPW\ncan handle well. Click modeling suffers from data sparsity problem since the\nsame query-document pair appears limited times on tail queries; IPW suffers\nfrom high variance problem since it is highly sensitive to small propensity\nscore values. Therefore, a general debiasing framework that works well under\ntail queries is in desperate need. To address this problem, we propose a\nmodel-based unbiased learning-to-rank framework. Specifically, we develop a\ngeneral context-aware user simulator to generate pseudo clicks for unobserved\nranked lists to train rankers, which addresses the data sparsity problem. In\naddition, considering the discrepancy between pseudo clicks and actual clicks,\nwe take the observation of a ranked list as the treatment variable and further\nincorporate inverse propensity weighting with pseudo labels in a doubly robust\nway.

Our key insight is to copy and deform patches from the partial input\nto complete missing regions.

We also show that, in\nevery characteristic p and for all d (greater than 3) not divisible by p, there\nalways exist reduced polynomials of degree d whose F-pure threshold is a\ntruncation of the base p expansion of 2/d at some place; in particular, there\nalways exist reduced polynomials whose F-pure threshold is strictly less than\n2/d.

Without the careful design to capture subtle differences between\nfine-grained actions, previous weakly-supervised models for general action\ndetection cannot perform well in the fine-grained setting.

We also intensively explore various filtering\nalgorithms, including Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter, Ensemble Empirical mode\ndecomposition (EEMD), Normalized Least-Mean-Square (NLMS), Recursive least\nsquares (RLS) filter, Total variation denoising (TVD), Wavelet and extended\nKalman filter (EKF) for comparison. Data from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test\ndatabase were used. The proposed methodology shows the average signal to noise\nratio (SNR) of 10.96, the Percentage Root Difference of 150.45, and the\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.959 from the modified MIT-BIH database with added\nmotion artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 21:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The most widely accepted hypothesis involving a giant\nimpactor that tipped Uranus onto its side encounters several difficulties with\nregards to the Uranus' spin rate and its prograde satellite system. An\nobliquity increase that was driven by capture of Uranus into a secular\nspin-orbit resonance remains a possible alternative hypothesis that avoids many\nof the issues associated with a giant impact. We propose that secular\nspin-orbit resonance could have excited Uranus' obliquity to its present day\nvalue if it was driven by the outward migration of an as-yet undetected outer\nSolar System body commonly known as Planet Nine. We draw support for our\nhypothesis from an analysis of 123 N-body simulations with varying parameters\nfor Planet Nine and its migration. We find that in multiple instances, a\nsimulated Planet Nine drives Uranus' obliquity past 98 degrees, with a\nsignificant number falling within 10 percent of this value. We note a\nsignificant caveat to our results in that a much faster than present-day\nspin-axis precession rate for Uranus is required in all cases for it to reach\nhigh obliquities. We conclude that while it was in principle possible for\nPlanet Nine (if it exists) to have been responsible for Uranus' obliquity, the\nfeasibility of such a result hinges on Uranus' primordial precession rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 21:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

For a wireless device to transmit successfully, it uses a\nbackoff protocol to ensure exclusive access to the channel. Modern radios,\nhowever, do not need exclusive access to the channel to communicate; in\nparticular, they have the ability to receive useful information even when more\nthan one device transmits at the same time. These capabilities have now been\nexploited for many years by systems that rely on interference cancellation,\nphysical layer network coding and analog network coding to improve efficiency.\nFor example, Zigzag decoding [56] demonstrated how a base station can decode\nmessages sent by multiple devices simultaneously.\n  In this paper, we address the following question: Can we design a backoff\nprotocol that is better than exponential backoff when exclusive channel access\nis not required. We define the Coded Radio Network Model, which generalizes\ntraditional radio network models (e.g., [30]). We then introduce the Decodable\nBackoff Algorithm, a randomized backoff protocol that achieves an optimal\nthroughput of $1-o(1)$. (Throughput $1$ is optimal, as simultaneous reception\ndoes not increase the channel capacity.) The algorithm breaks the constant\nthroughput lower bound for traditional radio networks [47-49], showing the\npower of these new hardware capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 21:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Letting A denote a continuous treatment variable, the target\nof inference is the expected outcome if everyone in the population takes\ntreatment level A=a. Under standard assumptions, the dose-response function\ntakes the form of a partial mean. Building upon the recent literature on\nnonparametric regression with estimated outcomes, we study three different\nestimators. As a global method, we construct an\nempirical-risk-minimization-based estimator with an explicit characterization\nof second-order remainder terms. As a local method, we develop a two-stage,\ndoubly-robust (DR) learner. Finally, we construct a mth-order estimator based\non the theory of higher-order influence functions. Under certain conditions,\nthis higher order estimator achieves the fastest rate of convergence that we\nare aware of for this problem. However, the other two approaches are easier to\nimplement using off-the-shelf software, since they are formulated as two-stage\nregression tasks. For each estimator, we provide an upper bound on the\nmean-square error and investigate its finite-sample performance in a\nsimulation.

High-fidelity numerical simulations\nconstitute the backbone of engineering design, providing an accurate insight\ninto the performance of complex systems.

To this end, reduced order\nmodels (ROMs) are employed, to approximate the high-fidelity solutions while\naccurately capturing the dominant aspects of the physical behavior. The present\nwork proposes a new machine learning (ML) platform for the development of ROMs,\nto handle large-scale numerical problems dealing with transient nonlinear\npartial differential equations.

Numerous efforts have been\ndedicated to strengthen the image dependency by creating the delicate models or\nintroducing the extra visual annotations. However, these methods cannot\nsufficiently explore how the visual cues explicitly affect the learned answer\nrepresentation, which is vital for language reliance alleviation. Moreover,\nthey generally emphasize the class-level discrimination of the learned answer\nrepresentation, which overlooks the more fine-grained instance-level patterns\nand demands further optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncollaborative learning scheme from the viewpoint of visual perturbation\ncalibration, which can better investigate the fine-grained visual effects and\nmitigate the language prior problem by learning the instance-level\ncharacteristics. Specifically, we devise a visual controller to construct two\nsorts of curated images with different perturbation extents, based on which the\ncollaborative learning of intra-instance invariance and inter-instance\ndiscrimination is implemented by two well-designed discriminators. Besides, we\nimplement the information bottleneck modulator on latent space for further bias\nalleviation and representation calibration.

A\ndecentralized frequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm was proposed in\nprior work for undirected networks in which the nodes locally share their\nfrequencies and phases with their neighbors to reach synchronization. Kalman\nfiltering (KF) was also integrated with DFPC (KF-DFPC) to lower the total\nresidual phase error upon convergence. Since these DFPC-based algorithms rely\non the average consensus protocol, they do not converge for directed networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a push-sum based frequency and phase consensus\n(PsFPC) algorithm for the directed networks. The residual phase error of PsFPC\nis theoretically derived as well. Kalman filtering is also integrated with\nPsFPC and the resulting KF-PsFPC algorithm shows a significant reduction in the\nresidual phase error upon convergence. KF assumes that the model parameters,\ni.e., the measurement noise and innovation noise covariance matrices, are\nknown. Since they may not be known in practice, we develop an online\nexpectation maximization (EM) based algorithm that iteratively computes the\nmaximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the unknown matrices in an online manner.\nEM is integrated with KF-PsFPC to propose the EM-KF-PsFPC algorithm. Simulation\nresults are included where the performance of the PsFPC-based algorithms is\nanalyzed for different distributed phased arrays and is compared to other\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 02:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The complexity\nof these operations increases when the transportation, power, and\ncommunications networks fail, leaving people stranded and unable to communicate\ntheir locations and needs. The advent of emerging technologies like uncrewed\nautonomous vehicles can help humanitarian logistics providers reach otherwise\nstranded populations after transportation network failures. However, due to the\nfailures in telecommunication infrastructure, demand for emergency aid can\nbecome uncertain. To address the challenges of delivering emergency aid to\ntrapped populations with failing infrastructure networks, we propose a novel\nrobust computational framework for a two-echelon vehicle routing problem that\nuses uncrewed autonomous vehicles, or drones, for the deliveries. We formulate\nthe problem as a two-stage robust optimization model to handle demand\nuncertainty. Then, we propose a column-and-constraint generation approach for\nworst-case demand scenario generation for a given set of truck and drone\nroutes.

Previous literatures have achieved\npromising results for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) by discovering discriminative\nhash codes and modality-specific hash functions. Nonetheless, most existing CMR\nworks are subjected to some restrictions: 1) It is assumed that data of\ndifferent modalities are fully paired, which is impractical in real\napplications due to sample missing and false data alignment, and 2) binary\nregression targets including the label matrix and binary codes are too rigid to\neffectively learn semantic-preserving hash codes and hash functions. To address\nthese problems, this paper proposes an Adaptive Marginalized Semantic Hashing\n(AMSH) method which not only enhances the discrimination of latent\nrepresentations and hash codes by adaptive margins, but also can be used for\nboth paired and unpaired CMR. As a two-step method, in the first step, AMSH\ngenerates semantic-aware modality-specific latent representations with\nadaptively marginalized labels, which enlarges the distances between different\nclasses, and exploits the labels to preserve the inter-modal and intra-modal\nsemantic similarities into latent representations and hash codes. In the second\nstep, adaptive margin matrices are embedded into the hash codes, and enlarge\nthe gaps between positive and negative bits, which improves the discrimination\nand robustness of hash functions. On this basis, AMSH generates\nsimilarity-preserving hash codes and robust hash functions without strict\none-to-one data correspondence requirement. Experiments are conducted on\nseveral benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority and flexibility of\nAMSH over some state-of-the-art CMR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 02:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

This paper proposes an adaptation module in a\npretrained Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) network to leverage the\npowerful SISR model instead of using highly engineered light field imaging\ndomain specific Super Resolution models. The adaption module consists of a Sub\naperture Shift block and a fusion block. It is an adaptation in the SISR\nnetwork to further exploit the spatial and angular information in LF images to\nimprove the super resolution performance. Experimental validation shows that\nthe proposed method outperforms existing light field super resolution\nalgorithms. It also achieves PSNR gains of more than 1 dB across all the\ndatasets as compared to the same pretrained SISR models for scale factor 2, and\nPSNR gains 0.6 to 1 dB for scale factor 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 03:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 04:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

It remains challenging to identify small or\nsparse face image clusters that we call hard clusters, which is caused by the\nheterogeneity, \\ie, high variations in size and sparsity, of the clusters.\nConsequently, the conventional way of using a uniform threshold (to identify\nclusters) often leads to a terrible misclassification for the samples that\nshould belong to hard clusters. We tackle this problem by leveraging the\nneighborhood information of samples and inferring the cluster memberships (of\nsamples) in a probabilistic way.

Training GNN-based\nrecommender systems (GNNRecSys) on large graphs incurs a large memory\nfootprint, easily exceeding the DRAM capacity on a typical server. Existing\nsolutions resort to distributed subgraph training, which is inefficient due to\nthe high cost of dynamically constructing subgraphs and significant redundancy\nacross subgraphs.\n  The emerging persistent memory technologies provide a significantly larger\nmemory capacity than DRAMs at an affordable cost, making single-machine\nGNNRecSys training feasible, which eliminates the inefficiencies in distributed\ntraining.

Moreover, even if the parameters are well adjusted, a partial\nunder-segmentation problem can still emerge, which implies ground segmentation\nfailures in some regions. Finally, ground segmentation methods typically fail\nto estimate an appropriate ground plane when the ground is above another\nstructure, such as a retaining wall.

In many scientific research, randomized\nexperiments provide a golden standard for estimation of causal effects for\ndecades. However, in many situations, randomized experiments are not feasible\nin practice so that practitioners need to rely on empirical investigation for\ncausal reasoning. Causal inference via observational data is a challenging task\nsince the knowledge of the treatment assignment mechanism is missing, which\ntypically requires non-testable assumptions to make the inference possible. For\nseveral years, great effort has been devoted to the research of causal\ninference for binary treatments. In practice, it is also common to use\nobservational data on multiple treatment comparisons. Within the potential\noutcomes framework, we propose a generalized cross-fitting estimator (GCF),\nwhich generalizes the doubly robust estimator with cross-fitting for binary\ntreatment to multiple treatment comparisons and provides rigorous proofs on its\nstatistical properties. This estimator permits the use of more flexible machine\nlearning methods to model the nuisance parts, and based on relatively weak\nassumptions, while there is still a theoretical guarantee for valid statistical\ninference.

To address these, we\npresent a generic framework called GE-Grasp for robotic motion planning in\ndense clutter, where we leverage diverse action primitives for occluded object\nremoval and present the generator-evaluator architecture to avoid spatial\ncollisions. Therefore, our GE-Grasp is capable of grasping objects in dense\nclutter efficiently with promising success rates. Specifically, we define three\naction primitives: target-oriented grasping for target capturing, pushing, and\nnontarget-oriented grasping to reduce the crowdedness and occlusions. The\ngenerators effectively provide various action candidates referring to the\nspatial information. Meanwhile, the evaluators assess the selected action\nprimitive candidates, where the optimal action is implemented by the robot.\nExtensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that our\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of grasping in clutter with\nrespect to motion efficiency and success rates.

In NS-COM, ultra-broadband wireless\nconnectivity between NSPSs and various airborne/spaceborne platforms is\nrequired for a plethora of bandwidth-consuming applications, such as NSPS-based\nAd hoc networking, in-flight Internet and relaying technology. However, such\nrequirement seems to contradict with the scarcity of spectrum resources at\nconventional microwave frequencies, which motivates the exploitation of\nterahertz (THz) band ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz. Due to huge available\nbandwidth, the THz signals are capable of supporting ultra-high-rate data\ntransmission for NS-COM over 100 Gb/s, which are naturally suitable for the\nnear-space environment with marginal path loss.

This paper introduces an\nimprovement to the SCL decoding for polar and pre-transformed polar codes that\nreduces the number of sorting operations without degrading the code's\nerror-correction performance. In an SCL decoding with an optimum metric\nfunction we show that, on average, the correct branch's bit-metric value must\nbe equal to the bit-channel capacity, and on the other hand, the average\nbit-metric value of a wrong branch can be at most zero. This implies that a\nwrong path's partial path metric value deviates from the bit-channel capacity's\npartial summation. For relatively reliable bit-channels, the bit metric for a\nwrong branch becomes very large negative number, which enables us to detect and\nprune such paths. We prove that, for a threshold lower than the bit-channel\ncutoff rate, the probability of pruning the correct path decreases\nexponentially by the given threshold. Based on these findings, we presented a\npruning technique, and the experimental results demonstrate a substantial\ndecrease in the amount of sorting procedures required for SCL decoding.

However, existing methods generally ignore the repetitions of\nthe pattern and do not consider gap constraints, which can lead to mining\nresults containing a large number of patterns that users are not interested in.\nTo solve this problem, this paper discovers frequent one-off negative\nsequential patterns (ONPs). This problem has the following two characteristics.\nFirst, the support is calculated under the one-off condition, which means that\nany character in the sequence can only be used once at most. Second, the gap\nconstraint can be given by the user. To efficiently mine patterns, this paper\nproposes the ONP-Miner algorithm, which employs depth-first and backtracking\nstrategies to calculate the support. Therefore, ONP-Miner can effectively avoid\ncreating redundant nodes and parent-child relationships. Moreover, to\neffectively reduce the number of candidate patterns, ONP-Miner uses pattern\njoin and pruning strategies to generate and further prune the candidate\npatterns, respectively. Experimental results show that ONP-Miner not only\nimproves the mining efficiency, but also has better mining performance than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, ONP mining can find more\ninteresting patterns in traffic volume data to predict future traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The DNP was performed using low-power solid state\nsources under static (non-spinning) conditions. The DNP spectrum (DNP\nenhancement as a function of microwave frequency) of diamond powder shows\nfeatures that broadly correlate with the EPR spectrum. A well-defined negative\nOverhauser peak and two solid effect peaks are observed for the central\n($m_I=0$) manifold of the $^{14}$N spins. Previous low temperature measurements\nin diamond had measured a positive Overhauser enhancement in this manifold.\nFrequency-chirped millimeter-wave excitation of the electron spins is seen to\nsignificantly improve the enhancements for the two outer nuclear spin manifolds\n($m_I = \\pm 1$) and to blur some of the sharper features associated with the\ncentral manifolds. The outer lines are best fit using a combination of the\ncross effect and a truncated cross effect -- which is known to mimic features\nof an Overhauser effect. Similar features are also observed in experiments on\nsingle crystal samples. The observation of all of these mechanisms in a single\nmaterial system under the same experimental conditions is likely due to the\nsignificant heterogeneity of the high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) type Ib\ndiamond samples used. Large room temperature DNP enhancements at fields above a\nfew Tesla enable spectroscopic studies with better chemical shift resolution\nunder ambient conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

In\nthe usual approach to the problem, network resistance is ignored and simplified\npower-angle relations are used based on branch reactances alone. The purpose of\nthis note is to describe a tractable generalisation of this approach to account\nfor arbitrary network resistances. The solution is worked in detail for a\nsingle network branch with resistance $R \\geq 0$ and reactance $X > 0$, with\nexplicit formulae derived linking branch impedance, active and reactive power\nflows, voltage phase displacement and losses under the 'flat' voltage profile\nassumption. These formulae have a convenient expression in terms of a\n'coefficient of support' which relates the assumed active power flow to the\ncorresponding reactive power consumed on the branch, and encapsulates much of\nthe mathematical technicalities in the exact solution. It is shown that when\nnetwork resistance is taken into account, the angle displacement $\\delta_j -\n\\delta_k$ between adjacent bus voltages is always larger than given by the\nlossless power-angle relation $\\sin(\\delta_j - \\delta_k) = XP$. The approach is\napplied to the analysis of circulating power flows in large networks, building\non the classic work of Janssens and Kamagate (2003). It is seen that in\nnetworks with nonzero branch resistances, a circulating flow of active power is\nalways accompanied by a counter-circulating flow of reactive power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Target speech extraction means extracting the\nspeech of a target speaker in a mixture. Typical approaches have been\nexploiting properties of audio signals, such as harmonic structure and\ndirection of arrival. In contrast, ConceptBeam tackles the problem with\nsemantic clues. Specifically, we extract the speech of speakers speaking about\na concept, i.e., a topic of interest, using a concept specifier such as an\nimage or speech. Solving this novel problem would open the door to innovative\napplications such as listening systems that focus on a particular topic\ndiscussed in a conversation. Unlike keywords, concepts are abstract notions,\nmaking it challenging to directly represent a target concept. In our scheme, a\nconcept is encoded as a semantic embedding by mapping the concept specifier to\na shared embedding space. This modality-independent space can be built by means\nof deep metric learning using paired data consisting of images and their spoken\ncaptions. We use it to bridge modality-dependent information, i.e., the speech\nsegments in the mixture, and the specified, modality-independent concept. As a\nproof of our scheme, we performed experiments using a set of images associated\nwith spoken captions. That is, we generated speech mixtures from these spoken\ncaptions and used the images or speech signals as the concept specifiers. We\nthen extracted the target speech using the acoustic characteristics of the\nidentified segments. We compare ConceptBeam with two methods: one based on\nkeywords obtained from recognition systems and another based on sound source\nseparation. We show that ConceptBeam clearly outperforms the baseline methods\nand effectively extracts speech based on the semantic representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Despite its simplicity, solving jigsaw puzzle has been demonstrated to be\nhelpful for diverse tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as\nself-supervised feature representation learning, domain generalization, and\nfine-grained classification.\n  In this paper, we explore solving jigsaw puzzle as a self-supervised\nauxiliary loss in ViT for image classification, named Jigsaw-ViT.

It can be a promising\nalternative to classical image-domain methods and enjoys great advantages in\nmemory saving and computational efficiency. However, previous attempts on CL\nare not only limited to a fixed CS ratio, which lacks flexibility, but also\nlimited to MNIST/CIFAR-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world\nhigh-resolution (HR) data or vision tasks. In this paper, a novel\ntransformer-based compressive learning framework on large-scale images with\narbitrary CS ratios, dubbed TransCL, is proposed. Specifically, TransCL first\nutilizes the strategy of learnable block-based compressed sensing and proposes\na flexible linear projection strategy to enable CL to be performed on\nlarge-scale images in an efficient block-by-block manner with arbitrary CS\nratios. Then, regarding CS measurements from all blocks as a sequence, a pure\ntransformer-based backbone is deployed to perform vision tasks with various\ntask-oriented heads. Our sufficient analysis presents that TransCL exhibits\nstrong resistance to interference and robust adaptability to arbitrary CS\nratios. Extensive experiments for complex HR data demonstrate that the proposed\nTransCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and\nsemantic segmentation tasks.

Epidemic spread is a nonlinear process,\noften modeled as the law of mass action, which is of a quadratic form; thus, on\na compact domain, its Lipschitz constant turns out to be local and relatively\nlarge, which renders the Lipschitz-based design criteria of existing observer\narchitectures infeasible. In this paper, a novel observer architecture is\nproposed for the state estimation of a class of nonlinear systems that\nencompasses the deterministic epidemic models. The proposed observer offers\nextra leverage to reduce the influence of nonlinearity in the estimation error\ndynamics, which is not possible in other Luenberger-like observers. Algebraic\nRiccati inequalities are derived as sufficient conditions for the asymptotic\nconvergence of the estimation error to zero under local Lipschitz and\ngeneralized Lipschitz assumptions. Equivalent linear matrix inequality\nformulations of the algebraic Riccati inequalities are also provided. The\nefficacy of the proposed observer design is illustrated by its application on\nthe celebrated SIDARTHE-V epidemic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

By manually constructing positive/negative samples,\nmost graph contrastive learning methods rely on the vector inner product based\nsimilarity metric to distinguish the samples for graph representation.

Also, the vector inner product based similarity metric cannot\nfully exploit the local structures of the graph to characterize the graph\ndifference well. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive\nsubgraph generation based contrastive learning framework for efficient and\nrobust self-supervised graph representation learning, and the optimal transport\ndistance is utilized as the similarity metric between the subgraphs. It aims to\ngenerate contrastive samples by capturing the intrinsic structures of the graph\nand distinguish the samples based on the features and structures of subgraphs\nsimultaneously. Specifically, for each center node, by adaptively learning\nrelation weights to the nodes of the corresponding neighborhood, we first\ndevelop a network to generate the interpolated subgraph.

The jumping motions via the centroidal dynamics are formulated as\na 12-dimensional black-box optimization problem subject to the robot\nkino-dynamic constraints. Gradient-based approaches offer great success in\naddressing trajectory optimization (TO), yet, prior knowledge (e.g., reference\nmotion, contact schedule) is required and results in sub-optimal solutions. The\nnew proposed framework first employed a heuristics-based optimization method to\navoid these problems.

In this paper,\nwe argue that domain-invariant features should be originating from both\ninternal and mutual sides. Internal invariance means that the features can be\nlearned with a single domain and the features capture intrinsic semantics of\ndata, i.e., the property within a domain, which is agnostic to other domains.\nMutual invariance means that the features can be learned with multiple domains\n(cross-domain) and the features contain common information, i.e., the\ntransferable features w.r.t. other domains. We then propose DIFEX for\nDomain-Invariant Feature EXploration. DIFEX employs a knowledge distillation\nframework to capture the high-level Fourier phase as the internally-invariant\nfeatures and learn cross-domain correlation alignment as the mutually-invariant\nfeatures. We further design an exploration loss to increase the feature\ndiversity for better generalization.

Few works consider forging participant-centric collaboration among\nparticipants to pursue an FL model for their common interests, which induces\ndramatic differences in incentive mechanism design from the broker-centric FL.\nTo coordinate the selfish and heterogeneous participants, we propose a novel\nanalytic framework for incentivizing effective and efficient collaborations for\nparticipant-centric FL.

The underlying models were formulated under different theoretical\nassumptions and with varying, and sometimes conflicting objectives. This paper\npresents a unifying framework under which different approaches can be compared\nbased on their respective assumptions. The unifying modelling framework is\nreferred to as trip pricing model, which extends path-differentiated pricing to\nmultimodal paths, i.e., trips on whatever mode or combinations of modes, and\ngeneralizes road pricing schemes (which are shown to be a special case). By\nsetting both positive (tolls) and negative (incentives) prices, revenue-neutral\nschemes are also shown to be special cases, with no a-priori assumption on\nwhich paths/modes to toll/incentivize. For model comparison, the pricing design\nproblem is formulated in a multi-objective optimization framework, which\ncombines traffic efficiency, environmental sustainability, users' acceptance,\nsocial and spatial equity, as pricing objectives. The trip pricing scheme is\ncompared with traditional road pricing schemes, and with their revenue-neutral\nvariants. First-best and second-best pricing schemes, designed in single- and\nmulti-objective optimization frameworks, are compared on the Nguyen-Dupuis\nnetwork. Results suggest a vast potential for multi-objective trip congestion\npricing over single-objective road pricing. In addition, the application of\nboth positive and negative prices is shown to significantly increase the\nexpected acceptance of pricing schemes and to preserve efficiency and\nsustainability objectives. The results should promote the design of more\neffective pricing policies, i.e., set of pricing rules easier to communicate,\nbased on now available technologies of passengers' tracking and pricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 10:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Recently, some works have managed\nto select the accurate boxes generated from a well-trained WSOD network to\nsupervise a semi-supervised detection framework for better performance.\nHowever, these approaches simply divide the training set into labeled and\nunlabeled sets according to the image-level criteria, such that sufficient\nmislabeled or wrongly localized box predictions are chosen as pseudo\nground-truths, resulting in a sub-optimal solution of detection performance. To\novercome this issue, we propose a novel WSOD framework with a new paradigm that\nswitches from weak supervision to noisy supervision (W2N). Generally, with\ngiven pseudo ground-truths generated from the well-trained WSOD network, we\npropose a two-module iterative training algorithm to refine pseudo labels and\nsupervise better object detector progressively. In the localization adaptation\nmodule, we propose a regularization loss to reduce the proportion of\ndiscriminative parts in original pseudo ground-truths, obtaining better pseudo\nground-truths for further training.

The BINGO radio telescope will use the 21cm line to map the Universe in\nthe redshift range $0.127 \\le z \\le 0.449$, in a tomographic approach, with the\nmain goal of probing BAO. This work presents the forecasts of measuring the\ntransversal BAO signal during the BINGO Phase 1 operation. We use two\nclustering estimators, the two-point angular correlation function (ACF) and the\nangular power spectrum (APS), and a template-based method to model the ACF and\nAPS estimated from simulations of the BINGO region and extract the BAO\ninformation. The tomographic approach allows the combination of redshift bins\nto improve the template fitting performance. We find that each clustering\nestimator shows different sensitivities to specific redshift ranges, although\nboth of them perform better at higher redshifts. In general, the APS estimator\nprovides slightly better estimates, with smaller uncertainties and larger\nprobability of detection of the BAO signal, achieving $\\gtrsim 90$\\% at higher\nredshifts. We investigate the contribution from instrumental noise and residual\nforeground signals and find that the former has the greater impact, getting\nmore significant as the redshift increases, in particular the APS estimator.\nIndeed, including noise in the analysis increases the uncertainty up to a\nfactor of $\\sim 2.2$ at higher redshifts. Foreground residuals, in contrast, do\nnot significantly affect our final uncertainties. In summary, our results show\nthat, even including semi-realistic systematic effects, BINGO has the potential\nto successfully measure the BAO scale in radio frequencies.

Originally, the Koopman formalism has been described for\nautonomous systems and the extension for actuated continuous-time systems with\na linear input or a control affine form has only recently been addressed.\nHowever, such a derivation for discrete-time systems has not yet been\ndeveloped. Thus, a particular Koopman form is generally assumed, predominantly\na linear time invariant (LTI) model, as it facilitates the use of control\ntechniques such as linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control.\nHowever, we show that this assumption is insufficient to capture the dynamics\nof the underlying nonlinear system. In the present paper, we systematically\ninvestigate and analytically derive lifted forms under inputs for a general\nclass of nonlinear systems in both continuous and discrete time, using the\nfundamental theorem of calculus. We prove that the resulting lifted\nrepresentations give linear state-space Koopman models where the input matrix\nbecomes state (and input, for the discrete-time case)-dependent, hence it can\nbe seen as a specially structured linear parameter-varying (LPV) description of\nthe underlying system. We also provide error bounds on how much the parameter\nvariation contributes and how well the system behaviour can be approximated by\nan LTI Koopman representation. The introduced theoretical insight greatly helps\nfor performing proper model structure selection in system identification with\nKoopman models as well as making a proper choice for LTI or LPV techniques for\nthe control of nonlinear systems through the Koopman approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 12:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

However, inaccurate pseudo labels of the target samples may\nyield suboptimal performance with error accumulation during the optimization\nprocess. Moreover, once the pseudo labels are generated, how to remedy the\ngenerated pseudo labels is far from explored.

It is known that the power spectral\ndensity (PSD) of the X-ray emission of XRBs shows significant evolution with\nspectral states. It is not clear whether AGN follow a similar evolutionary\ntrend, however, though their X-ray emission and the PSD are both variable. In\nthis work, we study a sample of nine AGN with multiple long observations with\nXMM-Newton, which exhibit significant X-ray spectral variation. We perform\nBayesian PSD analysis to measure the PSD shape and variation. We find that a\nlarge change in the X-ray energy spectrum (mainly the change of flux state) is\noften accompanied by a large change in the PSD shape. The emergence of a\nhigh-frequency break in the PSD also depends on the spectral state. Among the\nfour sources with significant high-frequency PSD breaks detected, three show\nthe break only in the high-flux state, while the remaining one shows it only in\nthe low-flux state. Moreover, the X-ray rms variability in different spectral\nstates of an AGN is found to vary by as much as 1.0 dex. These results suggest\nthat the different variability properties observed are likely caused by\ndifferent physical processes dominating different spectral states. Our results\nalso indicate that the intrinsic PSD variation can introduce a significant\nfraction of the dispersion as reported for the correlations between various\nX-ray variability properties and the black hole mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 12:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, the harmonic complexity of\nthe GP, while displaying no clear correlation with the spot properties in our\nsimulations, is systematically higher for the RV than for the light curve data.\nFinally, for the QP kernel, we investigate the impact of noise and\ntime-sampling on the hyperparameters in the case of RVs.

However, understanding the relation between jet\nparameters and resulting injection depth are needed to enable targeting\nspecific skin layers, and enhance the pharmacokinetics of various therapeutic\ncompounds. The complexity of skin, its opacity and non-linear mechanical\nproperties, pose a technological challenge. Hence the use of surrogates is\ninstrumental to understand how to inject without needles.

It is defined as the proportion of genetic\nvariants that have a nonzero effect on the trait. Evaluation of polygenicity\ncan provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of the trait.\nSeveral recent works have attempted to estimate polygenicity at the SNP level.\nHowever, evaluating polygenicity at the gene level can be biologically more\nmeaningful. We propose the notion of gene-level polygenicity, defined as the\nproportion of genes having a non-zero effect on the trait under the framework\nof transcriptome-wide association study. We introduce a Bayesian approach\npolygene to estimate this quantity for a trait. The method is based on spike\nand slab prior and simultaneously provides an optimal subset of non-null genes.\nOur simulation study shows that polygene efficiently estimates gene-level\npolygenicity. The method produces downward bias for small choices of trait\nheritability due to a non-null gene, which diminishes rapidly with an increase\nin the GWAS sample size. While identifying the optimal subset of non-null\ngenes, polygene offers a high level of specificity and an overall good level of\nsensitivity -- the sensitivity increases as the sample size of the reference\npanel expression and GWAS data increase.

Our study sheds a light on the relationship\nbetween one user's opinion change episode and subsequent behavioral change on\nan online social media, Reddit. In particular, we look at r/ChangeMyView, an\nonline community dedicated to debating one's own opinions. Interestingly, this\nforum adopts a well-codified schema for explicitly self-reporting opinion\nchange. Starting from this ground truth, we analyze changes in future online\ninformation consumption behavior that arise after a self-reported opinion\nchange on sociopolitical topics; and in particular, operationalized in this\nwork as the participation to sociopolitical subreddits. Such participation\nprofile is important as it represents one's information diet, and is a reliable\nproxy for, e.g., political affiliation or health choices.\n  We find that people who report an opinion change are significantly more\nlikely to change their future participation in a specific subset of online\ncommunities. We characterize which communities are more likely to be abandoned\nafter opinion change, and find a significant association (r=0.46) between\npropaganda-like language used in a community and the increase in chances of\nleaving it. We find comparable results (r=0.39) for the opposite direction,\ni.e., joining a community. This finding suggests how propagandistic communities\nact as a first gateway to internalize a shift in one's sociopolitical opinion.\nFinally, we show that the textual content of the discussion associated with\nopinion change is indicative of which communities are going to be subject to a\nparticipation change. In fact, a predictive model based only on the opinion\nchange post is able to pinpoint these communities with an AP@5 of 0.20, similar\nto what can be reached by using all the past history of participation in\ncommunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 13:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Current\nstate-of-the-art time series anomaly detectors mainly focus on devising\nadvanced neural network structures and new reconstruction/prediction learning\nobjectives to learn data normality (normal patterns and behaviors) as\naccurately as possible. However, these one-class learning methods can be\ndeceived by unknown anomalies in the training data (i.e., anomaly\ncontamination). Further, their normality learning also lacks knowledge about\nthe anomalies of interest. Consequently, they often learn a biased, inaccurate\nnormality boundary. This paper proposes a novel one-class learning approach,\nnamed calibrated one-class classification, to tackle this problem. Our\none-class classifier is calibrated in two ways: (1) by adaptively penalizing\nuncertain predictions, which helps eliminate the impact of anomaly\ncontamination while accentuating the predictions that the one-class model is\nconfident in, and (2) by discriminating the normal samples from native anomaly\nexamples that are generated to simulate genuine time series abnormal behaviors\non the basis of original data. These two calibrations result in\ncontamination-tolerant, anomaly-informed one-class learning, yielding a\nsignificantly improved normality modeling. Extensive experiments on six\nreal-world datasets show that our model substantially outperforms twelve\nstate-of-the-art competitors and obtains 6% - 31% F1 score improvement.

Whereas the SPT is sufficient to provide a\nrather good description of a reference system taking into account hard-core\ninteractions, the AMSA is known to be efficient in treating the Coulomb\ninteractions between the ions. Alternatively, we also use the mean spherical\napproximation (MSA) for comparison. In general, both approximations lead to\nsimilar qualitative results for the phase diagrams: the region of coexisting\nenvelope becomes broader and shifts towards larger densities and higher\ntemperatures when the pressure increases. However, the AMSA and the MSA produce\ndifferent concentration dependences, i.e., contrary to the MSA, the AMSA phase\ndiagrams show that the high-density phase mostly consists of the ions for all\npressures considered. To demonstrate the effect of asphericity of solvent\nmolecules on the fluid-fluid phase transition, we consider an \"equivalent\"\nmixture in which the HSC particles are replaced by hard spheres (HS) of the\nsame volume.

For semi-supervised\nlearning of latent state TOD models, variational learning is often used, but\nsuffers from the annoying high-variance of the gradients propagated through\ndiscrete latent variables and the drawback of indirectly optimizing the target\nlog-likelihood. Recently, an alternative algorithm, called joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA), has emerged for learning discrete latent variable models\nwith impressive performances. In this paper, we propose to apply JSA to\nsemi-supervised learning of the latent state TOD models, which is referred to\nas JSA-TOD. To our knowledge, JSA-TOD represents the first work in developing\nJSA based semi-supervised learning of discrete latent variable conditional\nmodels for such long sequential generation problems like in TOD systems.\nExtensive experiments show that JSA-TOD significantly outperforms its\nvariational learning counterpart.

We\nshow that these results are highly sensitive to the choice of Bayesian priors\non timing noise parameters, with priors that more closely match the injected\ndistributions of timing noise parameters resulting in diminished support for a\ncommon-spectrum noise process. These results emphasize shortcomings in current\nmethods for inferring the presence of a common-spectrum process, and imply that\nthe detection of a common process is not a reliable precursor to detection of\nthe GWB. Future searches for the nanohertz GWB should remain focussed on\ndetecting spatial correlations, and make use of more tailored specifications\nfor a common-spectrum noise process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 14:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Learning such compositional structures has been a challenge for\nartificial systems, due to the underlying combinatorial search. To date,\nresearch into compositional learning has largely proceeded separately from work\non lifelong or continual learning. This dissertation integrated these two lines\nof work to present a general-purpose framework for lifelong learning of\nfunctionally compositional structures. The framework separates the learning\ninto two stages: learning how to combine existing components to assimilate a\nnovel problem, and learning how to adapt the existing components to accommodate\nthe new problem. This separation explicitly handles the trade-off between\nstability and flexibility. This dissertation instantiated the framework into\nvarious supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Supervised\nlearning evaluations found that 1) compositional models improve lifelong\nlearning of diverse tasks, 2) the multi-stage process permits lifelong learning\nof compositional knowledge, and 3) the components learned by the framework\nrepresent self-contained and reusable functions. Similar RL evaluations\ndemonstrated that 1) algorithms under the framework accelerate the discovery of\nhigh-performing policies, and 2) these algorithms retain or improve performance\non previously learned tasks. The dissertation extended one lifelong\ncompositional RL algorithm to the nonstationary setting, where the task\ndistribution varies over time, and found that modularity permits individually\ntracking changes to different elements in the environment. The final\ncontribution of this dissertation was a new benchmark for compositional RL,\nwhich exposed that existing methods struggle to discover the compositional\nproperties of the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 15:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Consequently, numerous pre-trained\nmodels are released online to facilitate further research. However, it raises\nextensive concerns on whether these pre-trained models would leak\nprivacy-sensitive information of their training data. Thus, in this work, we\naim to answer the following questions: \"Can we effectively recover private\ninformation from these pre-trained models? What are the sufficient conditions\nto retrieve such sensitive information?\" We first explore different statistical\ninformation which can discriminate the private training distribution from other\ndistributions. Based on our observations, we propose a novel private data\nreconstruction framework, SecretGen, to effectively recover private\ninformation. Compared with previous methods which can recover private data with\nthe ground true prediction of the targeted recovery instance, SecretGen does\nnot require such prior knowledge, making it more practical. We conduct\nextensive experiments on different datasets under diverse scenarios to compare\nSecretGen with other baselines and provide a systematic benchmark to better\nunderstand the impact of different auxiliary information and optimization\noperations. We show that without prior knowledge about true class prediction,\nSecretGen is able to recover private data with similar performance compared\nwith the ones that leverage such prior knowledge. If the prior knowledge is\ngiven, SecretGen will significantly outperform baseline methods. We also\npropose several quantitative metrics to further quantify the privacy\nvulnerability of pre-trained models, which will help the model selection for\nprivacy-sensitive applications.

We examine here this apparent\ncontradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and\nits evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D cellular\nsolids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is\nadequately described by a non-stationary depinning equation derived from damage\nmechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description,\nprecursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the\nmaterial's disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following\nindividual damage events.

Starting with the data\npoints being represented by a Markov process using the diffusion map framework,\nthe method adaptively increase the orthogonality of the clusters by applying a\nfeedback mechanism inspired by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This mechanism\niteratively increases the spectral gap and refines the orthogonality of the\ndata to achieve a clustering with high specificity. By using the diffusion map\nframework and representing the relation between data points using transition\nprobabilities, the method is robust with respect to both the underlying\ndistance, noise in the data and random initialization. We prove that the method\nconverges globally to a unique fixpoint for certain parameter values.

We construct a model that analytically\nrepresents the spatiotemporal distribution of spurs in a target volume as a\nfunction of irradiation parameters (e.g. dose, dose rate, linear energy\ntransfer), and quantifies the effect of interspur interactions on the ongoing\nradiochemistry. Spurs evolve under a simplified reaction-diffusion equation\nwith parameters based on Monte Carlo simulations, and interspur interaction is\nquantified by calculating the expected values of interspur overlap in the\ntarget.\n  The model demonstrates that for any set of irradiation parameters, a minimum\ncritical dose and dose rate are necessary to induce significant interspur\ninteraction, and that interspur interactions correlate negatively with beam\nlinear energy transfer at a fixed dose. The model suggests optimal beam\nparameters, including dose, dose rate, linear energy transfer, and pulse\nstructure, to maximize interspur interactions. Depending on the rate of radical\nscavenging in the target, which limits interspur interaction, this model\npredicts that the irradiation parameters necessary to elicit the FLASH effect\nmay coincide with an onset of significant interspur interactions, suggesting\nthat interspur interaction may be the underlying mechanism of the FLASH effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 15:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

The goal is to learn a unified model\nperformant on all the classes observed so far. Given the recent popularity of\nVision Transformers (ViTs) in conventional classification settings, an\ninteresting question is to study their continual learning behaviour. In this\nwork, we develop a Debiased Dual Distilled Transformer for CIL dubbed\n$\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$. The proposed model leverages a hybrid nested ViT\ndesign to ensure data efficiency and scalability to small as well as large\ndatasets. In contrast to a recent ViT based CIL approach, our\n$\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ does not dynamically expand its architecture when\nnew tasks are learned and remains suitable for a large number of incremental\ntasks. The improved CIL behaviour of $\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ owes to two\nfundamental changes to the ViT design. First, we treat the incremental learning\nas a long-tail classification problem where the majority samples from new\nclasses vastly outnumber the limited exemplars available for old classes. To\navoid the bias against the minority old classes, we propose to dynamically\nadjust logits to emphasize on retaining the representations relevant to old\ntasks. Second, we propose to preserve the configuration of spatial attention\nmaps as the learning progresses across tasks. This helps in reducing\ncatastrophic forgetting by constraining the model to retain the attention on\nthe most discriminative regions. $\\textrm{D}^3\\textrm{Former}$ obtains\nfavorable results on incremental versions of CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and\nImageNet datasets.

In contrast, graph\nneural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the\nmolecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes\nand bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end\nfashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in\nQSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction\nperformance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field\nof research.

These mathematical machinery\nwas invented initially by Henri Poincare around 1900 and developed over time to\nunderstand shapes and dynamical systems whose structure and behavior is too\ncomplicated to solve for analytically but can be understood via global\nrelationships. In particular, we show how individual neurons in a neural\nnetwork can correspond to simplexes in a simplicial complex manifold\napproximation to the decision surface learned by the NN, and how these\nsimplexes can be used to compute topological invariants from algebraic topology\nfor the decision manifold with an explicit computation of homology groups by\nhand in a simple case. We also show how the gradient of the probability density\nfunction learned by the NN creates a dynamical system, which can be analyzed by\na myriad of topological tools such as Conley Index Theory, Morse Theory, and\nStable Manifolds. We solve analytically for associated the differential\nequation for a trained NN with a single hidden layer of 256 Neurons applied to\nthe MINST digit dataset, and approximately numerically that it a sink and basin\nof attraction for each of the 10 classes, but the sinks and strong attracting\nmanifolds lie in regions not corresponding to images of actual digits.
