There are two procedures in the\nstandard LGA, i.e., \"propagation\" + \"transaction\". If the propagation step is\nremoved and the transaction is conducted among all agents, the LGA reduces to a\nmore simplified kinetic model. In addition, two dealing rules are imposed on\nthe transaction phase. Under Rule I, the trading volume depends on the average\nsaving propensities of an arbitrary pair of agents in trade. Under Rule II, the\nexchange is governed by a stochastic parameter between the saving propensities\nof two traders. Besides, two sampling methods are introduced for the random\nselection of two agents in the iterative process. Specifically, Sampling I is\nthe sampling with replacement and is easier to program. Sampling II is the\nsampling without replacement and owns a higher computing efficiency. There are\nslight differences between the stationary wealth distributions simulated by\nusing the two transaction rules and sampling approaches. In addition, the\naccuracy, robustness and efficiency of the econophysics models are validated by\ntypical numerical tests. The reduced LGA without the propagation step owns a\nhigher computational efficiency than the standard LGA. Moreover, the impact of\nsaving propensities of agents in two groups on the wealth distributions is\nstudied, and the influence of proportions of agents is investigated as well. To\nquantitatively measure the wealth inequality, the Gini coefficients, Kolkata\nindices, and deviation degrees of all agents and two groups are simulated and\nanalyzed in detail.

Seeds get dispersed around the mother plant via several agents\nin a random way. In our model seeds landing sites are distributed according to\na homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant rate on $\\mathbb{R}$. We\nwill assume that each seed will successfully germinate and grow into a new\nplant with the same characteristics as the mother plant. The time is discrete,\nscaled according to generations of plants or can represent years, since annual\nplants go through an entire growing cycle during one year.

The most commonly-used metric in\nADHD is the theta-to-beta spectral power ratio (TBR) that is based on a\nsingle-channel analysis. However, initial findings for this measure have not\nbeen replicated in other studies. Thus, instead of focusing on single-channel\nspectral power, a novel model for investigating interactions (dependence)\nbetween channels in the entire network is proposed. Although dependence\nmeasures such as coherence and partial directed coherence (PDC) are well\nexplored in studying brain connectivity, these measures only capture linear\ndependence. Moreover, in designed clinical experiments, these dependence\nmeasures are observed to vary across subjects even within a homogeneous group.\nTo address these limitations, we propose the mixed-effects\nfunctional-coefficient autoregressive (MX-FAR) model which captures\nbetween-subject variation by incorporating subject-specific random effects.

In particular, the minimal rank decomposition\nby rectangles of a persistence module, also known as the generalized\npersistence diagram, gives a uniquely defined representation of the rank\ninvariant of the module by a pair of rectangle-decomposable modules. This pair\nis interpreted as a signed barcode, with the rectangle summands of the first\n(resp. second) module playing the role of the positive (resp. negative) bars.\nThe minimal rank decomposition by rectangles generalizes the concept of\npersistence barcode from one-parameter persistence, and, being a discrete\ninvariant, it is amenable to manipulations on a computer.

Such a venture is similar to many studies in which researchers have\nenhanced modeling through ontological analysis of the underlying paradigm of\nUML models. We attempt to develop a conceptual model that consists of a\nfoundation of things that is supplemented with a second level of designated\nobjects. According to some researchers, the problem of the difference between\nthings and objects is one of the most decisive issues for the conception of\nreality. In software engineering, objects serve two purposes: they promote\nunderstanding of the real world and provide a practical basis for computer\nimplementation. The notion of object plays a central role in the\nobject-oriented approach, in which other notions are viewed by decomposing them\ninto objects and their relationships. This paper contributes to the\nestablishment of a broader understanding of the notion of object in conceptual\nmodeling based on things that are simultaneously machines.

In this work, we delve into the gradient matching method from a\ncomprehensive perspective and answer the critical questions of what, how, and\nwhere to match. We propose to match the multi-level gradients to involve both\nintra-class and inter-class gradient information. We demonstrate that the\ndistance function should focus on the angle, considering the magnitude\nsimultaneously to delay the overfitting. An overfitting-aware adaptive learning\nstep strategy is also proposed to trim unnecessary optimization steps for\nalgorithmic efficiency improvement. Ablation and comparison experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed methodology shows superior accuracy, efficiency,\nand generalization compared to prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 21:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Shortest path\nalgorithms are commonly applied to modern navigation systems, so our study aims\nto improve the efficiency of an existing algorithm on large-scale Euclidean\nnetworks. The current literature lacks a deep understanding of certain\nalgorithms' performance on these types of networks. Therefore, we incorporate a\nnew heuristic function, called the $k$-step look-ahead, into the A* search\nalgorithm and conduct a computational experiment to evaluate and compare the\nresults on road networks of varying sizes. Our main findings are that this new\nheuristic yields a significant improvement in runtime, particularly for larger\nnetworks when compared to standard A*, as well as that a higher value of $k$ is\nneeded to achieve optimal efficiency as network size increases. Future research\ncan build upon this work by implementing a program that automatically chooses\nan optimal $k$ value given an input network.

Many of these challenges stem from the fact that\nelectron ionisation can make it difficult to recover molecular information due\nto the high degree of fragmentation with concomitant loss of molecular ion\nsignal. With GC-MS data there are often many common fragment ions shared among\nclosely-eluting peaks, necessitating sophisticated methods for analysis. Some\nof these methods are fully automated, but make some assumptions about the data\nwhich can introduce artifacts during the analysis. Chemometric methods such as\nMultivariate Curve Resolution, or Parallel Factor Analysis are particularly\nattractive, since they are flexible and make relatively few assumptions about\nthe data - ideally resulting in fewer artifacts. These methods do require\nexpert user intervention to determine the most relevant regions of interest and\nan appropriate number of components, $k$, for each region. Automated region of\ninterest selection is needed to permit automated batch processing of\nchromatographic data with advanced signal deconvolution. Here, we propose a new\nmethod for automated, untargeted region of interest selection that accounts for\nthe multivariate information present in GC-MS data to select regions of\ninterest based on the ratio of the squared first, and second singular values\nfrom the Singular Value Decomposition of a window that moves across the\nchromatogram. Assuming that the first singular value accounts largely for\nsignal, and that the second singular value accounts largely for noise, it is\npossible to interpret the relationship between these two values as a\nprobabilistic distribution of Fisher Ratios. The sensitivity of the algorithm\nwas tested by investigating the concentration at which the algorithm can no\nlonger pick out chromatographic regions known to contain signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 21:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

Accordingly, we trigger gait switching merely\nbased on proprioceptive sensory information. To learn this predictive model, we\npropose a semi-supervised process for detecting and annotating ground truth\nslip events in two stages: We first detect abnormal occurrences in the time\nseries sequences of the gait data using an unsupervised anomaly detector, and\nthen, the anomalies are verified with expert human knowledge in a replay\nsimulation to assert the event of a slip.

Hence, the faults can\nbe executed on SNNs as well as compressed networks with minimal-to-none\nmodifications to the underlying code, a feat that is not achievable by other\nstate-of-the-art tools.\n  To evaluate our enpheeph framework, we analyze the resiliency of different\nDNN and SNN models, with different compression techniques. By injecting a\nrandom and increasing number of faults, we show that DNNs can show a reduction\nin accuracy with a fault rate as low as 7 x 10 ^ (-7) faults per parameter,\nwith an accuracy drop higher than 40%. Run-time overhead when executing\nenpheeph is less than 20% of the baseline execution time when executing 100 000\nfaults concurrently, at least 10x lower than state-of-the-art frameworks,\nmaking enpheeph future-proof for complex fault injection scenarios.\n  We release enpheeph at https://github.com/Alexei95/enpheeph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 00:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

This functional rule extraction method applies to\nthe perceptron and multilayer neural network. For any $N$ model that is trained\nto predict some outcome given some event, that model behaviour can be expressed\nâ using the functional rule extraction method â as a formal rule or informal\nrule obeyed by the network to predict that outcome. As example, figure 1\nconsist of a comprehensive physics function that is parameter for one of the\nnetwork hidden activation functions.

The NLI-based indirect supervision acquires only one relation\nverbalization template from humans as a semantically general template for each\nrelationship, and then the template set is enriched by high-quality textual\npatterns automatically mined from the distantly annotated corpus.

Thus far to our best\nknowledge, no solution exists priori to this work, despite its high prevalence\nin practice. Two globally decentralized adaptive control schemes are presented\nbased on the backstepping technique, the first one is developed in a continuous\nfashion by combining the philosophy of the modified congelation of variables\nbased approach with the special treatment of non-triangular structural\nuncertainties, which avoids the derivative of time-varying parameters and\neliminates the limitation of the triangular condition, thus largely broadens\nthe scope of application. By making use of the important property that the\npartial derivatives of the constructed virtual controllers in each subsystem\nare all constant, the second scheme is developed through directly replacing the\nstates in the preceding scheme with the triggered ones. Consequently, the\nnon-differentiability of the virtual control stemming from intermittent state\nfeedback is completely obviated. The internal signals under both schemes are\nrigorously shown to be globally uniformly bounded with the aid of several novel\nlemmas, while the stabilization performance can be enhanced by appropriately\nadjusting design parameters. Moreover, the inter-event intervals are ensured to\nbe lower-bounded by a positive constant.

The disadvantages of NFT include the consumption of electrical\npower and the faster spread of disease. Therefore, NFT requires a good nutrient\ncontrol and monitoring system to save electricity and achieve optimal growth\nand resistance to pests and diseases. In this study, a nutrient control was\ndesigned with indicators of pH and TDS levels and equipped with an Internet of\nThings (IoT) based monitoring system. The control system used is the Mamdani\nFuzzy Inference System. The output of the system is the active time of the pH\nUp, pH Down, and AB Mix nutrient pumps, which aim to normalize the pH and TDS\nof nutrient liquids. The experimental results show that one to three control\nsteps are needed to normalize pH. One control step has a response time of 60\nseconds, and it can prevent pH Up and pH Down oscillations. As for TDS control,\nthe prediction of AB mix pump active time works accurately, and TDS levels can\nbe normalized in one control step. Overall, based on surface control,\nsimulations, and real experimental data, it is indicated that the control\nsystem operates very well and can normalize pH and TDS to the desired normal\nstandard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 05:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

The recently proposed occupancy\nflow field prediction introduces a scalable and effective representation to\njointly predict surrounding agents' future motions in a scene.

Therefore, this paper\nproposes a novel Multi-modal Hierarchical Transformer network that fuses the\nvectorized (agent motion) and visual (scene flow, map, and occupancy)\nmodalities and jointly predicts the flow and occupancy of the scene.\nSpecifically, visual and vector features from sensory data are encoded through\na multi-stage Transformer module and then a late-fusion Transformer module with\ntemporal pixel-wise attention.

However, with the increasing depth of SNNs, the memory problem\ncaused by the weights of SNNs has gradually attracted attention. Inspired by\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) quantization technology, binarized SNN (BSNN)\nis introduced to solve the memory problem. Due to the lack of suitable learning\nalgorithms, BSNN is usually obtained by ANN-to-SNN conversion, whose accuracy\nwill be limited by the trained ANNs. In this paper, we propose an ultra-low\nlatency adaptive local binary spiking neural network (ALBSNN) with accuracy\nloss estimators, which dynamically selects the network layers to be binarized\nto ensure the accuracy of the network by evaluating the error caused by the\nbinarized weights during the network learning process. Experimental results\nshow that this method can reduce storage space by more than 20 % without losing\nnetwork accuracy. At the same time, in order to accelerate the training speed\nof the network, the global average pooling(GAP) layer is introduced to replace\nthe fully connected layers by the combination of convolution and pooling, so\nthat SNNs can use a small number of time steps to obtain better recognition\naccuracy.

Most conventional filtering\ntechniques are fairly hand-crafted and often need to be finely tuned to the\npresent hardware, imaging scheme and application. Learning based techniques on\nthe other hand suffer from the need for a target image for training (in case of\nfully supervised techniques) or require narrow, complex physics-based models of\nthe speckle appearance that might not apply in all cases.

However, adversarial image samples with\nquasi-imperceptible noises could threaten deep learning SR models. In this\npaper, we propose a robust deep learning framework for real-world SR that\nrandomly erases potential adversarial noises in the frequency domain of input\nimages or features. The rationale is that on the SR task clean images or\nfeatures have a different pattern from the attacked ones in the frequency\ndomain. Observing that existing adversarial attacks usually add high-frequency\nnoises to input images, we introduce a novel random frequency mask module that\nblocks out high-frequency components possibly containing the harmful\nperturbations in a stochastic manner. Since the frequency masking may not only\ndestroys the adversarial perturbations but also affects the sharp details in a\nclean image, we further develop an adversarial sample classifier based on the\nfrequency domain of images to determine if applying the proposed mask module.\nBased on the above ideas, we devise a novel real-world image SR framework that\ncombines the proposed frequency mask modules and the proposed adversarial\nclassifier with an existing super-resolution backbone network. Experiments show\nthat our proposed method is more insensitive to adversarial attacks and\npresents more stable SR results than existing models and defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Using international survey and remote sensing data, we find that\nthe key statistics (e.g., mean, quantiles, and standard deviation) of carbon\nstock tend to scale with the hydrological regime (i.e., aridity) via a\nuniversal exponent. As a result, when normalized by its averages in the\ncorresponding hydrological regime, the carbon stock distributions collapse onto\na single curve.

The\nchallenges of artistic text recognition include the various appearance with\nspecial-designed fonts and effects, the complex connections and overlaps\nbetween characters, and the severe interference from background patterns. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose to recognize the artistic text at three\nlevels. Firstly, corner points are applied to guide the extraction of local\nfeatures inside characters, considering the robustness of corner structures to\nappearance and shape. In this way, the discreteness of the corner points cuts\noff the connection between characters, and the sparsity of them improves the\nrobustness for background interference. Secondly, we design a character\ncontrastive loss to model the character-level feature, improving the feature\nrepresentation for character classification. Thirdly, we utilize Transformer to\nlearn the global feature on image-level and model the global relationship of\nthe corner points, with the assistance of a corner-query cross-attention\nmechanism. Besides, we provide an artistic text dataset to benchmark the\nperformance. Experimental results verify the significant superiority of our\nproposed method on artistic text recognition and also achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on several blurred and perspective datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 14:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Moreover, pre-conditioning\nnoisy gradient observations tend to amplify the noise by a factor given by the\nlargest eigenvalue of the pre-conditioning matrix. We propose a Bayesian\napproach to obtain a Hessian matrix approximation for stochastic optimization\nthat minimizes the secant equations residue while retaining the smallest\neigenvalue above a specified limit. Thus, the proposed approach assists\nstochastic gradient descent to converge to local minima without augmenting\ngradient noise. The prior distribution is modeled as the exponential of the\nnegative squared distance to the previous Hessian approximation, in the\nFrobenius sense, with logarithmic barriers imposing extreme eigenvalues\nconstraints. The likelihood distribution is derived from the secant equations,\ni.e., the probability of obtaining the observed gradient evaluations for a\ngiven candidate Hessian approximation.

For several applications in\nthis sector, the system to be modeled consists of a mix of discrete-event and\ncontinuous processes interacting with each other. Building simulation-based\nDigital Twins of such systems necessitates an open, flexible simulation\nframework which can support easy modeling and fast simulation of both\ncontinuous and discrete-event components, and their interactions. In this\npaper, we present an outline and key design aspects of a Python-based framework\nfor performing mixed discrete-continuous simulations. The continuous processes\nin the system are assumed to be loosely coupled to other components via\npre-defined events. For example, a continuous state variable crossing a\nthreshold may trigger an external event. Similarly, external events may lead to\na sudden change in the trajectory, state value or boundary conditions in a\ncontinuous process. We first present a systematic events-based interface using\nwhich such interactions can be modeled and simulated. We then discuss\nimplementation details of the framework along with a detailed example. In our\nimplementation, the advancement of time is controlled and performed using the\nevent-stepped engine of SimPy (a popular discrete-event simulation library in\nPython).

In this research, I show that a class of RVM-CDM (cold dark\nmatter) model can also describe a cyclical cosmology in which the universe\nundergoes cycles of expansion to the contraction phase and vice versa. To this\nend, following our previous work, I consider one of the most successful class\nof RVM-CDM model in bouncing cosmology, $\\rho_x=n_0+n_2 H^2 +n_4 H^4$, in which\nthe power spectral index gets a red tilt and the running of the spectral index\nmay give a negative value by choosing the appropriate value of parameters\n($n_0,~n_2,~n_4$), which is consistent with the cosmological observations. It\nis worthwhile to mention that most matter bounce models do not produce this\nnegative value. However, the main purpose of this article is to investigate the\nRVM-CDM model in the turnaround phase. Far from the bounce in a phantom\nexpanding universe, the turnaround conditions are investigated before the\noccurrence of a sudden big rip. By analyzing the Hubble parameter, equation of\nstate parameter, and deceleration parameter around the turnaround, we show that\na successful turnaround may occur after an expansion in an \\textbf{interacting}\ncase of RVM-CDM by choosing the appropriate value of parameters. A minimum\nvalue for the interaction parameter is obtained and also finds any relation\nbetween other model parameters. Finally, the effect of each parameter on a\nturnaround is studied, and we see that the transition time from accelerating to\ndecelerating expansion can occur earlier for larger values of interaction\nparameters. Also, in several graphs, the effect of the second term in DE\ndensity, including $H^2$, is studied, and we see that by increasing its\ncoefficient, $n_2$, the transition point leads to lower values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 08:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}
