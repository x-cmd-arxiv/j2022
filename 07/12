However, regional\ninformation is typically only achieved at the expense of undesirable\ninformation lost owing to down-sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel\nTransformer architecture that aims to mitigate the cost issue, named Dual\nVision Transformer (Dual-ViT). The new architecture incorporates a critical\nsemantic pathway that can more efficiently compress token vectors into global\nsemantics with reduced order of complexity. Such compressed global semantics\nthen serve as useful prior information in learning finer pixel level details,\nthrough another constructed pixel pathway. The semantic pathway and pixel\npathway are then integrated together and are jointly trained, spreading the\nenhanced self-attention information in parallel through both of the pathways.\nDual-ViT is henceforth able to reduce the computational complexity without\ncompromising much accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that Dual-ViT provides\nsuperior accuracy than SOTA Transformer architectures with reduced training\ncomplexity.

Thus, existing solutions\ncommonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over\nkeys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we\nargue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and\ninevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components\nin objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we\nconstruct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates\nthe invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention\nlearning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with\nlossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better\nefficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are\nleveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts\nwith enlarged receptive field.

Rehearsal-based\nmethods which explicitly store previous task samples in the buffer and\ninterleave them with the current task samples have proven to be the most\neffective in mitigating forgetting. However, Experience Replay (ER) does not\nperform well under low-buffer regimes and longer task sequences as its\nperformance is commensurate with the buffer size. Consistency in predictions of\nsoft-targets can assist ER in preserving information pertaining to previous\ntasks better as soft-targets capture the rich similarity structure of the data.\nTherefore, we examine the role of consistency regularization in ER framework\nunder various continual learning scenarios. We also propose to cast consistency\nregularization as a self-supervised pretext task thereby enabling the use of a\nwide variety of self-supervised learning methods as regularizers. While\nsimultaneously enhancing model calibration and robustness to natural\ncorruptions, regularizing consistency in predictions results in lesser\nforgetting across all continual learning scenarios.

Yet, the\nunprecedented size of an NLP model stresses both latency and memory, creating a\ntension between the two key resources of a mobile device. To meet a target\nlatency, holding the whole model in memory launches execution as soon as\npossible but increases one app's memory footprints by several times, limiting\nits benefits to only a few inferences before being recycled by mobile memory\nmanagement. On the other hand, loading the model from storage on demand incurs\nIO as long as a few seconds, far exceeding the delay range satisfying to a\nuser; pipelining layerwise model loading and execution does not hide IO either,\ndue to the high skewness between IO and computation delays.\n  To this end, we propose Speedy Transformer Inference (STI). Built on the key\nidea of maximizing IO/compute resource utilization on the most important parts\nof a model, STI reconciles the latency v.s. memory tension via two novel\ntechniques. First, model sharding. STI manages model parameters as\nindependently tunable shards, and profiles their importance to accuracy.\nSecond, elastic pipeline planning with a preload buffer. STI instantiates an\nIO/compute pipeline and uses a small buffer for preload shards to bootstrap\nexecution without stalling at early stages; it judiciously selects, tunes, and\nassembles shards per their importance for resource-elastic execution,\nmaximizing inference accuracy.\n  Atop two commodity SoCs, we build STI and evaluate it against a wide range of\nNLP tasks, under a practical range of target latencies, and on both CPU and\nGPU.

The users are significantly less powerful than the server, and, in\nparticular, should have both computation and communication complexities that\nare polylogarithmic in $n$.

However,\nthis pipeline suffers from high computational cost and long inference latency,\nwhich largely depends on two essential factors: 1) network architecture\nparameters, 2) sequential data stream. Recently, the parameters of image-based\ngenerative models have been significantly compressed via more efficient network\narchitectures. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly focus on slimming network\narchitectures and ignore the size of the sequential data stream. Moreover, due\nto the lack of temporal coherence, image-based compression is not sufficient\nfor the compression of the video task. In this paper, we present a\nspatial-temporal compression framework, \\textbf{Fast-Vid2Vid}, which focuses on\ndata aspects of generative models. It makes the first attempt at time dimension\nto reduce computational resources and accelerate inference. Specifically, we\ncompress the input data stream spatially and reduce the temporal redundancy.\nAfter the proposed spatial-temporal knowledge distillation, our model can\nsynthesize key-frames using the low-resolution data stream. Finally,\nFast-Vid2Vid interpolates intermediate frames by motion compensation with\nslight latency. On standard benchmarks, Fast-Vid2Vid achieves around real-time\nperformance as 20 FPS and saves around 8x computational cost on a single V100\nGPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 17:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

This suggests that using radio lobes as proxies for cavities may help\nto circumvent systematic uncertainties in the cavity volume measurements.\nEncouraged by the high volume of unique ILT observations successfully\nprocessed, this hybrid method enables radio-mode feedback to be studied at high\nredshifts for the first time even for large samples of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Current models predict the effect of this\nextension to be negligible due to large decay constants $f$ close to the scale\nof grand unified theories. Here, we present a construction of dCS allowing for\nmuch smaller decay constants, ranging from sub-eV to Planck scales.\nSpecifically, we show that if there exists a fermion species with strong\nself-interactions, the short-wavelength fermion modes form a bound state. This\nbound state can then undergo dynamical symmetry breaking and the resulting\npseudoscalar develops Yukawa interactions with the remaining long-wavelength\nfermion modes. Due to this new interaction, loop corrections with gravitons\nthen realize a linear coupling between the pseudoscalar and the gravitational\nChern-Simons term. The strength of this coupling is set by the Yukawa coupling\nconstant divided by the fermion mass. Therefore, since self-interacting\nfermions with small masses are ideal, we identify neutrinos as promising\ncandidates.

In turn, such\nregions cast shadows on adjacent zones that consequently cool down and shrink,\neventually leading to an alternating pattern of overheated and shadowed\nregions. Previous investigations have proposed this to be a real self-sustained\nprocess, the so-called self-shadowing or thermal wave instability, which could\nnaturally form frequently observed disk structures such as rings and gaps, and\neven potentially enhance the formation of planetesimals. All of these, however,\nhave assumed in one way or another vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and\ninstantaneous radiative diffusion throughout the disk. In this work we present\nthe first study of the stability of accretion disks to self-shadowing that\nrelaxes these assumptions, relying instead on radiation-hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We first construct hydrostatic disk configurations by means of an\niterative procedure and show that the formation of a pattern of enlarged and\nshadowed regions is a direct consequence of assuming instantaneous radiative\ndiffusion. We then let these solutions evolve in time, which leads to a fast\ndamping of the initial shadowing features in layers close to the disk surface.\nThese thermally relaxed layers grow towards the midplane until all temperature\nextrema in the radial direction are erased in the entire disk. Our results\nsuggest that radiative cooling and gas advection at the disk surface prevent a\nself-shadowing instability from forming, by damping temperature perturbations\nbefore these reach lower, optically thick regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 18:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

The Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) estimates\nvalues and uncertainties for a galaxy's bulge-to-total light ratio ($L_B/L_T$),\neffective radius ($R_e$), and flux ($F$). To estimate posteriors, GaMPEN uses\nthe Monte Carlo Dropout technique and incorporates the full covariance matrix\nbetween the output parameters in its loss function. GaMPEN also uses a Spatial\nTransformer Network (STN) to automatically crop input galaxy frames to an\noptimal size before determining their morphology.

Training and\ntesting GaMPEN on galaxies simulated to match $z < 0.25$ galaxies in Hyper\nSuprime-Cam Wide $g$-band images, we demonstrate that GaMPEN achieves typical\nerrors of $0.1$ in $L_B/L_T$, $0.17$ arcsec ($\\sim 7\\%$) in $R_e$, and\n$6.3\\times10^4$ nJy ($\\sim 1\\%$) in $F$.

An automated approach was proposed to identify\nand remove the condensation associated abnormal measurements. The proposed\ndevice has better affordability and portability as well as similar usability\nand data accessibility compared to those existing devices recognized.

In order to handle these challenges, this work first\nproposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the\nuncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general\nCU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant\nuncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty\nestimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA\nmulti-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables\nthe SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal\ntrajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the\noptimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent\ntrajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic\ndataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately\napproximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent\ntrajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily\nhelps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed\nframework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement\nError of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for\nmulti-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty\nis positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU\nvalues are highly related to the interactive information among agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 21:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Among its intrinsic properties are its electric charge, mass, and\nspin. These emerge from the complex dynamics of its fundamental constituents,\nquarks and gluons, described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nUsing electron scattering, its electric charge and spin, shared among the quark\nconstituents, have been the topic of active investigation. An example is the\nnovel precision measurement of the proton's electric charge radius. In\ncontrast, little is known about the proton's inner mass density, dominated by\nthe energy carried by the gluons, which are hard to access through electron\nscattering since gluons carry no electromagnetic charge. Here, we chose to\nprobe this gluonic gravitational density using a small color dipole, the\n$J/\\psi$ particle, through its threshold photoproduction. From our data, we\ndetermined, for the first time, the proton's gluonic gravitational form\nfactors. We used a variety of models and determined, in all cases, a mass\nradius that is notably smaller than the electric charge radius. In some cases,\nthe determined radius, although model dependent, is in excellent agreement with\nfirst-principle predictions from lattice QCD. This work paves the way for a\ndeeper understanding of the salient role of gluons in providing gravitational\nmass to visible matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 22:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 21:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 19:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 19:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We\nconsider a two-band model in a square lattice, where the bands have distinct\neffective masses. The incommensurate CDW (inCDW) and CDW phases arise from an\ninterband Coulomb repulsive interaction, while the SC emerges due to a local\nintraband attractive interaction.

To address this\nchallenge, the research community has looked at the solution of decentralized\ntraining and sharing of model parameters using the Federated Learning (FL)\nparadigm. In this paper, we study the utilization of FL for performing survival\nanalysis on distributed healthcare datasets. Recently, the popular Cox\nproportional hazard (CPH) models have been adapted for FL settings; however,\ndue to its linearity and proportional hazards assumptions, CPH models result in\nsuboptimal performance, especially for non-linear, non-iid, and heavily\ncensored survival datasets. To overcome the challenges of existing federated\nsurvival analysis methods, we leverage the predictive accuracy of the deep\nlearning models and the power of pseudo values to propose a first-of-its-kind,\npseudo value-based deep learning model for federated survival analysis (FSA)\ncalled FedPseudo. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach of deriving pseudo\nvalues for survival probability in the FL settings that speeds up the\ncomputation of pseudo values. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that our pseudo valued-based FL framework achieves similar\nperformance as the best centrally trained deep survival analysis model.\nMoreover, our proposed FL approach obtains the best results for various\ncensoring settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 01:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Our simulations reveal that the workings of RPS\nare not only direct acceleration of the ISM by ICM ram pressure but also\nmixing-driven momentum transfer involving significant phase transition and\nradiative cooling. The hot ICM passes through the low-density channels of the\nporous, multiphase ISM, shreds the cool ISM, and creates mixing layers. The ICM\nmomentum is transferred through the mixing layers while populating the\nintermediate temperature gas and radiating thermal energy away. The mixed gas\nextends beyond galactic disks and forms stripped tails that cool back unless\nthe ICM fluxes are large enough to prevent cooling until they escape the\nsimulation domain. The mixing-driven momentum transfer predicts that the more\nICM mixes in, the faster the ISM moves, resulting in the anti-correlation of\noutflow velocity and gas metallicity of the stripped ISM.

Optical metasurfaces apart from\nbeing compact planar components can flexibly manipulate light with high\nefficiency in a broad wavelength range. Here, we propose and demonstrate for\nthe first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metasurface-assisted vortex\nfiber laser that can directly generate OAM beams with changeable topological\ncharges. Due to the designed broadband gap-surface plasmon metasurface,\ncombined with an intracavity tunable filter, the laser enables OAM beam with\ncenter wavelength continuously tunable from 1015 nm to 1075 nm, nearly twice of\nother vortex fiber lasers ever reported. The metasurface can be designed at\nwill to satisfy requirements for either low pump threshold or high slope\nefficiency of the laser. Furthermore, the cavity-metasurface configuration can\nbe extended to generate higher-order OAM beams or more complex structured beams\nin different wavelength regions, which greatly broadens the possibilities for\ndeveloping low-cost and high-quality structured-beam laser sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 02:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Such a system\narchitecture effectively separates the specific implementations of different\ndomains and improves the R&D efficiency. Once new object models and process\nprofiles are provided, the proposed system architecture requires no\nmodification of codes for changed learning objects and processes.

A key challenge in MSA is the\naccurate subject-specific prediction of multi-state model quantities such as\ntransition probability and state occupation probability in the presence of\ncensoring. Traditional multi-state methods such as Aalen-Johansen (AJ)\nestimators and Cox-based methods are respectively limited by Markov and\nproportional hazards assumptions and are infeasible for making subject-specific\npredictions.

Recently, Detection Transformer (DETR)-based HOI detectors have\nbecome popular due to their superior performance and efficient structure.\nHowever, these approaches typically adopt fixed HOI queries for all testing\nimages, which is vulnerable to the location change of objects in one specific\nimage. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose to enhance DETR's robustness by\nmining hard-positive queries, which are forced to make correct predictions\nusing partial visual cues. First, we explicitly compose hard-positive queries\naccording to the ground-truth (GT) position of labeled human-object pairs for\neach training image. Specifically, we shift the GT bounding boxes of each\nlabeled human-object pair so that the shifted boxes cover only a certain\nportion of the GT ones. We encode the coordinates of the shifted boxes for each\nlabeled human-object pair into an HOI query. Second, we implicitly construct\nanother set of hard-positive queries by masking the top scores in\ncross-attention maps of the decoder layers. The masked attention maps then only\ncover partial important cues for HOI predictions. Finally, an alternate\nstrategy is proposed that efficiently combines both types of hard queries. In\neach iteration, both DETR's learnable queries and one selected type of\nhard-positive queries are adopted for loss computation. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed approach can be widely applied to existing DETR-based\nHOI detectors.

A key\nunderlying reason for poor generalisation is the scarcity of emotion datasets,\nwhich is a significant roadblock to designing robust machine learning (ML)\nmodels. Recent works in SER focus on utilising multitask learning (MTL) methods\nto improve generalisation by learning shared representations. However, most of\nthese studies propose MTL solutions with the requirement of meta labels for\nauxiliary tasks, which limits the training of SER systems. This paper proposes\nan MTL framework (MTL-AUG) that learns generalised representations from\naugmented data. We utilise augmentation-type classification and unsupervised\nreconstruction as auxiliary tasks, which allow training SER systems on\naugmented data without requiring any meta labels for auxiliary tasks. The\nsemi-supervised nature of MTL-AUG allows for the exploitation of the abundant\nunlabelled data to further boost the performance of SER.

In this paper, we proposed a multi-camera view based proactive BS\nselection and beam switching that can predict the optimal BS of the user in the\nfuture frame and switch the corresponding beam pair. Specifically, we extract\nthe features of multi-camera view images and a small part of channel state\ninformation (CSI) in historical frames, and dynamically adjust the weight of\neach modality feature. Then we design a multi-task learning module to guide the\nnetwork to better understand the main task, thereby enhancing the accuracy and\nthe robustness of BS selection and beam switching.

CANF-VC represents a new attempt that leverages the\nconditional ANF to learn a video generative model for conditional inter-frame\ncoding. We choose ANF because it is a special type of generative model, which\nincludes variational autoencoder as a special case and is able to achieve\nbetter expressiveness. CANF-VC also extends the idea of conditional coding to\nmotion coding, forming a purely conditional coding framework. Extensive\nexperimental results on commonly used datasets confirm the superiority of\nCANF-VC to the state-of-the-art methods. The source code of CANF-VC is\navailable at https://github.com/NYCU-MAPL/CANF-VC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 04:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 03:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Here, humans and a DCNN\nperformed a challenging face-identity matching task that included identical\ntwins. Participants (N=87) viewed pairs of face images of three types:\nsame-identity, general imposter pairs (different identities from similar\ndemographic groups), and twin imposter pairs (identical twin siblings). The\ntask was to determine whether the pairs showed the same person or different\npeople. Identity comparisons were tested in three viewpoint-disparity\nconditions: frontal to frontal, frontal to 45-degree profile, and frontal to\n90-degree profile. Accuracy for discriminating matched-identity pairs from\ntwin-imposters and general imposters was assessed in each viewpoint-disparity\ncondition. Humans were more accurate for general-imposter pairs than\ntwin-imposter pairs, and accuracy declined with increased viewpoint disparity\nbetween the images in a pair. A DCNN trained for face identification (Ranjan et\nal., 2018) was tested on the same image pairs presented to humans. Machine\nperformance mirrored the pattern of human accuracy, but with performance at or\nabove all humans in all but one condition. Human and machine similarity scores\nwere compared across all image-pair types. This item-level analysis showed that\nhuman and machine similarity ratings correlated significantly in six of nine\nimage-pair types [range r=0.38 to r=0.63], suggesting general accord between\nthe perception of face similarity by humans and the DCNN. These findings also\ncontribute to our understanding of DCNN performance for discriminating\nhigh-resemblance faces, demonstrate that the DCNN performs at a level at or\nabove humans, and suggest a degree of parity between the features used by\nhumans and the DCNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 04:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

By utilizing the unique equivariance of\nspherical projections, we propose very fast color histogram generation for a\nlarge number of camera poses without explicitly rendering images for all\ncandidate poses. We accumulate the regional consistency of the panorama and\npoint cloud as 2D/3D score maps, and use them to weigh the input color values\nto further increase robustness. The weighted color distribution quickly finds\ngood initial poses and achieves stable convergence for gradient-based\noptimization.

However,\nthe teacher network is tightly coupled with the student network since the\nteacher is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student, which causes a\nperformance bottleneck. To address the coupling problem, we propose a Cycle\nSelf-Training (CST) framework for SSOD, which consists of two teachers T1 and\nT2, two students S1 and S2. Based on these networks, a cycle self-training\nmechanism is built, i.e.,\nS1${\\rightarrow}$T1${\\rightarrow}$S2${\\rightarrow}$T2${\\rightarrow}$S1. For\nS${\\rightarrow}$T, we also utilize the EMA weights of the students to update\nthe teachers. For T${\\rightarrow}$S, instead of providing supervision for its\nown student S1(S2) directly, the teacher T1(T2) generates pseudo-labels for the\nstudent S2(S1), which looses the coupling effect. Moreover, owing to the\nproperty of EMA, the teacher is most likely to accumulate the biases from the\nstudent and make the mistakes irreversible. To mitigate the problem, we also\npropose a distribution consistency reweighting strategy, where pseudo-labels\nare reweighted based on distribution consistency across the teachers T1 and T2.\nWith the strategy, the two students S2 and S1 can be trained robustly with\nnoisy pseudo labels to avoid confirmation biases.

The\nunderlying reasons are twofold. First, the scene difference is usually more\nnoticeable and easier to discriminate than the motion difference. Second, the\nclips sampled from the same video often share similar backgrounds but have\ndistinct motions. Simply regarding them as positive pairs will draw the model\nto the static background rather than the motion pattern. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper presents a novel dual contrastive formulation.\nConcretely, we decouple the input RGB video sequence into two complementary\nmodes, static scene and dynamic motion. Then, the original RGB features are\npulled closer to the static features and the aligned dynamic features,\nrespectively. In this way, the static scene and the dynamic motion are\nsimultaneously encoded into the compact RGB representation.

Existing privacy-preserving\napproaches for decentralized optimization achieve privacy preservation by\npatching decentralized optimization with information-technology privacy\nmechanisms such as differential privacy or homomorphic encryption, which either\nsacrifices optimization accuracy or incurs heavy computation/communication\noverhead. We propose an inherently privacy-preserving decentralized\noptimization algorithm by exploiting the robustness of decentralized\noptimization to uncertainties in optimization dynamics. More specifically, we\npresent a general decentralized optimization framework, based on which we show\nthat privacy can be enabled in decentralized optimization by adding randomness\nin optimization parameters. We further show that the added randomness has no\ninfluence on the accuracy of optimization, and prove that our inherently\nprivacy-preserving algorithm has $R$-linear convergence when the global\nobjective function is smooth and strongly convex.

To close these crucial gaps, we\npropose a novel vision transformer dubbed the eXplainable Vision Transformer\n(eX-ViT), an intrinsically interpretable transformer model that is able to\njointly discover robust interpretable features and perform the prediction.\nSpecifically, eX-ViT is composed of the Explainable Multi-Head Attention\n(E-MHA) module, the Attribute-guided Explainer (AttE) module and the\nself-supervised attribute-guided loss. The E-MHA tailors explainable attention\nweights that are able to learn semantically interpretable representations from\nlocal patches in terms of model decisions with noise robustness.

In addition, a self-supervised attribute-guided\nloss is developed for our eX-ViT, which aims at learning enhanced\nrepresentations through the attribute discriminability mechanism and attribute\ndiversity mechanism, to localize diverse and discriminative attributes and\ngenerate more robust explanations.

The vertex operations are realized by a group of\nDNN modules that collectively form the BGNN architecture.

The [Ce/Fe] vertical gradient has\nalso been estimated. We also report an increasing [Ce/Ca] vs [Ca/H] in the\ndisc, illustrating the late contribution of AGB with respect to SN II. Our\ncerium abundances in the disc, including the young massive population, are well\nreproduced by a new three-infall chemical evolution model. Among the halo\npopulation, the M 4 globular cluster is found to be enriched in cerium.\nMoreover, eleven stars with cerium abundances belonging to the Thamnos, Helmi\nStream and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus accreted systems were identified from\nchemo-dynamical diagnostics. We found that the Helmi Stream could be slightly\nunderabundant in cerium, compared to the two other systems. This work\nillustrates the high quality of the GSP-Spec chemical abundances, that\nsignificantly contributes to unveil the heavy elements evolution history of the\nMilky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 08:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 09:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The other is that no sufficient occluded human data\ncan be used for training a robust model. To address the obstacles, our key-idea\nis to employ non-occluded human data to learn a joint-level spatial-temporal\nmotion prior for occluded human with a self-supervised strategy. To further\nreduce the gap between synthetic and real occlusion data, we build the first 3D\noccluded motion dataset~(OcMotion), which can be used for both training and\ntesting. We encode the motions in 2D maps and synthesize occlusions on\nnon-occluded data for the self-supervised training. A spatial-temporal layer is\nthen designed to learn joint-level correlations. The learned prior reduces the\nambiguities of occlusions and is robust to diverse occlusion types, which is\nthen adopted to assist the occluded human motion capture.

Recently, deep learning has become the\nmainstream methodology for wound image segmentation. However, the\npre-processing of the wound image, such as the illumination correction, is\nrequired before the training phase as the performance can be greatly improved.\nThe correction procedure and the training of deep models are independent of\neach other, which leads to sub-optimal segmentation performance as the fixed\nillumination correction may not be suitable for all images. To address\naforementioned issues, an end-to-end dual-view segmentation approach was\nproposed in this paper, by incorporating a learn-able illumination correction\nmodule into the deep segmentation models. The parameters of the module can be\nlearned and updated during the training stage automatically, while the\ndual-view fusion can fully employ the features from both the raw images and the\nenhanced ones. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nframework, the extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets.\nThe encouraging results suggest that our framework can significantly improve\nthe segmentation performance, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 08:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

One of the main problems in this topic is to determine\nthe largest length of a q-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable code for\ngiven locality and minimum distance. Unlike classical MDS codes, the maximum\nlength of Singleton? Optimal locally repairable codes are very sensitive to\nminimum distance and locality. Thus, it is more challenging and complicated to\ninvestigate the maximum length of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes.\nIn literature, there has been already some research on this problem. However,\nmost of work is concerned with some specific parameter regime such as small\nminimum distance and locality, and rely on the constraint that (r + 1)|n and\nrecovery sets are disjoint, where r is locality and n is the code length. In\nthis paper we study the problem for large range of parameters including the\ncase where minimum distance is proportional to length.

In this work, we study the learnable\ncombination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified\narchitecture search approach. Our approach contains two key designs to achieve\nthe search for high-performance networks. First, we model the very different\nsearchable operators in a unified form, and thus enable the operators to be\ncharacterized with the same set of configuration parameters. In this way, the\noverall search space size is significantly reduced, and the total search cost\nbecomes affordable. Second, we propose context-aware downsampling modules\n(DSMs) to mitigate the gap between the different types of operators. Our\nproposed DSMs are able to better adapt features from different types of\noperators, which is important for identifying high-performance hybrid\narchitectures. Finally, we integrate configurable operators and DSMs into a\nunified search space and search with a Reinforcement Learning-based search\nalgorithm to fully explore the optimal combination of the operators.

The\nmethod is based on Lyapunov theory, and a shape function is defined to enlarge\nthe provable subset of a local Lyapunov function. In contrast with existing\nmethods with a shape function centered at the equilibrium point, the proposed\nmethod utilizes a shifted shape function (SSF) with its center shifted\niteratively towards the boundary of the newly obtained invariant subset to\nimprove ROA estimation.

Especially the nonsinglet contributions arise\ndue to the Block-Nordsieck violation in electroweak processes, which yields the\nSudakov logarithms and the rapidity divergence. They change the evolution of\nthe factorized parts considerably in the $N$-jettiness.

Most existing methods deploy a deterministic model to learn the\nretouching style from a specific expert, making it less flexible to meet\ndiverse subjective preferences. Besides, the intrinsic diversity of an expert\ndue to the targeted processing on different images is also deficiently\ndescribed. To circumvent such issues, we propose to learn diverse image\nretouching with normalizing flow-based architectures. Unlike current flow-based\nmethods which directly generate the output image, we argue that learning in a\nstyle domain could (i) disentangle the retouching styles from the image\ncontent, (ii) lead to a stable style presentation form, and (iii) avoid the\nspatial disharmony effects. For obtaining meaningful image tone style\nrepresentations, a joint-training pipeline is delicately designed, which is\ncomposed of a style encoder, a conditional RetouchNet, and the image tone style\nnormalizing flow (TSFlow) module. In particular, the style encoder predicts the\ntarget style representation of an input image, which serves as the conditional\ninformation in the RetouchNet for retouching, while the TSFlow maps the style\nrepresentation vector into a Gaussian distribution in the forward pass. After\ntraining, the TSFlow can generate diverse image tone style vectors by sampling\nfrom the Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on MIT-Adobe FiveK and\nPPR10K datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art methods and is effective in generating diverse results to\nsatisfy different human aesthetic preferences.

Recent research usually refers to dynamic\nnoise modeling with model output probabilities and loss values, and then\nseparates clean and noisy samples. These methods have gained notable success.\nHowever, unlike cherry-picked data, existing approaches often cannot perform\nwell when facing imbalanced datasets, a common scenario in the real world. We\nthoroughly investigate this phenomenon and point out two major issues that\nhinder the performance, i.e., \\emph{inter-class loss distribution discrepancy}\nand \\emph{misleading predictions due to uncertainty}. The first issue is that\nexisting methods often perform class-agnostic noise modeling. However, loss\ndistributions show a significant discrepancy among classes under class\nimbalance, and class-agnostic noise modeling can easily get confused with noisy\nsamples and samples in minority classes. The second issue refers to that models\nmay output misleading predictions due to epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric\nuncertainty, thus existing methods that rely solely on the output probabilities\nmay fail to distinguish confident samples. Inspired by our observations, we\npropose an Uncertainty-aware Label Correction framework~(ULC) to handle label\nnoise on imbalanced datasets. First, we perform epistemic uncertainty-aware\nclass-specific noise modeling to identify trustworthy clean samples and\nrefine/discard highly confident true/corrupted labels. Then, we introduce\naleatoric uncertainty in the subsequent learning process to prevent noise\naccumulation in the label noise modeling process. We conduct experiments on\nseveral synthetic and real-world datasets.

In\nthis study, we address this challenge by proposing an ensemble method called\nVertXNet, to automatically segment and label vertebrae in X-ray spinal images.\nVertXNet combines two state-of-the-art segmentation models, namely U-Net and\nMask R-CNN to improve vertebrae segmentation. A main feature of VertXNet is to\nalso infer vertebrae labels thanks to its Mask R-CNN component (trained to\ndetect 'reference' vertebrae) on a given spinal X-ray image. VertXNet was\nevaluated on an in-house dataset of lateral cervical and lumbar X-ray imaging\nfor ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Our results show that VertXNet can\naccurately label spinal X-rays (mean Dice of 0.9). It can be used to circumvent\nthe lack of annotated vertebrae without requiring human expert review. This\nstep is crucial to investigate clinical associations by solving the lack of\nsegmentation, a common bottleneck for most computational imaging projects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 11:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

The accuracy of AlphaFold2, a frontier end-to-end\nstructure prediction system, is already close to that of the experimental\ndetermination techniques. Due to the complex model architecture and large\nmemory consumption, it requires lots of computational resources and time to\nimplement the training and inference of AlphaFold2 from scratch. The cost of\nrunning the original AlphaFold2 is expensive for most individuals and\ninstitutions. Therefore, reducing this cost could accelerate the development of\nlife science. We implement AlphaFold2 using PaddlePaddle, namely HelixFold, to\nimprove training and inference speed and reduce memory consumption. The\nperformance is improved by operator fusion, tensor fusion, and hybrid\nparallelism computation, while the memory is optimized through Recompute,\nBFloat16, and memory read/write in-place. Compared with the original AlphaFold2\n(implemented with Jax) and OpenFold (implemented with PyTorch), HelixFold needs\nonly 7.5 days to complete the full end-to-end training and only 5.3 days when\nusing hybrid parallelism, while both AlphaFold2 and OpenFold take about 11\ndays. HelixFold saves 1x training time. We verified that HelixFold's accuracy\ncould be on par with AlphaFold2 on the CASP14 and CAMEO datasets.

In this work, using a recently\ndeveloped node-splitting technique which introduces internal losses and noise\ninto repeater devices, we present achievable end-to-end rates for\nnoisy-repeater quantum networks. These are obtained by extending the coherent\nand reverse coherent information (single channel capacity lower bounds) into\nend-to-end capacity lower bounds, both in the context of single-path and\nmulti-path routing. These achievable rates are completely general, and apply to\nnetworks composed of arbitrary channels arranged in general topologies.

As a result, we develop\ntools which provide tight performance bounds for quantum networks constituent\nof channels whose capacities are not exactly known, and reveal critical network\nproperties which are necessary for high-rate quantum communications.

This indicates\nthat the radio halo emission is produced by primary re-acceleration mechanisms.\nFinally, we derive a radio Mach number of M_R= 4.6$\\pm$0.9 for the relic shock\nregion, which is higher than the Mach number inferred by earlier analyses based\non X-ray data. Discrepancies between radio and X-ray Mach numbers have been\nobserved for multiple systems, with studies suggesting that this is due to\nvarious factors, including relic orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 12:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

In this paper, we analyze the modality asynchrony\nand undifferentiated instances phenomena of the multiple instance learning\n(MIL) procedure, and further investigate its negative impact on\nweakly-supervised audio-visual learning. To address these issues, we propose a\nmodality-aware contrastive instance learning with self-distillation (MACIL-SD)\nstrategy.

Then\naudio and visual violent semi-bag representations are assembled as positive\npairs, and violent semi-bags are combined with background and normal instances\nin the opposite modality as contrastive negative pairs. Furthermore, a\nself-distillation module is applied to transfer unimodal visual knowledge to\nthe audio-visual model, which alleviates noises and closes the semantic gap\nbetween unimodal and multimodal features.

Its first\npart considers a quartic tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry and long-range\npropagator. The existence of a non-perturbative fixed point in any $d$ at large\n$N$ is established. We found four lines of fixed points parametrized by the\nso-called tetrahedral coupling. One of them is infrared attractive, strongly\ninteracting and gives rise to a new kind of CFT, called melonic CFTs which are\nthen studied in more details. We first compute dimensions of bilinears and OPE\ncoefficients at the fixed point which are consistent with a unitary CFT at\nlarge $N$. We then compute $1/N$ corrections. At next-to-leading order, the\nline of fixed points collapses to one fixed point. However, the corrections are\ncomplex and unitarity is broken at NLO. Finally, we show that this model\nrespects the $F$-theorem. The next part of the thesis investigates sextic\ntensor field theories in rank $3$ and $5$. In rank $3$, we found two IR stable\nreal fixed points in short range and a line of IR stable real fixed points in\nlong range. Surprisingly, the only fixed point in rank $5$ is the Gaussian one.\nFor the rank $3$ model, in the short-range case, we still find two IR stable\nfixed points at NLO. However, in the long-range case, the corrections to the\nfixed points are non-perturbative and hence unreliable: we found no precursor\nof the large $N$ fixed point. The last part of the thesis investigates the\nclass of model exhibiting a melonic large $N$ limit. We prove that models with\ntensors in an irreducible representation of $O(N)$ or $Sp(N)$ in rank $5$\nindeed admit a large $N$ limit. This generalization relies on recursive bounds\nderived from a detailed combinatorial analysis of Feynman graphs involved in\nthe perturbative expansion of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 13:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

However,\nthere is still limited work on testing DL libraries, which serve as the\nfoundations for building, training, and running DL models. Prior work on\nfuzzing DL libraries can only generate tests for APIs which have been invoked\nby documentation examples, developer tests, or DL models, leaving a large\nnumber of APIs untested. In this paper, we propose DeepREL, the first approach\nto automatically inferring relational APIs for more effective DL library\nfuzzing. Our basic hypothesis is that for a DL library under test, there may\nexist a number of APIs sharing similar input parameters and outputs; in this\nway, we can easily \"borrow\" test inputs from invoked APIs to test other\nrelational APIs. Furthermore, we formalize the notion of value equivalence and\nstatus equivalence for relational APIs to serve as the oracle for effective bug\nfinding. We have implemented DeepREL as a fully automated end-to-end relational\nAPI inference and fuzzing technique for DL libraries, which 1) automatically\ninfers potential API relations based on API syntactic or semantic information,\n2) synthesizes concrete test programs for invoking relational APIs, 3)\nvalidates the inferred relational APIs via representative test inputs, and\nfinally 4) performs fuzzing on the verified relational APIs to find potential\ninconsistencies. Our evaluation on two of the most popular DL libraries,\nPyTorch and TensorFlow, demonstrates that DeepREL can cover 157% more APIs than\nstate-of-the-art FreeFuzz. To date, DeepREL has detected 162 bugs in total,\nwith 106 already confirmed by the developers as previously unknown bugs.\nSurprisingly, DeepREL has detected 13.5% of the high-priority bugs for the\nentire PyTorch issue-tracking system in a three-month period.

In MT, the sparse pseudo labels, offered by the final\npredictions of the teacher (e.g., after Non Maximum Suppression (NMS)\npost-processing), are adopted for the dense supervision for the student via\nhand-crafted label assignment. However, the sparse-to-dense paradigm\ncomplicates the pipeline of SSOD, and simultaneously neglects the powerful\ndirect, dense teacher supervision. In this paper, we attempt to directly\nleverage the dense guidance of teacher to supervise student training, i.e., the\ndense-to-dense paradigm. Specifically, we propose the Inverse NMS Clustering\n(INC) and Rank Matching (RM) to instantiate the dense supervision, without the\nwidely used, conventional sparse pseudo labels. INC leads the student to group\ncandidate boxes into clusters in NMS as the teacher does, which is implemented\nby learning grouping information revealed in NMS procedure of the teacher.\nAfter obtaining the same grouping scheme as the teacher via INC, the student\nfurther imitates the rank distribution of the teacher over clustered candidates\nthrough Rank Matching. With the proposed INC and RM, we integrate Dense Teacher\nGuidance into Semi-Supervised Object Detection (termed DTG-SSOD), successfully\nabandoning sparse pseudo labels and enabling more informative learning on\nunlabeled data.

However, for highly heterogeneous problems,\nwhere the coefficient function is varying rapidly on several possibly\nnon-separated scales, the condition number of the preconditioned system\ngenerally depends on the contrast of the coefficient function leading to a\ndeterioration of convergence. Enhancing the methods by coarse spaces\nconstructed from suitable local eigenvalue problems, also denoted as adaptive\nor spectral coarse spaces, restores robust, contrast-independent convergence.\nHowever, these eigenvalue problems typically rely on non-algebraic information,\nsuch that the adaptive coarse spaces cannot be constructed from the fully\nassembled system matrix. In this paper, a novel algebraic adaptive coarse\nspace, which relies on the a-orthogonal decomposition of (local) finite element\n(FE) spaces into functions that solve the partial differential equation (PDE)\nwith some trace and FE functions that are zero on the boundary, is proposed. In\nparticular, the basis is constructed from eigenmodes of two types of local\neigenvalue problems associated with the edges of the domain decomposition. To\napproximate functions that solve the PDE locally, we employ a transfer\neigenvalue problem, which has originally been proposed for the construction of\noptimal local approximation spaces for multiscale methods. In addition, we make\nuse of a Dirichlet eigenvalue problem that is a slight modification of the\nNeumann eigenvalue problem used in the adaptive generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund\n(AGDSW) coarse space. Both eigenvalue problems rely solely on local Dirichlet\nmatrices, which can be extracted from the fully assembled system matrix.

To solve this complex optimization problem, two popular video\ncoding frameworks have been developed: block-based hybrid video coding and\nend-to-end learned video coding. If we rethink video coding from the\nperspective of optimization, we find that the existing two frameworks represent\ntwo directions of optimization solutions. Block-based hybrid coding represents\nthe discrete optimization solution because those irrelevant coding modes are\ndiscrete in mathematics. It searches for the best one among multiple starting\npoints (i.e. modes). However, the search is not efficient enough. On the other\nhand, end-to-end learned coding represents the continuous optimization solution\nbecause the gradient descent is based on a continuous function. It optimizes a\ngroup of model parameters efficiently by the numerical algorithm. However,\nlimited by only one starting point, it is easy to fall into the local optimum.\nTo better solve the optimization problem, we propose to regard video coding as\na hybrid of the discrete and continuous optimization problem, and use both\nsearch and numerical algorithm to solve it. Our idea is to provide multiple\ndiscrete starting points in the global space and optimize the local optimum\naround each point by numerical algorithm efficiently. Finally, we search for\nthe global optimum among those local optimums. Guided by the hybrid\noptimization idea, we design a hybrid optimization video coding framework,\nwhich is built on continuous deep networks entirely and also contains some\ndiscrete modes.

For these\nreasons, deep learning methodologies tend to overfit, that is, arrive at latent\nrepresentations with poor generalisation performance on the final regression\ntask. To overcome this, in this work, we introduce two complementary\ncontributions. First, we introduce a novel relational loss for multilabel\nregression and ordinal problems that regularises learning and leads to better\ngeneralisation. The proposed loss uses label vector inter-relational\ninformation to learn better latent representations by aligning batch label\ndistances to the distances in the latent feature space. Second, we utilise a\ntwo-stage attention architecture that estimates a target for each clip by using\nfeatures from the neighbouring clips as temporal context.

Recent transformer-based neural\nnetworks have demonstrated their powerful capability of modeling\nspatio-temporal correlations for the VIS task. Relying on video- or clip-level\ninput, they suffer from high latency and computational cost. We propose a\nrobust context fusion network to tackle VIS in an online fashion, which\npredicts instance segmentation frame-by-frame with a few preceding frames. To\nacquire the precise and temporal-consistent prediction for each frame\nefficiently, the key idea is to fuse effective and compact context from\nreference frames into the target frame. Considering the different effects of\nreference and target frames on the target prediction, we first summarize\ncontextual features through importance-aware compression. A transformer encoder\nis adopted to fuse the compressed context. Then, we leverage an\norder-preserving instance embedding to convey the identity-aware information\nand correspond the identities to predicted instance masks. We demonstrate that\nour robust fusion network achieves the best performance among existing online\nVIS methods and is even better than previously published clip-level methods on\nthe Youtube-VIS 2019 and 2021 benchmarks.

This study numerically investigates the breaking of internal\nwaves and the following turbulence generation resulting from the AAI. In our\nsimulation, we periodically distort the calculation domain following the\nstreamlines of an elliptic vortex and integrate the equations of motion using a\nFourier spectral method. This technique enables us to exclude the overall\nstructure of the large-scale vortex from the computation and concentrate on\nresolving the small-scale waves and turbulence. From a series of experiments,\nwe identify two different scenarios of wave breaking conditioned on the\nmagnitude of the instability growth rate scaled by the buoyancy frequency,\n$\\lambda/N$. First, when $\\lambda/N\\gtrsim0.008$, the primary wave amplitude\nexcited by AAI quickly goes far beyond the overturning threshold and directly\nbreaks. The resulting state is thus strongly nonlinear turbulence. Second, if\n$\\lambda/N\\lesssim0.008$, weak wave-wave interactions begin to redistribute\nenergy across frequency space before the primary wave reaches a breaking limit.\nThen, after a sufficiently long time, the system approaches a Garrett-Munk-like\nstationary spectrum, in which wave breaking occurs at finer vertical scales.\nThroughout the experimental conditions, the growth and decay time scales of the\nprimary wave energy are well correlated. However, since the primary wave\namplitude reaches a prescribed limit in one scenario but not in the other, the\nenergy dissipation rates exhibit two types of scaling properties.

An important component for such experiments is a\nheat valve, i.e. a device which allows one to control the heat power flowing\nthrough the system. Here we theoretically study the heat valve based on a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) coupled to two heat baths\nvia two resonators. The heat current in such system can be tuned by magnetic\nflux. We investigate how does the heat current modulation depend on the\ncoupling strength g between the SQUID and the resonators. In the weak coupling\nregime the heat current modulation grows as g2, but, surprisingly, at the\nintermediate coupling it can be strongly suppressed. This effect is linked to\nthe resonant nature of the heat transport at weak coupling, where the heat\ncurrent dependence on the magnetic flux is a periodic set of narrow peaks. At\nthe intermediate coupling, the peaks become broader and overlap, thus reducing\nthe heat modulation. At very strong coupling the heat modulation grows again\nand finally saturates at a constant value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 15:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

If the two processes are\nseparated, they cannot optimize the same objective function, ultimately\nproviding sub-optimal results. In this paper, a unified approach is presented\nwhere dynamic programming is the underlying optimization technique. Its\nflexibility allows accommodating arbitrary constraints and objective functions,\nthus providing a generic framework for optimal planning of real systems. To\ndemonstrate its applicability to a real world scenario, the framework is\ninstantiated for time-optimality. Compared to numerical solvers, the proposed\nmethodology provides visibility of the underlying resolution process, allowing\nfor further analyses beyond the computation of the optimal trajectory. The\neffectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on a real 7-degrees-of-freedom\nserial chain. The issues associated with the execution of optimal trajectories\non a real controller are also discussed and addressed.

A key limitation of\nthese congestion signals is that they are either late in feedback or they incur\nsignificant overheads. An ideal congestion control must discover any available\nbandwidth in the network, detect congestion as soon as link utilization\napproaches full capacity, and react timely to avoid queuing and packet drops,\nwithout significant overheads. To this end, this work proposes Scout service\nthat leverages priority queues to infer bandwidth availability and link\nbusyness at the host. The key observation here is that as the high priority\nqueue (HPQ) gets busier, the low priority queue (LPQ) is served less.\nTherefore, the state of the link can be observed from the LPQ and any\ncongestion can be detected several RTTs earlier than observing the HPQ.

It is a classical result that for suitable windows any function can\nin principle be uniquely recovered up to a global phase factor from its\nspectrogram. However, for most practical applications only discrete samples -\ntypically from a lattice - of the spectrogram are available. This raises the\nquestion of whether lattice samples of the spectrogram contain sufficient\ninformation to determine a function $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ up to a global\nphase factor. In recent work this question was answered in the negative for the\ncase $d=1$, but the higher dimensional case has remained open. In the present\npaper, we show that the same non-identifiability result holds in arbitrary\ndimensions. Precisely, given any dimension $d$, any window function $g$ and any\n(symplectic or separable) lattice $\\mathcal{L} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ we\nconstruct pairs of functions $f,h\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ that do not agree up to\na global phase factor, but whose spectrograms agree on $\\mathcal{L}$. Our\ntechniques are sufficiently flexible to produce counterexamples to unique\nrecoverability under even more stringent assumptions: for example, if the\nwindow function is real-valued, the functions $f,h$ can even be chosen to\nsatisfy $|f|=|h|$. Our results thus reveal the non-existence of a critical\nsampling density in the absence of phase information, a property which is in\nstark contrast to uniqueness results in time-frequency analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 15:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Crosstalk noise has been\nrecognized as one of several major types of noises in superconducting Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Crosstalk arises from the concurrent\nexecution of two-qubit gates on nearby qubits, such as \\texttt{CX}. It might\nsignificantly raise the error rate of gates in comparison to running them\nindividually. Crosstalk can be mitigated through scheduling or hardware machine\ntuning.

Adversarial examples are\nsimilar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial\ntraining is a simple and effective defense method to improve the robustness of\nCNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and\nadversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates\nsimilarities and differences between normally trained CNNs (NT-CNNs) and\nadversarially trained CNNs (AT-CNNs) in information extraction from the mutual\ninformation perspective. We show that 1) whether NT-CNNs or AT-CNNs, for\noriginal and adversarial examples, the trends towards mutual information are\nalmost similar throughout training; 2) compared with normal training,\nadversarial training is more difficult and the amount of information that\nAT-CNNs extract from the input is less; 3) the CNNs trained with different\nmethods have different preferences for certain types of information; NT-CNNs\ntend to extract texture-based information from the input, while AT-CNNs prefer\nto shape-based information. The reason why adversarial examples mislead CNNs\nmay be that they contain more texture-based information about other classes.\nFurthermore, we also analyze the mutual information estimators used in this\nwork and find that they outline the geometric properties of the middle layer's\noutput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 13:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 13:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

This can then be used for further analyses, e.g. with\nstatistical methods. However, reducing an aspect of a complex image to a\nsingle, meaningful number is challenging. Thus, methods for calculating retinal\ntraits tend to be complex, multi-step pipelines that can only be applied to\nhigh quality images. This means that researchers often have to discard\nsubstantial portions of the available data. We hypothesise that such pipelines\ncan be approximated with a single, simpler step that can be made robust to\ncommon quality issues. We propose Deep Approximation of Retinal Traits (DART)\nwhere a deep neural network is used predict the output of an existing pipeline\non high quality images from synthetically degraded versions of these images. We\ndemonstrate DART on retinal Fractal Dimension (FD) calculated by VAMPIRE, using\nretinal images from UK Biobank that previous work identified as high quality.\nOur method shows very high agreement with FD VAMPIRE on unseen test images\n(Pearson r=0.9572). Even when those images are severely degraded, DART can\nstill recover an FD estimate that shows good agreement with FD VAMPIRE obtained\nfrom the original images (Pearson r=0.8817). This suggests that our method\ncould enable researchers to discard fewer images in the future. Our method can\ncompute FD for over 1,000img/s using a single GPU.

The respective machine learning\nmethods are based on neurological concepts so that they can systematically\nderive knowledge from data and store it. One type of machine learning\nalgorithms that can be categorized as \"deep learning\" model is referred to as\nDeep Neural Networks (DNNs). DNNs consist of multiple artificial neurons\narranged in layers that are trained by using the backpropagation algorithm.\nThese deep learning methods exhibit amazing capabilities for inferring and\nstoring complex knowledge from high-dimensional data. However, DNNs are\naffected by a problem that prevents new knowledge from being added to an\nexisting base. The ability to continuously accumulate knowledge is an important\nfactor that contributed to evolution and is therefore a prerequisite for the\ndevelopment of strong AIs.

This stochastic framework arises from a decomposition of\nthe Lagrangian velocity into a smooth-in-time component and a highly\noscillating noise term. One important characteristic of this random model is\nthat it conserves the total energy of the resolved flow for any realization.\nSuch an energy-preserving representation is successfully implemented in a well\nestablished multi-layered quasi-geostrophic dynamical core. The empirical\nspatial correlation of the unresolved noise is calibrated from the\neddy-resolving simulation data. In particular, a stationary correction drift\ncan be introduced in the noise through Girsanov transformation. This non\nintuitive term appears to be important in reproducing on a coarse mesh the\neastwards jet of the wind-driven double-gyre circulation.

The NeuroCognitive Performance Test\n(NCPT) is a web-based, self-directed, modular battery intended for repeated\nassessments of multiple cognitive domains. Our objective was to examine its\nrelationship with the ADAS-Cog and MMSE as well as with established\npaper-pencil tests of cognition and daily functioning in MCI. We used Spearman\ncorrelations, regressions and principal components analysis followed by a\nfactor analysis (varimax rotated) to examine our objectives. In MCI subjects,\nthe NCPT composite is significantly correlated with both a composite measure of\nestablished tests (r=0.78, p<0.0001) as well as with the ADAS-Cog (r=0.55,\np<0.0001). Both NCPT and paper-pencil test batteries had a similar factor\nstructure that included a large g component with a high eigenvalue. The\ncorrelation for the analogous tests (e.g. Trails A and B, learning memory\ntests) were significant (p<0.0001). Further, both the NCPT and established\ntests significantly (p< 0.01) predicted the University of California San Diego\nPerformance-Based Skills Assessment and Functional Activities Questionnaire,\nmeasures of daily functioning. The NCPT, a web-based, self-directed,\ncomputerized test, shows high concurrent validity with established tests and\nhence offers promise for use as a research or clinical tool in MCI. Despite\nlimitations such as a relatively small sample, absence of control group and\ncross-sectional nature, these findings are consistent with the growing\nliterature on the promise of self-directed, web-based cognitive assessments for\nMCI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 17:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

These datasets were initially mainly limited to exchange\ndata, namely price, capitalization and volume. Their coverage has now\nconsiderably expanded to include, for example, macroeconomic data, supply and\ndemand of commodities, balance sheet data and more recently extra-financial\ndata such as ESG scores. This broadening of the factors retained as influential\nconstitutes a serious challenge for statistical modeling. Indeed, the\ninstability of the correlations between these factors makes it practically\nimpossible to identify the joint laws needed to construct scenarios.\nFortunately, spectacular advances in Deep Learning field in recent years have\ngiven rise to GANs. GANs are a type of generative machine learning models that\nproduce new data samples with the same characteristics as a training data\ndistribution in an unsupervised way, avoiding data assumptions and human\ninduced biases. In this work, we are exploring the use of GANs for synthetic\nfinancial scenarios generation. This pilot study is the result of a\ncollaboration between Fujitsu and Advestis and it will be followed by a\nthorough exploration of the use cases that can benefit from the proposed\nsolution. We propose a GANs-based algorithm that allows the replication of\nmultivariate data representing several properties (including, but not limited\nto, price, market capitalization, ESG score, controversy score,. . .) of a set\nof stocks. This approach differs from examples in the financial literature,\nwhich are mainly focused on the reproduction of temporal asset price scenarios.\nWe also propose several metrics to evaluate the quality of the data generated\nby the GANs. This approach is well fit for the generation of scenarios, the\ntime direction simply arising as a subsequent (eventually conditioned)\ngeneration of data points drawn from the learned distribution. Our method will\nallow to simulate high dimensional scenarios (compared to $\\lesssim 10$\nfeatures currently employed in most recent use cases) where network complexity\nis reduced thanks to a wisely performed feature engineering and selection.\nComplete results will be presented in a forthcoming study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 09:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

First, a non-resolved structure identifying method\nbased on level-set field is employed to detect the tiny fragments which make\nthe geometry `dirty' under a given resolutions. Second, a re-distance algorithm\nis proposed to remove the tiny fragments and reconstruct clean and smooth\ngeometries.

Based on these data, can we gain insight into the innovation dynamics of\nthe industry, including the potential for industrial transformation? Areas\nCovered: Using Premarket Notifications (PMNs) and Approvals (PMAs) data, it is\nshown that from 1976 to 2020 the total composite (PMN + PMA) metric follows a\nsingle secular period: 20.5 years (applications peak-to-peak: 1992-2012;\ntrough: 2002) and 26.5 years (registrations peak to peak: 1992 to 2019; trough:\n2003), with a peak to trough relative percentage difference of 24% and 28%,\nrespectively. Importantly, PMNs and PMAs independently present as an inverse\nstructure. Expert Opinion: The evidence suggests: MD innovation is driven by a\nsingular secular Kutnets-like cyclic phenomenon (independent of economic\ncrises) derived from a fundamental shift from simple (PMNs) to complex (PMAs)\nMDs. Portentously, while the COVID-19 crisis may not affect the overriding\ndynamic, the anticipated yet significant (~25%) MD innovation drop may be\npotentially attenuated with attentive measures by MD stakeholders. Limitations\nof this approach and further thoughts complete this perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 18:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 20:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-28"}
