The dominant method -- that\nis contrastive learning, is generally based on instance discrimination tasks,\ni.e., individual samples are treated as independent categories. However,\npresuming all the samples are different contradicts the natural grouping of\nsimilar samples in common visual datasets, e.g., multiple views of the same\ndog. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes an adaptive method that introduces\nsoft inter-sample relations, namely Adaptive Soft Contrastive Learning (ASCL).\nMore specifically, ASCL transforms the original instance discrimination task\ninto a multi-instance soft discrimination task, and adaptively introduces\ninter-sample relations. As an effective and concise plug-in module for existing\nself-supervised learning frameworks, ASCL achieves the best performance on\nseveral benchmarks in terms of both performance and efficiency.

It aims to approximate the posterior, reducing\ncomputation costs but potentially compromising its statistical accuracy. In\nthis work, we study this statistical and computational trade-off in variational\ninference via a case study in inferential model selection. Focusing on Gaussian\ninferential models (a.k.a. variational approximating families) with diagonal\nplus low-rank precision matrices, we initiate a theoretical study of the\ntrade-offs in two aspects, Bayesian posterior inference error and frequentist\nuncertainty quantification error. From the Bayesian posterior inference\nperspective, we characterize the error of the variational posterior relative to\nthe exact posterior. We prove that, given a fixed computation budget, a\nlower-rank inferential model produces variational posteriors with a higher\nstatistical approximation error, but a lower computational error; it reduces\nvariances in stochastic optimization and, in turn, accelerates convergence.\nFrom the frequentist uncertainty quantification perspective, we consider the\nprecision matrix of the variational posterior as an uncertainty estimate. We\nfind that, relative to the true asymptotic precision, the variational\napproximation suffers from an additional statistical error originating from the\nsampling uncertainty of the data. Moreover, this statistical error becomes the\ndominant factor as the computation budget increases. As a consequence, for\nsmall datasets, the inferential model need not be full-rank to achieve optimal\nestimation error.

Most SOTAs adopt distance clustering, which is typically\neffective but does not perform well in segmenting adjacent objects with the\nsame semantic label (especially when they share neighboring points). Due to the\nuneven distribution of offset points, these existing methods can hardly cluster\nall instance points. To this end, we design a novel divide-and-conquer strategy\nnamed PBNet that binarizes each point and clusters them separately to segment\ninstances. Our binary clustering divides offset instance points into two\ncategories: high and low density points (HPs vs. LPs). Adjacent objects can be\nclearly separated by removing LPs, and then be completed and refined by\nassigning LPs via a neighbor voting method. To suppress potential\nover-segmentation, we propose to construct local scenes with the weight mask\nfor each instance.

Several\napproximate methods have been introduced for this purpose. We study the\naccuracy of the multiblob method for solving the Stokes mobility problem in\nfree space, where the 3D geometry of a particle surface is discretised with\nspherical blobs and the pair-wise interaction between blobs is described by the\nRPY-tensor. The paper aims to investigate and improve on the magnitude of the\nerror in the solution velocities of the Stokes mobility problem using a\ncombination of two different techniques: an optimally chosen grid of blobs and\na pair-correction inspired by Stokesian dynamics. Optimisation strategies to\ndetermine a grid with a certain number of blobs are presented with the aim of\nmatching the hydrodynamic response of a single accurately described ideal\nparticle, alone in the fluid. Small errors in this self-interaction are\nessential as they determine the basic error level in a system of well-separated\nparticles. With a good match, reasonable accuracy can be obtained even with\ncoarse blob-resolutions of the particle surfaces. The error in the\nself-interaction is however sensitive to the exact choice of grid parameters\nand simply hand-picking a suitable blob geometry can lead to errors several\norders of magnitude larger in size. The pair-correction is local and cheap to\napply, and reduces on the error for more closely interacting particles. Two\ndifferent types of geometries are considered: spheres and axisymmetric rods\nwith smooth caps. The error in solutions to mobility problems is quantified for\nparticles of varying inter-particle distances for systems containing a few\nparticles, comparing to an accurate solution based on a second kind\nBIE-formulation where the quadrature error is controlled by employing\nquadrature by expansion (QBX).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 17:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

By decomposing the error estimates into\ncontributions from individual elements, it is possible to formulate adaptation\nmethods, which modify the mesh with the objective of minimising the resulting\nQoI error. However, the standard error estimate formulation involves the true\nadjoint solution, which is unknown in practice. As such, it is common practice\nto approximate it with an 'enriched' approximation (e.g. in a higher order\nspace or on a refined mesh). Doing so generally results in a significant\nincrease in computational cost, which can be a bottleneck compromising the\ncompetitiveness of (goal-oriented) adaptive simulations. The central idea of\nthis paper is to develop a \"data-driven\" goal-oriented mesh adaptation approach\nthrough the selective replacement of the expensive error estimation step with\nan appropriately configured and trained neural network. In doing so, the error\nestimator may be obtained without even constructing the enriched spaces.

Because the vev of the flavon\nchanges during the electroweak phase transition, the effective Yukawa couplings\nof the fermions have different values before and after the phase transition,\nthus allowing for successful dark matter genesis. Additionally, the hierarchy\nin the flavour structure is alleviated and the origin of the light neutrino\nmasses are explained by the interplay of the seesaw and Froggatt-Nielsen\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 18:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

While radiative feedback\nhas been extensively studied, the role of mechanical feedback has received\ncomparatively less scrutiny to date. Here we use high-resolution parsec-scale\nhydrodynamical simulations to study jet propagation and its effect on BH\naccretion onto 100 ${\\rm M_\\odot}$ BHs in the dense, low-metallicity gas\nexpected in early protogalaxies. As the jet propagates, it shocks the\nsurrounding gas and forms a jet cocoon. The cocoon consists of a\nrapidly-cooling cold phase at the interface with the background gas and an\nover-pressured subsonic phase of reverse shock-heated gas filling the cocoon\ninterior. We systematically vary the background gas density and temperature, BH\nfeedback efficiency, and the jet model. We found that the jet cocoon width\nroughly follows a scaling derived by assuming momentum conservation in the jet\npropagation direction, and energy conservation in the lateral directions.\nDepending on the assumed gas and jet properties, the cocoon either stays\nelongated out to a large radius or isotropizes before reaching the Bondi\nradius, forming a nearly spherical bubble. Lower jet velocities and higher\nbackground gas densities result in self-regulation to higher momentum fluxes\nand elongated cocoons. In all cases, the outward momentum flux of the cocoon\nbalances the inward momentum flux of the inflowing gas near the Bondi radius,\nwhich ultimately regulates BH accretion. The larger the distance the jet cocoon\nreaches, the longer the variability timescale of the BH accretion rate.\nOverall, the average accretion rate always remains below the Bondi rate, and\nexceeds the Eddington rate only if the ambient medium is dense and cold, and/or\nthe jet is weak. We derive the combination of jet and ambient gas parameters\nyielding super-Eddington growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 18:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Each cloud\nsector is made of a cloud field, its anticommuting partner, a cloud function\nand a cloud Faddeev-Popov determinant. Every field insertion in a correlation\nfunction can be made gauge invariant by dressing it with an independent cloud.\nThe cloud sectors are rendered purely virtual, to ensure that they do not\npropagate extra degrees of freedom. The off-shell, diagrammatic version of the\noptical theorem holds, and the extended theory is unitary. The one-loop\ntwo-point functions of the dressed quarks and gluons are calculated. Their\nabsorptive parts are gauge independent, cloud independent and positive (while\nthey are cloud dependent and possibly negative, if the clouds are defined by\nmeans of the Feynman prescription). A gauge/cloud duality simplifies the\ncomputations and shows that the gauge choice is just a particular cloud.\nRenormalizability is proved to all orders by means of an extended\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism and its Zinn-Justin master equations.

Quantum algorithms for computing energy derivatives have been proposed,\nbut only limited work has been done to address the specific challenges that\narise in this context, where calculations are more complicated and involve more\nstringent requirements on accuracy compared to single-point energy\ncalculations. In this work, we introduce a technique to improve the performance\nof variational quantum circuits calculating energy derivatives. The method,\nwhich we refer to as tailgating, is an adaptive procedure that selects gates\nbased on their gradient with respect to the expectation value of Hamiltonian\nderivatives. These gates are then added at the end of a quantum circuit\noriginally designed to calculate ground- or excited-state energies. A\ndistinguishing feature of this approach is that the appended gates do not need\nto be optimized: their parameters can be set to zero and varied only for the\npurpose of computing energy derivatives, via calculating derivatives with\nrespect to circuit parameters. We support the validity of this method by\nestablishing sufficient conditions for a circuit to compute accurate energy\ngradients. This is achieved through a connection between energy derivatives and\neigenstates of Taylor approximations of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the\nadvantages of the tailgating approach by performing simulations calculating the\nvibrational modes of beryllium hydride and water: quantities that depend on\nsecond-order energy derivatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 18:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Our work covers the stellar mass range $10^6 \\lesssim\nM_\\star/{\\rm M_\\odot} \\lesssim 10^8$ at redshifts $6 < z < 10$. Adopting an\nunresolved, cloud-scale escape fraction parameter of unity, the halo escape\nfraction $f_{\\rm esc}$ increases with mass from $\\sim 0.3$ at $M_\\star =\n10^6$M$_\\odot$ to $\\sim 0.6$ at $M_\\star = 10^{7.5}$M$_\\odot$, after which we\nfind hints of a turnover and decreasing escape fractions for even more massive\ngalaxies.

In addition, $f_{\\rm esc}$ has\nsignificant scatter at fixed mass, driven by diversity in the ionizing photon\nrate together with a complex relationship between (stellar) source positions\nand the underling density distribution. The global emissivity is consistent\nwith observations for reasonable cloud-scale absorption values, and halos with\na stellar mass $\\lesssim 10^{7.5}$M$_\\odot$ contribute the majority of ionizing\nphotons at all redshifts.

Current practices of sensing urban road networks mainly depend on\ninductive loop sensors, roadside cameras, and crowdsourcing data from massive\nurban travelers (e.g., Google Map). These data have the drawbacks of high\ncosts, limited coverage, or low reliability due to insufficient user\npenetration. This study investigates an innovative approach of drive-by\nsensing, which leverages large-scale ridesourcing vehicles (RVs) to monitor and\ninfer the states of urban road networks. With RV traversing over road networks,\nwe examine the RV fleet sensing performance based on the unique number of road\nsegments explicitly visited, the sensing reliability as a result of repeated\nvisits, and the information that can be implicitly inferred given explicit data\nand road network topology. We propose an optimal rerouting model to\nsimultaneously maximize the sensing coverage and sensing reliability, which can\nbe efficiently solved using a heuristic algorithm to guide the cruising\ntrajectory of unoccupied RVs sequentially. To validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, comprehensive experiments and sensitivity analyses are\nperformed using real-world RV data of more than 20,000 vehicles in New York\nCity (NYC).

However, for node classification tasks, often, only\nmarginal improvement of GNNs over their linear counterparts has been observed.\nPrevious works provide very few understandings of this phenomenon. In this\nwork, we resort to Bayesian learning to deeply investigate the functions of\nnon-linearity in GNNs for node classification tasks. Given a graph generated\nfrom the statistical model CSBM, we observe that the max-a-posterior estimation\nof a node label given its own and neighbors' attributes consists of two types\nof non-linearity, a possibly non-linear transformation of node attributes and a\nReLU-activated feature aggregation from neighbors.

To solve these\nproblems, most existing methods explore modeling body context cues by enhancing\nfeature representation with graph neural networks or adding structural\nconstraints. However, these methods are not robust for their single-root\nformulation that decoding 3D poses from a root node with a pre-defined graph.\nIn this paper, we propose GR-M3D, which models the \\textbf{M}ulti-person\n\\textbf{3D} pose estimation with dynamic \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{R}easoning. The\ndecoding graph in GR-M3D is predicted instead of pre-defined. In particular, It\nfirstly generates several data maps and enhances them with a scale and depth\naware refinement module (SDAR). Then multiple root keypoints and dense decoding\npaths for each person are estimated from these data maps. Based on them,\ndynamic decoding graphs are built by assigning path weights to the decoding\npaths, while the path weights are inferred from those enhanced data maps. And\nthis process is named dynamic graph reasoning (DGR). Finally, the 3D poses are\ndecoded according to dynamic decoding graphs for each detected person. GR-M3D\ncan adjust the structure of the decoding graph implicitly by adopting soft path\nweights according to input data, which makes the decoding graphs be adaptive to\ndifferent input persons to the best extent and more capable of handling\nocclusion and depth ambiguity than previous methods. We empirically show that\nthe proposed bottom-up approach even outperforms top-down methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on three 3D pose datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 21:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 03:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

The almost unanimous conclusion is that they are, and\nit is often conjectured more or less explicitly that the reason of this\nsupposed superiority is to be attributed to the self-attention mechanism. In\nthis paper we perform extensive empirical analyses showing that recent\nstate-of-the-art CNNs (particularly, ConvNeXt) can be as robust and reliable or\neven sometimes more than the current state-of-the-art Transformers. However,\nthere is no clear winner. Therefore, although it is tempting to state the\ndefinitive superiority of one family of architectures over another, they seem\nto enjoy similar extraordinary performances on a variety of tasks while also\nsuffering from similar vulnerabilities such as texture, background, and\nsimplicity biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 21:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Issues of unfairness and discrimination\nare pervasive when decisions are being made by humans, and remain (or are\npotentially amplified) when decisions are made using machines with little\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness. In this paper, we introduce a\nframework for \\textit{causal fairness analysis} with the intent of filling in\nthis gap, i.e., understanding, modeling, and possibly solving issues of\nfairness in decision-making settings. The main insight of our approach will be\nto link the quantification of the disparities present on the observed data with\nthe underlying, and often unobserved, collection of causal mechanisms that\ngenerate the disparity in the first place, challenge we call the Fundamental\nProblem of Causal Fairness Analysis (FPCFA). In order to solve the FPCFA, we\nstudy the problem of decomposing variations and empirical measures of fairness\nthat attribute such variations to structural mechanisms and different units of\nthe population. Our effort culminates in the Fairness Map, which is the first\nsystematic attempt to organize and explain the relationship between different\ncriteria found in the literature. Finally, we study which causal assumptions\nare minimally needed for performing causal fairness analysis and propose a\nFairness Cookbook, which allows data scientists to assess the existence of\ndisparate impact and disparate treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 01:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Under a harmonic ansatz,\nthe wave equation gives an undamped free vibration equation; solving this\nequation with the proper boundary conditions provides the undamped\neigenfunctions with the familiar standing wave patterns. Any harmonically\ndriven solution is expressible in terms of these undamped eigenfunctions. Here,\nwe show that this formalism becomes inconvenient as dissipation increases. To\nthis end, we experimentally map out the position- and frequency-dependent\noscillatory motion of a NEMS string resonator driven linearly by a\nnon-symmetric force on one end at different dissipation limits. At low\ndissipation (high Q factor), we observe sharp resonances with standing wave\npatterns that closely match the eigenfunctions of an undamped string. With a\nslight increase in dissipation, the standing wave patterns become lost and\nwaves begin to propagate along the nanostructure. At large dissipation (low Q\nfactor), these propagating waves become strongly attenuated and display little,\nif any, resemblance to the undamped string eigenfunctions.

The proposed method was compared to the state-of-the-art\napproach in liver QSM for two multi-echo SGRE protocols with different\nacquisition parameters at 3T.\n  Results: The data-adaptive method produced susceptibility maps with higher\nsubjective quality due to reduced shading artifacts. For both acquisition\nprotocols, higher linear correlation with both $R_2$ and $R_2^*$-based\nmeasurements were observed for the data-adaptive method ($r^2=0.74/0.72$ for\n$R_2$, $0.98/0.99$ for $R_2^*$) than the standard method ($r^2=0.62/0.67$ and\n$0.84/0.91$). For both protocols, the data-adaptive method enabled better\ntest-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficients 0.14/0.14ppm for the\ndata-adaptive method, 0.26/0.31ppm for the standard method) and reproducibility\nacross protocols (reproducibility coefficient 0.25ppm vs 0.36ppm) than the\nstandard method.\n  Conclusions: The proposed data-adaptive QSM algorithm may enable\nquantification of liver iron concentration with improved\nrepeatability/reproducibility across different acquisition parameters as 3T.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 04:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Contrarily, glass and other\nsimilar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third\nlaw. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by\nregarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many\ninconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to\nthese inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law\nwithout any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature\nof entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only\nwhen thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are\nTCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for\nsolids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On\nthis basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of\natoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be\nassigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by\ndiscrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations.\nAmong various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at\nsufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration,\nwhich do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that\nregion. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by\nexpressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes\nat $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended\nspace including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high\ntemperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained\nthrough several debates on the glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 05:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 01:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

The\nlocal dataset held by each client is never exchanged in FL, so the local\ndataset privacy is protected. Although FL is increasingly popular, data\nheterogeneity across different clients leads to the client model drift issue\nand results in model performance degradation and poor model fairness. To\naddress the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local Knowledge\nFusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let the server\nreturn the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in each\ntraining round so that the local model can be regularized towards the global\noptima. Thus, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In FedKF, we first\npropose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that supports a precise\nglobal knowledge representation. Then, we propose a data-free knowledge\ndistillation (KD) approach to facilitate the KD from the global model to the\nlocal model while the local model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded\nin the local dataset) simultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local\nknowledge fusion process.

Laser-based OWC networks can provide terabits per second (Tbps)\naggregate data rates. However, the emerging OWC networks require clusters of\noptical transmitters to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. In this\ncontext, multi-user interference (MUI) is a crucial issue that must be managed\nefficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. Rate splitting (RS) is\nproposed as a transmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously by\nsplitting the message of a given user into common and private messages, and\nthen, each user decodes the desired message following a certain procedure. In\nradio frequency (RF) networks, RS provides higher spectral efficiency compared\nwith orthogonal and non-orthogonal transmission schemes. Considering the high\ndensity of OWC networks, the performance of RS is limited by the cost of\nproviding channel state information (CSI) at transmitters and by the noise\nresulting from interference cancellation. In this work, a user-grouping\nalgorithm is proposed and used to form multiple groups, each group contains\nusers spatially clustered. Then, an outer precoder is designed to manage\ninter-group interference following the methodology of blind interference\nalignment (BIA), which reduces the requirements of CSI at RF or optical\ntransmitters. For intra-group interference, RS is applied within each group\nwhere the users belonging to a given group receive a unique common message on\nwhich their private messages are superimposed. Furthermore, an optimization\nproblem is formulated to allocate the power among the private messages intended\nto all users such that the sum rate of the network is maximized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 08:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Social bots\nare assumed to be automated social media accounts operated by malicious actors\nwith the goal of manipulating public opinion.

However, the relevant publications either use crude and\nquestionable heuristics to discriminate between supposed social bots and humans\nor -- in the vast majority of the cases -- fully rely on the output of\nautomatic bot detection tools, most commonly Botometer. In this paper, we point\nout a fundamental theoretical flaw in the widely-used study design for\nestimating the prevalence of social bots. Furthermore, we empirically\ninvestigate the validity of peer-reviewed Botometer-based studies by closely\nand systematically inspecting hundreds of accounts that had been counted as\nsocial bots.

In the literature, there are very few results on the\nirreducibility of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by pure jump noise. The\nexisting methods on this topic are basically along the same lines as that for\nthe Gaussian case. They heavily rely on the fact that the driving noises are\nadditive type and more or less in the class of stable processes. The use of\nsuch methods to deal with the case of other types of additive pure jump noises\nappears to be unclear, let alone the case of multiplicative noises.\n  In this paper, we develop a new, effective method to obtain the\nirreducibility of SPDEs and SDEs driven by multiplicative pure jump noise. The\nconditions placed on the coefficients and the driving noise are very mild, and\nin some sense they are necessary and sufficient. This leads to not only\nsignificantly improving all of the results in the literature, but also to new\nirreducibility results of a much larger class of equations driven by pure jump\nnoise with much weaker requirements than those treatable by the known methods.\nAs a result, we are able to apply the main results to SPDEs with locally\nmonotone coefficients, SPDEs/SDEs with singular coefficients, nonlinear $\\rm\nSchr\\ddot{o}dinger$ equations, Euler equations etc. We emphasize that under our\nsetting the driving noises could be compound Poisson processes, even allowed to\nbe infinite dimensional.

We present recent results from a\nproof-of-principle wakefield acceleration experiment that reveal a unique\nsynergy between a laser-driven and particle-driven accelerator: a high-charge\nlaser-wakefield accelerated electron bunch can drive its own wakefield while\nsimultaneously drawing energy from the laser pulse via direct laser\nacceleration. This process continues to accelerate electrons beyond the usual\ndecelerating phase of the wakefield, thus reaching much higher energies.

So-called sgoldstinoless models assume the existence of a nilpotency\nconstraint $S^2=0$ that effectively removes the sgoldstino from the theory.\nSuch models were proposed to realise non-oscillatory inflation scenarios with a\nsingle scalar field, which feature a long period of kination at the end of\ninflation, and therefore a non-standard post-inflationary cosmology. Using\neffective operators, we propose models in which the sgoldstino is stabilized\nclose to the origin to reproduce the nilpotent constraint. We show that small\nsgoldstino fluctuations may lead to a sizeable back-reaction on the\ncosmological history. We study the effect of this back-reaction on the\ninflation observables measured in the cosmic microwave background and confront\nthe model to a series of constraints including limits on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$.\nWe show that the peculiar form of the potential in the large supersymmetry\nbreaking scale limit can generate peaks in the scalar power spectrum produced\nfrom inflation.

We demonstrate the usefulness of SemAbs on two\nopen-world 3D scene understanding tasks: 1) completing partially observed\nobjects and 2) localizing hidden objects from language descriptions.\nExperiments show that SemAbs can generalize to novel vocabulary,\nmaterials/lighting, classes, and domains (i.e., real-world scans) from training\non limited 3D synthetic data.

It is of great value to rectify them when considering poor visual\naesthetics and the deteriorated performance of OCR systems. Recent\nlearning-based methods intensively focus on the accurately cropped document\nimage. However, this might not be sufficient for overcoming practical\nchallenges, including document images either with large marginal regions or\nwithout margins. Due to this impracticality, users struggle to crop documents\nprecisely when they encounter large marginal regions. Simultaneously, dewarping\nimages without margins is still an insurmountable problem. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is still no complete and effective pipeline for rectifying\ndocument images in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\ncalled Marior (Margin Removal and \\Iterative Content Rectification). Marior\nfollows a progressive strategy to iteratively improve the dewarping quality and\nreadability in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we divide the pipeline\ninto two modules: margin removal module (MRM) and iterative content\nrectification module (ICRM). First, we predict the segmentation mask of the\ninput image to remove the margin, thereby obtaining a preliminary result. Then\nwe refine the image further by producing dense displacement flows to achieve\ncontent-aware rectification. We determine the number of refinement iterations\nadaptively. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our\nmethod on public benchmarks.

Traditionally, memory-hard\nfunctions have been analyzed in the (parallel) random oracle model. However, as\nthe memory-hard security game is multi-stage, indifferentiability does not\napply and instantiating the random oracle becomes a non-trivial problem.

The existing literature mainly focused on the change point\nestimation with stringent sub-Gaussian assumptions on the errors. In practice,\nhowever, there is no prior knowledge about the existence of a change point or\nthe tail structures of errors. To address these issues, in this paper, we\npropose a novel tail-adaptive approach for simultaneous change point testing\nand estimation. The method is built on a new loss function which is a weighted\ncombination between the composite quantile and least squared losses, allowing\nus to borrow information of the possible change points from both the\nconditional mean and quantiles. For the change point testing, based on the\nadjusted $L_2$-norm aggregation of a weighted score CUSUM process, we propose a\nfamily of individual testing statistics with different weights to account for\nthe unknown tail structures. Combining the individual tests, a tail-adaptive\ntest is further constructed that is powerful for sparse alternatives of\nregression coefficients' changes under various tail structures. For the change\npoint estimation, a family of argmax-based individual estimators is proposed\nonce a change point is detected. In theory, for both individual and\ntail-adaptive tests, the bootstrap procedures are proposed to approximate their\nlimiting null distributions. Under some mild conditions, we justify the\nvalidity of the new tests in terms of size and power under the high-dimensional\nsetup. The corresponding change point estimators are shown to be rate optimal\nup to a logarithm factor. Moreover, combined with the wild binary segmentation\ntechnique, a new algorithm is proposed to detect multiple change points in a\ntail-adaptive manner. Extensive numerical results are conducted to illustrate\nthe appealing performance of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 14:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 02:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Using the gold-standard non-DL\nmodel, FreeSurfer (FS), we segmented six brain structures: midbrain, pons,\ncaudate, putamen, pallidum, and third ventricle, and considered them as\nannotating data for DL models, the representative V-Net and UNETR. The Dice\nscores and area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating normal, PD, and\nP-plus cases were calculated. The segmentation times of V-Net and UNETR for the\nsix brain structures per patient were 3.48 +- 0.17 and 48.14 +- 0.97 s,\nrespectively, being at least 300 times faster than FS (15,735 +- 1.07 s).

For classification of\nnormal vs. P-plus and PD vs. multiple systemic atrophy (cerebellar type), the\nDL models and FS showed AUCs above 0.8. DL significantly reduces the analysis\ntime without compromising the performance of brain segmentation and\ndifferential diagnosis. Our findings may contribute to the adoption of DL brain\nMRI segmentation in clinical settings and advance brain research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2022 14:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

Since\nincentives are effective to engage customers and customers have different\npreferences for different types of incentives, the demand for personalized\npromotion decision making is increasing over time.\n  However, research on promotion decision making has focused specifically on\npurchase conversion during the promotion period (the direct effect), while\ngenerally disregarding the enduring effect in the post promotion period. To\nachieve a better lift return on investment (lift ROI) on the enduring effect of\nthe promotion and improve customer retention and loyalty, we propose a\nframework of multiple treatment promotion decision making by modeling each\ncustomer's direct and enduring response. First, we propose a customer direct\nand enduring effect (CDEE) model which predicts the customer direct and\nenduring response. With the help of the predictions of the CDEE, we personalize\nincentive allocation to optimize the enduring effect while keeping the cost\nunder the budget. To estimate the effect of decision making, we apply an\nunbiased evaluation approach of business metrics with randomized control trial\n(RCT) data.

An\nalgorithmic process is designed based on the model to accurately separate the\nhuman respiration and heartbeat motion. Firstly, a human maximum motion\nvelocity constraint method is proposed to correct human chest wall tracking,\ndetermine the radial position of the chest wall relative to the radar, and\nextract the phase signal corresponding to the chest wall motion. Then an\nimproved time-difference method is proposed to suppress the interference of RS\nharmonics on HS and the interference of low-frequency noise on RS. Finally, an\nadaptive Gaussian weighting filter is designed to extract the RS with less\ndistortion from the phase signal. A low-order finite-length unit impulse\nresponse (FIR) filter is used to extract the HS with less distortion from the\nphase signal. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulating\nthe process of measuring the RS and HS of the chest wall motion model by radar.\nThe simulation results show that, ideally, the radar measurement results of the\nRS and HS are less distorted relative to the actual values. In addition, we\nused a millimeter-wave experimental radar system in the 60 GHz band to measure\nthe respiration rate (RR) and HR (HR) of two subjects. The experimental results\nshowed that the measured RR and HR correlated well with the actual values. The\nquantitative analysis of simulation results and experimental results show that\nthe proposed method can achieve accurate and robust measurement of RS and HS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 16:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}
