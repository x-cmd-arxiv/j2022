We present a systematic method based\non generalized cumulant expansions for deriving a time-local master equation\nfor such systems. This master equation has an intuitive form that directly\nparallels a standard Lindblad equation, but contains several surprising\nfeatures: the combination of driving and non-Markovianity results in effective\ntime-dependent dephasing rates that can be negative, and the noise can generate\nHamiltonian renormalizations even though it is classical. We analyze in detail\nthe highly relevant case of a Rabi-driven qubit subject to various kinds of\nnon-Markovian noise including $1/f$ fluctuations, finding an excellent\nagreement between our master equation and numerically-exact simulations over\nrelevant timescales.

A powerful class of techniques\nfor solving optimal control problems involves using reparameterization to\ntransform the control design to a convex but infinite dimensional optimization.\nTo make the problem tractable, historical work focuses on Galerkin-type finite\ndimensional approximations to Hardy space, especially those involving Lorentz\nseries approximations such as the finite impulse response appproximation.\nHowever, Lorentz series approximations can lead to infeasibility, difficulty\nincorporating prior knowledge, deadbeat control in the case of finite impulse\nresponse, and increased suboptimality, especially for systems with large\nseparation of time scales. The goal of this two-part article is to introduce a\nnew Galerkin-type method based on approximation by transfer functions with a\nselection of simple poles, and to apply this simple pole approximation for\noptimal control design. In Part I, error bounds for approximating arbitrary\ntransfer functions in Hardy space are provided based on the geometry of the\npole selection. It is shown that the space of transfer functions with these\nsimple poles converges to the full Hardy space, and a uniform convergence rate\nis provided based purely on the geometry of the pole selection. This is then\nspecialized to derive a convergence rate for a particularly interesting pole\nselection based on an Archimedes spiral. In Part II, the simple pole\napproximation is combined with system level synthesis, a recent\nreparameterization approach, to develop a new control design method. This\ntechnique is convex and tractable, always feasible, can include prior\nknowledge, does not result in deadbeat control, and works well for systems with\nlarge separation of tim\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 16:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Due to the chaos it is fundamentally\nimpossible to accurately predict the solar system's orbital evolution beyond\n$\\sim$50 Myr based on present astronomical observations. We have recently\ndeveloped a method to overcome the problem by using the geologic record to\nconstrain astronomical solutions in the past. Our resulting optimal\nastronomical solution (called ZB18a) shows exceptional agreement with the\ngeologic record to $\\sim$58 Ma (Myr ago) and a characteristic resonance\ntransition around 50 Ma. Here we show that ZB18a and integration of Earth's and\nMars' spin vector based on ZB18a yield reduced variations in Earth's and Mars'\norbital inclination and Earth's obliquity (axial tilt) from $\\sim$58 to\n$\\sim$48 Ma -- the latter being consistent with paleoclimate records. The\nchanges in the obliquities have important implications for the climate\nhistories of Earth and Mars. We provide a detailed analysis of solar system\nfrequencies ($g$- and $s$-modes) and show that the shifts in the variation in\nEarth's and Mars' orbital inclination and obliquity around 48 Ma are associated\nwith the resonance transition and caused by changes in the contributions to the\nsuperposition of $s$-modes, plus $g$-$s$-mode interactions in the inner solar\nsystem. The $g$-$s$-mode interactions and the resonance transition (consistent\nwith geologic data) are unequivocal manifestations of chaos. Dynamical chaos in\nthe solar system hence not only affects its orbital properties, but also the\nlong-term evolution of planetary climate through eccentricity and the link\nbetween inclination and axial tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 16:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

LES is described in terms of the temporally evolving Eulerian\nvelocity field defined over a spatial grid with the mean-spacing correspondent\nto the resolved scale. This classic Eulerian LES depends on assumptions about\neffects of sub-grid scales on the resolved scales.\n  Here, we take an alternative approach and design novel LES heuristics stated\nin terms of Lagrangian particles moving with the flow.

The source wishes to transmit an\ninfinite stream of packets to the destination via the relay. The three-node D&F\nrelay network is constrained by a decoding delay of T packets, i.e., the packet\ntransmitted by the source at time i must be decoded by the destination by time\ni+T. For the individual channels from source to relay and relay to destination,\nwe assume a delay-constrained sliding-window (DCSW) based packet-erasure model\nthat can be viewed as a tractable approximation to the commonly-accepted\nGilbert-Elliot channel model. Under the model, any time-window of width w\ncontains either up to a random erasure or else erasure burst of length at most\nb (>= a). Thus the source-relay and relay-destination channels are modeled as\n(a_1, b_1, w_1, T_1) and (a_2, b_2, w_2, T_2) DCSW channels.

We consider a\nsituation where the gas becomes thermally unstable due to the hardening of the\nradiation field when the main radiative processes are free-free cooling and\nCompton heating. We identify two ways in which this can happen: (i) when the\nCompton temperature increases with time, through a rise in either the intensity\nor energy of a hard X-ray component; and (ii) when attenuation reduces the flux\nof the thermal component so that the Compton temperature increases with depth\nthrough the slab. Both ways likely occur in the broad line region of active\ngalactic nuclei where columns of gas can be ionization bounded. In such\ninstances where attenuation is significant, thermal equilibrium solution curves\nbecome position-dependent and it no longer suffices to assess the stability of\nan irradiated column of gas at all depths using a single equilibrium curve.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset (HUPD), a large-scale,\nwell-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of English-language patent\napplications filed to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)\nbetween 2004 and 2018. With more than 4.5 million patent documents, HUPD is two\nto three times larger than comparable corpora. Unlike previously proposed\npatent datasets in NLP, HUPD contains the inventor-submitted versions of patent\napplications--not the final versions of granted patents--thereby allowing us to\nstudy patentability at the time of filing using NLP methods for the first time.\nIt is also novel in its inclusion of rich structured metadata alongside the\ntext of patent filings: By providing each application's metadata along with all\nof its text fields, the dataset enables researchers to perform new sets of NLP\ntasks that leverage variation in structured covariates. As a case study on the\ntypes of research HUPD makes possible, we introduce a new task to the NLP\ncommunity--namely, binary classification of patent decisions. We additionally\nshow the structured metadata provided in the dataset enables us to conduct\nexplicit studies of concept shifts for this task. Finally, we demonstrate how\nHUPD can be used for three additional tasks: multi-class classification of\npatent subject areas, language modeling, and summarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 17:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Originated from\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), transformer architectures, consisting of\nself-attention and cross-attention, effectively learn long-range interactions\nbetween elements in a sequence. However, we observe that most existing\ntransformer-based vision models simply borrow the idea from NLP, neglecting the\ncrucial difference between languages and images, particularly the extremely\nlarge sequence length of spatially flattened pixel features. This subsequently\nimpedes the learning in cross-attention between pixel features and object\nqueries. In this paper, we rethink the relationship between pixels and object\nqueries and propose to reformulate the cross-attention learning as a clustering\nprocess. Inspired by the traditional k-means clustering algorithm, we develop a\nk-means Mask Xformer (kMaX-DeepLab) for segmentation tasks, which not only\nimproves the state-of-the-art, but also enjoys a simple and elegant design. As\na result, our kMaX-DeepLab achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on COCO\nval set with 58.0% PQ, Cityscapes val set with 68.4% PQ, 44.0% AP, and 83.5%\nmIoU, and ADE20K val set with 50.9% PQ and 55.2% mIoU without test-time\naugmentation or external dataset.

In this work, we take a global\nperspective and aim to identify the temperature range in which neutrinos can\ninteract given current cosmological observations. We consider a generic set of\nrates parametrizing neutrino interactions and by performing a full Planck\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis we find that neutrinos cannot\ninteract significantly for redshifts $2000 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10^5$, which we\nrefer to as the freestreaming window.

We approach this issue by conducting a comprehensive\nempirical study of diverse approaches that are known to impact OOD robustness\non a broad range of natural and synthetic distribution shifts of CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet.

We then give explicit constructions of GAPN\nbinomials over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of any odd algebraic degree between $p$ and\n$2(p-1)$ and, in the case where $p$ is not a Mersenne prime, also of any even\nalgebraic degree in this range. To obtain GAPN functions of even algebraic\ndegree also in the general case, we finally show how to construct GAPN\ntrinomials over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of any even algebraic degree between $p$ and\n$2(p-1)$ by applying a characterization of a special form of GAPN binomials by\n\\\"{O}zbudak and S\\u{a}l\\u{a}gean.

The\nConditional space-time Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD) offers insight\ninto transient dynamics, revealing the causation of specific flow phenomenon -\nor events, in a customizable manner. This work exploits the temporal evolution\nof CPOD modes in a reduced subspace, resulting in new extensions and\nadaptations that meet or exceed the capabilities of other decomposition\nmethods. Chiefly, it is demonstrated that the subsequent application of dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) to CPOD modes, provides a flexible tool to investigate\ntargeted flow instabilities, both tonal and convective in nature. By extending\nthe CPOD time-horizon to educe the former type, it is shown that CPOD-DMD can\nexactly reproduce Spectral POD modes. Regarding the latter, a multi-resolution\nframework (CPOD-mrDMD) yields a refined \"cause and effect\" stability analysis,\ncapable of diagnosing the natural forcing mechanisms within the flow, and the\nresulting unstable modes. In a separate application, CPOD properties are\nappreciated in the context of reduced order models, with an example of\nreal-time flow prediction of extreme events derived from an active sensor\ncorrelated to a CPOD mode.

To alleviate this\nlimitation, structured pruning is a well known technique which consists in\nremoving channels, neurons or filters, and is commonly applied in order to\nproduce more compact models. In most cases, the computations to remove are\nselected based on a relative importance criterion. At the same time, the need\nfor explainable predictive models has risen tremendously and motivated the\ndevelopment of robust attribution methods that highlight the relative\nimportance of pixels of an input image or feature map. In this work, we discuss\nthe limitations of existing pruning heuristics, among which magnitude and\ngradient-based methods. We draw inspiration from attribution methods to design\na novel integrated gradient pruning criterion, in which the relevance of each\nneuron is defined as the integral of the gradient variation on a path towards\nthis neuron removal. Furthermore, we propose an entwined DNN pruning and\nfine-tuning flowchart to better preserve DNN accuracy while removing\nparameters.

This is because the foundry does not share its calibrated physics-based\nmodels, comprised of highly confidential technology and material parameters.\nHowever, the unmonitored yet necessary overestimation of degradation amounts to\na performance decline, which could be preventable. Furthermore, these\nphysics-based models are exceptionally computationally complex. The costs of\nmodeling millions of individual transistors at design time can be evidently\nexorbitant.

A series of 45 runs were carried out\nstarting from a Gaussian vortex-model; the evolution of vortices was followed\nduring 300 orbits for various values of the vortex parameters and the Toomre\nparameter. Two simulations, with the highest resolution (HR) thus far for\nstudies of vortices, were also run to better characterise the internal\nstructure of the vortices and for the purpose of comparison with an isothermal\ncase.\n  We find that SG tends to destabilise the injected vortices, but compact\nsmall-scale vortices seem to be more robust than large-scale oblong vortices.\nVortex survival critically depends on the value of the disc's Toomre parameter,\nbut may also depend on the disc temperature at equilibrium.

We bring together these critical\nelements by selecting PSBs from the overlap of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nthe Canada-France Imaging Survey and applying a suite of classification\nmethods: non-parametric morphology metrics such as asymmetry and Gini-M20, a\nconvolutional neural network trained to identify post-merger galaxies, and\nvisual classification.

However, applying our merger\nidentification metrics to known post-mergers in the IllustrisTNG simulation\nshows that ~70% of recent post-mergers (<200 Myr) would not be detected.

Through an extensive theoretical and empirical\nanalysis, we show that these methods can be counter-productive: they are unable\nto remove the concepts entirely, and in the worst case may end up destroying\nall task-relevant features. The reason is the methods' reliance on a probing\nclassifier as a proxy for the concept. Even under the most favorable conditions\nfor learning a probing classifier when a concept's relevant features in\nrepresentation space alone can provide 100% accuracy, we prove that a probing\nclassifier is likely to use non-concept features and thus post-hoc or\nadversarial methods will fail to remove the concept correctly. These\ntheoretical implications are confirmed by experiments on models trained on\nsynthetic, Multi-NLI, and Twitter datasets.

To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

Here, we apply a coupled\natmosphere-interior evolution model to the Trappist-1 planets to anticipate\ntheir modern atmospheres. This model, which has previously been validated for\nEarth and Venus, connects magma ocean crystallization to temperate geochemical\ncycling. Mantle convection, magmatic outgassing, atmospheric escape, crustal\noxidation, a radiative-convective climate model, and deep volatile cycling are\nexplicitly coupled to anticipate bulk atmospheres and planetary redox evolution\nover 8 Gyr. By adopting a Monte Carlo approach that samples a broad range of\ninitial conditions and unknown parameters, we make some tentative predictions\nabout current Trappist-1 atmospheres. We find that anoxic atmospheres are\nprobable, but not guaranteed, for the outer planets; oxygen produced via\nhydrogen loss during the pre-main sequence is typically consumed by crustal\nsinks. In contrast, oxygen accumulation on the inner planets occurs in around\nhalf of all models runs. Complete atmospheric erosion is possible but not\nassured for the inner planets (occurs in 20%-50% of model runs), whereas the\nouter planets retain significant surface volatiles in virtually all model\nsimulations. For all planets that retain substantial atmospheres,\nCO$_2$-dominated or CO$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres are expected; water vapor is\nunlikely to be a detectable atmospheric constituent in most cases. There are\nnecessarily many caveats to these predictions, but the ways in which they\nmisalign with upcoming observations will highlight gaps in terrestrial planet\nknowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 00:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Moreover, today's models are\ntrained in a supervised manner, using training data synthesized from generic\nsources, environments, and human head shapes.\n  This paper intends to relax both these constraints at the expense of a slight\nalteration in the problem definition.

In particular, the relationship between the\nnumber $n$ of CuO$_2$ layers in a unit cell of cuprate superconductors and the\noptimum superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm opt}$ is\nintriguing. As experimentally observed in layered cuprates, $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm\nopt}$ increases when $n$ is increased, up to $n=3$, and, then, decreases for\nlarger $n$. However, the mechanism behind the $n$ dependence of $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm\nopt}$ remains elusive although there have been many studies on the $n$\ndependence. In this paper, we studied a bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model to\nclarify the effects of the adjacent CuO$_2$ layers on the stability of the\nsuperconductivity by using a many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. We\ncalculate the superconducting correlation at long distance and zero\ntemperature, and the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions estimated\nfrom the momentum distribution as the observables correlated with $T_{\\rm\nc}^{\\rm opt}$. It is found that the in-plane superconducting correlation is not\nenhanced in comparison with that in the single-layer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model.\nThe superconducting correlations of the bilayer Hamiltonian are significantly\nsmall in the overdoped region in comparison with those of single-layer\nHamiltonian, which is attributed to the van Hove singularity. In addition, we\nfound that the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions is also similar\nin both the single-layer and bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model at the optimal\ndoping. Therefore, we conclude that the adjacent Hubbard layers are not\nrelevant to the enhancement of $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm opt}$ in the bilayer cuprates.\nPossible origins of the enhanced $T_{\\rm c}^{\\rm opt}$ other than the adjacent\nlayers are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 06:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Backdoor attacks are insidious, and\npoisoned models perform well on benign samples and are only triggered when\ngiven specific inputs, which cause the neural network to produce incorrect\noutputs. The state-of-the-art backdoor attack work is implemented by data\npoisoning, i.e., the attacker injects poisoned samples into the dataset, and\nthe models trained with that dataset are infected with the backdoor. However,\nmost of the triggers used in the current study are fixed patterns patched on a\nsmall fraction of an image and are often clearly mislabeled, which is easily\ndetected by humans or defense methods such as Neural Cleanse and SentiNet.\nAlso, it's difficult to be learned by DNNs without mislabeling, as they may\nignore small patterns.

Most studies to date have found, by means of\nvarious approximate or phenomenological methods, that shot noise is insensitive\nto dephasing caused by inelastic scattering. In this paper, we explore the\nstatus of this statement by deriving a general Landaur-B\\\"uttiker-type formula\nthat expresses the current noise and Fano factor in a one-dimensional conductor\nthrough inelastic scattering amplitudes. For a double-barrier structure, exact\nscattering amplitudes are calculated in the presence of a time-dependent\npotential. As an example of dephasing potential, we consider the one induced by\nequilibrium phonons. We calculate transmission coefficients of a double-barrier\nstructure for these two types of phonon-induced dephasing. In the case of\ndiffusive phase relaxation valid for one dimension phonons, the resonant level\nhas a Lorentzian shape. For phonons whith high dimensions logarithmic dephasing\nrealized which leads to an unusual shape of the size-quantized level\ncharacterized by the two energy scales. We further calculate the Fano factor\nfor these types of dephasing, using exact expressions for inelastic\ntransmission and reflection amplitudes. It turned out that when an integer\nnumber of levels fall into the energy window of width eV, where V is the\nvoltage applied to the structure, the Fano factor is really insensitive to\ninelastic processes inside the structure and coincides with the prediction of\nphenomenological models with an accuracy of small corrections depending on\nthese processes.

To\naddress this issue, a novel RGB-D salient object detection model (SiaTrans) is\nproposed in this paper, which allows training on depth image quality\nclassification at the same time as training on SOD. In light of the common\ninformation between RGB and depth images on salient objects, SiaTrans uses a\nSiamese transformer network with shared weight parameters as the encoder and\nextracts RGB and depth features concatenated on the batch dimension, saving\nspace resources without compromising performance. SiaTrans uses the Class token\nin the backbone network (T2T-ViT) to classify the quality of depth images\nwithout preventing the token sequence from going on with the saliency detection\ntask.

However, PA\nsignals generated with these light sources are readily degraded by noise due to\nthe low optical fluence, leading to decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in PA\nimages. In this work, a spatiotemporal singular value decomposition (SVD) based\nPA denoising method was investigated for these light sources that usually have\nlow fluence and high repetition rates. The proposed method leverages both\nspatial and temporal correlations between radiofrequency (RF) data frames.\nValidation was performed on simulations and in vivo PA data acquired from human\nfingers (2D) and forearm (3D) using a LED-based system. Spatiotemporal SVD\ngreatly enhanced the PA signals of blood vessels corrupted by noise while\npreserving a high temporal resolution to slow motions, improving the SNR of in\nvivo PA images by 1.1, 0.7, and 1.9 times compared to single frame-based\nwavelet denoising, averaging across 200 frames, and single frame without\ndenoising, respectively. The proposed method demonstrated a processing time of\naround 50 \\mus per frame with SVD acceleration and GPU. Thus, spatiotemporal\nSVD is well suited to PA imaging systems with low-energy excitation light\nsources for real-time in vivo applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 09:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Although these models have some\nsimilarities to the models typically used in statistical modelling, the\nmajority of neural network research has been conducted outside of the field of\nstatistics. This has resulted in a lack of statistically-based methodology,\nand, in particular, there has been little emphasis on model parsimony.\nDetermining the input layer structure is analogous to variable selection, while\nthe structure for the hidden layer relates to model complexity. In practice,\nneural network model selection is often carried out by comparing models using\nout-of-sample performance. However, in contrast, the construction of an\nassociated likelihood function opens the door to information-criteria-based\nvariable and architecture selection.

These maps are based on\n1) a saliency map provided by an arbitrary saliency model, 2) the recently\nmeasured human cost function quantifying preferences in magnitude and direction\nof eye movements, and 3) a sequential exploration bonus, which changes with\neach subsequent gaze shift.

The first method computes the CCF of the total intensity of\neach of 64 frequency channels with a reference channel and converts the time\nlag of maximum correlation into a DM. The second method separately computes the\nCCF between every pair of channels for each individual bright pulse and\nextracts an average DM from the distribution of all channel-pair DMs. Both\nmethods allow the determination of the DM with a relative uncertainty of better\nthan 10^-5 and provide robust estimates for the uncertainty of the best-fit\nvalue.

Experiments on three popular code intelligence\ntasks, including code completion, code summarization and code search,\ndemonstrate insertion/deletion transformation and identifier transformation\nshow the greatest impact on the performance of Transformer.

We provide a tight analysis of its privacy\nguarantees, showing that it achieves the same privacy-accuracy trade-offs as\nthe continuous Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis is based on a novel bound on\nthe R\\'enyi divergence of two Poisson binomial distributions that may be of\nindependent interest.\n  Unlike previous discrete DP schemes based on additive noise, our mechanism\nencodes local information into a parameter of the binomial distribution, and\nhence the output distribution is discrete with bounded support. Moreover, the\nsupport does not increase as the privacy budget $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$ as\nin the case of additive schemes which require the addition of more noise to\nachieve higher privacy; on the contrary, the support becomes smaller as\n$\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. The bounded support enables us to combine our\nmechanism with secure aggregation (SecAgg), a multi-party cryptographic\nprotocol, without the need of performing modular clipping which results in an\nunbiased estimator of the sum of the local vectors. This in turn allows us to\napply it in the private FL setting and provide an upper bound on the\nconvergence rate of the SGD algorithm. Moreover, since the support of the\noutput distribution becomes smaller as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$, the\ncommunication cost of our scheme decreases with the privacy constraint\n$\\varepsilon$, outperforming all previous distributed DP schemes based on\nadditive noise in the high privacy or low communication regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 05:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Adversarial training\n(AT) is often adopted to improve robustness through training a mixture of\ncorrupted and clean data. However, most of AT based methods are ineffective in\ndealing with transferred adversarial examples which are generated to fool a\nwide spectrum of defense models, and thus cannot satisfy the generalization\nrequirement raised in real-world scenarios. Moreover, adversarially training a\ndefense model in general cannot produce interpretable predictions towards the\ninputs with perturbations, whilst a highly interpretable robust model is\nrequired by different domain experts to understand the behaviour of a DNN. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach based on Jacobian norm and Selective\nInput Gradient Regularization (J-SIGR), which suggests the linearized\nrobustness through Jacobian normalization and also regularizes the\nperturbation-based saliency maps to imitate the model's interpretable\npredictions. As such, we achieve both the improved defense and high\ninterpretability of DNNs. Finally, we evaluate our method across different\narchitectures against powerful adversarial attacks.

It is a challenging and practical problem since the query images often\nsuffer from resolution degradation due to the different capturing conditions\nfrom real-world cameras. To address this problem, state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsolutions either learn the resolution-invariant representation or adopt\nsuper-resolution (SR) module to recover the missing information from the LR\nquery. This paper explores an alternative SR-free paradigm to directly compare\nHR and LR images via a dynamic metric, which is adaptive to the resolution of a\nquery image. We realize this idea by learning resolution-adaptive\nrepresentations for cross-resolution comparison. Specifically, we propose two\nresolution-adaptive mechanisms. The first one disentangles the\nresolution-specific information into different sub-vectors in the penultimate\nlayer of the deep neural networks, and thus creates a varying-length\nrepresentation. To better extract resolution-dependent information, we further\npropose to learn resolution-adaptive masks for intermediate residual feature\nblocks. A novel progressive learning strategy is proposed to train those masks\nproperly. These two mechanisms are combined to boost the performance of CRReID.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method is superior to existing\napproaches and achieves SOTA performance on multiple CRReID benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 03:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}
