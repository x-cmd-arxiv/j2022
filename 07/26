DeepFakes\nand spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and\nits abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a\nbiological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract\nconcept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but\ntrivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of\ntraining data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other\nhand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly\nlarger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite\ndataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be\n\"understood\" by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic\ngradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information\ncomplexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no\nmeans of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through\ncontinuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as\nabstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects\ncan be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical\nconcepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which\nthe ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active\nperception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting\nvisual more than acoustic or chemical perception. Finally, we conclude that\nbinding physical entities to digital identities is possible in finite time with\nfinite resources, solving in principle the signal-to-symbol barrier problem,\nbut we highlight the need for continuous validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 17:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 02:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Mixing by convective overshooting has long been suggested to play an\nimportant role for the amount of hydrogen available to nuclear burning in\nconvective cores of stars.

We suggest an improved model for the computation of the dissipation rate\nof turbulent kinetic energy which can be used in non-local models of stellar\nconvection and can readily be implemented and self-consistently used in 1D\nstellar evolution calculations. Methods. We review the physics underlying\nvarious models to compute the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy,\n{\\epsilon}, in local and particularly in non-local models of convection in\nstellar astrophysics. The different contributions to the dissipation rate and\ntheir dependence on local stratification and on non-local transport are\nanalysed and a new method to account for at least some of these physical\nmechanisms is suggested.

The flow entering the magnetosphere is accelerated by the gravity of\nthe star and then decelerated in a shock located above its surface. For a large\nmass accretion rate, most of the radiation comes from the\nradiation-pressure-dominated region below the shock, known as accretion column.\nThough the one-dimensional, stationary structure of this flow has been studied\nfor many years, its global dynamics was hardly ever considered before.\nConsidering the time-dependent structure of an accretion column allows us to\ntest the stability of the existing stationary analytic solution, as well as its\npossible variability modes, and check the validity of its boundary conditions.\nUsing a conservative scheme, we perform one-dimensional time-dependent\nsimulations of an ideal radiative MHD flow inside an aligned dipolar\nmagnetosphere. We assume that magnetic stresses dominate the momentum balance\nin general. However, along a given field line, the motion is essentially\nhydrodynamic, with gravity, centrifugal force, and radiation pressure acting as\nmass forces. When thermal pressure locally exceeds magnetic pressure, the flow\nis assumed to lose mass. Position of the shock agrees well with the theoretical\npredictions, though at higher luminosities, there is a limit set by advection\neffects: if more than 2/3 of the released power is advected with the flow, the\nanalytic solution becomes self-inconsistent, and the column starts leaking at a\nfinite height. Depending on the geometry, this breakdown may broaden the\ncolumn, mass-load the field lines, and produce radiation-driven, mildly\nrelativistic ejecta. Approaching the equilibrium position, the shock front\nexperiences damped oscillations at a frequency close to the inverse sound\npropagation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 16:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}

However, the\nearly-injected single-shot backdoor attack is ineffective because: (1) the\nmaximum backdoor effectiveness is not reached at injection because of the\ndilution effect from normal local updates; (2) the backdoor effect decreases\nquickly as the backdoor will be overwritten by the newcoming normal local\nupdates. In this paper, we strengthen the early-injected single-shot backdoor\nattack utilizing FL model information leakage. We show that the FL convergence\ncan be expedited if the client trains on a dataset that mimics the distribution\nand gradients of the whole population. Based on this observation, we proposed a\ntwo-phase backdoor attack, which includes a preliminary phase for the\nsubsequent backdoor attack. In the preliminary phase, the attacker-controlled\nclient first launches a whole population distribution inference attack and then\ntrains on a locally crafted dataset that is aligned with both the gradient and\ninferred distribution.

Similar to\nCNNs, ViTs also struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios and the main culprit\nis overfitting to source domains. Inspired by the modular architecture of ViTs,\nwe propose a simple DG approach for ViTs, coined as self-distillation for ViTs.\nIt reduces the overfitting of source domains by easing the learning of\ninput-output mapping problem through curating non-zero entropy supervisory\nsignals for intermediate transformer blocks. Further, it does not introduce any\nnew parameters and can be seamlessly plugged into the modular composition of\ndifferent ViTs.

We support our findings of early-time tygers\nwith two complementary and independent means, namely by an asymptotic analysis\nof the time-Taylor series for the velocity, as well as by a novel singularity\ntheory that employs Lagrangian coordinates.\n  Finally, we apply two methods that reduce the amplitude of early-time tygers,\none is tyger purging which removes large Fourier modes from the velocity, and\nis a variant of a procedure known in the literature. The other method realizes\nan iterative UV completion, which, most interestingly, iteratively restores the\nconservation of energy once the Taylor series for the velocity diverges. Our\ntechniques are straightforwardly adapted to higher dimensions and/or applied to\nother equations of hydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 09:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

However, the HFM/EXED\ninstrument at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin made this possible at magnetic\nfields up to 25.9 T. Thus we have used HFM/EXED to investigate the\nfield-induced ordered phase, in particular to look for quasi-2D physics arising\nfrom the layered structure and from the different bilayer types. From neutron\ndiffraction data, we determined the global dependence of the magnetic order\nparameter on both magnetic field and temperature, finding a form consistent\nwith 3D quantum critical scaling; from this we deduce that the quasi-2D\ninteractions and nonuniform layering of BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ are not anisotropic\nenough to induce hallmarks of 2D physics. From neutron spectroscopy data, we\nmeasured the dispersion of the strongly Zeeman-split magnetic excitations,\nfinding good agreement with the zero-field interaction parameters of\nBaCuSi$_2$O$_6$. We conclude that HFM/EXED allowed a significant extension in\nthe application of neutron scattering techniques to the field range above 20 T\nand in particular opened new horizons in the study of field-induced magnetic\nquantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 18:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 20:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

Further modeling in some cases\nuses the ASCOT5 code to calculate advection and diffusion coefficients for\nrunaway electrons based on the NIMROD-calculated fields, and the DREAM code to\ncompute the runaway evolution in the presence of these transport coefficients.\nCompared with similar modeling in Tinguely, et al [2021 Nucl.

Of three coil geometries considered in\nSPARC, only the $n=1$ coil is found to have sufficient resonant components to\nsuppress the runaway current growth. Without the new conservative transport\nassumptions, full suppression of the RE current is maintained when the TQ MHD\nis included in the simulation or when the RE current is limited to 250kA, but\nwhen transport in closed flux regions is fully suppressed, these scenarios\nallow RE beams on the order of 1-2MA to appear.

It is believed that the heavy-ion collision experiments at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have\ncreated the QGP medium by colliding two heavy nuclei at nearly the speed of\nlight. Since the collision happens really fast, we can not observe the QGP\ndirectly. Instead, we look at the hundreds or even thousands of final hadrons\ncoming out of the collision. In particular, jet and heavy flavor observables\nare excellent probes of the transport properties of such a medium. On the\ntheoretical side, computational models are essential to make the connections\nbetween the final observables and the plasma. Previously studies have employed\na comprehensive multistage modeling approach of both the probes and the medium.\n  In this dissertation, heavy quarks are investigated as probes pf the QGP.\nFirst, the framework that describes the evolution of both soft and hard\nparticles during the collision is discussed, which includes initial condition,\nhydrodynamical expansion, parton transport, hadronization, and hadronic\nrescattering. It has recently been organized into the Jet Energy-loss\nTomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope\n(JETSCAPE) framework, which allows people to study heavy-ion collision in a\nmore systematic manner.\n  To study the energy loss of hard partons inside the QGP medium, the linear\nBoltzmann transport model (LBT) and in medium DGLAP evolution (implemented in\nthe MATTER model) are combined and have achieved a simultaneous description of\nboth charged hadron, D meson, and inclusive jet observables.

Bright galactic foregrounds\ncontaminate the 400--800~MHz HIRAX frequency band, so meeting the science goals\nwill require precise instrument characterization. In this paper we describe\ncharacterization of the HIRAX antenna, focusing on measurements of the antenna\nbeam and antenna noise temperature.\n  Beam measurements of the current HIRAX antenna design were performed in an\nanechoic chamber and compared to simulations. We report measurement techniques\nand results, which find a broad and symmetric antenna beam for $\\nu <$650MHz,\nand elevated cross-polarization levels and beam asymmetries for $\\nu >$700MHz.\nNoise temperature measurements of the HIRAX feeds were performed in a custom\napparatus built at Yale. In this system, identical loads, one cryogenic and the\nother at room temperature, are used to take a differential (Y-factor)\nmeasurement from which the noise of the system is inferred. Several measurement\nsets have been conducted using the system, involving CHIME feeds as well as\nfour of the HIRAX active feeds. These measurements give the first noise\ntemperature measurements of the HIRAX feed, revealing a $\\sim$60K noise\ntemperature (relative to 30K target) with 40K peak- to-peak frequency-dependent\nfeatures, and provide the first demonstration of feed repeatability. Both\nfindings inform current and future feed designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 18:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

We considered non-illuminated Novikov-Thorne discs and X-ray illuminated\ndiscs based on a Novikov-Thorne temperature radial profile. We also considered\nthe case where the temperature profile is modified by a colour-correction\nfactor. We assumed that the X-ray luminosity is equal to the accretion power\nthat is dissipated to the disc below a transition radius. The half-light radius\nof X-ray illuminated radii can be up to some three to four times greater than\nthe radius of a standard disc, even for a non-spinning black hole, due to the\nfact that the absorbed X-rays act as a secondary source of energy, increasing\nthe disc temperature. Non-illuminated discs are consistent with observations,\nbut only at the 2.5sigma level. On the other hand, X-ray illuminated discs can\nexplain both the half-light radius-black hole mass as well as the\nluminosity-black hole mass relation in AGN, for a wide range of physical\nparameters.

By tuning the\ninterlayer exchange coupling between a layer accommodating magnetic vortex\nstate and an out-of-plane magnetized layer, one can efficiently realize new\ntopological chiral textures such as cone state vortices and circular stripe\ndomains. We study how the number of circular stripes can be controlled by both\nthe interlayer exchange coupling and the sample geometrical parameters. By\nvarying geometrical parameters, a continuous phase transition between the\nhomogeneous state, cone state vortex, circular stripe domains, and the\nimprinted vortex takes place, which is analysed by full scale micromagnetic\nsimulations. The analytical description provides an intuitive pictures of the\nmagnetization textures in each of these phases.

The strong and\nbroad-spectrum antimicrobial effect of plasma-activated liquids (PALs) is now\nwell known. The proven applicability of machine learning (ML) in the medical\nfield is encouraging for its application in the field of plasma medicine as\nwell. Thus, ML applications on PALs could present a new perspective to better\nunderstand the influences of various parameters on their antimicrobial effects.\nIn this paper, comparative supervised ML models are presented by using\npreviously obtained data to qualitatively predict the in vitro antimicrobial\nactivity of PALs. A literature search was performed and data is collected from\n33 relevant articles. After the required preprocessing steps, two supervised ML\nmethods, namely classification, and regression are applied to data to obtain\nmicrobial inactivation (MI) predictions. For classification, MI is labeled in\nfour categories and for regression, MI is used as a continuous variable. Two\ndifferent robust cross-validation strategies are conducted for classification\nand regression models to evaluate the proposed method; repeated stratified\nk-fold cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation, respectively. We also\ninvestigate the effect of different features on models. The results\ndemonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Random Forest Classifier (oRFC)\nand Random Forest Regressor (oRFR) provided better results than other models\nfor the classification and regression, respectively. Finally, the best test\naccuracy of 82.68% for oRFC and R2 of 0.75 for the oRFR are obtained. ML\ntechniques could contribute to a better understanding of plasma parameters that\nhave a dominant role in the desired antimicrobial effect. Furthermore, such\nfindings may contribute to the definition of a plasma dose in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 19:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Our idea is to design a\ndual-mode camera system where the first mode is low-power (1.1 mW) but only\noutputs grey-scale, low resolution, and noisy video and the second mode\nconsumes much higher power (100 mW) but outputs color and higher resolution\nimages. To reduce total energy consumption, we heavily duty cycle the high\npower mode to output an image only once every second. The data for this camera\nsystem is then wirelessly sent to a nearby plugged-in gateway, where we run our\nreal-time neural network decoder to reconstruct a higher-resolution color\nvideo. To achieve this, we introduce an attention feature filter mechanism that\nassigns different weights to different features, based on the correlation\nbetween the feature map and the contents of the input frame at each spatial\nlocation. We design a wireless hardware prototype using off-the-shelf cameras\nand address practical issues including packet loss and perspective mismatch.\nOur evaluations show that our dual-camera approach reduces energy consumption\nby 7x compared to existing systems.

Service owners\nintending to maintain Service Level Objectives (SLO) for themselves typically\nrequest a conservative amount of resources. Platform providers want to increase\noperational efficiency to reduce capital and operating costs. Achieving both\noperational efficiency and SLO for individual services at the same time is\nchallenging due to the diversity in service workload characteristics, resource\nusage patterns that are dependent on input load, heterogeneity in platform,\nmemory, I/O, and network architecture, and resource bundling.\n  This paper presents a tunable approach to resource allocation that accounts\nfor both dynamic service resource needs and platform heterogeneity. In\naddition, an online K-Means-based service classification method is used in\nconjunction with an offline sensitivity component. Our tunable approach allows\ntrading resource utilization efficiency for absolute SLO guarantees based on\nthe service owners' sensitivity to its SLO. We evaluate our tunable resource\nallocator at scale in a private cloud environment with mostly latency-critical\nworkloads.

When tuning for SLO, by introducing\ninterference-aware colocation, we can tune the solver to reduce tasks\nexperiencing degradation of SLO by up to ~22% compared to the baseline, but at\nan additional cost of ~30% in terms of the number of hosts.

Many of the detected species are expected to form on\nthe icy surface of interstellar grains and transfer later into the gas phase.\nTherefore, icy material is regarded as a primordial source of COMs in the ISM.\nUpcoming JWST observations of interstellar ices in star-forming regions will\nreveal IR features of frozen molecules with unprecedented resolution and\nsensitivity. To identify COM features in the JWST data, lab IR spectra of ices\nfor conditions that simulate interstellar environments are needed. This work\npresents FTIR spectra (500-4000 cm$^{-1}$/20-2.5$\\mu$m, with a resolution of 1\ncm$^{-1}$) of methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN, aka acetonitrile) mixed with H$_2$O,\nCO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$, at temperatures from 15-150 K. The refractive\nindex of pure amorphous CH$_3$CN ice at 15K and the band strength, peak\nposition, and FWHM of selected IR bands are also measured. These bands are: the\nCH$_3$ sym stretching at 2940.9 cm$^{-1}$, the CN stretching at 2252.2\ncm$^{-1}$, a combination of modes at 1448.3 cm$^{-1}$ , the CH$_3$ antisym def.\nat 1410 cm$^{-1}$ , the CH$_3$ sym def. at 1374.5 cm$^{-1}$, and the CH$_3$\nrock at 1041.6 cm$^{-1}$. The lab spectra of CH$_3$CN are compared to\nobservations of ices toward W33A and three low-mass YSOs.

Advanced theories which are both more physical and\nnumerically treatable are needed. Convective flows in stellar interiors are\nhighly turbulent. This poses a number of numerical challenges for the modelling\nof convection in stellar interiors. We include an effective turbulence model\ninto a 1D stellar evolution code in order to treat non-local effects within the\nsame theory. We use a turbulent convection model which relies on the solution\nof second order moment equations. We implement this into a state of the art 1D\nstellar evolution code.

The original distribution\ntesting model relies on samples drawn independently from the distribution to be\ntested. However, when testing distributions over the $n$-dimensional Hamming\ncube $\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}$ for a large $n$, even reading a few samples is\ninfeasible. To address this, Goldreich and Ron [ITCS 2022] have defined a model\ncalled the huge object model, in which the samples may only be queried in a few\nplaces.\n  In this work, we initiate a study of a general class of properties in the\nhuge object model, those that are invariant under a permutation of the indices\nof the vectors in $\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^{n}$, while still not being necessarily\nfully symmetric as per the definition used in traditional distribution testing.\n  We prove that every index-invariant property satisfying a bounded\nVC-dimension restriction admits a property tester with a number of queries\nindependent of n. To complement this result, we argue that satisfying only\nindex-invariance or only a VC-dimension bound is insufficient to guarantee a\ntester whose query complexity is independent of n. Moreover, we prove that the\ndependency of sample and query complexities of our tester on the VC-dimension\nis tight. As a second part of this work, we address the question of the number\nof queries required for non-adaptive testing. We show that it can be at most\nquadratic in the number of queries required for an adaptive tester of\nindex-invariant properties. This is in contrast with the tight exponential gap\nfor general non-index-invariant properties. Finally, we provide an\nindex-invariant property for which the quadratic gap between adaptive and\nnon-adaptive query complexities for testing is almost tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 20:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 19:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Specifically, we propose the first data augmentation-based membership\ninference attacks against ML models trained by SSL. Given a data sample and the\nblack-box access to a model, the goal of membership inference attack is to\ndetermine whether the data sample belongs to the training dataset of the model.\nOur evaluation shows that the proposed attack can consistently outperform\nexisting membership inference attacks and achieves the best performance against\nthe model trained by SSL. Moreover, we uncover that the reason for membership\nleakage in SSL is different from the commonly believed one in supervised\nlearning, i.e., overfitting (the gap between training and testing accuracy). We\nobserve that the SSL model is well generalized to the testing data (with almost\n0 overfitting) but ''memorizes'' the training data by giving a more confident\nprediction regardless of its correctness. We also explore early stopping as a\ncountermeasure to prevent membership inference attacks against SSL.

In this paper, we propose a new quantum image\nrepresentation of RGB images, which is an improvement to all the existing\nrepresentations in terms of using minimum resource. We use two entangled\nquantum registers constituting of total 7 qutrits to encode the color channels\nand their intensities. Additionally, we generalize the existing encoding\nmethods by using both qubits and qutrits to encode the pixel positions of a\nrectangular image. This hybrid-qudit approach aligns well with the current\nprogress of NISQ devices in incorporating higher dimensional quantum systems\nthan qubits. We then describe the image encoding method using higher-order\nqubit-qutrit gates, and demonstrate the decomposition of these gates in terms\nof simpler elementary gates. We use the Google Cirq's quantum simulator to\nverify the image retrieval. We show that the complexity of the image encoding\nprocess is linear in the number of pixels.

Even\nthough there are reports on various end effectors for strawberry harvesting,\nbut there they lack a picture of certain parameters that the researchers can\nrely upon to develop new end effectors.

This enables\nan end effector to grip a strawberry of mass up to 50 grams with a manipulation\nacceleration of 50 m/s$^2$ without squeezing the peduncle.

A well-known coupling method that has been frequently\nemployed in different concurrent multiscale methods such as Quasicontinuum is\nthe strong compatibility coupling (SCC). Although the SCC is a highly accurate\ncoupling method, it constrains the mesh generation and restricts the reduction\nof computational cost. In this paper, first, we explain the notion of coupling\nmodels through the interface in the context of continuum mechanics for\nquasi-static problems. Then, the SCC is relaxed to overcome the downsides in\nthe following approaches: a surface approximation approach and a force\napproximation approach. Based on the latter, we develop a brand new coupling\nmethod called consistent linear coupling (CLC). Overall, six different coupling\nschemes are introduced in line with the surface and force approximation\napproaches. The schemes are compared in terms of solving quasi-static 3D\nelastic nanoscale contact between an aluminum substrate and a diamond\nsemi-sphere. Numerical results reveal that the CLC-based schemes are more\naccurate when compared with the surface approximation schemes. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that by decreasing the size of interface elements, the accuracy of\nthe CLC converges to and even exceeds the accuracy of SCC, but nevertheless\nwith significantly less computational cost. In other words, in contrast to the\nSCC, the accuracy of the CLC is tunable, and it can be optimized proportional\nto the computational cost and accuracy.

We propose a new flash technique, named ``patterned flash'', for\nflash imaging at a long distance. Patterned flash concentrates optical power\ninto a dot array. Compared with the conventional uniform flash where the signal\nis overwhelmed by the noise everywhere, patterned flash provides stronger\nsignals at sparsely distributed points across the field of view to ensure the\nsignals at those points stand out from the sensor noise. This enables\npost-processing to resolve important objects and details. Additionally, the\npatterned flash projects texture onto the scene, which can be treated as a\nstructured light system for depth perception. Given the novel system, we\ndevelop a joint image reconstruction and depth estimation algorithm with a\nconvolutional neural network.

This is accomplished simply by following the\nstandard/ubiquitous Davidson method in its \"direct\" form -- wherein, in each\niteration, the electronic Hamiltonian operator is applied directly in second\nquantization to the Ritz vector/wavefunction from the prior iteration -- except\nthat (in this work) only a small portion of the resultant expansion vector is\nactually even computed (through application of only a similarly small portion\nof the Hamiltonian). Specifically, at each iteration of this truncated Davidson\napproach, the new expansion vector is taken to be twice as large as that from\nthe prior iteration. In this manner, a small set of highly truncated expansion\nvectors (say 10--30) of increasing precision is incrementally constructed,\nforming a small subspace within which diagonalization of the Hamiltonian yields\nclear, consistent, and monotonically variational convergence to the approximate\nfull CI limit. The good efficiency in which convergence to the level of\nchemical accuracy (1.6 mHartree) is achieved suggests, at least for the\ndemonstrated problem sizes -- Hilbert spaces of $10^{18}$ and wavefunctions of\n$10^8$ determinants -- that this truncated Davidson methodology can serve as a\nreplacement of standard CI and complete-active space (CAS) approaches, in\ncircumstances where only a few chemically-significant digits of accuracy are\nrequired and/or meaningful in view of ever-present basis set limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

First, this study shows that\nregardless of level of ambiguity both for people or networked society, only two\ntypes of opinions can be formed, and both are biased. However, one opinion type\nis less biased than the other depending on the state of the world.

Existing works typically require compressed video\nbitstream to be decoded to RGB frames before being segmented, which increases\ncomputation and storage requirements and ultimately slows the inference down.\nThis may hamper its application in real-world computing resource limited\nscenarios, such as autonomous cars and drones. To alleviate this problem, in\nthis paper, we explore the referring object segmentation task on compressed\nvideos, namely on the original video data flow. Besides the inherent difficulty\nof the video referring object segmentation task itself, obtaining\ndiscriminative representation from compressed video is also rather challenging.\nTo address this problem, we propose a multi-attention network which consists of\ndual-path dual-attention module and a query-based cross-modal Transformer\nmodule. Specifically, the dual-path dual-attention module is designed to\nextract effective representation from compressed data in three modalities,\ni.e., I-frame, Motion Vector and Residual. The query-based cross-modal\nTransformer firstly models the correlation between linguistic and visual\nmodalities, and then the fused multi-modality features are used to guide object\nqueries to generate a content-aware dynamic kernel and to predict final\nsegmentation masks. Different from previous works, we propose to learn just one\nkernel, which thus removes the complicated post mask-matching procedure of\nexisting methods. Extensive promising experimental results on three challenging\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method compared against several\nstate-of-the-art methods which are proposed for processing RGB data.

Compared with traditional CT based on\nenergy-integrating detectors, spectral CT can make full use of spectral\ninformation, resulting in high resolution and providing accurate material\nquantification. Numerous model-based iterative reconstruction methods have been\nproposed for spectral CT reconstruction. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom difficulties such as laborious parameter selection and expensive\ncomputational costs. In addition, due to the image similarity of different\nenergy bins, spectral CT usually implies a strong low-rank prior, which has\nbeen widely adopted in current iterative reconstruction models. Singular value\nthresholding (SVT) is an effective algorithm to solve the low-rank constrained\nmodel.

Based on\nan experimental technique previously coined as The Gap Test and Bazant's Type\nII Size Effect Law, it is found that there is a monotonic decrease in the Mode\nI fracture energy as the crack parallel compressive stress increases. Compared\nto the nominal value of fracture energy, where no crack parallel compression is\napplied, the fracture energy is observed to decrease by up to 37% for a\ncompressive stress equal to 44% of the compressive failure limit of the\ncomposite. This weakening effect is attributed to splitting cracks that are\ninduced at the crack tip due to the crack parallel compression, which are\nidentified via crack tip photomicroscopy. This is a novel result that\nchallenges the century old hypothesis of fracture energy being a constant\nmaterial property and further, shows for the first time that crack parallel\ncompression leads to a composite structure being dangerously weaker than\nexpected. The experimental campaign is also buttressed with a computational\ncampaign that provides a framework capable of capturing the effects of crack\nparallel compression. Through the use of the crack band model, which correctly\ncharacterizes the fracture process zone tensorially, coupled with a fully\ntensorial damage law, the simulated results provide satisfactory agreement with\nthe experimental data. Conversely, when a reduced tensorial damage law defines\nthe crack band it is shown that the structural strength and fracture energy are\ndangerously overpredicted. This emphasizes the importance of using a crack band\nmodel coupled with a fully tensorial damage law to accurately predict fracture\nin composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 04:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

In addition, most of the existing methods choose to use an\n$n\\times n$ similarity matrix for optimization, which makes the memory and\ncomputation unaffordable. In this paper we propose a novel Asymmetric Scalable\nCross-Modal Hashing (ASCMH) to address these issues.

Quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments conducted on publicly available benchmarks, SemanticKITTI and\nSemanticPOSS, demonstrate that our pipeline achieves much better mIoU and\ninference performance compared with state-of-the-art models. The code will be\navailable at https://github.com/huixiancheng/CENet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Using\nmachine learning and deep learning for skin cancer classification can increase\naccessibility and reduce the discomforting procedures involved in the\ntraditional lesion detection process. These models can be wrapped in web or\nmobile apps and serve a greater population. In this paper, two such models are\ntested on the benchmark HAM10000 dataset of common skin lesions.

One major advantage of unit testing is the adjustable\ntrade-off between efficiency (i.e., testing effort) and effectiveness (i.e.,\nfault-detection probability). To this end, various strategies have been\nproposed to exploit this trade-off. In particular, test-suite reduction (TSR)\nreduces the number of (presumably redundant) test cases while testing a single\nprogram version. Regression-test selection (RTS) selects test cases for testing\nconsecutive program revisions. However, both TSR and RTS may influence -- or\neven obstruct -- each others' performance when used in combination. For\ninstance, test cases discarded during TSR for a particular program version may\nbecome relevant again for RTS. However, finding a combination of both\nstrategies leading to a reasonable trade-off throughout the version history of\na program is an open question. The goal of this paper is to gain a better\nunderstanding of the interactions between TSR and RTS with respect to\nefficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we present a configurable framework\ncalled RegreTS for automated unit-testing of C programs. The framework\ncomprises different strategies for TSR and RTS and possible combinations\nthereof. We apply this framework to a collection of subject systems, delivering\nseveral crucial insights. First, TSR has almost always a negative impact on the\neffectiveness of RTS, yet a positive impact on efficiency. Second, test cases\nrevealing to testers the effect of program modifications between consecutive\nprogram versions are far more effective than test cases simply covering\nmodified code parts, yet causing much more testing effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 08:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The revealed effect may\ncontrol the structure of planetesimal disks in planetary systems: the orbital\nzone between the 2/1 and 1/1 resonances with a planet should be normally free\nfrom low-mass material (only that occasionally captured in the first-order 3/2\nor 4/3 resonances may survive); whereas any low-mass population inner to the\n2/1 resonance location should be normally long-lived (if not perturbed by\nsecular resonances, which we do not consider in this study).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 08:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The hdr lasso\nproblem is essentially an $L_1$-regularized optimization problem whose loss\nfunction is Jaeckel's dispersion function with Wilcoxon scores. Due to the\nnondifferentiability of the above loss function, many classical algorithms for\nlasso-type problems are unable to solve this model.

However, most correction schemes rely on the\nassumption that errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in space and time. In\nsuperconducting qubits this assumption is drastically violated in the presence\nof ionizing radiation, which creates bursts of high energy phonons in the\nsubstrate. These phonons can break Cooper-pairs in the superconductor and,\nthus, create quasiparticles over large areas, consequently reducing qubit\ncoherence across the quantum device in a correlated fashion. A potential\nmitigation technique is to place large volumes of normal or superconducting\nmetal on the device, capable of reducing the phonon energy to below the\nsuperconducting gap of the qubits. To investigate the effectiveness of this\nmethod we fabricate a quantum device with four nominally identical\nnanowire-based transmon qubits.

In a recent study it has been argued that their peculiar\nproperties can be explained if emitting electrons are accelerated in a series\nof oblique shocks induced by the recollimation of the relativistic jet.\nHowever, new 3D simulations of recollimated, weakly magnetized jets reveal\nthat, in correspondence with the first recollimation shock, the flow develops a\nrapidly growing instability, becomes highly turbulent and decelerates,\neffectively hampering the formation of the multiple shock structure routinely\nobserved in 2D simulations. Building on these new findings, we propose here a\nrevised scenario for EHBL, in which the emission is produced by electrons\naccelerated at the recollimation shock and subsequently further energized\nthrough stochastic acceleration in the turbulent downstream flow. We apply a\nsimple version of this scenario to the prototypical EHBL 1ES 0229-200, showing\nthat the SED can be satisfactorily reproduced with standard values of the main\nphysical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 09:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

A typical RealSR framework usually\nincludes the optimization of multiple criteria which are designed for different\nimage properties, by making the implicit assumption that the ground-truth\nimages can provide a good trade-off between different criteria. However, this\nassumption could be easily violated in practice due to the inherent contrastive\nrelationship between different image properties. Contrastive learning (CL)\nprovides a promising recipe to relieve this problem by learning discriminative\nfeatures using the triplet contrastive losses. Though CL has achieved\nsignificant success in many computer vision tasks, it is non-trivial to\nintroduce CL to RealSR due to the difficulty in defining valid positive image\npairs in this case. Inspired by the observation that the contrastive\nrelationship could also exist between the criteria, in this work, we propose a\nnovel training paradigm for RealSR, named Criteria Comparative Learning\n(Cria-CL), by developing contrastive losses defined on criteria instead of\nimage patches. In addition, a spatial projector is proposed to obtain a good\nview for Cria-CL in RealSR.

These waves are known to\nbe subject to nonlinear effects, including triggering differential rotation in\nthe form of zonal flows. In this study, we use a realistic tidal body forcing\nto excite inertial waves through the residual action of the equilibrium tide in\nthe momentum equation for the waves.

Producing an answer requires understanding\nthe interplay across visual scenes in video and linguistic semantics in\nquestion. However, most leading VideoQA models work as black boxes, which make\nthe visual-linguistic alignment behind the answering process obscure. Such\nblack-box nature calls for visual explainability that reveals ``What part of\nthe video should the model look at to answer the question?''. Only a few works\npresent the visual explanations in a post-hoc fashion, which emulates the\ntarget model's answering process via an additional method. Nonetheless, the\nemulation struggles to faithfully exhibit the visual-linguistic alignment\nduring answering.\n  Instead of post-hoc explainability, we focus on intrinsic interpretability to\nmake the answering process transparent. At its core is grounding the\nquestion-critical cues as the causal scene to yield answers, while rolling out\nthe question-irrelevant information as the environment scene. Taking a causal\nlook at VideoQA, we devise a self-interpretable framework, Equivariant and\nInvariant Grounding for Interpretable VideoQA (EIGV). Specifically, the\nequivariant grounding encourages the answering to be sensitive to the semantic\nchanges in the causal scene and question; in contrast, the invariant grounding\nenforces the answering to be insensitive to the changes in the environment\nscene. By imposing them on the answering process, EIGV is able to distinguish\nthe causal scene from the environment information, and explicitly present the\nvisual-linguistic alignment. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\njustify the superiority of EIGV in terms of accuracy and visual\ninterpretability over the leading baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 10:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

In this study we investigate the solar cycle trends\nin the timing and magnitude of the 67 SEP ground-level enhancements (GLEs)\nrecorded by neutron monitors since the mid 1950s.

There are insufficient data to conclusively determine whether larger\nsolar cycles produce more GLEs. Implications for putative space-weather events\nin the cosmogenic-isotope records are discussed. We find that GLEs tend to\ncluster within a few tens of days, likely due to particularly productive\nindividual active regions, and with approximately 11-year separations, owing to\nthe solar cycle ordering.

A hidden\nMarkov model is developed to decompose LC interactions into homogenous segments\nand reveal the temporal properties of these segments. Then, conditional mutual\ninformation is used to quantify the interaction intensity, and the graph\nstructure is used to characterize the connectivity between vehicles. Finally,\nthe critical vehicle in each dynamic interaction network is identified.

We show\nhow Feynman's path integral may be defined non-perturbatively, for such\ntheories, without a Wick rotation to imaginary time. We start by introducing a\nclass of smooth regulators which render interference integrals absolutely\nconvergent and thus unambiguous. The analyticity of the regulators allows us to\nuse Cauchy's theorem to deform the integration domain onto a set of relevant,\ncomplex \"thimbles\" (or generalized steepest descent contours) each associated\nwith a classical saddle. The regulator can then be removed to obtain an exact,\nnon-perturbative representation. We show why the usual method of gradient flow,\nused to identify relevant saddles and steepest descent \"thimbles\" for\nfinite-dimensional oscillatory integrals, fails in the infinite-dimensional\ncase.

This method allows for finding the Boltzmann distribution with\nsingle neuron biases and pairwise interactions that maximizes the entropy and\nreproduces the empirical statistics of the recorded neuronal activity. Here we\napply this strategy to large populations of retinal output neurons (ganglion\ncells) of different types, stimulated by multiple visual stimuli with their own\nstatistics. The activity of retinal output neurons is driven by both the inputs\nfrom upstream neurons and the recurrent connections. We first apply the\nstandard inverse Ising model approach, and show that it accounts well for the\nsystem's collective behavior when the input visual stimulus has short-ranged\nspatial correlations, but fails for long-ranged ones. This happens because\nstimuli with long-ranged spatial correlations synchronize the activity of\nneurons over long distances. This effect cannot be accounted for by pairwise\ninteractions, and so by the pairwise Ising model. To solve this issue, we apply\na previously proposed framework that includes a temporal dependence in the\nsingle neurons biases to model how neurons are driven in time by the stimulus.\nThanks to this addition, the stimulus effects are taken into account by the\nbiases, and the pairwise interactions allow for characterizing the network\neffect in the population activity and for reproducing the structure of the\nrecurrent functional connections in the retinal architecture. We found that the\nretinal architecture splits into weakly interacting subpopulations composed of\nstrongly interacting neurons.

This paper proposes a novel slip system\nidentification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip Systems based Local\nIdentification of Plasticity), in which the measured displacement gradient\nfields (from Digital Image Correlation) are locally matched to the kinematics\nof one or multiple combined theoretical slip systems, based on the measured\ncrystal orientations.

Experimental case studies on FCC and BCC metals show how full-field\nidentification of discrete slip, diffuse slip and cross-slip becomes feasible,\neven when considering 48 slip systems for BCC.

Our goal is to synthesize humans interacting with a given 3D\nscene controlled by high-level semantic specifications as pairs of action\ncategories and object instances, e.g., \"sit on the chair\". The key challenge of\nincorporating interaction semantics into the generation framework is to learn a\njoint representation that effectively captures heterogeneous information,\nincluding human body articulation, 3D object geometry, and the intent of the\ninteraction. To address this challenge, we design a novel transformer-based\ngenerative model, in which the articulated 3D human body surface points and 3D\nobjects are jointly encoded in a unified latent space, and the semantics of the\ninteraction between the human and objects are embedded via positional encoding.\nFurthermore, inspired by the compositional nature of interactions that humans\ncan simultaneously interact with multiple objects, we define interaction\nsemantics as the composition of varying numbers of atomic action-object pairs.\nOur proposed generative model can naturally incorporate varying numbers of\natomic interactions, which enables synthesizing compositional human-scene\ninteractions without requiring composite interaction data.

Unfortunately, scaling up multilayer\nhBN while precisely controlling the number of layers remains an elusive\nchallenge, resulting in a rough material unable to enhance the mobility of\ngraphene. This leads to the pursuit of alternative, scalable materials, which\ncan be simultaneously used as substrate and encapsulant for graphene.

Most of existing studies on adaptive\nsubmodular optimization focus on either monotone case or non-monotone case.\nSpecifically, if the utility function is monotone and adaptive submodular,\n\\cite{golovin2011adaptive} developed a greedy policy that achieves a $(1-1/e)$\napproximation ratio subject to a cardinality constraint. If the utility\nfunction is non-monotone and adaptive submodular, \\cite{tang2021beyond} showed\nthat a random greedy policy achieves a $1/e$ approximation ratio subject to a\ncardinality constraint. In this work, we aim to generalize the above mentioned\nresults by studying the partial-monotone adaptive submodular maximization\nproblem. To this end, we introduce the notation of adaptive monotonicity ratio\n$m\\in[0,1]$ to measure the degree of monotonicity of a function. Our main\nresult is to show that a random greedy policy achieves an approximation ratio\nof $m(1-1/e)+(1-m)(1/e)$ if the utility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and\nadaptive submodular. Notably this result recovers the aforementioned $(1-1/e)$\nand $1/e$ approximation ratios when $m = 0$ and $m = 1$, respectively. We\nfurther extend our results to consider a knapsack constraint. We show that a\nsampling-based policy achieves an approximation ratio of $(m+1)/10$ if the\nutility function is $m$-adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular. One\nimportant implication of our results is that even for a non-monotone utility\nfunction, we still can achieve an approximation ratio close to $(1-1/e)$ if\nthis function is ``close'' to a monotone function.

We evaluate variations of SSIVD-Net and Salient Classifier on our\nSCVD dataset and benchmark against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models commonly\nemployed in violence detection. Our approach exhibits significant improvements\nin detecting both weaponized and non-weaponized violence instances. By\nadvancing the SOTA in violence detection, our work offers a practical and\nscalable solution suitable for real-world applications. The proposed\nmethodology not only addresses the challenges of violence detection in CCTV\nfootage but also contributes to the understanding of weapon distribution in\nsmart surveillance. Ultimately, our research findings should enable smarter and\nmore secure cities, as well as enhance public safety measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 12:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 13:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 12:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 12:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 04:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 09:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Unfortunately, no established methods exist to\nmeasure how knowledge is distributed among development teams. Knowing how this\nknowledge evolves and is owned by key developers in a project helps managers\nreduce risks caused by turnover. To this end, this paper introduces a novel,\nrealistic representation of domain knowledge distribution: the ConceptRealm. To\nconstruct the ConceptRealm, we employ a latent Dirichlet allocation model to\nrepresent textual features obtained from 300k issues and 1.3M comments from 518\nopen-source projects. We analyze whether the newly emerged issues and\ndevelopers share similar concepts or how aligned the developers' concepts are\nwith the team over time. We also investigate the impact of leaving members on\nthe frequency of concepts. Finally, we evaluate the soundness of our approach\nto closed-source software, thus allowing the validation of the results from a\npractical standpoint. We find out that the ConceptRealm can represent the\nhigh-level domain knowledge within a team and can be utilized to predict the\nalignment of developers with issues. We also observe that projects exhibit many\nkeepers independent of project maturity and that abruptly leaving keepers harm\nthe team's concept familiarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 12:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The key idea here is to occlude a specific\nvolume of data by a 3D mask in an input 3D temporal-spatial data space and then\nmeasure the change degree in the output score. The occluded volume data that\nproduces a larger change degree is regarded as a more critical element for\nclassification. However, while the occlusion sensitivity analysis is commonly\nused to analyze single image classification, it is not so straightforward to\napply this idea to video classification as a simple fixed cuboid cannot deal\nwith the motions. To this end, we adapt the shape of a 3D occlusion mask to\ncomplicated motions of target objects. Our flexible mask adaptation is\nperformed by considering the temporal continuity and spatial co-occurrence of\nthe optical flows extracted from the input video data. We further propose to\napproximate our method by using the first-order partial derivative of the score\nwith respect to an input image to reduce its computational cost. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method through various and extensive comparisons with\nthe conventional methods in terms of the deletion/insertion metric and the\npointing metric on the UCF-101.

Federated learning (FL), as a revolutionary learning approach,\nenables collaborative AI model training across distributed mobile edge devices.\nBy exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels,\nover-the-air computation allows concurrent model uploading from massive devices\nover the same radio resources, and thus significantly reduces the communication\ncost of FL. In this paper, we study the coexistence of over-the-air FL and\ntraditional information transfer (IT) in a mobile edge network. We propose a\ncoexisting federated learning and information transfer (CFLIT) communication\nframework, where the FL and IT devices share the wireless spectrum in an OFDM\nsystem. Under this framework, we aim to maximize the IT data rate and guarantee\na given FL convergence performance by optimizing the long-term radio resource\nallocation. A key challenge that limits the spectrum efficiency of the\ncoexisting system lies in the large overhead incurred by frequent communication\nbetween the server and edge devices for FL model aggregation. To address the\nchallenge, we rigorously analyze the impact of the computation-to-communication\nratio on the convergence of over-the-air FL in wireless fading channels. The\nanalysis reveals the existence of an optimal computation-to-communication ratio\nthat minimizes the amount of radio resources needed for over-the-air FL to\nconverge to a given error tolerance. Based on the analysis, we propose a\nlow-complexity online algorithm to jointly optimize the radio resource\nallocation for both the FL devices and IT devices. Extensive numerical\nsimulations verify the superior performance of the proposed design for the\ncoexistence of FL and IT devices in wireless cellular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 13:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 07:53:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 07:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

In this context, we are particularly\ninterested in generalized quasi-topological gravities, i.e., theories whose\nequations of motion for statically spherically symmetric solutions are of\nsecond order at most. Here, we characterize the number of these theories\nexisting at a given curvature order and dimensions. Moreover, we show that any\neffective higher-curvature theory is connected, via field redefinitions to some\ngeneralized quasi-topological gravity. The situation is special for three\nspacetime dimensions, as theories of this type have trivial equations of\nmotion. However, when matter fields are added into the picture, the equations\nof motion become non-trivial, describing, among other solutions,\nmultiparametric generalizations of the Ba\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole.\n  From the CFT side, entanglement entropy arises as a prominent quantity that\nencodes important information about the field theory, such as the type A and\ntype B trace anomalies in even dimensions and the sphere free energy of the\ntheory in odd dimensions when considering spherical entangling regions. As\nentanglement entropy also includes divergences, we employ the Kounterterms\nscheme to extract the physically relevant quantities. In the case of\nthree-dimensional CFTs dual to Einstein gravity, we show that the finite part\nis isolated and can be written in terms of the Willmore energy, providing an\nupper bound based on its properties. We extend this remarkable result to\narbitrary CFTs under consideration. Besides, we show the validity of the\nKounterterms scheme for general quadratic curvature gravity, extracting the\ntype A, type B anomalies of the theory in even dimensions and the sphere free\nenergy in odd ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 13:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

We propose a new primal-dual algorithm, in which the dual update is\nrandomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the\nproblem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen\ndual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the\nproximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A\nnonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm\nfinds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth\nfunctions, possibly composed with linear operators. We derive linear\nconvergence results in presence of strong convexity; these results are new even\nin the deterministic case, when our algorithms reverts to the recently proposed\nPrimal-Dual Davis-Yin algorithm. Some randomized algorithms of the literature\nare also recovered as particular cases (e.g., Point-SAGA). But our\nrandomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms\nbeyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the\nconvergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction\nmechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is\nused.

The sparks lag behind the co-rotation speed during their\nlifetimes due to variable $E$x$B$ drift. In a PSG the sparking discharges arise\nin locations where the surface temperatures go below the critical level ($T_i$)\nfor ions to freely flow from the surface. The sparking commences due to the\nlarge potential drop developing along the magnetic field lines in these lower\ntemperature regions and subsequently the back streaming particles heat the\nsurface to $T_i$. The temperature regulation requires the polar cap to be\ntightly filled with sparks and a continuous presence of sparks is required\naround its boundary since no heating is possible from the closed field line\nregion. We have estimated the time evolution of the sparking system in the IAR\nwhich shows a gradual shift in the spark formation along two distinct\ndirections resembling clockwise and anti-clockwise motion in two halves of the\npolar cap.

The enhancement of the gravitational acceleration can\nhave a meaningful impact on the scaling relations as well as on the halo\nmorphology. The galaxy rotational velocity field (calculated with the velocity\nof the gas disc and the acceleration fields) deviates from the typical values\nof the Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) in GR. For a given stellar mass, f(R)\ngravity tends to produce greater maximum velocities. On the other hand, the\nmass in haloes in f(R) gravity is more concentrated than their counterparts in\nGR. This trend changes when the concentration is calculated with the dynamical\ndensity profile, which takes into account the unscreened outer regions of the\nhalo. Stellar discs interact with the overall potential well in the central\nregions, modifying the morphology of the screening regions and reshaping them.\nWe find a trend for galaxies with a more dominant stellar disc to deviate\nfurther from round screening regions.

The real-world degradations can be beyond the simulation\nscope by the handcrafted degradations, which are referred to as novel\ndegradations. In this work, we propose to learn a latent representation space\nfor degradations, which can be generalized from handcrafted (base) degradations\nto novel degradations. The obtained representations for a novel degradation in\nthis latent space are then leveraged to generate degraded images consistent\nwith the novel degradation to compose paired training data for SR model.\nFurthermore, we perform variational inference to match the posterior of\ndegradations in latent representation space with a prior distribution (e.g.,\nGaussian distribution).

This paper presents contextual text\ndetection, a new setup that detects CTBs for better understanding of texts in\nscenes. We formulate the new setup by a dual detection task which first detects\nintegral text units and then groups them into a CTB.

This usually leads to imprecise estimates and inaccurate\npredictions in such a three-on-three game. With the finding of a clustering\nfeature in estimated robot strengths, a more flexible model with latent\nclusters of robots was proposed to alleviate overparameterization of the WMPR\nmodel. Since its structure can be regarded as a dimension reduction of the\nparameter space in the WMPR model, the identification of clusters of robot\nstrengths is naturally transformed into a model selection problem. Instead of\ncomparing a huge number of competing models, we develop an effective method to\nestimate the number of clusters, clusters of robots, and robot strengths. The\nnew method consists of two parts: (i) a combination of hierarchical and\nnon-hierarchical classifications to determine candidate models; and (ii)\nvariant goodness-of-fit criteria to select optimal models. Different from\nexisting hierarchical classification systems, each step of ours is based on\nestimated robot strengths from a candidate model in the preceding\nnon-hierarchical classification step. A great advantage of the designed\nnon-hierarchical classification system is to examine the possibility of\nreassigning robots to other cluster sets of robots. To reduce the\noverestimation of clusters by the mean squared prediction error criteria, the\ncorresponding BIC are established as alternatives for model selection.

Moreover, few samples for pixel-level\nsegmentation on new classes lead to notorious overfitting issues in each\nlearning session. In this paper, we explicitly represent class-based knowledge\nfor semantic segmentation as a category embedding and a hyper-class embedding,\nwhere the former describes exclusive semantical properties, and the latter\nexpresses hyper-class knowledge as class-shared semantic properties. Aiming to\nsolve IFSS problems, we present EHNet, i.e., Embedding adaptive-update and\nHyper-class representation Network from two aspects. First, we propose an\nembedding adaptive-update strategy to avoid feature drift, which maintains old\nknowledge by hyper-class representation, and adaptively update category\nembeddings with a class-attention scheme to involve new classes learned in\nindividual sessions. Second, to resist overfitting issues caused by few\ntraining samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category\nembeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new\nclass for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge,\nthus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale. Significantly,\nthese two designs provide representation capability for classes with sufficient\nsemantics and limited biases, enabling to perform segmentation tasks requiring\nhigh semantic dependence.

These\ntwo prevalent strategies in MOT implicitly assume that the classification\nperformance is near-perfect. However, this is far from the case in recent\nlarge-scale MOT datasets, which contain large numbers of classes with many rare\nor semantically similar categories. Therefore, the resulting inaccurate\nclassification leads to sub-optimal tracking and inadequate benchmarking of\ntrackers. We address these issues by disentangling classification from\ntracking. We introduce a new metric, Track Every Thing Accuracy (TETA),\nbreaking tracking measurement into three sub-factors: localization,\nassociation, and classification, allowing comprehensive benchmarking of\ntracking performance even under inaccurate classification. TETA also deals with\nthe challenging incomplete annotation problem in large-scale tracking datasets.\nWe further introduce a Track Every Thing tracker (TETer), that performs\nassociation using Class Exemplar Matching (CEM). Our experiments show that TETA\nevaluates trackers more comprehensively, and TETer achieves significant\nimprovements on the challenging large-scale datasets BDD100K and TAO compared\nto the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 15:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

However, recent attempts to address the problem of single image\nsuper-resolution (SISR) with lookup tables are highly constrained by the small\nreceptive field size. Besides, their frameworks of single-layer lookup tables\nlimit the extension and generalization capacities of the model. In this paper,\nwe propose a framework of series-parallel lookup tables (SPLUT) to alleviate\nthe above issues and achieve efficient image super-resolution. On the one hand,\nwe cascade multiple lookup tables to enlarge the receptive field of each\nextracted feature vector. On the other hand, we propose a parallel network\nwhich includes two branches of cascaded lookup tables which process different\ncomponents of the input low-resolution images. By doing so, the two branches\ncollaborate with each other and compensate for the precision loss of\ndiscretizing input pixels when establishing lookup tables.

Furthermore, we no longer need interpolation\nmethods which introduce redundant computations so that our method can achieve\nfaster inference speed.

Because of limited and delayed data sharing,\nCF programs need a reliable method to track infection rates. There are three\ncomplex structures in CF registry data: recurrent infections, missing data, and\nmultilevel correlation due to repeated measures within a patient and\npatient-to-patient transmissions. A step-by-step analysis pipeline was proposed\nto develop and validate a risk-adjusted model to help healthcare programs\nmonitor the number of recurrent events while taking into account missing data\nand the hierarchies of repeated measures in right-censored data.
