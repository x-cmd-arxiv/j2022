For T\\bar{T} deformation, we find that the\nleading order correction of entanglement entropy is proportional to the\nexpectation value of the undeformed modular Hamiltonian. As a check, in the\nhigh/low-temperature limit, the entanglement entropy coincides with that\nobtained by the replica trick in the literature. Following the same\nperturbative strategy, we obtain the entanglement entropy of the free fermion\nvacuum state up to second-order by inserting a local bilinear operator\ndeformation in a moving mirror set- ting. In the uniformly accelerated mirror,\nthe first-order and second-order correction of entanglement entropy vanishes in\nthe late time limit. For mass deformation, we derive the entanglement entropy\nup to first-order deformation and comment on the second-order correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 16:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In an effort to achieve an energy-conserving RAN, this paper\ndevelops a dynamic on-off switching paradigm, where the ON/OFF states of gNBs\ncan be dynamically configured according to the evolvements of the associated\nusers. We formulate the dynamic sleep control for a cluster of gNBs as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) and analyze various switching policies to reduce the\nenergy expenditure. The optimal policy of the MDP that minimizes the energy\nexpenditure can be derived from dynamic programming, but the computation is\nexpensive. To circumvent this issue, this paper puts forth a greedy policy and\nan index policy for gNB sleep control. When there is no constraint on the\nnumber of gNBs that can be turned off, we prove the dual-threshold structure of\nthe greedy policy and analyze its connections with the optimal policy. Inspired\nby the dual-threshold structure and Whittle index, we develop an index policy\nby decoupling the original MDP into multiple one-dimensional MDPs -- the\nindexability of the decoupled MDP is proven and an algorithm to compute the\nindex is proposed. Extensive simulation results verify that the index policy\nexhibits close-to-optimal performance in terms of the energy expenditure of the\ngNB cluster. As far as the computational complexity is concerned, on the other\nhand, the index policy is much more efficient than the optimal policy, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive when the number of gNBs is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 16:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

However, there are few existing\nsnapshot systems, none of which is open source. To address this, we developed\nSnapperGPS, a fully open-source, low-cost, and low-power location tracking\nsystem designed for wildlife tracking. SnapperGPS comprises three parts, all of\nwhich are open-source: (i) a small, low-cost, and low-power receiver; (ii) a\nweb application to configure the receiver via USB; and (iii) a cloud-based\nplatform for processing recorded data.

The\nreceiver records very short and low-resolution samples resulting in\nparticularly low power consumption, outperforming existing systems. It can run\nfor more than a year on a 40 mAh battery.

In\nweakly twisted magnetic tubes, the KHi is able to grow nonlinearly and,\nsubsequently, turbulence is driven in the coronal loop in a similar manner as\nin the untwisted case. Provided that magnetic twist remains weak, the effect of\nmagnetic twist is to delay the onset of the KHi and to slow down the\ndevelopment of turbulence.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel DualNorm module after the sampling-grouping operation to effectively and\nefficiently address the irregularity issue. The DualNorm module consists of\nPoint Normalization, which normalizes the grouped points to the sampled points,\nand Reverse Point Normalization, which normalizes the sampled points to the\ngrouped points. The proposed framework, PointNorm, utilizes local mean and\nglobal standard deviation to benefit from both local and global features while\nmaintaining a faithful inference speed. Experiments show that we achieved\nexcellent accuracy and efficiency on ModelNet40 classification, ScanObjectNN\nclassification, ShapeNetPart Part Segmentation, and S3DIS Semantic\nSegmentation.

Experience shows that a na\\\"{i}ve marking policy\nleads to inefficient use of computational resources for adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR). Consequently, using AFEM in practice often involves ad-hoc or\ntime-consuming offline parameter tuning to set appropriate parameters for the\nmarking subroutine. To address these practical concerns, we recast AMR as a\nMarkov decision process in which refinement parameters can be selected\non-the-fly at run time, without the need for pre-tuning by expert users. In\nthis new paradigm, the refinement parameters are also chosen adaptively via a\nmarking policy that can be optimized using methods from reinforcement learning.\nWe use the Poisson equation to demonstrate our techniques on $h$- and\n$hp$-refinement benchmark problems, and our experiments suggest that superior\nmarking policies remain undiscovered for many classical AFEM applications.\nFurthermore, an unexpected observation from this work is that marking policies\ntrained on one family of PDEs are sometimes robust enough to perform well on\nproblems far outside the training family. For illustration, we show that a\nsimple $hp$-refinement policy trained on 2D domains with only a single\nre-entrant corner can be deployed on far more complicated 2D domains, and even\n3D domains, without significant performance loss. For reproduction and broader\nadoption, we accompany this work with an open-source implementation of our\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 16:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

These surfaces are described by two roughness descriptors,\nnamely, relative roughness (Rr) and fractal dimension (FD). The contact\nbehaviour of rough spheres with a rigid flat surface is simulated using FEM to\nquantify the influences of surface structure and sphere morphology by focusing\non contact stiffness and true contact area. The dependence of normal contact\nstiffness (k) on applied normal force (F) is found to follow a power law over\nfour orders of magnitude, with both alpha and beta being highly correlated with\nRr and FD. With increasing load, the power exponent converges to that of\nHertzian contact, e.g., 1/3, independent of Rr. Regions of true contact evolve\nthrough the formation of new microcontacts and their progressive merging,\nmeanwhile the area distributions of contact island induced by various forces\ntend to obey similar Weibull distributions due to fractal nature in their\nsurfaces. Contacts with larger values of Rr are found to produce contact\ncontours with higher fractal dimension as calculated by a 2D box-counting\nmethod. Our results suggest that the correlation between radial lengths in a\nquasi spherical particle should be considered in studying contact behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 17:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

However, the inherited iterative\nsampling process costs hinder their applications to text-to-speech deployment.\nThrough the preliminary study on diffusion model parameterization, we find that\nprevious gradient-based TTS models require hundreds or thousands of iterations\nto guarantee high sample quality, which poses a challenge for accelerating\nsampling. In this work, we propose ProDiff, on progressive fast diffusion model\nfor high-quality text-to-speech. Unlike previous work estimating the gradient\nfor data density, ProDiff parameterizes the denoising model by directly\npredicting clean data to avoid distinct quality degradation in accelerating\nsampling. To tackle the model convergence challenge with decreased diffusion\niterations, ProDiff reduces the data variance in the target site via knowledge\ndistillation. Specifically, the denoising model uses the generated\nmel-spectrogram from an N-step DDIM teacher as the training target and distills\nthe behavior into a new model with N/2 steps. As such, it allows the TTS model\nto make sharp predictions and further reduces the sampling time by orders of\nmagnitude. Our evaluation demonstrates that ProDiff needs only 2 iterations to\nsynthesize high-fidelity mel-spectrograms, while it maintains sample quality\nand diversity competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps.\nProDiff enables a sampling speed of 24x faster than real-time on a single\nNVIDIA 2080Ti GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to\ntext-to-speech synthesis deployment for the first time.

This task is very challenging since\nminor parametric deviation may lead to noticeable misalignment between the\nestimated mesh and the input image. Moreover, when integrating part-specific\nestimations into the full-body model, existing solutions tend to either degrade\nthe alignment or produce unnatural wrist poses. To address these issues, we\npropose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression\nnetwork for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it as PyMAF-X for the\nrecovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage\na feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the\nmesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted\nparameters, mesh-aligned evidence will be extracted from finer-resolution\nfeatures accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the\nalignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide\nmesh-image correspondence guidance while spatial alignment attention is\nintroduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When\nextending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy\nis proposed in PyMAF-X to produce natural wrist poses while maintaining the\nwell-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations.

Existing visual reasoning\napproaches typically utilize supervised methods to extract 2D segmentation\nmasks on which concepts are grounded. In contrast, humans are capable of\ngrounding concepts on the underlying 3D representation of images. However,\ntraditionally inferred 3D representations (e.g., point clouds, voxelgrids, and\nmeshes) cannot capture continuous 3D features flexibly, thus making it\nchallenging to ground concepts to 3D regions based on the language description\nof the object being referred to. To address both issues, we propose to leverage\nthe continuous, differentiable nature of neural fields to segment and learn\nconcepts. Specifically, each 3D coordinate in a scene is represented as a\nhigh-dimensional descriptor. Concept grounding can then be performed by\ncomputing the similarity between the descriptor vector of a 3D coordinate and\nthe vector embedding of a language concept, which enables segmentations and\nconcept learning to be jointly learned on neural fields in a differentiable\nfashion. As a result, both 3D semantic and instance segmentations can emerge\ndirectly from question answering supervision using a set of defined neural\noperators on top of neural fields (e.g., filtering and counting). Experimental\nresults show that our proposed framework outperforms\nunsupervised/language-mediated segmentation models on semantic and instance\nsegmentation tasks, as well as outperforms existing models on the challenging\n3D aware visual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our framework can generalize well\nto unseen shape categories and real scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 17:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

In this perspective we explore decoding algorithms for the\nsurface code; a prototypical quantum low-density parity-check code that\nunderlies many of the leading efforts to demonstrate scalable quantum\ncomputing. Central to our discussion is the minimum-weight perfect-matching\ndecoder. The decoder works by exploiting underlying structure that arises due\nto materialised symmetries among surface-code stabilizer elements. By\nconcentrating on these symmetries, we begin to address the question of how a\nminimum-weight perfect-matching decoder might be generalised for other types of\ncode. We approach this question first by investigating examples of matching\ndecoders for other codes. These include decoding algorithms that have been\nspecialised to correct for noise models that demonstrate a particular structure\nor bias with respect to certain types of code. In addition to this, we propose\na systematic way of constructing a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for\ncodes with certain characteristic properties. The properties we make use of are\ncommon among topological codes. We discuss the broader applicability of the\nproposal, and we suggest some questions we can address that may show us how to\ndesign a generalised matching decoder for arbitrary stabilizer codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Quantum error correction offers a path to\nalgorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many\nphysical qubits, where increasing the number of physical qubits enhances\nprotection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also\nincreases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be\nsufficiently low in order for logical performance to improve with increasing\ncode size. Here, we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling\nacross multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting\nqubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from\nincreasing qubit number. We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit\nmodestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, both\nin terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per\ncycle ($2.914\\%\\pm 0.016\\%$ compared to $3.028\\%\\pm 0.023\\%$).

To overcome the challenge, this paper\npresents an end-to-end physics-driven approach that is efficient and can\ngeneralize to real-world turbulence. On the data synthesis front, we\nsignificantly increase the image resolution that can be handled by the SOTA\nturbulence simulator by approximating the random field via wide-sense\nstationarity. The new data synthesis process enables the generation of\nlarge-scale multi-level turbulence and ground truth pairs for training.

Current practice is to force all inverters to shut down during\nfault conditions, weakening resilience and reducing reliability. Dynamic state\nestimation (DSE), which has been explored for both line protection and load bus\nprotection before, is a potential solution to these challenges to create widely\nutilizable, highly reliable protection systems.

This shows that the molecular ring, forming the\nwaist of the bipolar nebula, expands with a velocity of 1 - 1.9 km s$^{-1}$. We\nalso observe an increased linewidth in the ring indicating that turbulence is\ndriven by energy injection from the stellar feedback. The bipolar cavity hosts\nblue-shifted expanding [CII] shells at 5.2$\\pm$0.5$\\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$\n(statistical and systematic uncertainty) which indicates that expansion out of\nthe dense gas happens non-uniformly and that the observed bipolar phase might\nbe relatively short ($\\sim$0.2 Myr). The X-ray observations show diffuse\nemission that traces a hot plasma, created by stellar winds, in and around RCW\n36. At least 50 \\% of the stellar wind energy is missing in RCW 36. This is\nlikely due to leakage which is clearing even larger cavities around the bipolar\nRCW 36 region.

This could be driven by stellar winds and/or radiation\npressure, but remains difficult to constrain. This local mass ejection, which\ncan remove all mass within 1 pc of RCW 36 in 1-2 Myr, and the large-scale\nclearing of ambient gas in the Vela C cloud indicates that stellar feedback\nplays a significant role in suppressing the star formation efficiency (SFE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 19:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

For\ninstance, spin-orbit interactions affect the magnetization and transport\ndynamics in solids, while spins and momenta are locked in topological matter.\nAlternatively, spin-orbit entanglement may play an important role in exotic\nphenomena, like quantum spin liquids in 4d and 5d systems. An interesting\nquestion is how electronic states mixed by spin orbit coupling interact with\nelectromagnetic fields, which may hold potential to tune their properties and\nreveal interesting physics. Motivated by our recent discovery of large\ngyrotropic signals in some Jahn-Teller manganites, here we explore the\ninteraction of light with spin-mixed states in a d4 transition metal. We show\nthat spin-orbit mixing enables electronic transitions that are sensitive to\ncircularly polarized light, giving rise to a gyrotropic response that increases\nwith spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, photoexcited transitions that involve\nspin reversal are behind such gyrotropic resonances. Additionally, we find that\nthe interaction with the electromagnetic field depends strongly on the relative\norientation of the propagation of light with respect to Jahn-Teller distortions\nand spin quantization. We suggest that such interactions offer the opportunity\nto use electromagnetic waves at optical wavelengths to entangle orbital and\nspin degrees of freedom.

Mechanisms of surgical failure\ndiscriminate surgical outcome groups (Abnormalities not targeted: AUC=0.80,\nPartial resection of the epileptogenic zone: AUC=0.68, Insufficient cortical\nabnormality impact: AUC=0.64).

These results can likely be explained\nthrough a combination of an unusually high covering factor for reflection, and\nfluxes that are seen out of phase owing to light travel times.

However, the design of model architecture remains an open question: In\ngeneral, learning all tasks with a shared set of parameters suffers from severe\ninterference between tasks; while learning each task with a dedicated parameter\nsubspace is limited by scalability. In this work, we theoretically analyze the\ngeneralization errors for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual\nlearning, which can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task\ndistributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space.\nThen, inspired by the robust biological learning system that processes\nsequential experiences with multiple parallel compartments, we propose\nCooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL) as a general strategy for\ncontinual learning. Specifically, we present an architecture with a fixed\nnumber of narrower sub-networks to learn all incremental tasks in parallel,\nwhich can naturally reduce the two errors through improving the three\ncomponents of the upper bound. To strengthen this advantage, we encourage to\ncooperate these sub-networks by penalizing the difference of predictions made\nby their feature representations.

The bewildering\nexplanations advanced during the construction of quantum mechanics are shown to\nhave distanced the new theory from the rest of scientific knowledge, by\nintroducing indeterminism, acausality, nonlocality, and even subjectivism as\npart of its interpretative framework. The conclusion drawn from this\nunsatisfactory interpretative landscape is that quantum mechanics lacks a key\nontological ingredient. Arguments are given in favour of the random zero-point\nradiation field (ZPF) as the element needed to complete the quantum ontology.\nThe (wave-mediated) quantum stochastic process is shown to be essentially\ndifferent from Brownian motion, and more amenable to an analogy with the\nhydrodynamic case. The new perspective provided by the introduction of the ZPF\nis used to explain some salient features of quantum systems, such as the\nstationary atomic states and the transitions between them, and the apparent\nnonlocality expressed in the entangled states. Notably, the permanent presence\nof the field drastically affects the dynamics of the (otherwise classical)\nparticle, which eventually falls under the control of the field. This\nqualitative change is reflected in the transition from the initial classical\ndescription in space-time, to the final quantum one in the Hilbert space. The\nclarification of the mechanism of quantization leads us to consider the\npossibility that a similar phenomenon occurs in other physical systems of\ncorpuscles subjected to an oscillating background, of which the walking-droplet\nsystem is a paradigmatic example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Traditionally, extending the FOV of CT is considered as\na CT reconstruction problem using limited data. However, this approach relies\non the projection domain data which might not be available in application. In\nthis work, we formulate the problem from the semantic image extension\nperspective which only requires image data as inputs.

We evaluate our algorithm on several benchmarks for\nintelligent transportation systems, which are connected autonomous vehicle\ncontrol tasks (Flow and CACC) and adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC).\nEmpirically results show that our method achieves superior data efficiency and\nmatches the performance of model-free methods using true models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 19:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

In this study, we propose a biophysical feature based machine\nlearning method for breast cancer detection to improve the performance beyond a\nbenchmark deep learning algorithm and to furthermore provide a color overlay\nvisual map of the probability of malignancy within a lesion. This overall\nframework is termed disease specific imaging. Previously, 150 breast lesions\nwere segmented and classified utilizing a modified fully convolutional network\nand a modified GoogLeNet, respectively. In this study multiparametric analysis\nwas performed within the contoured lesions. Features were extracted from\nultrasound radiofrequency, envelope, and log compressed data based on\nbiophysical and morphological models. The support vector machine with a\nGaussian kernel constructed a nonlinear hyperplane, and we calculated the\ndistance between the hyperplane and data point of each feature in\nmultiparametric space. The distance can quantitatively assess a lesion, and\nsuggest the probability of malignancy that is color coded and overlaid onto B\nmode images. Training and evaluation were performed on in vivo patient data.\nThe overall accuracy for the most common types and sizes of breast lesions in\nour study exceeded 98.0% for classification and 0.98 for an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve, which is more precise than the\nperformance of radiologists and a deep learning system. Further, the\ncorrelation between the probability and BI RADS enables a quantitative\nguideline to predict breast cancer. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed\nframework can help radiologists achieve more accurate and convenient breast\ncancer classification and detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

A critical\ntask of performing a network meta-analysis is to offer ranks of all available\ntreatment options for a specific disease outcome. Frequently, the estimated\ntreatment rankings are accompanied by a large amount of uncertainty, suffer\nfrom multiplicity issues, and rarely permit ties. These issues make\ninterpreting rankings problematic as they are often treated as absolute\nmetrics. To address these shortcomings, we formulate a ranking strategy that\nadapts to scenarios with high order uncertainty by producing more conservative\nresults. This improves the interpretability while simultaneously accounting for\nmultiple comparisons. To admit ties between treatment effects, we also develop\na Bayesian Nonparametric approach for network meta-analysis. The approach\ncapitalizes on the induced clustering mechanism of Bayesian Nonparametric\nmethods producing a positive probability that two treatment effects are equal.\nWe demonstrate the utility of the procedure through numerical experiments and a\nnetwork meta-analysis designed to study antidepressant treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 23:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

The ability to train policies in simulation enables safe exploration\nand large-scale data collection quickly at low cost. However, prior works in\nsim-to-real transfer of robotic policies typically do not involve any\nhuman-robot interaction because accurately simulating human behavior is an open\nproblem. In this work, our goal is to leverage the power of simulation to train\nrobotic policies that are proficient at interacting with humans upon\ndeployment. But there is a chicken and egg problem -- how to gather examples of\na human interacting with a physical robot so as to model human behavior in\nsimulation without already having a robot that is able to interact with a\nhuman? Our proposed method, Iterative-Sim-to-Real (i-S2R), attempts to address\nthis. i-S2R bootstraps from a simple model of human behavior and alternates\nbetween training in simulation and deploying in the real world. In each\niteration, both the human behavior model and the policy are refined. For all\ntraining we apply a new evolutionary search algorithm called Blackbox Gradient\nSensing (BGS). We evaluate our method on a real world robotic table tennis\nsetting, where the objective for the robot is to play cooperatively with a\nhuman player for as long as possible. Table tennis is a high-speed, dynamic\ntask that requires the two players to react quickly to each other's moves,\nmaking for a challenging test bed for research on human-robot interaction. We\npresent results on an industrial robotic arm that is able to cooperatively play\ntable tennis with human players, achieving rallies of 22 successive hits on\naverage and 150 at best. Further, for 80% of players, rally lengths are 70% to\n175% longer compared to the sim-to-real plus fine-tuning (S2R+FT) baseline.

Traffic and safety characteristics of toll plazas are\ndifferent from that of other road entities. Different conflict risk indicators,\nwhich are usually longitudinal, have been adopted for real-time safety\nassessment. In this study, correlated grouped random parameter logit models\nwith heterogeneity in the means are established to capture the unobserved\nheterogeneity, with additional flexibility, at road user level for the\nassociation between conflict risk and influencing factors. In addition,\nmodified conflict risk indicator is developed to assess the safety of\ndiverging, merging, and weaving movements of traffic, with which vehicles'\ndimensions (width and length), and longitudinal and angular movements are\nconsidered. Also, prevalence and severity of both rear-end and sideswipe\nconflicts are assessed.

Unlike a single\nneural network structure which only takes one stain type as input to digitally\noutput images of another stain type, C-DNN first uses virtual staining to\ntransform autofluorescence microscopy images into H&E and then performs stain\ntransfer from H&E to the domain of the other stain in a cascaded manner. This\ncascaded structure in the training phase allows the model to directly exploit\nhistochemically stained image data on both H&E and the target special stain of\ninterest. This advantage alleviates the challenge of paired data acquisition\nand improves the image quality and color accuracy of the virtual stain transfer\nfrom H&E to another stain. We validated the superior performance of this C-DNN\napproach using kidney needle core biopsy tissue sections and successfully\ntransferred the H&E-stained tissue images into virtual PAS (periodic\nacid-Schiff) stain.

Our method can detect\nunobserved cluster centers of the epidemics, and estimate the space-time range\nof the clusters that are useful to construct a warning system. Furthermore, our\nmodel can measure the impact of different types of landmarks in the city, which\nprovides an intuitive explanation of disease spreading sources from different\ntime points. To efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the disease\npatterns, we employ a sequential approach that uses the posterior distribution\nof the parameters for the previous time step as the prior information for the\ncurrent time step. This approach enables us to incorporate time dependence into\nour model in a computationally efficient manner without complicating the model\nstructure. We also develop a model assessment by comparing the data with\ntheoretical densities, and outline the goodness-of-fit of our fitted model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 01:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Recently,\nvarious deep learning (DL)-based conventional SEI methods have been proposed,\nand achieved advanced performances. However, these methods are proposed for\nclose-set scenarios with massive RF signal samples for training, and they\ngenerally have poor performance under the condition of limited training\nsamples. Thus, we focus on few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) for aircraft identification\nvia automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, and a novel\nFS-SEI method is proposed, based on deep metric ensemble learning (DMEL).\nSpecifically, the proposed method consists of feature embedding and\nclassification.

However, they usually require heavy\ncross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result,\nmaking them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that\ncan help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the\ncomputational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight\nthat comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of\nrepresentations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a\nlocally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation,\nwhere the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the\nlatter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global context\ncues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to\ninvestigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and\nthen refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and\nlight-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can\nboost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive\nexperimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is\ncompatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection\naccuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision and reduce their\ncomplexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance more efficiently.

In this paper, we propose a new perspective that regards the SISR as a\nsemantic image detail enhancement problem to generate semantically reasonable\nHR image that are faithful to the ground truth. To enhance the semantic\naccuracy and the visual quality of the reconstructed image, we explore the\nmulti-modal fusion learning in SISR by proposing a Text-Guided Super-Resolution\n(TGSR) framework, which can effectively utilize the information from the text\nand image modalities. Different from existing methods, the proposed TGSR could\ngenerate HR image details that match the text descriptions through a\ncoarse-to-fine process. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate\nthe effect of the TGSR, which exploits the text reference to recover realistic\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 01:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Quantifying the relations (e.g., similarity or difference) between\ncomplex networks paves the way for understanding the latent information shared\nacross networks. However, fundamental metrics of relations, such as information\ndivergence, mutual information, Fisher information, and causality, are not\nwell-defined between complex networks. As a compromise, commonly used\nstrategies (e.g., network embedding, matching, and kernel approaches) measure\nnetwork relations in data-driven ways. These approaches are\ncomputation-oriented and inapplicable to analytic derivations in mathematics\nand physics. To resolve these issues, we present a theory to derive an optimal\ncharacterization of network topological properties. Our theory shows that a\nnetwork can be fully represented by a Gaussian variable defined by a function\nof the discrete Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator (i.e., the Laplacian), which\nsimultaneously satisfies network-topology-dependent smoothness and maximum\nentropy properties. Based on this characterization, we can analytically measure\ndiverse relations between complex networks in terms of topology properties.

To address this problem, we\npropose a continuous facial motion deblurring network based on GAN (CFMD-GAN),\nwhich is a novel framework for restoring the continuous moment latent in a\nsingle motion-blurred face image with a single network and a single training\nstage. To stabilize the network training, we train the generator to restore\ncontinuous moments in the order determined by our facial motion-based\nreordering process (FMR) utilizing domain-specific knowledge of the face.\nMoreover, we propose an auxiliary regressor that helps our generator produce\nmore accurate images by estimating continuous sharp moments.

However, we notice that existing\nmethods totally ignore the training data in the source domain, leading to\nsub-optimal solutions for unpaired I2I. To this end, we propose energy-guided\nstochastic differential equations (EGSDE) that employs an energy function\npretrained on both the source and target domains to guide the inference process\nof a pretrained SDE for realistic and faithful unpaired I2I. Building upon two\nfeature extractors, we carefully design the energy function such that it\nencourages the transferred image to preserve the domain-independent features\nand discard domain-specific ones. Further, we provide an alternative\nexplanation of the EGSDE as a product of experts, where each of the three\nexperts (corresponding to the SDE and two feature extractors) solely\ncontributes to faithfulness or realism. Empirically, we compare EGSDE to a\nlarge family of baselines on three widely-adopted unpaired I2I tasks under four\nmetrics.

A promising approach to\nhigh-dimensional likelihood-free inference involves estimating low-dimensional\nmarginal posteriors by conditioning only on summary statistics believed to be\ninformative for the low-dimensional component, and then combining the\nlow-dimensional approximations in some way. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nsuch low-dimensional approximations can be surprisingly poor in practice for\nseemingly intuitive summary statistic choices. We describe an idealized\nlow-dimensional summary statistic that is, in principle, suitable for marginal\nestimation.

Given an initial choice\nof low-dimensional summary statistic that might only be informative about a\nmarginal posterior location, the new method improves performance by first\ncrudely localising the posterior approximation using all the summary statistics\nto ensure global identifiability, followed by a second step that hones in on an\naccurate low-dimensional approximation using the low-dimensional summary\nstatistic.

Nevertheless, recent deep-learning-based\nmethods minimize the point-to-point distances. In contrast to these methods,\nthis paper proposes the first deep-learning-based approach to point-to-plane\nregistration. A challenging part of this problem is that a typical solution for\npoint-to-plane registration requires an iterative process of accumulating small\ntransformations obtained by minimizing a linearized energy function. The\niteration significantly increases the size of the computation graph needed for\nbackpropagation and can slow down both forward and backward network\nevaluations. To solve this problem, we consider the estimated rigid\ntransformation as a function of input point clouds and derive its analytic\ngradients using the implicit function theorem. The analytic gradient that we\nintroduce is independent of how the error minimizing function (i.e., the rigid\ntransformation) is obtained, thus allowing us to calculate both the rigid\ntransformation and its gradient efficiently. We implement the proposed\npoint-to-plane registration module over several previous methods that minimize\npoint-to-point distances and demonstrate that the extensions outperform the\nbase methods even with point clouds with noise and low-quality point normals\nestimated with local point distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 05:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

This pest has been\nnearly eradicated; however, southern part of Texas still faces this issue and\nis always prone to the pest reinfestation each year due to its sub-tropical\nclimate where cotton plants can grow year-round. Volunteer cotton (VC) plants\ngrowing in the fields of inter-seasonal crops, like corn, can serve as hosts to\nthese pests once they reach pin-head square stage (5-6 leaf stage) and\ntherefore need to be detected, located, and destroyed or sprayed . In this\npaper, we present a study to detect VC plants in a corn field using YOLOv3 on\nthree band aerial images collected by unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The\ntwo-fold objectives of this paper were : (i) to determine whether YOLOv3 can be\nused for VC detection in a corn field using RGB (red, green, and blue) aerial\nimages collected by UAS and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on\nimages at three different scales (320 x 320, S1; 416 x 416, S2; and 512 x 512,\nS3 pixels) based on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP) and\nF1-score at 95% confidence level.

The lack of significant\ndifferences of mAP at all the three scales indicated that the trained YOLOv3\nmodel can be used on a computer vision-based remotely piloted aerial\napplication system (RPAAS) for VC detection and spray application in near\nreal-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 05:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Each transaction begins with an invocation from an\nexternal user to a smart contract. Contracts have local storage and can call\nother contracts, and more importantly, they store, send and receive\ncryptocurrency.

With the learned model and embeddings, subgraphs are sampled in a\nhighly scalable and parallel way and the frequency distribution estimation is\nthen performed based on these sampled subgraphs. Eventually, our methods\nachieve comparable accuracy and a significant speedup by three orders of\nmagnitude compared to existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 06:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Interesting spectral features have\nbeen observed in both all-electron and nuclei spectra. However, the\ninterpretation of the results is compromised by the disagreements between the\ndata obtained from the various experiments, that are not reconcilable with the\nquoted experimental uncertainties. Understanding the reason for the discrepancy\namong the measurements is of fundamental importance in view of the forthcoming\nhigh-energy cosmic-ray experiments planned for space, as well as for the\ncorrect interpretation of the available results. The purpose of this work is to\ninvestigate the possibility that a systematic effect may derive from the\nnon-proportionality of the light response of inorganic crystals, typically used\nin high-energy calorimetry due to their excellent energy-resolution\nperformance. The main reason for the non-proportionality of the crystals is\nthat scintillation light yield depends on ionisation density. Experimental data\nobtained with ion beams were used to characterize the light response of various\nscintillator materials. The obtained luminous efficiencies were used as input\nof a Monte Carlo simulation to perform a comparative study of the effect of the\nlight-yield non-proportionality on the detection of high-energy electromagnetic\nand hadronic showers. The result of this study indicates that, if the\ncalorimeter response is calibrated by using the energy deposit of minimum\nionizing particles, the measured shower energy might be affected by a\nsignificant systematic shift, at the level of few percent, whose sign and\nmagnitude depend specifically on the type of scintillator material used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 06:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-22"}

When we choose an interaction Hamiltonian such\nthat the energy and coherence of the system change simultaneously, the\npopulation change of the system and the energy change are the same when the\ninitial state is mixed.

New techniques and methods for lowering the\ndissipation rate have in recent years been discovered and allowed for the\nengineering of mechanical oscillators with phononic modes that are extremely\nwell isolated from the environment and thus possessing quality factors close to\nand beyond 1 billion. A powerful strategy for isolating and controlling a\nsingle phononic mode is based on phononic crystal engineering. Here we propose\na new method for phononic crystal engineering of nanomechanical oscillators\nthat is based on a periodic variation of the material density. To circumvent\nthe introduction of additional bending losses resulting from the variation of\nmaterial density, the added mass constitutes an array of nanopillars in which\nthe losses will be diluted. Using this novel technique for phononic crystal\nengineering, we design and fabricate corrugated mechanical oscillators with\nquality factors approaching one billion in a room temperature environment. The\nflexibility space of these new phononic crystals is large and further\nadvancement can be attained through optimized phononic crystal patterning and\nstrain engineering via topology optimization. This will allow for the\nengineering of mechanical membranes with quality factors approaching 10\nbillion. Such extremely low mechanical dissipation rates will enable the\ndevelopment of radically new technologies such as quantum-limited atomic force\nmicroscopy at room-temperature, ultra-sensitive detectors of dark matter,\nspontaneous waveform collapses, gravity, and high-efficiency quantum\ninformation transducers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 07:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

However, sub-femtosecond spin\ndynamics have not yet been observed or predicted. Here, we explore ultrafast\nlight-driven spin dynamics in a highly non-resonant strong-field regime.\nThrough state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations, we predict that a non-magnetic\nmaterial can be transiently transformed into a magnetic one via dynamical\nextremely nonlinear spin-flipping processes, which occur on attosecond\ntimescales and are mediated by a combination of multi-photon and spin-orbit\ninteractions. These are non-perturbative non-resonant analogues to the inverse\nFaraday effect that build up from cycle-to-cycle as electrons gain angular\nmomentum. Remarkably, we show that even for linearly polarized driving, where\none does not intuitively expect any magnetic response, the magnetization\ntransiently oscillates as the system interacts with light. This oscillating\nresponse is enabled by transverse anomalous light-driven currents in the solid,\nand typically occurs on timescales of ~500 attoseconds. We further demonstrate\nthat the speed of magnetization can be controlled by tuning the laser\nwavelength and intensity. An experimental set-up capable of measuring these\ndynamics through pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy is outlined and\nsimulated.

The information extraction part is responsible\nfor generating key contents with the fused context features.

In such a network, a sink node is required to compute\nwith zero error a target function of which the inputs are generated as source\nmessages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access any one\nbut not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not\nallowed to obtain any information about a security function of the source\nmessages. The secure computing capacity for the above model is defined as the\nmaximum average number of times that the target function can be securely\ncomputed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap\nsets and security function for one use of the network. The characterization of\nthis capacity is in general overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we\nconsider securely computing linear functions with a wiretapper who can\neavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size r, referred to as the\nsecurity level, with the security function being the identity function. We\nfirst prove an upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is\napplicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. When\nthe security level r is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing\ncapacity without security consideration. We discover the surprising fact that\nfor some models, there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared\nwith the computing capacity without security consideration. We further obtain\nan equivalent expression of the upper bound by using a graph-theoretic\napproach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this\nbound.

To\neliminate such limitations, we introduce a neighbor correspondence matching\n(NCM) algorithm for flow-based frame synthesis. Since the current frame is not\navailable in video frame synthesis, NCM is performed in a\ncurrent-frame-agnostic fashion to establish multi-scale correspondences in the\nspatial-temporal neighborhoods of each pixel. Based on the powerful motion\nrepresentation capability of NCM, we further propose to estimate intermediate\nflows for frame synthesis in a heterogeneous coarse-to-fine scheme.\nSpecifically, the coarse-scale module is designed to leverage neighbor\ncorrespondences to capture large motion, while the fine-scale module is more\ncomputationally efficient to speed up the estimation process. Both modules are\ntrained progressively to eliminate the resolution gap between training dataset\nand real-world videos.

In the wind tunnel test, the PIV\nmeasurement and real-time measurement using SPPIV were conducted for the flow\nvelocity field around the NACA0015 airfoil model. The off-line analysis results\nof the test show that the flow velocity field can be estimated from a small\nnumber of processing points by applying SPPIV, and also illustrates the\nfollowing characteristics of SPPIV. The estimation accuracy improves as the\nnumber of processing points increases, whereas the processing time per step\nincreases in proportion to the number of processing points. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to set an optimal number of processing points. In addition, the\napplication of the Kalman filter significantly improves the estimation accuracy\nwith a small number of processing points while suppressing the processing time.\nWhen the flow velocity fields with different angles of attack are used as the\ntraining data with that of test data, the estimation using SPPIV is found to be\nreasonable if the difference in angle of attack between the training and test\ndata is equal to or less than 2 deg and the flow phenomena of the training data\nare similar to that of the test data. For this reason, training data should be\nprepared at least every 4 deg. Finally, the demonstration of SPPIV as a\nreal-time flow observation was conducted for the first time.

We investigate the presence of\nlithium in three best-observed Galactic red nova remnants. Explaining the\norigin of lithium may point to mixing mechanism present before, during, or\nafter the merger. Methods. The lithium line at 6707.81 A was compared to a\nfeature of [Ca I at 6572.78 A to derive relative abundances in circumstellar\ngas. Absolute abundances were next calculated assuming the Solar calcium to\nlithium abundance ratio. Results. Lithium abundances were measured in the\nmerger remnants of V838 Mon with A(Li)=2.3, CK Vul with A(Li)=2.5, and V1309\nSco with A(Li)=1.8. Conclusions. Lithium is overabundant in red novae,\nsuggesting that at least some merger products activate the Cameron-Fowler\nmechanism whereby convective mixing can reach the deep stellar interior.\nWhether deep convection and associated diffusion alone or some other processes\n(e.g. spin down) can be responsible for driving the Cameron-Fowler mechanism in\nthe remnants requires further studies.

These intramolecular rotations lead to dimerization of the molecular\nstacks that are described predominantly by intermolecular tilts and small\nvariations in intermolecular distances. Atypical of modulated structures and\nsuperstructures of biphenyl and other polyphenyls, the rotations of individual\nmolecules are asymmetric ($\\Delta$$\\varphi_{\\mathrm{biphenyl}}$ $\\approx$ 5\ndegrees) while $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{biphenyl}}$ of one independent molecule is two\nto four times larger than the other. Crystal-chemical analysis and phase\nrelations in superspace suggest multiple competing factors involving\nintramolecular steric factors, intermolecular H--C${\\cdot}{\\cdot}{\\cdot}$C--H\ncontacts and weak C--H${\\cdot}{\\cdot}{\\cdot}$O hydrogen bonds that govern the\ndistinctively unequal torsional property of the molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 10:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 13:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

For\nprocessing, transmitting or displaying such an image signal, a re-sampling to a\nregular grid is required. Recently, Frequency Selective Reconstruction (FSR)\nhas been proposed as a very effective sparsity-based algorithm for solving this\nunder-determined problem. For this, FSR iteratively generates a model of the\nsignal in the Fourier-domain. In this context, a fixed frequency prior inspired\nby the optical transfer function is used for favoring low-frequency content.\nHowever, this fixed prior is often too strict and may lead to a reduced\nreconstruction quality. To resolve this weakness, this paper proposes an\nadaptive frequency prior which takes the local density of the available samples\ninto account. The proposed adaptive prior allows for a very high reconstruction\nquality, yielding gains of up to 0.6 dB PSNR over the fixed prior,\nindependently of the density of the available samples.

To reduce the\nrequirement of labels, a semi-supervised meta-training (SSMT) setting has been\nproposed for FSL, which includes only a few labeled samples and numbers of\nunlabeled samples in base classes. However, existing methods under this setting\nrequire class-aware sample selection from the unlabeled set, which violates the\nassumption of unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a practical\nsemi-supervised meta-training setting with truly unlabeled data to facilitate\nthe applications of FSL in realistic scenarios. To better utilize both the\nlabeled and truly unlabeled data, we propose a simple and effective\nmeta-training framework, called pseudo-labeling based meta-learning (PLML).\nFirstly, we train a classifier via common semi-supervised learning (SSL) and\nuse it to obtain the pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Then we build few-shot\ntasks from labeled and pseudo-labeled data and design a novel finetuning method\nwith feature smoothing and noise suppression to better learn the FSL model from\nnoise labels. Surprisingly, through extensive experiments across two FSL\ndatasets, we find that this simple meta-training framework effectively prevents\nthe performance degradation of various FSL models under limited labeled data,\nand also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SSMT models.

The diagnosis of PD mainly\nrelies on clinical experience rather than a definite medical test, and the\ndiagnostic accuracy is only about 73-84% since it is challenged by the\nsubjective opinions or experiences of different medical experts. Therefore, an\nefficient and interpretable automatic PD diagnosis system is valuable for\nsupporting clinicians with more robust diagnostic decision-making. To this end,\nwe propose to classify Parkinson's tremor since it is one of the most\npredominant symptoms of PD with strong generalizability. Different from other\ncomputer-aided time and resource-consuming Parkinson's Tremor (PT)\nclassification systems that rely on wearable sensors, we propose SPAPNet, which\nonly requires consumer-grade non-intrusive video recording of camera-facing\nhuman movements as input to provide undiagnosed patients with low-cost PT\nclassification results as a PD warning sign.

It is essential for\npoint-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided\ncolors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized\nimage with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce\npartially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking\nconvolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address\nthis problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization\nVision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions,\nleveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention\nmechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant\nregions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time\nby utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces\nthe decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by\npixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing\nlayer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our\napproach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive\ncolorization, producing accurately colorized images with a user's minimal\neffort.

To appropriately consider this time-varying nature of the $T_1$ and\n$T_2$ parameters, a new class of quantum channels, known as Time-Varying\nQuantum Channels (TVQCs), has been proposed. In previous works, realizations of\nmulti-qubit TVQCs have been assumed to be equal for all the qubits of an error\ncorrection block, implying that the random variables that describe the\nfluctuations of $T_1$ and $T_2$ are block-to-block uncorrelated, but qubit-wise\nperfectly correlated for the same block.

In order\nto minimize the background from such low-energy protons the Advanced Telescope\nfor High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) satellite introduced a novel concept, the\nso called Charged Particle Diverter (CPD).

Since the parameters of SSL\nmodels are generally so large that training and inference require a lot of\nmemory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models\nwithout a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods\nsuch as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink\nthe depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research\non how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the\nsmall-footprint model.

While Bayesian deep learning techniques allow uncertainty estimation,\ntraining them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not\nalways yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many\nof the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and\ndeployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates.\nTo address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity\nmapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation. BayesCap is a\nmemory-efficient method that can be trained on a small fraction of the original\ndataset, enhancing pretrained non-Bayesian computer vision models by providing\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates for the predictions without (i) hampering the\nperformance of the model and (ii) the need for expensive retraining the model\nfrom scratch.

Our technique capitalizes on the powerful\ncombinatorial results of [Graf, Harris, Haxell, SODA 2021]. We apply the\nrainbow matching technique on four (di)graph packing or hitting problems,\nnamely the Triangle-Packing in Tournament problem (TPT), where we ask for a\npacking of $k$ directed triangles in a tournament, Directed Feedback Vertex Set\nin Tournament problem (FVST), where we ask for a (hitting) set of at most $k$\nvertices which intersects all triangles of a tournament, the Induced\n2-Path-Packing (IPP) where we ask for a packing of $k$ induced paths of length\ntwo in a graph and Induced 2-Path Hitting Set problem (IPHS), where we ask for\na (hitting) set of at most $k$ vertices which intersects all induced paths of\nlength two in a graph. The existence of a sub-quadratic kernels for these\nproblems was proven for the first time in [Fomin, Le, Lokshtanov, Saurabh,\nThomass\\'e, Zehavi. ACM Trans. Algorithms, 2019], where they gave a kernel of\n$O(k^{3/2})$ vertices for the two first problems and $O(k^{5/3})$ vertices for\nthe two last. In the same paper it was questioned whether these bounds can be\n(optimally) improved to linear ones. Motivated by this question, we apply the\nrainbow matching technique and prove that TPT and FVST admit (almost linear)\nkernels of $k^{1+\\frac{O(1)}{\\sqrt{\\log{k}}}}$ vertices and that IPP and IPHS\nadmit kernels of $O(k)$ vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 12:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 11:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 10:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 20:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Crystallization of these\nmaterials is often complicated by the formation of various phases with the same\nstoichiometry but structural types deviating from perovskites such as\nwell-known the hexagonal delta FAPbI3 polytype. Such phases are rarely placed\nin the focus of device engineering due to their unattractive optoelectronic\nproperties while they are, indeed, highly important because they influence on\nthe optoelectronic properties and efficiency of final devices. However, the\ntotal number of such phases has not been yet discovered and the complete\nconfigurational space of the polytypes and their band structures have not been\nstudied systematically. In this work, we predicted and described all possible\nhexagonal polytypes of hybrid lead halides with the APbI3 composition using the\ngroup theory approach, also we analyzed theoretically the relationship between\nthe configuration of close-packed layers in polytypes and their band gap using\nDFT calculations. Two main factors affecting the bandgap were found including\nthe ratio of cubic (c) and hexagonal (h) close-packed layers and the thickness\nof blocks of cubic layers in the structures. We also show that the dependence\nof the band gap on the ratio of cubic (c) and hexagonal (h) layers in these\nstructures are non-linear. We believe that the presence of such polytypes in\nthe perovskite matrix might be a reason for a decrease in the charge carrier\nmobility and therefore it would be an obstacle for efficient charge transport\ncausing negative consequences for the efficiency of solar cell devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 12:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Unique to young\nstars, however, are X-rays from accretion and outflows, and both processes are\nof pivotal importance for star and planet formation. We describe how X-ray data\nprovide important insight into the physics of accretion and outflows. First,\nmass accreted from a circumstellar disk onto the stellar surface reaches\nvelocities up to a few hundred km/s, fast enough to generate soft X-rays in the\npost-shock region of the accretion shock. X-ray observations together with\nlaboratory experiments and numerical simulations show that the accretion\ngeometry is complex in young stars. Specifically, the center of the accretion\ncolumn is likely surrounded by material shielding the inner flow from view but\nitself also hot enough to emit X-rays. Second, X-rays are observed in two\nlocations of protostellar jets: an inner stationary emission component probably\nrelated to outflow collimation and outer components, which evolve withing years\nand are likely related to working surfaces where the shock travels through the\njet. Jet-powered X-rays appear to trace the fastest jet component and provide\nnovel information on jet launching in young stars. We conclude that X-ray data\nwill continue to be highly important for understanding star and planet\nformation, because they directly probe the origin of many emission features\nstudied in other wavelength regimes. In addition, future X-ray missions will\nimprove sensitivity and spectral resolution to probe key model parameters (e.g.\nvelocities) in large samples of PMS stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 13:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In this paper, we study how the income diversity of\nurban encounters have changed during different periods throughout the pandemic,\nusing a large-scale, privacy-enhanced mobility dataset of more than one million\nanonymized mobile phone users in four large US cities, collected across three\nyears spanning before and during the pandemic.

Counterfactual analyses show\nthat while the reduction of outside activities (higher rates of staying at\nhome) was a major factor that contributed to decreased diversity in the early\nstages of the pandemic, behavioral changes including lower willingness to\nexplore new places and changes in visitation preferences further worsened the\nlong-term diversity of encounters.

We\nperformed posterior predictive checks of the model through different validation\nstrategies: stratified 5-fold random cross-validation, block-by-social-group\ncross-validation, and block-by-focal-animals validation. The proposed model was\napplied to a pig behavior dataset collected from 797 growing pigs freshly\nremixed into 59 social groups that resulted in 10,032 records of directional\ndyadic interactions. The response variable was the duration in seconds that\neach animal spent delivering attacks on another group mate. Generalized linear\nmixed models were fitted. Fixed effects included sex, individual weight, prior\nnursery mate experience, and prior littermate experience of the two pigs in the\ndyad. Random effects included aggression giver, aggression receiver, dyad, and\nsocial group. A Bayesian framework was utilized for parameter estimation and\nposterior predictive model checking. Prior nursery mate experience was the only\nsignificant fixed effect. In addition, a weak but significant correlation\nbetween the random giver effect and the random receiver effect was obtained\nwhen analyzing the attacking duration. The predictive performance of the model\nvaried depending on the validation strategy, with substantially lower\nperformance from the block-by-social-group strategy than other validation\nstrategies.

By\nobtaining the analytical eigenfunctions of the linearized, incompressible,\nthree dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes (NS) equation in the channel geometry,\ni.e., the hydrodynamic modes (HMs), we reduce the full NS equation to a system\nof coupled autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by expanding the\nvelocity in terms of the HMs; time becomes the only independent variable. The\nnonlinear term of the NS equation is converted to a third-rank tensor that\ncouples pairs of the expansion coefficients to effect the time variation on the\nthird. In the linear regime, the value of $Re_c$ is obtained to five\nsignificant digit accuracy when compared to the Orszag result. We numerically\ntime evolve the autonomous ODEs at $Re>Re_c$ with a finite set of thermally\nexcited initial HMs to find a fluctuating equilibrium state with a reduced net\nflow rate, accompanied by vortices. Through the perspective of force balance,\ninteresting features are uncovered in the counter-flow profiles at $Re>Re_c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 13:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 07:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

The equation is usually approximated using a\nstochastic interacting $P$-particle system, a set of $P$ coupled\n$d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Importance sampling\n(IS) is a common technique to reduce high relative variance of Monte Carlo\nestimators of rare event probabilities. In the SDE context, optimal measure\nchange is derived using stochastic optimal control theory to minimize estimator\nvariance, which when applied to stochastic particle systems yields a $P \\times\nd$-dimensional partial differential control equation, which is cumbersome to\nsolve. The work in (dos Reis et al., 2018) circumvented this problem by a\ndecoupling approach, producing a $d$-dimensional control PDE. Based on the\ndecoupling approach, we develop a computationally efficient double loop Monte\nCarlo (DLMC) estimator. We offer a systematic approach to our DLMC estimator by\nproviding a comprehensive error and work analysis and formulating optimal\ncomputational complexity. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive DLMC method\ncombined with IS to estimate rare event probabilities, significantly reducing\nrelative variance and computational runtimes required to achieve a given\nrelative tolerance compared with standard Monte Carlo estimators without IS.\nThe proposed estimator has $\\mathcal{O}(TOL^{-4})$ computational complexity\nwith significantly reduced constant.

The time evolution of the magnetic fields agrees with\nthe prediction of the nonlinear turbulent dynamo theory in Xu & Lazarian\n(2016). When the initial weak magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock\nnormal, the maximum amplification of the field's strength achieves a factor of\n$\\approx200$, which is twice larger than that for a parallel shock. We find\nthat the perpendicular shock exhibits a smaller turbulent Alfv\\'en Mach number\nin the vicinity of the shock front than the parallel shock. However, the\nstrongest magnetic field has a low volume filling factor and is limited by the\nturbulent energy due to the reconnection diffusion taking place in a turbulent\nand magnetized fluid. The magnetic field strength averaged along the $z$-axis\nis reduced by a factor $\\gtrsim10$. We decompose the turbulent velocity and\nmagnetic field into solenoidal and compressive modes. The solenoidal mode is\ndominant and evolves to follow the Kolmogorov scaling, even though the preshock\ndensity distribution has a shallow spectrum. When the preshock density\ndistribution has a Kolmogorov spectrum, the turbulent velocity's compressive\ncomponent increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 14:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 03:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 18:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2022 05:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

The principal\nchallenge lies in effectively leveraging the spatiotemporal dependencies and\nexogenous factors related to the delay propagation. However, previous works\nonly consider limited spatiotemporal patterns with few factors. To promote more\ncomprehensive propagation modeling for delay prediction, we propose\nSpatioTemporal Propagation Network (STPN), a space-time separable graph\nconvolutional network, which is novel in spatiotemporal dependency capturing.\nFrom the aspect of spatial relation modeling, we propose a multi-graph\nconvolution model considering both geographic proximity and airline schedule.\nFrom the aspect of temporal dependency capturing, we propose a multi-head\nself-attentional mechanism that can be learned end-to-end and explicitly reason\nmultiple kinds of temporal dependency of delay time series. We show that the\njoint spatial and temporal learning models yield a sum of the Kronecker\nproduct, which factors the spatiotemporal dependence into the sum of several\nspatial and temporal adjacency matrices. By this means, STPN allows cross-talk\nof spatial and temporal factors for modeling delay propagation. Furthermore, a\nsqueeze and excitation module is added to each layer of STPN to boost\nmeaningful spatiotemporal features. To this end, we apply STPN to multi-step\nahead arrival and departure delay prediction in large-scale airport networks.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our model, we experiment with two real-world\ndelay datasets, including U.S and China flight delays; and we show that STPN\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, counterfactuals produced by\nSTPN show that it learns explainable delay propagation patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 14:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Extensive experiments mainly on\nthree medical image datasets show that the proposed approach consistently\noutperforms existing onestage and two-stage approaches, suggesting that metric\nlearning can be used as an effective plug-in component in the two-stage\nframework for fine-grained class-imbalanced image classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 14:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

To be more effective for\ndecision-making and pattern recognition applications, a good normalized\ndistance measure should ensure that its dual similarity measure satisfies the\naxiomatic definition. In this paper, we first construct some examples to\nillustrate that the dual similarity measures of two nonlinear distance measures\nintroduced in [A distance measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets and its\napplication to pattern classification problems, \\emph{IEEE Trans.

To overcome this problem,\nmany practices have been implemented, such as penalties to drivers, bans, and\nnew pricing strategies. This paper presents a double auction taxi fare scheme,\nwhich gives both passengers and taxi drivers to influence the price, coupled\nwith a clustering method to discourage strategic service rejection in the case\nstudy of Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand, which has detailed data\navailability and uneven taxi journey distributions. The double auction\nmechanism is tailored to 2019 taxi trips, service rejection complaints, and\nlocal travel behaviour to boost transportation equity. To benchmark the\nperformance of the new double auction scheme, a bespoke agent-based model of\nthe taxi service in Bangkok Metropolitan Region at different rejection rates of\n0%-20% was created. On one hand, the current rejection behaviour was modelled,\nand on the other, the double auction pricing strategy was applied. The results\nindicate that the double auction strategy generates a spatially distributed\naccessibility and leads to a higher taxi assignment success rate by up to 30%.\nThe double auction scheme increases pickups from locations that are 20-40 km\nfrom central Bangkok by 10-15%, despite being areas of low profit. Due to the\nchanging taxi travel landscape and longer taxi journeys, the total air\npollutant emissions from the taxis increase by 10% while decreasing local\nemissions within central areas of Bangkok by upto 40%. Using a 5 Baht average\nsurcharge, the total revenue drops by 20%. The results show that an\nequity-driven pricing strategy as an implementation of transport policy would\nbe beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 15:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Specifically, our label assignment\nstrategy considers the object center locations as shape- and size-agnostic\nanchors in an anchor-free fashion, and allows learning to occur at all scales\nfor every object.

Arguably neither Reiteration nor\nReductio is as intimately related to the meaning of the connectives as the\nintroduction and elimination rules are, so the base logic we identify serves as\na more fundamental starting point and common ground between proponents of\nintuitionistic logic, orthologic, and classical logic. The algebraic semantics\nfor the logic we motivate proof-theoretically is based on bounded lattices\nequipped with what has been called a weak pseudocomplementation. We show that\nsuch lattice expansions are representable using a set together with a reflexive\nbinary relation satisfying a simple first-order condition, which yields an\nelegant relational semantics for the logic. This builds on our previous study\nof representations of lattices with negations, which we extend and specialize\nfor several types of negation in addition to weak pseudocomplementation.\nFinally, we discuss ways of extending these representations to lattices with a\nconditional or implication operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 15:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 15:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 06:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 19:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 02:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 05:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 23:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Recently, commercial RGB-depth (RGB-D) cameras\nhave been widely adopted as single-view depth-sensing devices owing to their\nefficient depth-sensing abilities. However, the depth quality of most RGB-D\nsensors remains insufficient owing to the inherent noise from a single-view\nenvironment. Recently, several studies have focused on the single-view depth\nenhancement of RGB-D cameras. Recent research has proposed deep-learning-based\napproaches that typically train networks using high-quality supervised depth\ndatasets, which indicates that the quality of the ground-truth (GT) depth\ndataset is a top-most important factor for accurate system; however, such\nhigh-quality GT datasets are difficult to obtain. In this study, we developed a\nnovel method for high-quality GT depth generation based on an RGB-D stream\ndataset. First, we defined consecutive depth frames in a local spatial region\nas a local frame set. Then, the depth frames were aligned to a certain frame in\nthe local frame set using an unsupervised point cloud registration scheme. The\nregistration parameters were trained based on an overfit-training scheme, which\nwas primarily used to construct a single GT depth image for each frame set. The\nfinal GT depth dataset was constructed using several local frame sets, and each\nlocal frame set was trained independently. The primary advantage of this study\nis that a high-quality GT depth dataset can be constructed under various\nscanning environments using only the RGB-D stream dataset. Moreover, our\nproposed method can be used as a new benchmark GT dataset for accurate\nperformance evaluations. We evaluated our GT dataset on previously benchmarked\nGT depth datasets and demonstrated that our method is superior to\nstate-of-the-art depth enhancement frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 15:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 10:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Among the first-line\nmodalities investigated in studies of early diagnosis are features distilled\nfrom protein mass spectra. This method, however, considers only a specific\nsubset of spectral responses and ignores the interplay among protein expression\nlevels, which can also contain diagnostic information. We propose a new\nmodality that automatically searches protein mass spectra for discriminatory\nfeatures by considering the self-similar nature of the spectra. Self-similarity\nis assessed by taking a wavelet decomposition of protein mass spectra and\nestimating the rate of level-wise decay in the energies of the resulting\nwavelet coefficients. Level-wise energies are estimated in a robust manner\nusing distance variance, and rates are estimated locally via a rolling window\napproach. This results in a collection of rates that can be used to\ncharacterize the interplay among proteins, which can be indicative of cancer\npresence. Discriminatory descriptors are then selected from these evolutionary\nrates and used as classifying features. The proposed wavelet-based features are\nused in conjunction with features proposed in the existing literature for early\nstage diagnosis of ovarian cancer using two datasets published by the American\nNational Cancer Institute. Including the wavelet-based features from the new\nmodality results in improvements in diagnostic performance for early-stage\novarian cancer detection. This demonstrates the ability of the proposed\nmodality to characterize new ovarian cancer diagnostic information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 15:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

On the other hand, the inference procedure for\nprediction is an untrustworthy black box.\n  This paper proposes a novel explainable model for sparse KGC, compositing\nhigh-order reasoning into a graph convolutional network, namely HoGRN. It can\nnot only improve the generalization ability to mitigate the information\ninsufficiency issue but also provide interpretability while maintaining the\nmodel's effectiveness and efficiency. There are two main components that are\nseamlessly integrated for joint optimization. First, the high-order reasoning\ncomponent learns high-quality relation representations by capturing endogenous\ncorrelation among relations. This can reflect logical rules to justify a\nbroader of missing facts. Second, the entity updating component leverages a\nweight-free Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to efficiently model KG\nstructures with interpretability. Unlike conventional methods, we conduct\nentity aggregation and design composition-based attention in the relational\nspace without additional parameters. The lightweight design makes HoGRN better\nsuitable for sparse settings. For evaluation, we have conducted extensive\nexperiments-the results of HoGRN on several sparse KGs present impressive\nimprovements (9% MRR gain on average). Further ablation and case studies\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the main components. Our codes will be\nreleased upon acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 10:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

Due to the diverse nature of user\ninterests, recent advances propose the multi-interest networks to encode\nhistorical behaviors into multiple interest vectors. In real scenarios, the\ncorresponding items of captured interests are usually retrieved together to get\nexposure and collected into training data, which produces dependencies among\ninterests. Unfortunately, multi-interest networks may incorrectly concentrate\non subtle dependencies among captured interests. Misled by these dependencies,\nthe spurious correlations between irrelevant interests and targets are\ncaptured, resulting in the instability of prediction results when training and\ntest distributions do not match. In this paper, we introduce the widely used\nHilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of\nindependence among captured interests and empirically show that the continuous\nincrease of HSIC may harm model performance. Based on this, we propose a novel\nmulti-interest network, named DEep Stable Multi-Interest Learning (DESMIL),\nwhich tries to eliminate the influence of subtle dependencies among captured\ninterests via learning weights for training samples and make model concentrate\nmore on underlying true causation.

In this work, we proposed a general\nmethod of constructing Friedrich-Wintgen (FW) BICs and accidental BICs in a\ncoupled acoustic waveguide-resonator system. We demonstrated that FW BICs can\nbe achieved with arbitrary two degenerate resonances in a closed resonator\nregardless of whether they have the same or opposite parity. Moreover, their\neigenmode profiles can be arbitrarily engineered by adjusting the position of\nattached waveguide. That suggests an effective way of continuous switching the\nnature of BIC from FW BIC to symmetry-protected BIC or accidental BICs. Also,\nsuch BICs are sustained in the coupled waveguide-resonator system with shapes\nsuch as rectangle, ellipse, and rhomboid. These interesting phenomena are well\nexplained by the two-level effective non Hermitian Hamiltonian, where two\nstrongly coupled degenerate modes play a major role in forming such FW BICs.\nBesides, we found that such an open system also supports accidental BICs in\ngeometry space instead of momentum space via tuning the position of attached\nwaveguide, which are attributed to the quenched coupling between the waveguide\nand eigenmodes of the closed cavity. Finally, we fabricated a series of 3D\ncoupled-resonator-waveguide and experimentally verified the existence of FW\nBICs and accidental BICs by measuring the transmission spectra. Our results\ncomplement the current BIC library in acoustics and provide new routes for\ndesigning novel acoustic devices, such as in acoustic absorbers, filters and\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 05:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The optimal solution to Economic Load Dispatch\nproblems and various constraints can be obtained by evolving several\nevolutionary and swarm-based algorithms. The major drawback to swarm-based\nalgorithms is premature convergence towards an optimal solution. Fitness\nDependent Optimizer is a novel optimization algorithm stimulated by the\ndecision-making and reproductive process of bee swarming. Fitness Dependent\nOptimizer (FDO) examines the search spaces based on the searching approach of\nParticle Swarm Optimization. To calculate the pace, the fitness function is\nutilized to generate weights that direct the search agents in the phases of\nexploitation and exploration. In this research, the authors have carried out\nFitness Dependent Optimizer to solve the Economic Load Dispatch problem by\nreducing fuel cost, emission allocation, and transmission loss. Moreover, the\nauthors have enhanced a novel variant of Fitness Dependent Optimizer, which\nincorporates novel population initialization techniques and dynamically\nemployed sine maps to select the weight factor for Fitness Dependent Optimizer.\nThe enhanced population initialization approach incorporates a quasi-random\nSabol sequence to generate the initial solution in the multi-dimensional search\nspace. A standard 24-unit system is employed for experimental evaluation with\ndifferent power demands. Empirical results obtained using the enhanced variant\nof the Fitness Dependent Optimizer demonstrate superior performance in terms of\nlow transmission loss, low fuel cost, and low emission allocation compared to\nthe conventional Fitness Dependent Optimizer.
