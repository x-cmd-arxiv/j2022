The problem nevertheless is not trivial\nespecially for the real-world deployments, which often demand high efficiency\nin inference latency. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the design of\nconvolutional blocks (the type of convolutions and the number of channels in\nconvolutions), and the ways of interactions across multiple scales, all from\nlightweight standpoint for semantic segmentation. With such in-depth\ncomparisons, we conclude three principles, and accordingly devise Lightweight\nand Progressively-Scalable Networks (LPS-Net) that novelly expands the network\ncomplexity in a greedy manner. Technically, LPS-Net first capitalizes on the\nprinciples to build a tiny network. Then, LPS-Net progressively scales the tiny\nnetwork to larger ones by expanding a single dimension (the number of\nconvolutional blocks, the number of channels, or the input resolution) at one\ntime to meet the best speed/accuracy tradeoff. Extensive experiments conducted\non three datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of LPS-Net over\nseveral efficient semantic segmentation methods. More remarkably, our LPS-Net\nachieves 73.4% mIoU on Cityscapes test set, with the speed of 413.5FPS on an\nNVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, leading to a performance improvement by 1.5% and a 65%\nspeed-up against the state-of-the-art STDC.

Motivated by\naccelerating the inefficient exploration of the homotopy-augmented space of the\n2D environment, our fundamental idea is to identify the non-$k$-optimal path\ntopologies as early as possible and terminate the pathfinding along them. This\nis a non-trivial practice because it has to be done at an intermediate state of\nthe path planning process when locally shortest paths have not been fully\nconstructed. In other words, the paths to be compared have not rendezvoused at\nthe goal location, which makes the homotopy theory, modelling the spatial\nrelationship among the paths having the same endpoint, not applicable.\n  This paper is the first work that develops a systematic distance-based\ntopology simplification mechanism to solve the $k$-SNPP task, whose core\ncontribution is to assert the distance-based order of non-homotopic locally\nshortest paths before constructing them. If the order can be predicted, then\nthose path topologies having more than $k$ better topologies are proven free of\nthe desired $k$ paths and thus can be safely discarded during the path planning\nprocess. To this end, a hierarchical topological tree is proposed as an\nimplementation of the mechanism, whose nodes are proven to expand in\nnon-homotopic directions and edges (collision-free path segments) are proven\nlocally shortest. With efficient criteria that observe the order relations\nbetween partly constructed locally shortest paths being imparted into the tree,\nthe tree nodes that expand in non-$k$-optimal topologies will not be expanded.\nAs a result, the computational time for solving the $k$-SNPP problem is reduced\nby near two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 16:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Cuts are critical to modern\ninteger programming solvers, but their benefit is only realized when the cuts\nare applied recursively, causing numerical instability and \"tailing off\" of cut\nstrength after several rounds. To mitigate these difficulties, the VPC\nframework offers a practical method for generating strong cuts without\nresorting to recursion. The framework starts with a disjunction whose terms\npartition the feasible region into smaller subproblems, then obtains a\ncollection of points and rays from the disjunctive terms, from which we build a\nlinear program whose feasible solutions correspond to valid disjunctive cuts.\nThough a na\\\"ive implementation would result in an exponentially-sized\noptimization problem, we show how to efficiently construct this linear program,\nsuch that it is much smaller than the one from the alternative, the\nlift-and-project approach. This enables us to test strong multiterm\ndisjunctions that arise from the leaf nodes of a partial branch-and-bound tree.\nIn addition to proving useful theoretical properties of the cuts, we evaluate\ntheir performance computationally through an implementation in the open-source\nCOIN-OR framework. In the results, VPCs from a strong disjunction significantly\nimprove the gap closed compared to existing cuts in solvers, and they also\ndecrease solving time when used with branch and bound if the best partial tree\nper instance is selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 16:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

For example, expressive model families\nsuch as Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) have been almost entirely\nevaluated on their capability to learn a given target distribution with high\naccuracy. While this aspect may be ideal for some tasks, it limits the scope of\na generative model's assessment to its ability to memorize data rather than\ngeneralize. As a result, there has been little understanding of a model's\ngeneralization performance and the relation between such capability and the\nresource requirements, e.g., the circuit depth and the amount of training data.\nIn this work, we leverage upon a recently proposed generalization evaluation\nframework to begin addressing this knowledge gap. We first investigate the\nQCBM's learning process of a cardinality-constrained distribution and see an\nincrease in generalization performance while increasing the circuit depth. In\nthe 12-qubit example presented here, we observe that with as few as 30% of the\nvalid data in the training set, the QCBM exhibits the best generalization\nperformance toward generating unseen and valid data. Lastly, we assess the\nQCBM's ability to generalize not only to valid samples, but to high-quality\nbitstrings distributed according to an adequately re-weighted distribution. We\nsee that the QCBM is able to effectively learn the reweighted dataset and\ngenerate unseen samples with higher quality than those in the training set. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature that\npresents the QCBM's generalization performance as an integral evaluation metric\nfor quantum generative models, and demonstrates the QCBM's ability to\ngeneralize to high-quality, desired novel samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 17:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 12:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 01:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 18:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Hence, alert prioritization\nplays a crucial role in deciding which alerts to investigate from an enormous\nnumber of alerts that are generated by IDS. Recently, deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) off-policy\nmethod has shown to achieve better results for alert prioritization as compared\nto other state-of-the-art methods. However, DDPG is prone to the problem of\noverfitting. Additionally, it also has a poor exploration capability and hence\nit is not suitable for problems with a stochastic environment. To address these\nlimitations, we present a soft actor-critic based DRL algorithm for alert\nprioritization (SAC-AP), an off-policy method, based on the maximum entropy\nreinforcement learning framework that aims to maximize the expected reward\nwhile also maximizing the entropy. Further, the interaction between an\nadversary and a defender is modeled as a zero-sum game and a double oracle\nframework is utilized to obtain the approximate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium\n(MSNE). SAC-AP finds robust alert investigation policies and computes pure\nstrategy best response against opponent's mixed strategy. We present the\noverall design of SAC-AP and evaluate its performance as compared to other\nstate-of-the art alert prioritization methods. We consider defender's loss,\ni.e., the defender's inability to investigate the alerts that are triggered due\nto attacks, as the performance metric. Our results show that SAC-AP achieves up\nto 30% decrease in defender's loss as compared to the DDPG based alert\nprioritization method and hence provides better protection against intrusions.\nMoreover, the benefits are even higher when SAC-AP is compared to other\ntraditional alert prioritization methods including Uniform, GAIN, RIO and\nSuricata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 17:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 16:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 09:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape,\nappearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance,\nwhich is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel\ndisentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed\nobjects in their respective shape and appearance space. We also propose a\nnovel, octree-based differentiable optimization step, allowing us to further\nimprove object shape, pose and appearance simultaneously under the learned\nlatent space, in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Our novel joint implicit\ntextured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct\nnovel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our method, trained on simulated indoor\nscenes, accurately regresses the shape, appearance and pose of novel objects in\nthe real-world with minimal fine-tuning. Our method significantly out-performs\nall baselines on the NOCS dataset with an 8% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D\npose estimation.

In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental\ntrade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a\nquantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that\nleaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in\nwhich Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to\nevolve for a time $t$ that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock\nthrough a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information\nthat is lost. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nabout $t$ is equal to Eve's gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter.\nWe also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to\nestimate the values of parameters associated with two non-commuting\nobservables.

We develop a novel\nemulation method consisting in training, validating, and testing the simulated\ndisk-wind spectra into a purposely built artificial neural network. The trained\nemulator can generate a single synthetic spectrum for a particular parameter\nset in a fraction of a second, in contrast to the few hours required by a\nstandard Monte Carlo radiative transfer pipeline. The emulator does not suffer\nfrom interpolation issues with multi-dimensional spaces that are typically\nfaced by traditional X-ray fitting packages such as \\textsc{xspec}.\n\\textsc{xrade} will be suitable to a wide number of sources across the\nblack-hole mass, ionizing luminosity, and accretion rate scales.

The ability to reason about structure and compositionality\nallows us to not only build things, but also understand and reverse-engineer\ncomplex systems.

After condensation, FDM is\ndescribed by a single wave function satisfying a Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson\nequation. An equivalent, hydrodynamic formulation can be obtained through the\nMadelung transform. Here, we consider both descriptions and restrict our\nanalysis to linear response theory.

Our analysis of the finite time perturbation case\nreveals that the density wake diffuses through the FDM medium until it reaches\nits outer boundary. Once this transient regime is over, both the radial and\ntangential DF oscillate about the steady-state solution with an exponentially\ndecaying envelope. Steady-state is thus never achieved. We use our results to\nrevisit the DF decay timescales of the 5 Fornax globular clusters.

The AUC of radiologists were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.59 - 0.67), 0.66 (95%\nCI:0.61 - 0.71), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60 - 0.70), and 0.63 (95%CI: 0.58 - 0.67).\nConclusion: In the new testing dataset, the deep learning algorithm achieved\nsimilar performances with all four radiologists. The relative performance\ndifference between the algorithm and the radiologists is not significantly\naffected by the difference of ultrasound scanner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 19:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 21:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Previous studies have indicated that GNNs\nare vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which infer whether a\nnode is in the training data of GNNs and leak the node's private information,\nlike the patient's disease history. The implementation of previous MIAs takes\nadvantage of the models' probability output, which is infeasible if GNNs only\nprovide the prediction label (label-only) for the input.\n  In this paper, we propose a label-only MIA against GNNs for node\nclassification with the help of GNNs' flexible prediction mechanism, e.g.,\nobtaining the prediction label of one node even when neighbors' information is\nunavailable. Our attacking method achieves around 60\\% accuracy, precision, and\nArea Under the Curve (AUC) for most datasets and GNN models, some of which are\ncompetitive or even better than state-of-the-art probability-based MIAs\nimplemented under our environment and settings. Additionally, we analyze the\ninfluence of the sampling method, model selection approach, and overfitting\nlevel on the attack performance of our label-only MIA. Both of those factors\nhave an impact on the attack performance. Then, we consider scenarios where\nassumptions about the adversary's additional dataset (shadow dataset) and extra\ninformation about the target model are relaxed. Even in those scenarios, our\nlabel-only MIA achieves a better attack performance in most cases. Finally, we\nexplore the effectiveness of possible defenses, including Dropout,\nRegularization, Normalization, and Jumping knowledge.

For a long time, researchers focused on\nextracting topics from the text and visualizing them based on their relative\nsignificance in the corpus. However, recently, researchers started coming up\nwith more complex systems that not only expose the topics of the corpus but\nalso word closely related to the topic to give users a holistic view. These\ndetailed visualizations spawned research on comparing text corpora based on\ntheir visualization. Topics are often compared to idealize the difference\nbetween corpora. However, to capture greater semantics from different corpora,\nresearchers have started to compare texts based on the sentiment of the topics\nrelated to the text. Comparing the words carrying the most weightage, we can\nget an idea about the important topics for corpus. There are multiple existing\ntexts comparing methods present that compare topics rather than sentiments but\nwe feel that focusing on sentiment-carrying words would better compare the two\ncorpora. Since only sentiments can explain the real feeling of the text and not\njust the topic, topics without sentiments are just nouns. We aim to\ndifferentiate the corpus with a focus on sentiment, as opposed to comparing all\nthe words appearing in the two corpora. The rationale behind this is, that the\ntwo corpora do not many have identical words for side-by-side comparison, so\ncomparing the sentiment words gives us an idea of how the corpora are appealing\nto the emotions of the reader. We can argue that the entropy or the\nunexpectedness and divergence of topics should also be of importance and help\nus to identify key pivot points and the importance of certain topics in the\ncorpus alongside relative sentiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 20:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

Current systems thus resort to floating avatars, whose limitation\nis particularly evident in collaborative settings. To estimate full-body poses\nfrom the sparse input sources, prior work has incorporated additional trackers\nand sensors at the pelvis or lower body, which increases setup complexity and\nlimits practical application in mobile settings. In this paper, we present\nAvatarPoser, the first learning-based method that predicts full-body poses in\nworld coordinates using only motion input from the user's head and hands. Our\nmethod builds on a Transformer encoder to extract deep features from the input\nsignals and decouples global motion from the learned local joint orientations\nto guide pose estimation. To obtain accurate full-body motions that resemble\nmotion capture animations, we refine the arm joints' positions using an\noptimization routine with inverse kinematics to match the original tracking\ninput. In our evaluation, AvatarPoser achieved new state-of-the-art results in\nevaluations on large motion capture datasets (AMASS). At the same time, our\nmethod's inference speed supports real-time operation, providing a practical\ninterface to support holistic avatar control and representation for Metaverse\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 20:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

First, due to coarse-grained data transfers\n(size of a cache block, usually 64B between the DRAM and the memory controller,\nsystems waste energy on transferring data that is not used. Second, due to\ncoarse-grained DRAM row activation, systems waste energy by activating DRAM\ncells that are unused in many workloads where spatial locality is lower than\nthe large row size (usually 8-16KB).\n  We propose Sectored DRAM, a new, low-overhead DRAM substrate that alleviates\nthe two inefficiencies, by enabling fine-grained DRAM access and activation. To\nefficiently retrieve only the useful data from DRAM, Sectored DRAM exploits the\nobservation that many cache blocks are not fully utilized in many workloads due\nto poor spatial locality. Sectored DRAM predicts the words in a cache block\nthat will likely be accessed during the cache block's cache residency and: (i)\ntransfers only the predicted words on the memory channel, as opposed to\ntransferring the entire cache block, by dynamically tailoring the DRAM data\ntransfer size for the workload and (ii) activates a smaller set of cells that\ncontain the predicted words, as opposed to activating the entire DRAM row, by\ncarefully operating physically isolated portions of DRAM rows (MATs).\n  Compared to prior work in fine-grained DRAM, Sectored DRAM greatly reduces\nDRAM energy consumption, does not reduce DRAM throughput, and can be\nimplemented with low hardware cost. We evaluate Sectored DRAM using 41\nworkloads from widely-used benchmark suites. Sectored DRAM reduces the DRAM\nenergy consumption of highly-memory-intensive workloads by up to (on average)\n33% (20%) while improving their performance by 17% on average.

Pose or motion priors are important for\ngenerating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy\nor partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the\nzero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling\nimplicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3)^K, where a human\npose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The\nresulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect\nto the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the\nmanifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In\ncontrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose\nspace into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold,\npreserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that PoseNDF outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks,\nranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded\ndata to 3D pose reconstruction from images.

We propose a novel depth-averaged model capturing the internal\nenergy balance and the vertical profiles of velocity, depth, and turbulent\nkinetic energy. The vertical profiles change as the current evolves: it self\nstratifies. This enables the critical new insight that turbidity current\npropagation is enabled by bidirectional cascades between mean-flow kinetic,\nturbulent, and gravitational potential energies.\n  The model is generalised for fully confined `canyon' flow (no lateral\noverspill), and partially confined `channel' flow (lateral overspill over\nbounding levees). `Quasi-equilibrium' solutions for self-stratifying turbidity\ncurrents are constructed. These solutions are weekly unstable and connected to\na slowly evolving manifold, wherein environmental currents are likely found.\nEquilibrium solutions, found for channel flow, are not stable either. Levee\noverspill removes dilute, low momentum fluid, rejuvenating the flow, which can\ncause a positive feedback loop where the fluid becomes increasingly\nconcentrated. We test the new theory by modelling flow in the Congo\ncanyon-channel system, for the first time simulating a supercritical turbidity\ncurrent that travels 100s km to the distal reaches of a real-world system. It\nis shown that self-stratification enhances material and momentum fluxes,\ndetermining the environmental impacts and risks from such flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 23:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 10:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Methods: A two-degree-of-freedom control configuration, formed by a\nfeedback controller and a feedforward controller, is explored. The feedback\ncontroller is a proportional-integral controller and the feedforward controller\nis designed using the inverse of a control-oriented model of muscle tissue. A\ngeneralized linear model and a nonlinear model of muscle tissue are explored\nusing input-output data and system identification techniques. The force control\nscheme is tested on equine airway smooth muscle and its robustness confirmed\nwith murine flexor digitorum brevis muscle. Results: Performance and\nrepeatability of the force control scheme as well as the number of inputs and\nlevel of supervision required from the user were assessed with a series of\nexperiments. The force control scheme was able to fulfill the stated control\nobjectives in most cases, including the requirements for settling time and\novershoot. Conclusion: The proposed control scheme is shown to enable\nautomation of force control for characterizing muscle mechanics with minimal\nuser input required. Significance: This paper leverages an inversion-based\nfeedforward controller based on a nonlinear physiological model in a system\nidentification context that is superior to classic linear system\nidentification.

To alleviate this\nproblem, we design a bias adaptive classifier that targets the imbalanced SSL\nsetups.

Limited by\nhardware computational resources and memory capacity, most existing studies\npreprocessed original remote sensing images by down sampling or cropping them\ninto small patches less than 512*512 pixels before sending them to a deep\nneural network. However, down sampling images incurs spatial detail loss,\nrenders small segments hard to discriminate, and reverses the spatial\nresolution progress obtained by decades of years of efforts.

We\nperform test particle simulations to investigate the escape process and\nescape-limited maximum energy without magnetic field amplification in the\nupstream region, where the magnetic field strength and rotation period expected\nfrom observations of RSGs and WR stars are used.

In terms of the CR luminosity, SNRs propagating to the\nfree wind of WR stars can contribute to PeV CRs. As long as no magnetic field\namplification works around SNR shocks, the maximum energy is decided by the\nmagnetic field strength in the wind region, which depends on the rotation\nperiod, stellar wind, and surface magnetic field of RSGs and WR stars.\nTherefore, we need to observe these quantities to understand the origin of CRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 06:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 10:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant\nmodel, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems\n(FRSs) do not consider the lack of resources and data availability at the\nend-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users\nand items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices, and that all local\nrecommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user's\nbehavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be\nmade on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources.\nFurthermore, users' preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new\nitems. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the\nstraightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data.\nIn this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System\n(ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified\nuser preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight\nself-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning\na user's temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items.

The clustering module operates in an\nasynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and\ncope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior\nperformance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by\ncomparative experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 06:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

This can have disastrous consequences\nfor safety-critical applications. A popular mitigation strategy is to train a\nseparate classifier that can detect such OOD samples at the test time. In most\npractical settings OOD examples are not known at the train time, and hence a\nkey question is: how to augment the ID data with synthetic OOD samples for\ntraining such an OOD detector? In this paper, we propose a novel Compounded\nCorruption technique for the OOD data augmentation termed CnC. One of the major\nadvantages of CnC is that it does not require any hold-out data apart from the\ntraining set. Further, unlike current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, CnC\ndoes not require backpropagation or ensembling at the test time, making our\nmethod much faster at inference. Our extensive comparison with 20 methods from\nthe major conferences in last 4 years show that a model trained using CnC based\ndata augmentation, significantly outperforms SOTA, both in terms of OOD\ndetection accuracy as well as inference time. We include a detailed post-hoc\nanalysis to investigate the reasons for the success of our method and identify\nhigher relative entropy and diversity of CnC samples as probable causes. We\nalso provide theoretical insights via a piece-wise decomposition analysis on a\ntwo-dimensional dataset to reveal (visually and quantitatively) that our\napproach leads to a tighter boundary around ID classes, leading to better\ndetection of OOD samples.

This physical model is composed by\na sum of Fourier components, describing the main shape of the bump, a series of\nlow-order polynomials, describing the main compressed thickness, paddle tilt\nand deflection, and non-linear components describing the translation and\nrotation of the paddle aperture.

Using a marine ecosystem model, the assessment and the\nvalidation of annual periodic solutions (i.e., steady annual cycles) against\nobservational data are crucial to identify biogeochemical processes, which, for\nexample, influence the global carbon cycle. For marine ecosystem models, the\ntransport matrix method (TMM) already lowers the runtime of the simulation\nsignificantly and enables the application of larger time steps\nstraightforwardly. However, the selection of an appropriate time step is a\nchallenging compromise between accuracy and shortening the runtime. Using an\nautomatic time step adjustment during the computation of a steady annual cycle\nwith the TMM, we present in this paper different algorithms applying either an\nadaptive step size control or decreasing time steps in order to use the time\nstep always as large as possible without any manual selection. For these\nmethods and a variety of marine ecosystem models of different complexity, the\naccuracy of the computed steady annual cycle achieved the same accuracy as\nsolutions obtained with a fixed time step. Depending on the complexity of the\nmarine ecosystem model, the application of the methods shortened the runtime\nsignificantly. Due to the certain overhead of the adaptive method, the\ncomputational effort may be higher in special cases using the adaptive step\nsize control.

The proposed polynomial two-stage dynamic programming\nalgorithm VLSN to search this neighborhood can be flexibly adjusted to the\ndesired trade-off between accuracy and computational time. For instance, the\nsearch procedure can be converted into an exact algorithm of competitive\nruntime for DRP-E. In computational tests, the developed solution methods\noutperform current state-of-the art heuristics for DRP-E by a significant\nmargin. A case study based on a search for missing persons demonstrates that\nVLSN easily accommodates additional practice relevant features and outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art solution in disaster relief by 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 08:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

In this paper, we argue that the handcrafted\nvanilla Transformer architectures for Softmax attention may not be suitable for\nefficient Transformers. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to\nfind optimal architectures for efficient Transformers with the neural\narchitecture search (NAS) technique. The proposed method is validated on\npopular machine translation and image classification tasks.

This motivates us to mix the two\ntypes of attention to reduce the performance imbalance.

These methods will suffer a severe\nperformance drop when the degradation is different from their assumption.\nTherefore, some approaches attempt to train SR networks with the complex\ncombination of multiple degradations to cover the real degradation space. To\nadapt to multiple unknown degradations, introducing an explicit degradation\nestimator can actually facilitate SR performance. However, previous explicit\ndegradation estimation methods usually predict Gaussian blur with the\nsupervision of groundtruth blur kernels, and estimation errors may lead to SR\nfailure. Thus, it is necessary to design a method that can extract implicit\ndiscriminative degradation representation.

However, MLN\nrequires iterating on paired low-resolution (LR) and corresponding\nhigh-resolution (HR) images, which is unavailable in the inference phase.\nTherefore, we adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to make the student network\nlearn to directly extract the same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as\nthe teacher from LR images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 05:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Since the time step\nrequired for resolving a collision process is much smaller than that for a\nfluid flow, the computational cost of the traditional soft-sphere model by\nreducing the time step is quite high in particle-resolved simulations. In one\nstate-of-the-art methodology, collision time is stretched to several times the\nflow solver time step for the fluid to adapt to the sudden change in particle\nmotion. However, the stretched collision time is not physical, the hydrodynamic\nforce may be severely underestimated during a stretched collision, and the\nsimulation of sediment transport may be sensitive to the stretched collision\ntime. The proposed MTSA adopts different time steps to resolve fluid flow,\nfluid-particle interaction, and particle collision. We assessed the MTSA for\nparticle-wall collisions as well as particle-particle collisions, determined\nthe optimal iteration number in the algorithm, and obtained excellent\nagreements with experimental measurements and reference simulations. The\ncomputational cost of the MTSA can be reduced to about one order of magnitude\nless than that using the traditional soft-sphere model with almost the same\naccuracy.

However, collecting such\nannotations is time-consuming and costly. A common procedure to obtain\nannotations at zero labeling cost is to rely on thematic products or\ncrowdsourced labels. As a drawback, these procedures come with the risk of\nlabel noise that can distort the learning process of the MLC algorithms. In the\nliterature, most label noise robust methods are designed for single-label\nclassification (SLC) problems in computer vision (CV), where each image is\nannotated by a single label. Unlike SLC, label noise in MLC can be associated\nwith: 1) subtractive label-noise (a land cover class label is not assigned to\nan image while that class is present in the image); 2) additive label-noise (a\nland cover class label is assigned to an image although that class is not\npresent in the given image); and 3) mixed label-noise (a combination of both).\nIn this paper, we investigate three different noise robust CV SLC methods and\nadapt them to be robust for multi-label noise scenarios in RS.

As it is well known, $p(t)$ is not an exponential\nfunction; similarly, $w_{i}(t)$ is also not such. In particular, the ratio\n$w_{i}/w_{j}$ (for $i\\neq j)$ is not a simple constant, as it would be in the\nexponential limit. The functions $w_{i}(t)$ and their mutual ratios may\ntherefore represent a novel tool to study the non-exponential nature of the\ndecay law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Specifically,\nwe propose two pre-training tasks: Surrounding Word Prediction (SWP) for the\nlayout learning, and Contrastive learning of Word Embeddings (CWE) for\nidentifying different word blocks. Moreover, we replace the commonly used 1D\nposition embedding with a 1D clipped relative position embedding. In this way,\nthe joint training of Masked Layout-Language Modeling (MLLM) and two newly\nproposed tasks enables the interaction between semantic and spatial features in\na unified way.

Such processes often\nconsist of multiple states, e.g. operating modes of a machine, such that state\nchanges in the observed processes result in changes in the distribution of\nshape of the measured values. Time series segmentation (TSS) tries to find such\nchanges in TS post-hoc to deduce changes in the data-generating process. TSS is\ntypically approached as an unsupervised learning problem aiming at the\nidentification of segments distinguishable by some statistical property.\nCurrent algorithms for TSS require domain-dependent hyper-parameters to be set\nby the user, make assumptions about the TS value distribution or the types of\ndetectable changes which limits their applicability. Common hyperparameters are\nthe measure of segment homogeneity and the number of change points, which are\nparticularly hard to tune for each data set. We present ClaSP, a novel, highly\naccurate, hyper-parameter-free and domain-agnostic method for TSS. ClaSP\nhierarchically splits a TS into two parts. A change point is determined by\ntraining a binary TS classifier for each possible split point and selecting the\none split that is best at identifying subsequences to be from either of the\npartitions. ClaSP learns its main two model-parameters from the data using two\nnovel bespoke algorithms.

This issue motivated the researchers to study the cooperation between\nedge servers. The previous server cooperation algorithms have disadvantages\nsince the cooperated region is limited within one-hop. However, the performance\nof EC can be improved further by releasing the restriction of cooperation\nregion. Even some works have extended the cooperated region to multi-hops, they\nfail to support the task offloading which is one of the core issues of edge\ncomputing. Therefore, we propose a new decentralized and borderless server\ncooperation algorithm for edge computing which takes task offloading strategy\ninto account, named CoNet.

This has been\nre-evaluated and developed to include tracking the desorption through\n(extended) grain cooling profiles, consideration of grain size-dependencies and\nconstraints to the efficiencies. A model was then constructed to study the\ntrue, sporadic, nature of the process with possible allowances from species\nco-desorption and whole mantle desorption from very small grains. The key\nresults from the study are that the desorption rates are highly uncertain, but\nalmost certainly significantly larger than have been previously determined. For\ntypical interstellar grain size distributions it is found that the desorption\nis dominated by the contributions from the smallest grains. The sporadic\ndesorption model shows that, if the interval between cosmic ray impacts is\ncomparable to, or less than, the freeze-out timescale, the continuous\nrepresentation is inapplicable; chemical changes may occur on very long\ntimescales, resulting in strong gas phase chemical enrichments that have very\nnon-linear dependences on the cosmic ray flux. The inclusion of even limited\nlevels of species co-desorption and/or the contribution from very small grains\nfurther enhances the rates, especially for species such as H2O. In general we\nfind that cosmic-ray heating is the dominant desorption mechanism in dark\nenvironments.

Here, $\\gamma$ can be smaller than the inverse of any polynomial\nin the dimension and $\\delta$ as small as $exp(-\\Omega(\\log^{1-c}(d)))$, where\n$0 < c < 1$ is an arbitrary constant and $d$ is the dimension.

However, without appropriate\nfiltering, such an approach may also heavily disorganize the predictor's\ninternal mechanisms, leading to diminishing returns. This paper studies a\nfundamental control-flow property: the sparsity in the correlation between\nbranches and recent history. First, we show that sparse branch correlations\nexist in standard applications and, more importantly, such correlations can be\ncomputed efficiently using sparse modeling methods. Second, we introduce a\nsparsity-aware branch prediction mechanism that can compactly encode and store\nsparse models to unlock essential performance opportunities.

This inner belt is bounded by an eccentricity-type\nsecular resonance and by the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unless\nasteroid perihelia are low enough to allow scattering by Mars, escape requires\ntransport to one of the bounding resonances. In addition Yarkovsky forces are\ngenerally ineffective in changing either the eccentricity and/or inclination\nfor asteroids with diameter $\\gtrsim$30 km. Thus, large asteroids with\npericentres far from Mars may only escape from the inner belt through large\nchanges in their eccentricities.

Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in 1.6--4.2 Hz\nand quasi-regular modulation (QRM) near 60 mHz are detected during the\noutburst. The mHz QRM has a fractional rms of 10%--16% in the 8--35 keV energy\nband with a Q factor (frequency/width) of 2--4. Benefiting from the broad\nenergy band of hxmt, we study the energy dependence of the 60 mHz QRM in 1--100\nkeV for the first time.

Fast recurrence of the mHz QRM, in a timescale of\nless than one hour, has been observed during the outburst. During this period,\nthe corresponding energy spectra moderately change when the source transitions\nfrom the QRM state to the non-QRM state. The QRM phenomena also shows a\ndependence with the accretion rate.

Past work has shown that\npopulation structure and reciprocity can both promote the evolution of\ncooperation. Yet the impact of these mechanisms has been typically studied in\nisolation. In this work, we study how the two mechanisms interact. Using a\ngame-theoretic model, we explore how people engage in reciprocal cooperation in\ngroup-structured populations, compared to well-mixed populations of equal size.\nTo derive analytical results, we focus on two scenarios. In the first scenario,\nwe assume a complete separation of time scales. Mutations are rare compared to\nbetween-group comparisons, which themselves are rare compared to within-group\ncomparisons. In the second scenario, there is a partial separation of time\nscales, where mutations and between-group comparisons occur at a comparable\nrate. In both scenarios, we find that the effect of population structure\ndepends on the benefit of cooperation. When this benefit is small,\ngroup-structured populations are more cooperative. But when the benefit is\nlarge, well-mixed populations result in more cooperation.

However, due to the ambiguous\nboundary, annotating camouflage objects pixel-wisely is very time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, taking ~60mins to label one image. In this paper, we propose\nthe first weakly-supervised COD method, using scribble annotations as\nsupervision. To achieve this, we first relabel 4,040 images in existing\ncamouflaged object datasets with scribbles, which takes ~10s to label one\nimage. As scribble annotations only describe the primary structure of objects\nwithout details, for the network to learn to localize the boundaries of\ncamouflaged objects, we propose a novel consistency loss composed of two parts:\na cross-view loss to attain reliable consistency over different images, and an\ninside-view loss to maintain consistency inside a single prediction map.\nBesides, we observe that humans use semantic information to segment regions\nnear the boundaries of camouflaged objects. Hence, we further propose a\nfeature-guided loss, which includes visual features directly extracted from\nimages and semantically significant features captured by the model. Finally, we\npropose a novel network for COD via scribble learning on structural information\nand semantic relations. Our network has two novel modules: the local-context\ncontrasted (LCC) module, which mimics visual inhibition to enhance image\ncontrast/sharpness and expand the scribbles into potential camouflaged regions,\nand the logical semantic relation (LSR) module, which analyzes the semantic\nrelation to determine the regions representing the camouflaged object.\nExperimental results show that our model outperforms relevant SOTA methods on\nthree COD benchmarks with an average improvement of 11.0% on MAE, 3.2% on\nS-measure, 2.5% on E-measure, and 4.4% on weighted F-measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 13:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 18:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The soft X-ray spectra, the\nbarely temporal evolution of colour, and the evolution of the HR mean that the\n2020 outburst shares similar features with the 2016-2017 outburst, which was\nconsidered as a possible candidate for a TDE.

Thus, in this study, we explore the salience of AI issues in the\npublic with an emphasis on ethical criteria to investigate whether it is likely\nthat ethical AI is actively requested by the population. Between May 2020 and\nApril 2021, we conducted 15 surveys asking the German population about the most\nimportant AI-related issues (total of N=14,988 respondents). Our results show\nthat the majority of respondents were not concerned with AI at all. However, it\ncan be seen that general interest in AI and a higher educational level are\npredictive of some engagement with AI. Among those, who reported having thought\nabout AI, specific applications (e.g., autonomous driving) were by far the most\nmentioned topics. Ethical issues are voiced only by a small subset of citizens\nwith fairness, accountability, and transparency being the least mentioned ones.\nThese have been identified in several ethical guidelines (including the EU\nCommission's proposal) as key elements for the development of ethical AI. The\nsalience of ethical issues affects the behavioral intentions of citizens in the\nway that they 1) tend to avoid AI technology and 2) engage in public\ndiscussions about AI. We conclude that the low level of ethical implications\nmay pose a serious problem for the actual implementation of ethical AI for the\nCommon Good and emphasize that those who are presumably most affected by\nethical issues of AI are especially unaware of ethical risks.

Depending\non the circumstances, this mechanism may drive granular motion on the surface\nof the secondary. We modeled the dynamical evolution of a Didymos-like binary\nasteroid system using a fully coupled, three-dimensional simulation code. Then,\nwe computed the time-varying gravitational and rotational accelerations felt\nover the entire surface resulting from the secondary's perturbed dynamical\nstate. We find that an excited spin and orbit can induce large changes in the\neffective surface slope, potentially triggering granular motion and surface\nrefreshment. However, for the case of the DART impact, this effect is highly\ndependent on many unknowns, such as Dimorphos's detailed shape, bulk density,\nsurface geology, and the momentum transferred. Aside from the Didymos system\nand the DART mission, this effect also has important implications for binary\nsystems in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 14:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Therefore, perturbation by climate change or human impact may\nlead to crossing of a tipping point beyond which there is rapid large-scale\nforest dieback that is not easily reversed [3-5]. Empirical evidence for\nbistability due to fire-vegetation feedbacks relies on tree cover bimodality in\nsatellite-observed data [1,2], but this may also be explained by spatial\nheterogeneity [6], or by biases in the data [7,8]. Theoretical evidence for\nbistability [9-11] does not consider the interaction of fire with the\nvegetation landscape. Focusing on landscapes consisting of tropical forest and\ngrassland, we show that the microscopic rules of fire and vegetation spread (as\nproposed by [12]) lead to an emergent relation between macroscopic forest\nstructure and dynamics.

Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports\nanalytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built\nupon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as\nlocation, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common\nmodeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived\nfeatures are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the\ndistance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via\nrole-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the\ngame. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor\nof global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic\ngraph-based representation of game states.

Despite its advantages, today's\nquantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To\nguarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it\nis crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the\ncompiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make\nusers aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we\nfill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware\nquantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum\ncomputing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer\nEvolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of\nthe noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates\nquick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum\nalgorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables\ndetailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits. We extensively evaluate\nthe performance of VACSEN through two case studies on quantum algorithms of\ndifferent scales and an in-depth interviews with 12 quantum computing users.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of VACSEN in achieving\nnoise-aware quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 14:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner\nwith a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on\nan expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter.\nHowever, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge\nis not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve\nthe robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated\nby optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with\noptimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy\ngeneration is the emergence of superficially different teammates. When used for\nAHT training, superficially different teammate behaviours may not improve a\nlearner's robustness during collaboration with unknown teammates. In this\npaper, we present an automated teammate policy generation method optimising the\nBest-Response Diversity (BRDiv) metric, which measures diversity based on the\ncompatibility of teammate policies in terms of returns. We evaluate our\napproach in environments with multiple valid coordination strategies, comparing\nagainst methods optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics and an\nablation not optimising any diversity metric.

To evaluate\npedestrian safety proactively, surrogate safety measures (SSMs) have been\nwidely used in traffic conflict-based studies as they do not require historical\ncrashes as inputs. However, most existing SSMs were developed based on the\nassumption that road users would maintain constant velocity and direction. Risk\nestimations based on this assumption are less unstable, more likely to be\nexaggerated, and unable to capture the evasive maneuvers of drivers.\nConsidering the limitations among existing SSMs, this study proposes a\nprobabilistic framework for estimating the risk of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts\nat intersections. The proposed framework loosen restrictions of constant speed\nby predicting trajectories using a Gaussian Process Regression and accounts for\nthe different possible driver maneuvers with a Random Forest model. Real-world\nLiDAR data collected at an intersection was used to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed framework. The newly developed framework is able to identify all\npedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Compared to the Time-to-Collision, the proposed\nframework provides a more stable risk estimation and captures the evasive\nmaneuvers of vehicles. Moreover, the proposed framework does not require\nexpensive computation resources, which makes it an ideal choice for real-time\nproactive pedestrian safety solutions at intersections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 15:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

In our experiments, the GMM\nestimator shows significant performance gains compared to approaches that are\nnot able to capture the ambient information. To validate the claim that ambient\ninformation is learnt, we generate synthetic channel data using a\nstate-of-the-art channel simulator and train the GMM estimator once on these\nand once on the real data, and we apply the estimator once to the synthetic and\nonce to the real data.

How such large grains grow from the micron size\n(or less) in the earliest phase of star formation remains relatively\nunexplored. In this study we take a first step to model the grain growth in the\nprotostellar environment, using two-dimensional (2D axisymmetric) radiation\nhydrodynamic and grain growth simulations. We show that the grain growth\ncalculations can be greatly simplified by the \"terminal velocity\napproximation\", where the dust drift velocity relative to the gas is\nproportional to its stopping time, which is proportional to the grain size. We\nfind that the grain-grain collision from size-dependent terminal velocity alone\nis too slow to convert a significant fraction of the initially micron-sized\ngrains into mm/cm sizes during the deeply embedded Class 0 phase. Substantial\ngrain growth is achieved when the grain-grain collision speed is enhanced by a\nfactor of 4. The dust growth above and below the disk midplane enables the\ngrains to settle faster towards the midplane, which increases the local\ndust-to-gas ratio, which, in turn, speeds up further growth there. How this\nneeded enhancement can be achieved is unclear, although turbulence is a strong\npossibility that deserves further exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 15:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

In this paper, an efficient and\neffective end-to-end network for automatic pavement crack segmentation, called\nRHA-Net, is proposed to improve the pavement crack segmentation accuracy. The\nRHA-Net is built by integrating residual blocks (ResBlocks) and hybrid\nattention blocks into the encoder-decoder architecture. The ResBlocks are used\nto improve the ability of RHA-Net to extract high-level abstract features. The\nhybrid attention blocks are designed to fuse both low-level features and\nhigh-level features to help the model focus on correct channels and areas of\ncracks, thereby improving the feature presentation ability of RHA-Net. An image\ndata set containing 789 pavement crack images collected by a self-designed\nmobile robot is constructed and used for training and evaluating the proposed\nmodel. Compared with other state-of-the-art networks, the proposed model\nachieves better performance and the functionalities of adding residual blocks\nand hybrid attention mechanisms are validated in a comprehensive ablation\nstudy. Additionally, a light-weighted version of the model generated by\nintroducing depthwise separable convolution achieves better a performance and a\nmuch faster processing speed with 1/30 of the number of U-Net parameters.

However, DETR suffers from slow\ntraining convergence, which hinders its applicability to various detection\ntasks. We observe that DETR's slow convergence is largely attributed to the\ndifficulty in matching object queries to relevant regions due to the unaligned\nsemantics between object queries and encoded image features. With this\nobservation, we design Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR++ (SAM-DETR++) to\naccelerate DETR's convergence and improve detection performance. The core of\nSAM-DETR++ is a plug-and-play module that projects object queries and encoded\nimage features into the same feature embedding space, where each object query\ncan be easily matched to relevant regions with similar semantics. Besides,\nSAM-DETR++ searches for multiple representative keypoints and exploits their\nfeatures for semantic-aligned matching with enhanced representation capacity.\nFurthermore, SAM-DETR++ can effectively fuse multi-scale features in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner on the basis of the designed semantic-aligned matching.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed SAM-DETR++ achieves superior\nconvergence speed and competitive detection accuracy.

In image sensing, a measurement,\nsuch as of an object's position, is performed by computational analysis of a\ndigitized image. An emerging image-sensing paradigm breaks this delineation\nbetween data collection and analysis by designing optical components to perform\nnot imaging, but encoding. By optically encoding images into a compressed,\nlow-dimensional latent space suitable for efficient post-analysis, these image\nsensors can operate with fewer pixels and fewer photons, allowing\nhigher-throughput, lower-latency operation. Optical neural networks (ONNs)\noffer a platform for processing data in the analog, optical domain. ONN-based\nsensors have however been limited to linear processing, but nonlinearity is a\nprerequisite for depth, and multilayer NNs significantly outperform shallow NNs\non many tasks. Here, we realize a multilayer ONN pre-processor for image\nsensing, using a commercial image intensifier as a parallel optoelectronic,\noptical-to-optical nonlinear activation function. We demonstrate that the\nnonlinear ONN pre-processor can achieve compression ratios of up to 800:1 while\nstill enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision\ntasks, including machine-vision benchmarks, flow-cytometry image\nclassification, and identification of objects in real scenes. In all cases we\nfind that the ONN's nonlinearity and depth allowed it to outperform a purely\nlinear ONN encoder. Although our experiments are specialized to ONN sensors for\nincoherent-light images, alternative ONN platforms should facilitate a range of\nONN sensors. These ONN sensors may surpass conventional sensors by\npre-processing optical information in spatial, temporal, and/or spectral\ndimensions, potentially with coherent and quantum qualities, all natively in\nthe optical domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 21:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

A recently published\nhydraulic performance model has been reported to outperform established\nwork-balance models in predicting recovery during intermittent exercise.

In\nthis work, we hypothesised that the benefits of the model come at the cost of\ninaccurate predictions of metabolic responses to exercise such as\n$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n  Methods: Hydraulic model predictions were compared to breath-by-breath\n$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ data from 25 constant high-intensity exercise tests of\n5 participants (age $32\\pm7.8$ years, weight $73.6 \\pm 5.81$ kg,\n$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2\\mathrm{max}} \\; 3.59 \\pm 0.62$ L/min).

Beyond\nformal approaches, various attempts have been made to estimate the termination\nbehavior of programs using neural networks. However, the majority of these\napproaches continue to rely on formal methods to provide strong soundness\nguarantees and consequently suffer from similar limitations. In this paper, we\nmove away from formal methods and embrace the stochastic nature of machine\nlearning models. Instead of aiming for rigorous guarantees that can be\ninterpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a\nprogram's termination behavior and of the likely reason for nontermination\n(when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Compared to\nprevious approaches using neural networks for program termination, we also take\nadvantage of the graph representation of programs by employing Graph Neural\nNetworks. To further assist programmers in understanding and debugging\nnontermination bugs, we adapt the notions of attention and semantic\nsegmentation, previously used for other application domains, to programs.\nOverall, we designed and implemented classifiers for program termination based\non Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, as well as a\nsemantic segmentation Graph Neural Network that localizes AST nodes likely to\ncause nontermination.

Such a characterization leads to the\ndetermination of several numbers (integers or non-integers) that we call the\ncharacteristic numbers of a given parity vector. Some characteristic numbers\nare linked together by equations that can be called characteristic equations of\nthe considered parity vector. If a parity vector v of finite length n contains\nthe first n terms of a parity vector V of infinite length then all the\ncharacteristic numbers of v are considered as characteristic numbers of order n\nof the infinite vector V. The limits of nth order characteristic numbers when n\ntends to infinity constitute the absolute characteristic numbers of the\ninfinite vector V and they allow determining its behavior and properties. In\nthis paper, we study the properties of parity vectors of infinite length based\non their characteristic numbers. Then, we establish the relations between the\nfirst term of a Collatz sequence and its parity vector. Finally, still based on\nthe characteristic numbers, we determine some conditions of existence and\nnon-existence of divergent sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 22:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

This wave function is gleaned from the single particle\nenergy-momentum eigenstate offered by the theory of space filling universal\nquantum fields that is an inevitable outcome of Dirac's pioneering masterpiece.\nExamples of these well-known enigmas are wave particle duality, the de Broglie\nhypothesis, the uncertainty principle, wave function collapse, and predictions\nof measurement outcomes in terms of probability instead of certainty. Paul\nDirac successfully incorporated special theory of relativity into quantum\nmechanics for the first time. This was accomplished through his ingenious use\nof matrices that allowed the equations of motion to maintain the necessary\nfirst order time derivative feature necessary for positive probability density.\nThe ensuing Dirac equation for the electron led to the recognition of the\nmystifying quantized spin and magnetic moment as intrinsic properties in\ncontrast to earlier ad hoc assumptions. The solution of his relativistic\nequation for the hydrogen atom produced results in perfect agreement with\nexperimental data available at the time. The most far reaching prediction of\nthe celebrated Dirac equation was the totally unexpected existence of\nanti-particles, culminating in the eventual development of the quantum field\ntheory of the Standard Model that reveals the deepest secrets of the universe\nknown to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}
