Magnetic\ndipole and electric quadrupole degrees of freedom arising from the large\nangular moment of $J=15/2$, in combination with the symmetric and antisymmetric\nexchange interactions and the crystal field anisotropy, give rise to competing\nordered phases. We show that the antiferromagnetically coupled Dy moments in\nthe $ab$-plane form an incommensurate helimagnetic order with $q\\sim(0, 0,\n0.43)$ just below $T_{\\text{N}}=10$ K, which further exhibits successive\nfirst-order transitions to the commensurate helimagnetic order with\n$q=(0,0,0.5)$ at $T_{\\text{N}}^{\\;\\prime}=9.0$ K, and to the canted\nantiferromagnetic order with $q=(0,0,0)$ at $T_{\\text{N}}^{\\;\\prime\\prime}=8.5$\nK, both with large coexistence regions.

This is one of the central questions driving the SOFIA legacy program\nFEEDBACK. Here, we present a case study toward the prototypical H{\\sc ii}\nregion NGC7538. Methods: With SOFIA we mapped an area of ~210'^2 around NGC7538\nin the [CII] line at 1.9THz. Complementary observed atomic carbon [CI] and\nhigh-J CO(8-7) data as well as archival NIR/FIR, cm continuum, CO(3-2) and HI\ndata are folded into the analysis. Results: While the overall [CII] morphology\nfollows the general ionized gas, the channel maps show multiple bubble-like\nstructures with sizes on the order of ~80-100\" (~1.0-1.28pc). While at least\none of them may be an individual feedback bubble driven by the main exciting\nsources of the region, the other bubble-morphologies may also be due to the\nintrinsically porous structure of the HII region. An analysis of the expansion\nvelocities around 10km s^{-1} indicates that thermal expansion is not\nsufficient but that wind-driving from the central O-stars is required. The most\nblue-shifted [CII] component has barely any molecular or atomic counterparts.\nAt the interface to the molecular cloud, we find a typical photon-dominated\nregion (PDR) with a bar-shape. Ionized, atomic and molecular carbon show a\nlayered structure in this PDR. The carbon in the PDR is dominated by its\nionized form with atomic and molecular masses of ~0.45+-0.1M_{\\odot} and\n~1.2+-0.1M_{\\odot}, respectively, compared to the ionized carbon in the range\nof 3.6-9.7M_{\\odot}. Conclusions: The NGC7538 HII region exhibits a diverse set\nof sub-structures that interact with each other as well as with the adjacent\ncloud. Compared to other recent [CII] observations of HII regions (e.g., Orion\nVeil, RCW120, RCW49), bubble-shape morphologies revealed in [CII] emission,\nindicative of expanding shells, are recurring structures of PDRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

A crucial resource for\ntargeting further investment of public and private resources, as well as\ntracking the progress of universal electrification goals, is shared access to\nhigh-quality data on individual SHS installations including information such as\nlocation and power capacity. Though recent studies utilizing satellite imagery\nand machine learning to detect solar panels have emerged, they struggle to\naccurately locate many SHS due to limited image resolution (some small solar\npanels only occupy several pixels in satellite imagery). In this work, we\nexplore the viability and cost-performance tradeoff of using automatic SHS\ndetection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery as an alternative to\nsatellite imagery. More specifically, we explore three questions: (i) what is\nthe detection performance of SHS using drone imagery; (ii) how expensive is the\ndrone data collection, compared to satellite imagery; and (iii) how well does\ndrone-based SHS detection perform in real-world scenarios. We collect and\npublicly-release a dataset of high-resolution drone imagery encompassing SHS\nimaged under real-world conditions and use this dataset and a dataset from\nRwanda to evaluate the capabilities of deep learning models to recognize SHS,\nincluding those that are too small to be reliably recognized in satellite\nimagery. The results suggest that UAV imagery may be a viable alternative to\nidentify very small SHS from perspectives of both detection accuracy and\nfinancial costs of data collection. UAV-based data collection may be a\npractical option for supporting electricity access planning strategies for\nachieving sustainable development goals and for monitoring the progress towards\nthose goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 17:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Data from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an\neruptive flare/coronal mass ejection provide ambient conditions for the\nevolving particle distributions. Magnetic islands, which are created by\nsporadic reconnection at the self-consistently formed flare current sheet,\ncontract and accelerate the particles. The particle distributions are evolved\nusing rules derived in our previous work. In this investigation, we assume that\na prescribed fraction of particles sequentially \"hops\" to another accelerator\nand receives an additional boost in energy and anisotropy. This sequential\nprocess generates particle number spectra that obey an approximate power law at\nmid-range energies and presents low- and high-energy breaks. We analyze these\nspectral regions as functions of the model parameters. We also present a fully\nanalytic method for forming and interpreting such spectra, independent of the\nsequential acceleration model. The method requires only a few constrained\nphysical parameters, such as the percentage of particles transferred between\naccelerators, the energy gain in each accelerator, and the number of\naccelerators visited. Our investigation seeks to bridge the gap between MHD and\nkinetic regimes by combining global simulations and analytic kinetic theory.\nThe model reproduces and explains key characteristics of observed flare hard\nX-ray spectra as well as the underlying properties of the accelerated\nparticles. Our analytic model provides tools to interpret high-energy\nobservations for missions and telescopes, such as RHESSI, FOXSI, NuSTAR, Solar\nOrbiter, EOVSA, and future high-energy missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Recent\nwork has made considerable progress in identifying optimal algorithms for\nranked enumeration of join queries that do not contain any projections. In this\npaper, we initiate the study of the problem of enumerating results in ranked\norder for queries with projections. Our main result shows that for any acyclic\nquery, it is possible to obtain a near-linear (in the size of the database)\ndelay algorithm after only a linear time preprocessing step for two important\nranking functions: sum and lexicographic ordering. For a practical subset of\nacyclic queries known as star queries, we show an even stronger result that\nallows a user to obtain a smooth tradeoff between faster answering time\nguarantees using more preprocessing time. Our results are also extensible to\nqueries containing cycles and unions.

Several methods have been proposed to build 3D extinction maps of\nthe Milky Way (MW), most often based on Bayesian approaches. Although some\nstudies employed machine learning (ML) methods in part of their procedure, or\nto specific targets, no 3D extinction map of a large volume of the MW solely\nbased on a Neural Network method has been reported so far. Aims. We aim to\napply deep learning as a solution to build 3D extinction maps of the MW.\nMethods. We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the CIANNA\nframework, and trained it with synthetic 2MASS data. We used the Besan\\c{c}on\nGalaxy model to generate mock star catalogs, and 1D Gaussian random fields to\nsimulate the extinction profiles. From these data we computed color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) to train the network, using the corresponding extinction\nprofiles as targets. A forward pass with observed 2MASS CMDs provided\nextinction profile estimates for a grid of lines of sight. Results. We trained\nour network with data simulating lines of sight in the area of the Carina\nspiral arm tangent and obtained a 3D extinction map for a large sector in this\nregion ($l = 257 - 303$ deg, $|b| \\le 5$ deg), with distance and angular\nresolutions of $100$ pc and $30$ arcmin, respectively, and reaching up to $\\sim\n10$ kpc. Although each sightline is computed independently in the forward\nphase, the so-called fingers-of-God artifacts are weaker than in many other 3D\nextinction maps. We found that our CNN was efficient in taking advantage of\nredundancy across lines of sight, enabling us to train it with only 9\nsightlines simultaneously to build the whole map. Conclusions. We found deep\nlearning to be a reliable approach to produce 3D extinction maps from large\nsurveys. With this methodology, we expect to easily combine heterogeneous\nsurveys without cross-matching, and therefore to exploit several surveys in a\ncomplementary fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

To address this, in this paper we introduce\nthe idea of transfer-tuning, a novel approach to identify and reuse\nauto-schedules between tensor programs.

Moreover, the dark halo\nresponse is largely dominated by the first order 'forcing' term, with little\ninfluence from self-gravity. This makes it difficult to constrain the\nunderlying velocity distribution of the dark halo using the observed response\nof the stellar halo, but it allows us to investigate the response of stellar\nhalo models with various velocity anisotropies: a tangential (respectively\nradial) halo produces a shallower (respectively stronger) response. We also\nshow that only the local wake is responsible for these variations, the reflex\nmotion being solely dependent on the MW potential. Therefore, we identify the\nstructure (orientation and winding) of the in-plane quadrupolar ($m=2$)\nresponse as a potentially good probe of the stellar halo anisotropy.

Due to an increasing need for regulatory compliance\nrequired for ML applications, machine unlearning is becoming an emerging\nresearch problem. The right to be forgotten requests come in the form of\nremoval of a certain set or class of data from the already trained ML model.\nPractical considerations preclude retraining of the model from scratch after\ndiscarding the deleted data.

For the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association to make sense, we must\neither accept this low flux ratio or suppose that only some rare sub-population\nof blazars is capable of high-energy neutrino production. For example, if we\nconsider neutrino production only in blazar flares, we expect the flux ratio of\nbetween $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$ to be consistent with a single coincident\nobservation of a neutrino alert and flaring $\\gamma$-ray blazar. These\nconstraints should be interpreted in the context of the likelihood models used\nto find the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association, which assumes a fixed\npower-law neutrino spectrum of $E^{-2.13}$ for all blazars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 19:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Typically, the role of two-phase dynamics is\nneglected under the assumption that the liquid rapidly transitions to a\nsupercritical state. However, a transcritical domain exists where a sharp phase\ninterface remains. This scenario is the common case in the early times of\nliquid fuel injection under real-engine conditions involving hydrocarbon fuels.\nUnder such conditions, the dissolution of the oxidizer species into the liquid\nphase is accelerated due to local thermodynamic phase equilibrium (LTE) and\nvaporization or condensation can occur at multiple locations along the\ninterface at the same time. Fluid properties vary under species and thermal\nmixing, with similar liquid and gas mixtures near the interface. As a result of\nthe combination of low, varying surface-tension force and gas-like liquid\nviscosities, small surface instabilities develop early. The mixing process,\ninterface thermodynamics, and early deformation of a cool liquid n-decane jet\nsurrounded by a hotter moving gas initially composed of pure oxygen are\nanalyzed at various ambient pressures and gas velocities. A two-phase,\nlow-Mach-number flow solver for variable-density fluids is used. The interface\nis captured using a split Volume-of-Fluid method, generalized for a\nnon-divergence-free liquid velocity and mass exchange across the interface. The\nimportance of transcritical mixing effects over time for increasing pressures\nis shown. Initially, local deformation features differ considerably from\nprevious incompressible works. Then, the minimal surface-tension force is\nresponsible for the generation of overlapping liquid layers in favor of the\nclassical atomization into droplets. Thus, surface-area growth at transcritical\nconditions is mainly a consequence of gas-like deformations under shear rather\nthan spray formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 19:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 22:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Besides, most of them\ndo not provide crucial explanations on how the creator could improve their\ncontent. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLUE for the\neducational domain, which learns from the features extracted from freely\navailable public online teaching videos and provides explainable feedback on\nthe video along with a user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task,\nour unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as\nan ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits various multi-modal features to\nmodel the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion\nof the delivered content, animation, speaker's pitch and speech emotions. Under\na transfer learning setup, the overall model, in the unified space, is\nfine-tuned for downstream applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 19:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The well-known electrostatic\ninstabilities -- slab and curvature-mediated ETG -- are recovered, and a new\ninstability is found in the EM regime, called the Thermo-Alfv\\'enic instability\n(TAI). It exists in both a slab version (sTAI, destabilising kinetic Alfv\\'en\nwaves) and a curvature-mediated version (cTAI), which is a cousin of the\n(electron-scale) kinetic ballooning mode (KBM). The cTAI turns out to be\ndominant at the largest scales covered by the model (greater than $d_e$ but\nsmaller than $\\rho_i$), its physical mechanism hinging on the fast equalisation\nof the total temperature along perturbed magnetic field lines (in contrast to\nKBM, which is pressure balanced). A turbulent cascade theory is then\nconstructed, with two energy-injection scales: $d_e$, where the drivers are\nslab ETG and sTAI, and a larger (parallel system size dependent) scale, where\nthe driver is cTAI. The latter dominates the turbulent transport if the\ntemperature gradient is greater than a certain critical value, which scales\ninversely with the electron beta. The resulting heat flux scales more steeply\nwith the temperature gradient than that due to electrostatic ETG turbulence,\ngiving rise to stiffer transport.

In order to hide the face values\nof coins when a payment operation consumes or creates them, Zef uses random\ncommitments and NIZK proofs. Created coins are made unlinkable using the blind\nand randomizable threshold anonymous credentials of Coconut. To control storage\ncosts associated with coin replay prevention, Zef accounts are designed so that\ndata can be safely removed once an account is deactivated. Besides the\nspecifications and a detailed analysis of the protocol, we are making available\nan open-source implementation of Zef in Rust. Our extensive benchmarks on AWS\nconfirm textbook linear scalability and demonstrate a confirmation time under\none second at nominal capacity. Compared to existing anonymous payment systems\nbased on a blockchain, this represents a latency speedup of three orders of\nmagnitude, with no theoretical limit on throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 11:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 19:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 21:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

The former is observed in the regime of strong\nmagnon-photon couplings, particularly when the three modes bear comparable\nrelaxation rates. This character is marked by the appearance of three\ndistinguishable and non-converging polariton branches in the spectral response\nto a cavity drive. However, when the bare modes are resonant and the couplings\nperfectly symmetrical, one of the spectral peaks gets wiped out. This anomalous\nextinction of polaritonic response can be traced down to the existence of a\nconspicuous dark mode alongside two frequency-shifted bright modes. In an\nalternate parameter regime, where the magnon modes are weakly coupled to the\ncavity, features of level attraction unfold, subject to a large relaxation rate\nfor the cavity mode. Concurrently, for antisymmetric detunings to the magnon\nmodes, a transmission window springs into existence, exhibiting transparency in\nthe limit of negligible dissipation from the magnons. The emergence of level\nattraction can be reconciled with a theoretical model that embodies the\ndynamics of the magnon-magnon subsystem when the cavity field decays rapidly\ninto its steady state.

This would\nrequire long scan times and can be particularly difficult to achieve with\ncertain patient populations such as neonates. Here, we propose a method that\ncan accurately estimate the diffusion tensor from only six diffusion-weighted\nmeasurements. Our method achieves this by learning to exploit the relationships\nbetween the diffusion signals and tensors in neighboring voxels. Our model is\nbased on transformer networks, which represent the state of the art in modeling\nthe relationship between signals in a sequence. In particular, our model\nconsists of two such networks. The first network estimates the diffusion tensor\nbased on the diffusion signals in a neighborhood of voxels. The second network\nprovides more accurate tensor estimations by learning the relationships between\nthe diffusion signals as well as the tensors estimated by the first network in\nneighboring voxels. Our experiments with three datasets show that our proposed\nmethod achieves highly accurate estimations of the diffusion tensor and is\nsignificantly superior to three competing methods. Estimations produced by our\nmethod with six diffusion-weighted measurements are comparable with those of\nstandard estimation methods with 30-88 diffusion-weighted measurements.

The rearrangement\nof particles when subject to a dynamic shear environment can delay the clogging\nof a pore or even remove an existing clog.

Recent approaches mostly adopt the\nsophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture the tampering\nartifacts left in the images to locate the manipulated regions. However, these\napproaches ignore the feature correlations, i.e., feature inconsistencies,\nbetween manipulated regions and non-manipulated regions, leading to inferior\ndetection performance. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical Graph\nConvolutional Network (HGCN-Net), which consists of two parallel branches: the\nbackbone network branch and the hierarchical graph representation learning\n(HGRL) branch for image manipulation detection. Specifically, the feature maps\nof a given image are extracted by the backbone network branch, and then the\nfeature correlations within the feature maps are modeled as a set of\nfully-connected graphs for learning the hierarchical graph representation by\nthe HGRL branch. The learned hierarchical graph representation can sufficiently\ncapture the feature correlations across different scales, and thus it provides\nhigh discriminability for distinguishing manipulated and non-manipulated\nregions.

Dynamics of NRNs can be described at\ndifferent coarse-grained levels. Our previous work showed that the apparent\nenergy dissipation rate at a coarse-grained level follows an inverse power law\ndependence on the scale of coarse-graining. The scaling exponent is determined\nby the network structure and correlation of stationary probability fluxes.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether and how the (renormalized) flux correlation\nvaries with coarse-graining. Following Kadanoff's real space renormalization\ngroup (RG) approach for critical phenomena, we address this question by\ndeveloping a State-Space Renormalization Group (SSRG) theory for NRNs, which\nleads to an iterative RG equation for the flux correlation function. In square\nand hypercubic lattices, we solve the RG equation exactly and find two types of\nfixed point solutions: a family of nontrivial fixed points where the\ncorrelation exhibits power-law decay and a trivial fixed point where the\ncorrelation vanishes beyond the nearest neighbors. The power-law fixed point is\nstable if and only if the power exponent is less than the lattice dimension\n$n$. Consequently, the correlation function converges to the power-law fixed\npoint only when the correlation in the fine-grained network decays slower than\n$r^{-n}$ and to the trivial fixed point otherwise. If the flux correlation in\nthe fine-grained network contains multiple stable solutions with different\nexponents, the RG iteration dynamics select the fixed point solution with the\nsmallest exponent. We also discuss a possible connection between the RG flows\nof flux correlation with those of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 03:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 05:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

This paper models the blockchain transaction\nrecords as a blockchain transaction graph and tackles blockchain transaction\ntracing as a graph searching task. We propose TRacer, a scalable transaction\ntracing tool for account-based blockchains. To infer the relevance between\naccounts during graph searching, we develop a novel personalized PageRank\nmethod in TRacer based on the directed, weighted, temporal, and\nmulti-relationship blockchain transaction graphs. To the best of our knowledge,\nTRacer is the first intelligent transaction tracing tool in account-based\nblockchains that can handle complex transaction actions in decentralized\nfinance (DeFi). Experimental results and theoretical analysis prove that TRacer\ncan complete the transaction tracing task effectively at a low cost. All codes\nof TRacer are available at GitHub.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 05:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 11:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2022 07:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor\nproperties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed\ninto the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal,\nand the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the\ntensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms.

Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method\nhas achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand, various deep\nneural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images.\nOn the other hand, the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the\nhigh-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind\nof methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database\nsamples in a symmetric way. However, with the number of database samples\nincreasing, it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of\nlarge-scale database images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing\nmethod, named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL), for RSIR.

Therefore, it is quite challenging to integrate multi-view\nnoisy data under unsupervised setting. Traditional multi-view methods either\nsimply treat each view with equal importance or tune the weights of different\nviews to fixed values, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic noise in\nmulti-view data.

However, the\nunderstanding on such interactions and their distance dependent effects remains\nelusive, especially for the heteronuclear SACs. In this study, we reveal the\neffects of the distance-dependent inter-site interaction on the catalytic\nperformance of SACs. Using the density functional theory calculations, we\nsystematically investigate the heteronuclear iron and cobalt single atoms\nco-supported on the nitrogen-doped graphene (FeN4-C and CoN4-C) for oxygen\nreduction reaction (ORR). We find that as the distance between Fe and Co SACs\ndecreases, FeN4-C exhibits a reduced catalytic activity, which can be mitigated\nby the presence of an axial hydroxyl ligand, whereas the activity of CoN4-C\nshows a volcano-like evolution with the optimum reached at the intermediate\ndistance. We further unravel that the transition towards the high-spin state\nupon adsorption of ORR intermediate adsorbates is responsible for the decreased\nactivity of both FeN4-C and CoN4-C at short inter-site distance. Such high-spin\nstate transition is also found to significantly shift the linear relation\nbetween hydroxyl (*OH) and hydroperoxyl (*OOH) adsorbates.

Furthermore, we extend the proposed model for\ncolor VCS to perform joint reconstruction and demosaicing. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our 2-stage model has also achieved SOTA on color VCS\nreconstruction, leading to a >2.3dB gain in PSNR over the previous SOTA\nalgorithm based on plug-and-play framework, meanwhile speeds up the\nreconstruction by >17 times. In addition, we have found that our network is\nalso flexible to the mask modulation and scale size for color VCS\nreconstruction so that a single trained network can be applied to different\nhardware systems. The code and models will be released to the public.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 09:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 04:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

How to\nutilize multiple views latent representation of each single task to improve\neach learning task performance is a challenge problem. Based on this, we\nproposed a novel semi-supervised algorithm, termed as Multi-Task Multi-View\nlearning based on Common and Special Features (MTMVCSF). In general,\nmulti-views are the different aspects of an object and every view includes the\nunderlying common or special information of this object. As a consequence, we\nwill mine multiple views jointly latent factor of each learning task which\nconsists of each view special feature and the common feature of all views. By\nthis way, the original multi-task multi-view data has degenerated into\nmulti-task data, and exploring the correlations among multiple tasks enables to\nmake an improvement on the performance of learning algorithm. Another obvious\nadvantage of this approach is that we get latent representation of the set of\nunlabeled instances by the constraint of regression task with labeled\ninstances. The performance of classification and semi-supervised clustering\ntask in these latent representations perform obviously better than it in raw\ndata. Furthermore, an anti-noise multi-task multi-view algorithm called\nAN-MTMVCSF is proposed, which has a strong adaptability to noise labels. The\neffectiveness of these algorithms is proved by a series of well-designed\nexperiments on both real world and synthetic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 11:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Here we attempt to impose constraints on such a\ntransition by using two robust low-z redshift survey datasets ($z<0.01$), taken\nfrom the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) as well as the 2MASS Redshift\nSurvey (2MRS). In both surveys, we bin the data in redshift bins and focus on\nthe number of galaxies in each bin ($\\Delta N(z_i)$). We observe a peak in the\ndistribution of galaxies near a distance of approximately 20 Mpc in both\ndatasets. This feature could be attributed to galactic density fluctuations, to\ncoherent peculiar velocities of galaxies or to an ultra late-time gravitational\ntransition in the same era.

Previous works mainly focus on homogeneous recommendation and little\nprogress has been made for heterogeneous recommender systems.

In this respect, defect engineering has been in the\nfocus of a long-standing quest for fabricating LSMO thin films with highest\nquality in terms of both structural and magnetic properties. Here, we discuss\nthe correlation between structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies and\nimpurity islands, and magnetism in La0.74Sr0.26MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) epitaxial\nheterostructures by systematic control of the growth temperature and\npost-deposition annealing conditions. Upon increasing the growth temperature\nwithin the 500 $-$ 700 $^{\\circ}$C range, the epitaxial LSMO films experience a\nprogressive improvement in oxygen stoichiometry, leading to enhanced magnetic\ncharacteristics. Concurrently, however, the use of a high growth temperature\ntriggers the diffusion of impurities from the bulk of STO, which cause the\ncreation of off-stoichiometric, dendritic-like SrMoOx islands at the\nfilm/substrate interface. As a valuable workaround, post-deposition annealing\nof the LSMO films grown at a relatively-low temperature of about 500\n$^{\\circ}$C permits to obtain high-quality epitaxy, atomically-flat surface as\nwell as a sharp magnetic transition above room temperature and robust\nferromagnetism. Furthermore, under such optimized fabrication conditions\npossible scenarios for the formation of the magnetic dead layer as a function\nof LSMO film thickness are discussed.

To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes the\ndigitalization framework, designed and developed by following a Design Science\nResearch (DSR) methodology over a period of 18 months. The framework can help\npractitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing\nthe pros and cons for each level, deciding evaluation criteria for the digital\ntwin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the\norganizational processes and strategies, and value creation. Three real-life\ncase studies illustrate the application and usefulness of the framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

This paper presents a multifaceted approach to determine the\nelectronic doping density for a range of different lead-halide perovskite\nsystems. Optical and electrical characterisation techniques comprising\nintensity-dependent and transient photoluminescence, AC Hall effect,\ntransfer-length-methods, and charge extraction measurements were instrumental\nin quantifying an upper limit for the doping density. The obtained values are\nsubsequently compared to the charge on the electrodes per unit volume at\nshort-circuit conditions, which amounts to roughly $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. This\nfigure equals the product of the capacitance $C$ and the built-in potential\n$V_\\mathrm{bi}$ and represents the critical limit below which doping-induced\ncharges do not influence the device performance. The experimental results\ndemonstrate consistently that the doping density is below this critical\nthreshold ($<10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ which means $<CV_\\mathrm{bi}$ per unit volume)\nfor all common lead-based metal-halide perovskites. Nevertheless, although the\ndensity of doping-induced charges is too low to redistribute the built-in\nvoltage in the perovskite active layer, mobile ions are present in sufficient\nquantities to create space-charge-regions in the active layer, reminiscent of\ndoped pn-junctions.

Then, we develop a Part-of-Speech (POS) algorithm to\nautomatically identify and extract adjective-noun pairs from the review content\nfor review tag generation based on POS tagging and dependency parsing. Finally,\nwe also train a RankNet model for the re-ranking of the retrieval results to\nimprove the accuracy in our Solr-based food reviews search system. The\nexperimental results show that our proposed deep learning approaches are\npromising for the applications of real-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 02:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

The\nproposed algorithm is based on the process of transferring students from high\nschool to college. The proposed technique produces a set of non-dominated\nsolutions. To judge the ability and efficacy of the proposed multiobjective\nalgorithm, it is evaluated against a group of benchmarks and five real-world\nengineering optimization problems. Additionally, to evaluate the proposed\ntechnique quantitatively, several most widely used metrics are applied.\nMoreover, the results are confirmed statistically. The proposed work is then\ncompared with three multiobjective algorithms, which are MOWCA, NSGA-II, and\nMODA. Similar to the proposed technique, the other algorithms in the literature\nwere run against the benchmarks, and the real-world engineering problems\nutilized in the paper. The algorithms are compared with each other employing\ndescriptive, tabular, and graphical demonstrations. The results proved the\nability of the proposed work in providing a set of non-dominated solutions, and\nthat the algorithm outperformed the other participated algorithms in most of\nthe cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 14:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

However the nature of this link is not fully\nunderstood. Cold initial conditions alone without further symmetry do not lead\nto self-similarity. Here we show that when the system approaches equilibrium a\nnew symmetry appears. The combination of this equilibrium symmetry with the\ncold symmetry in the initial conditions leads to full self-similarity. As a\nconsequence for any initially cold system even if the initial spatial\ndistribution is not self-similar we will observe an evolution towards\nself-similarity near equilibrium. The case of one dimensional systems or\nspherically symmetric systems in 3D are discussed in detail. Systems depending\non the energy and other integrals are also considered. The problem of the\ndegeneracy of the self-similar solutions at equilibrium is tackled. It is shown\nthat very small perturbations at the center of the system have the ability to\nbreak this degeneracy and lead to the convergence towards a specific\nauto-similar solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 19:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

However, when the\ncross-sectional shape varies even mildly (such as a taper), existing\nsemi-analytical methods suffer from high computational cost. We show that the\nexisting methods can be viewed as a zeroth-order approximation with respect to\nthe structure's cross-sectional variation.

Based on\nthis expansion, we propose a new semi-analytical method that is fast to compute\neven in presence of large cross-sectional shape variation.
