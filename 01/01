Being formed in predominantly atomic gas by reactions between Ar+,\nwhich were initially ionised by cosmic rays and molecular hydrogen, ArH+ has\nbeen shown to be an excellent tracer of atomic gas as well as the impinging\ncosmic-ray ionisation rates. In this work, we attempt to extend the\nobservations of ArH+in extragalactic sources to examine its use as a tracer of\nthe atomic interstellar medium (ISM) in these galaxies. We report the detection\nof ArH+ towards two luminous nearby galaxies, NGC 253 and NGC 4945, and the\nnon-detection towards Arp 220 observed using the SEPIA660 receiver on the APEX\n12 m telescope. In addition, the two sidebands of this receiver allowed us to\nobserve the NKaKc=1_1,0-1_0,1 transitions of another atomic gas tracer p-H2O+\nat 607.227 GHz with the ArH+ line, simultaneously. We modelled the optically\nthin spectra of both species and compared their observed line profiles with\nthat of other well-known atomic gas tracers such as OH+ and o-H2O+ and diffuse\nand dense molecular gas tracers HF and CO, respectively. By further assuming\nthat the observed absorption from the ArH+, OH+, and H2O+ molecules are\naffected by the same flux of cosmic rays, we investigate the properties of the\ndifferent cloud layers based on a steady-state analysis of the chemistry of\nthese three species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 16:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

It was used effectively during the Ebola epidemic and successfully\nimplemented in several parts of the world during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nAn important consideration in contact tracing is the budget on the number of\nindividuals asked to quarantine -- the budget is limited for socioeconomic\nreasons. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to\nformulate the problem of using contact tracing to reduce the size of an\noutbreak while asking a limited number of people to quarantine. We formulate\neach step of the MDP as a combinatorial problem, MinExposed, which we\ndemonstrate is NP-Hard; as a result, we develop an LP-based approximation\nalgorithm. Though this algorithm directly solves MinExposed, it is often\nimpractical in the real world due to information constraints. To this end, we\ndevelop a greedy approach based on insights from the analysis of the previous\nalgorithm, which we show is more interpretable. A key feature of the greedy\nalgorithm is that it does not need complete information of the underlying\nsocial contact network. This makes the heuristic implementable in practice and\nis an important consideration. Finally, we carry out experiments on simulations\nof the MDP run on real-world networks, and show how the algorithms can help in\nbending the epidemic curve while limiting the number of isolated individuals.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that the greedy algorithm and its variants\nare especially effective, robust, and practical in a variety of realistic\nscenarios, such as when the contact graph and specific transmission\nprobabilities are not known.

The global\nobjective function is formulated in the space of the weighted parameters, but\nthe Gramian constraint is implemented in the original space, and the nonlinear\nconstraint is imposed using two separate Lagrange parameters, one for each\nmodel domain. This combined approach provides more similarity between the\nreconstructed models. It is assumed that the measured data are obtained on a\nuniform grid and that a consistent regular discretization of the volume domain\nis imposed. The sensitivity matrices exhibit a block Toeplitz Toeplitz block\nstructure for each depth layer of the model domain. Forward and transpose\noperations with the matrices can be implemented efficiently using two\ndimensional fast Fourier transforms. This makes it feasible to solve for large\nscale problems with respect to both computational costs and memory demands, and\nto solve the nonlinear problem by applying iterative methods that rely only on\nmatrix vector multiplications. As such, the use of the regularized reweighted\nconjugate gradient algorithm, in conjunction with the structure of the\nsensitivity matrices, leads to a fast methodology for large-scale joint\ninversion of geophysical data sets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that it\nis possible to apply a nonlinear joint inversion algorithm, with $L_p$-norm\nstabilisers, for the reconstruction of large model domains on a standard laptop\ncomputer. It is demonstrated, that the p=1 choice provides sparse reconstructed\nsolutions with sharp boundaries, and $p=2$ provides smooth and blurred models.\nGravity and magnetic data obtained over an area in northwest of Mesoproterozoic\nSt. Francois Terrane, southeast of Missouri, USA are inverted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

Eggshells, exoskeletons, and\nminerals, for example, have patterns composed of highly randomized layers of\norganic and inorganic compounds. These materials pose a challenge as the\ndistribution of compounds that determine surface color changes from object to\nobject and within local pattern regions.

The key element of our approach is\na new method which we call High-Order Degenerate Statistical Expansion. It\nleverages the use of classical multivariate Taylor expansion and degenerate\n$U$-statistic and yields an elegant explicit formula. In the univariate case of\n$\\scrH=\\R$, the formula expresses the error of the proposed estimator as a sum\nof order $k$ degenerate $U$-products of the noises with coefficient\n$f^{(k)}(\\btheta)/k!$ and an explicit remainder term in the form of the\nRiemann-Liouville integral as in the Taylor expansion around the true\n$\\btheta$. For general $\\scrH$, the formula expresses the estimation error in\nterms of the inner product of $f^{(k)}(\\btheta)/k!$ and the average of the\ntensor products of $k$ noises with distinct indices and a parallel extension of\nthe remainder term from the univariate case.

The proposed\nestimator can be viewed as a jackknife estimator of an ideal degenerate\nexpansion of $f(\\cdot)$ around the true $\\btheta$ with the degenerate\n$U$-product of the noises, and can be approximated by bootstrap. Thus, the\njackknife, bootstrap and Taylor expansion approaches all converge to the\nproposed estimator.

Here we aim to find new NH$_{3}$ (9,6)\nmasers to provide a better observational basis to study their role in high-mass\nstar-forming regions. We carried out NH$_{3}$ (9,6) observations toward Cepheus\nA and G34.26$+$0.15 with the Effelsberg-100 m telescope and the Karl G. Janksy\nVery Large Array. We discovered new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers in Cep A and\nG34.26$+$0.15, which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions\nhosting NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers from five to seven. Long term monitoring (20\nmonths) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6) maser in\nG34.26$+$0.15 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to\nthe Effelsberg data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of\nobservation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the\nNH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission regions that are not\nresolved by the interferometric measurements.

We suggest that massive BHs, including\nintermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through\ncollisions between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence\nstars. Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation,\nand relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs\nas massive as $10^4$ M$_\\odot$. This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs\naccrete a substantial fraction of the stellar mass captured during each\ncollision and (2) that the rate at which new stars are introduced into the\nregion near the SMBH is high enough to offset depletion by stellar disruptions\nand star-star collisions. We discuss deviations from these key assumptions in\nthe text. Our results suggest that BHs in the pair-instability mass gap and\nIMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centers. This formation channel has\nimplications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce\nelectromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal\ndisruption events. Additionally, formed through this channel, both black holes\nin the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the supermassive black hole at the\ncenter of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves.

If the objects identified in the observations\nare indeed horizonless and ultracompact, high curvature effects may come into\nplay, and their explorations may be intimately related to new physics beyond\nGeneral Relativity (GR). In this paper, we revisit the concept of statistical\nthermodynamics in curved spacetime, focusing on self-gravitating compact\nsystems without event horizons. Differently from the previous studies in this\ncontext, we develop a generic framework with no explicit dependence on the\ngravitational field equations, which is then applicable to a general theory of\ngravity. Defining the global variables directly from the local counterparts,\nthe conventional thermodynamics follows for a generic curved spacetime. The key\nstep is the appropriate identification of thermodynamic volume to ensure the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, which is in general different from the geometric\nvolume. For demonstration, we consider familiar examples of self-gravitating\ngas in GR, where the connection to previous studies becomes clear.

However,\nalternatives may be established by the observation of gravitational wave echoes\nthat probe possible near-horizon structure. These echoes are proposed to be\ngenerated in exotic compact objects that are horizonless and feature a\npartially reflecting \"wall\" inside their light rings, creating a cavity in\nwhich gravitational perturbations may echo, while leaking out through the\nangular momentum barrier with each pass. The characteristic signature of echoes\nis a comb of nearly evenly spaced spectral resonances. While approximately\ntrue, deviations from this simple picture can lead to severe observational\nsignal losses. In this paper, we explore such subtleties with the latest\nresults for echo sourcing and geometry. A physically motivated echo model is\nthen developed as a sum over Lorentzian spectral lines, parametrized by\nfunctions of the horizon frame frequency and the size of the cavity. Our final\nspectrum is a function of only the mass and spin of the black hole, as well as\nthe UV scale of the near-horizon physics. We then apply this model in a search\nfor echoes in the gravitational wave event with the loudest ringdown signal in\nLIGO/Virgo, i.e. GW190521.

To address the issue we propose a supremum Lagrange Multiplier test\nstatistic (sLMb), where the null hypothesis specifies a linear autoregressive\n(AR) model against the alternative of a TAR model. We consider a recursive\nbootstrap applied to the sLMb statistic and establish its validity.

When an oscillating foil experiences the jet deflection phenomenon,\nsecondary structures shed from the primary street traverse in the other\ndirection by making an angle with its parent vortex street.

We show that the coupling between\nMercury's interior regions is sufficiently strong that the obliquity of the\nmantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01\narcmin. The mantle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the\nchange between a large and no inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM\ncoupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the inner core boundary and, if\nthe core magnetic field strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the fluid and solid\ncores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational\ncoupling between the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the\nmore this co-precessing core is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and\nthe more the obliquity of the polar moment of inertia approaches that expected\nfor a rigid planet.

In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can\ninterfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired\narchitectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the\nbiophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable\nnetworks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific\nmanner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel\nartificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and\nsparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we\nstudy the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring\ntask-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning\nenvironment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation\ntasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's\nprediction task changes throughout training.

This concern is central to the echo chamber and\nfilter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and\nalgorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information\nsources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while\nusing an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that\nplatform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of\nobtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their\nregular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data,\nor estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their\ncentrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have\nfocused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and\nengagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave\nstudy pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and\nengagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found\nthat participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent\nrelationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed\nto on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results\nthey chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall\nengagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed\nto on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news\nsources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall.\nThese results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable\nnews on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by\nusers' own choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 23:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2022 20:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Here we show that the answer to that question\nis affirmative, this defective topology of Pd is magnetic, with a magnetism\nthat depends on the amount of sample porosity and on the topology of their\nstructures. Clearly, if magnetism exists in porous amorphous palladium, this\nindicates the possibility of developing light-weight magnets, useful when a\nmaximized magnetism/weight ratio is demanded, well suited for space and\naeronautical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 01:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Despite their extensive use, turbulent\ncombustion of large hydrocarbon fuels, remains relatively poorly understood and\ndifficult to predict. A key parameter when burning these fuels is the turbulent\nconsumption speed; the velocity at which fuel and air are consumed through a\nturbulent flame front. Such information can be useful as a model input\nparameter and for validation of modeled results. In this study, turbulent\nconsumption speeds were measured for three jet-like fuels using a premixed\nturbulent Bunsen burner. The burner was used to independently control\nturbulence intensity, unburned temperature, and equivalence ratio. Each fuel\nhad similar heat releases (within 2%), laminar flame speeds (within 5-15 %),\nand adiabatic flame temperatures. Despite this similarity, for constant Re_D\nand turbulence intensity, A2 (i.e., jet-A) has the highest turbulent flame\nspeeds and remains stable (i.e., without tip quenching) at lower {\\phi} than\nthe other fuels evaluated. In contrast the C1 fuel, which contains no\naromatics, has the slowest turbulent flame speeds and exhibits tip quenching at\nhigher {\\phi} then the other fuels. C1 was the most sensitive to the influence\nof turbulence, as evidenced by this fuel having the largest ratio of turbulent\nto laminar flame speeds.

In particular, they may fail when facing complex occlusions,\nsuch as those between pedestrians. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel method named Quality-aware Part Models (QPM) for occlusion-robust ReID.\nFirst, we propose to jointly learn part features and predict part quality\nscores. As no quality annotation is available, we introduce a strategy that\nautomatically assigns low scores to occluded body parts, thereby weakening the\nimpact of occluded body parts on ReID results. Second, based on the predicted\npart quality scores, we propose a novel identity-aware spatial attention (ISA)\nmodule. In this module, a coarse identity-aware feature is utilized to\nhighlight pixels of the target pedestrian, so as to handle the occlusion\nbetween pedestrians. Third, we design an adaptive and efficient approach for\ngenerating global features from common non-occluded regions with respect to\neach image pair. This design is crucial, but is often ignored by existing\nmethods. QPM has three key advantages: 1) it does not rely on any outside tools\nin either the training or inference stages; 2) it handles occlusions caused by\nboth objects and other pedestrians;3) it is highly computationally efficient.\nExperimental results on four popular databases for occluded ReID demonstrate\nthat QPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant\nmargins. The code of QPM will be released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 03:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and\nchallenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices.

One of the ubiquitous resources in such explorations is\nentanglement. Entanglement Monotones (EMs) are of key importance, particularly\nfor assessing the efficacy of a given entangled state as a resource for\ninformation theoretic tasks. Till date, investigations towards determination of\nEMs have focused on providing their tighter lower bounds. There is yet no\ngeneral scheme available for direct determination of the EMs. Consequently, an\nempirical determination of any EM has not yet been achieved for entangled qudit\nstates. The present paper fills this gap, both theoretically as well as\nexperimentally. First, we derive analytical relations between statistical\ncorrelation measures i.e. Mutual Predictability (MP), Mutual Information (MI)\nand Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and standard EMs i.e. Negativity (N)\nand Entanglement of Formation (EOF) in arbitrary dimensions. As a proof of\nconcept, we then experimentally measure MP, MI and PCC of two-qutrit pure\nstates and determine their N and EOF using these derived relations. This is a\nuseful addition to the experimenter's toolkit wherein by using a limited number\nof measurements (in this case 1 set of measurements), one can directly measure\nthe EMs in a bipartite arbitrary dimensional system. We obtain the value of N\nfor our bipartite qutrit to be 0.907 $\\pm$ 0.013 and the EOF to be 1.323 $\\pm$\n0.022. Since the present scheme enables determination of more than one\nentanglement monotone by the same limited number of measurements, we argue that\nit can serve as a unique experimental platform for quantitatively comparing and\ncontrasting the operational implications of entanglement monotones as well as\nshowing their non-monotonicity for a given bipartire pure qudit state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 06:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Second, an RSU selection algorithm\nis proposed to select a proper RSU that enhances the vehicle tracking\nperformance. A joint vehicle tracking algorithm is also developed to maximize\nthe tracking performance by considering sounding samples at multiple RSUs while\nminimizing the amount of sample exchange. The numerical results verify that the\nproposed vehicle tracking algorithms give better performance than conventional\nsignal-to-noise ratio-based tracking systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 07:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 02:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

In fairness-aware recommendation, most of the existing algorithmic\napproaches mainly aim at solving a constrained optimization problem by imposing\na constraint on the level of fairness while optimizing the main recommendation\nobjective, e.g., CTR. While this alleviates the impact of unfair\nrecommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly\ncompromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between\nfairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting\nobjectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation.\nOne conspicuous approach is to seek a Pareto efficient solution to guarantee\noptimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the\nneeds of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can\ngeneralize the whole Pareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify\nany preference of one objective over another based on their current business\nneeds.

Consequently, an updated microscopic view of\ntraffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture\nboth such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic\ncomposition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We\nanalyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI\n(Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI\ntraces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the\nimpact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the\ntraffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume\nfrom cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients\nshift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018\nto December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the\nCAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to\n6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI\ndataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the\napplication layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S)\ntraffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than\n90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted.

To address this\nproblem, two-stage approaches deploy two separate networks for a coarse and\nfine estimate of the inpainted image. Some approaches utilize handcrafted\nfeatures like edges or contours to guide the reconstruction process.

Security in such systems is\nseverely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and\ninattention to security classification of data. By incorporating a\nDenning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a\nsynchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which\ncorrect-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems may be\nspecified and derived. In particular, we propose an extension of the Lustre\nprogramming framework with a security type system. The novelty of our type\nsystem lies in a symbolic formulation of constraints over security type\nvariables, in particular the treatment of node calls, which allows us to reason\nabout secure flow with respect to any security class lattice. The main theorem\nis the soundness of our type system with respect to the co-inductive\noperational semantics of Lustre, which we prove by showing that well-typed\nprograms exhibit non-interference. Rather than tackle the full language, we\nfirst prove the non-interference result for a well-behaved sub-language called\n\"Normalised Lustre\" (NLustre), for which our type system is far simpler.

This\npreservation of security types by the normalisation transformations is a\nproperty akin to \"subject reduction\" but at the level of compiler\ntransformations. The main result that well-security-typed Lustre programs are\nnon-interfering follows from a reduction to our earlier result of\nnon-interference for NLustre via the semantics-preservation (of Bourke et al.)\nand type preservation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 13:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes\ndrives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing\ndemands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the\nDL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage\nthe auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,\nexisting auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and\noverlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor\ncodes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning\nframework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with\nlimited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences\namong subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of\none subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost\nmodel of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the\nfamily and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real\nhardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.\nOur experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same\ncode performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 14:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Yet, this property has hardly been studied on\ntheoretical grounds thus far. We aim to examine the period-age relation using\nthe results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations. We combined isochrone\nmodels with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental\nmode LPV pulsators, which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we\ncompared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds'\nclusters. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental\nmode period decreases with increasing age because of the dominant role of mass\nin shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period\ndistribution shows a non-negligible width and is skewed toward short periods,\nexcept for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich\nand C-rich models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit\nrelations describing age and initial mass as a function of the fundamental mode\nperiod for both O- and C-rich models. The study confirms the power of the\nperiod-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either\nO-rich or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to\nlimit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection biases, but\nrather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the\nfundamental mode.

However, little is known about the\ntemperature dependence of TEL, and, as a result, almost all existing defect\ntheories in semiconductors are built on a temperature-independent\napproximation. In this article, by deriving the basic formulas for\ntemperature-dependent TEL, we have established two fundamental rules for the\ntemperature dependence of TEL in semiconductors. Based on these rules,\nsurprisingly, it is found that the temperature dependences of TEL for different\ndefects are rather diverse: it can become shallower, deeper, or stay unchanged.\nThis defect-specific behavior is mainly determined by the synergistic or\nopposing effects between free energy corrections (determined by the local\nvolume change around the defect during a charge-state transition) and band edge\nchanges (which differ for different semiconductors).

Nitrogen doping into\nTiO2 has been able to narrow its bandgap, forming an absorption tail in the\nvisible-light region. However, TiO2 has limits to which it can be doped,\nsuggesting investigations of the oxygen-deficient Ti203.

In this study, specific indicators were\ndeveloped to analyze resilience, and the trajectories of resilience were\ncompared. Energy production is relevant for describing variations in social and\neconomic activities. This indicator was applied to a case study of a natural\ndisaster, that is Hurricane Irma in 2017. The hurricane caused fatalities and\ndestruction in the Caribbean islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy,\nwhich are two French overseas territories. Energy production after Hurricane\nIrma exhibited a significant decrease due to the destruction of the electricity\nnetwork as well as perturbations in economic and social activities. The energy\nproduction restoration rate was higher in Saint Barthelemy than in Saint\nMartin. The electricity restoration rate after a disaster was almost constant.\nHowever, the energy production 18 months after Hurricane Irma was identical to\nthat before Hurricane Irma in Saint Barthelemy; this was not the case in Saint\nMartin. During resilience, an increase in the gap between energy production in\nSaint Barthelemy and Saint Martin was observed. This study indicated that this\ngap represents an inequality growth between Saint Barthelemy (gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) of 40 000 euros/inhabitant) and Saint Martin (GDP of 16 600\neuros/inhabitant). The indicators emphasized that inequality growth after\nnatural disasters favors less vulnerable and more resilient territories. The\nnumber of inhabitants must be considered during indicator construction to avoid\nany bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 15:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}
