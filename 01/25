Unfortunately, their use is practically limited by their high\ncomputational cost which imposes to perform only a few iterations in the\navailable time for clinical exams. Data-driven methods, using neural networks\nto post-process a coarse and noisy image obtained from geometrical algorithms,\nhave been recently studied and appreciated for both their computational speed\nand accurate reconstructions. However, there is no evidence, neither\ntheoretically nor numerically, that neural networks based algorithms solve the\nmathematical inverse problem modeling the tomographic reconstruction process.\nIn our two-step approach, the first phase executes very few iterations of a\nregularized model-based algorithm whereas the second step completes the missing\niterations by means of a neural network. The resulting hybrid deep-variational\nframework preserves the convergence properties of the iterative method and, at\nthe same time, it exploits the computational speed and flexibility of a\ndata-driven approach.

Predicting their abundance and distribution has\nimportant implications for dark matter searches and searches for subhalos\nthemselves, as they could provide a decisive test of the CDM paradigm. A major\ndifficulty in subhalo population model building is to account for the\ngravitational stripping induced by baryons, which strongly impact on the\noverall dynamics inside galaxies. In this paper, we focus on these \"baryonic\"\ntides from analytical perspectives, summarizing previous work on galactic disk\nshocking, and thoroughly revisiting the impact of individual encounters with\nstars. For the latter, we go beyond the reference calculation of Gerhard and\nFall (1983) to deal with penetrative encounters, and provide new analytical\nresults. Based upon a full statistical analysis of subhalo energy change during\nmultiple stellar encounters possibly occurring during disk crossing, we show\nthat subhalos lighter than $\\sim 1$~M$_\\odot$ are very efficiently pruned by\nstellar encounters. This modifies their mass function in a stellar environment.\nIn contrast, disk shocking is more efficient at pruning massive subhalos. In\nshort, if reasonably resilient, subhalos surviving disk crossing have lost all\ntheir mass but an inner cuspy part, with a tidal mass function strongly\ndeparting from the cosmological one. If fragile, stellar encounters make their\nnumber density drop by an additional order of magnitude with respect to\ndisk-shocking effects only (e.g., at the solar position in the Milky Way).

We begin by analysing the structure of the RBG field\nequations and nontrivial aspects of their solution space. We then analyse the\nabrosption spectra of some spherically symmetric solutions. Then, we show that,\nif the projective symmetry in these theories is explicitly broken, then there\narise ghost degrees of freedom, and we argue that this will be a generic\nfeature of metric-affine gravity theories. Having done this, we analyse\nmetricafine theories through the EFT lens, showing how the nonmetricity tkes a\nparticular form in generic theories where the symmetrised Ricci tensor appears\nin the action beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term. This sources effective\ninteractions that we use to place tight constraints to these theories. In the\nthird part of the thesis we present a miscelanea of works which are not so\nrelated to the structure of RBG theories. We begin by studying a model for\nspontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry, namely the bumblebee model, in the\nmetric-affine approach. In the following chapter we generalise a conformal\ninvariant definition of proper time given by Perlick to the case with general\nnonmetricity. Finally, we present arguments that show that the recently\nproposed D4EGB theory is not well defined in its original form. We finish with\na brief outlook.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 16:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

To accomplish these\ngoals, first, the linear laws of Markov chains are derived by using the time\nembedding of their (categorical) autocorrelation function. Then, a binary\nseries is generated from the first difference of Bitcoin exchange rate (against\nthe United States Dollar). Finally, the minimum number of parameters describing\nthe linear laws of this series is identified through stepped time windows.\nBased on the results, linear laws typically became more complex (containing an\nadditional third parameter that indicates hidden Markov property) in two\nperiods: before the crash of cryptocurrency markets inducted by the COVID-19\npandemic (12 March 2020), and before the record-breaking surge in the price of\nBitcoin (Q4 2020 - Q1 2021).

However, due to the quadratic runtime of\nthe self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch\nembeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input\nfeatures, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question:\nIs the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer\narchitecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input\nrepresentation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter:\nspecifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is\nsimilar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it\noperates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and\nchannel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the\nnetwork. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to\nachieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer\noutperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar\nparameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical\nvision models such as the ResNet.

Previous studies have put constraints on IDE models by\nobservations of cosmic expansion history, cosmic microwave background and\nlarge-scale structures. However, these data are not yet enough to distinguish\nIDE models from $\\Lambda$CDM effectively. Because the non-linear structure\nformation contains rich cosmological information, it can provide additional\nmeans to differentiate alternative models. In this paper, based on a set of\n$N$-body simulations for IDE models, we investigate the formation histories and\nproperties of dark matter halos, and compare with their $\\Lambda$CDM\ncounterparts. For the model with dark matter decaying into dark energy and the\nparameters being the best-fit values from previous constraints, the structure\nformation is markedly slowed down, and the halos have systematically lower\nmass, looser internal structure, higher spin and anisotropy. This is\ninconsistent with the observed structure formation, and thus this model can be\nsafely ruled out from the perspective of non-linear structure formation.\nMoreover, we find that the ratio of halo concentrations between IDE and\n$\\Lambda$CDM counterparts depends sensitively on the interaction parameter and\nis independent of halo mass. This can act as a powerful probe to constrain IDE\nmodels. Our results concretely demonstrate that the interaction of the two dark\ncomponents can affect the halo formation considerably, and therefore the\nconstraints from non-linear structures are indispensable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 17:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

These new\nanalyses show that under certain constraints on condition number, the LU\nfactorization of the matrix can be computed in low precision without affecting\nthe final accuracy. Another promising technique is GMRES-based iterative\nrefinement, which, in contrast to the standard approach, use GMRES\npreconditioned by the low-precision triangular factors to solve for the\napproximate solution update in each refinement step. This more accurate\nsolution method extends the range of problems which can be solved with a given\ncombination of precisions. However, in certain settings, GMRES may require too\nmany iterations per refinement step, making it potentially more expensive than\nsimply recomputing the LU factors in a higher precision.\n  Krylov subspace recycling is a well-known technique for reusing information\nacross sequential invocations of a Krylov subspace method on systems with the\nsame or a slowly changing coefficient matrix. In this work, we incorporate the\nidea of Krylov subspace recycling into a mixed precision GMRES-based iterative\nrefinement solver. The insight is that in each refinement step, we call\npreconditioned GMRES on a linear system with the same coefficient matrix $A$,\nwith only the right-hand side changing. In this way, the GMRES solves in\nsubsequent refinement steps can be accelerated by recycling information\nobtained from the first step.

In contrast, little\nattention has been paid to the opposite side of the technology: the development\nof more efficient techniques for the detection of invisibility devices.

Here, we provide a complete\nlist of all symmetry-diagonalizable strictly and nearly NSrs in the 1651\nmagnetic space groups (MSGs) and 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) in both\nspinful and spinless settings. We first apply compatibility relations (CRs)\nwhich encode how bands split from a band node (BN) (located at a symmetric\npoint of BZ), to obtain all NSrs (emanating from the BN).

However, the study of many\nmetallic TMDs in the limit of few atomic layers is still behind when compared\nto their semiconducting counterparts, partly due to the lack of similar\nalternative characterization studies. In this work we present the\ncharacterization of the Raman spectrum, specifically of the E$^1_{2g}$- and\nA$_{1g}$-modes, of mechanically exfoliated crystals of Ta$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$S$_2$, a\nmetallic TMD which exhibits charge density wave formation and\nsuperconductivity. The clear identification of contributions to the Raman\nspectrum coming from the SiO$_2$/Si substrate, which overlap with the peaks\ncoming from the sample, and which dominate in intensity in the\nfew-layer-samples limit, allowed the isolation of the individual E$^1_{2g}$-\nand A$_{1g}$-modes of the samples and, for the first time, the observation of a\nclear evolution of the Raman shifts of both modes as a function of sample\nthickness. The evolution of such peaks qualitatively resembles the evolution\nseen in other TMDs, and provide a way of indirectly determining sample\nthickness in the limit of few atomic layers at a low cost. In addition, we\nobserve a softening (red-shift) of both E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes with\nMo-doping in the nanolayers, possibly related to the increased out-of-plane\nlattice parameter with respect to the pure compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 18:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

With\nwireless networks defined by random, rapidly changing transmission conditions\nthat challenge assumptions commonly held in the design of control systems,\nproper allocation of communication resources is essential to achieve reliable\noperation. Designing resource allocation policies, however, is challenging,\nmotivating recent works to successfully exploit deep learning and deep\nreinforcement learning techniques to design resource allocation and scheduling\npolicies for wireless control systems (WCSs). As the number of learnable\nparameters in a neural network grows with the size of the input signal, deep\nreinforcement learning may fail to scale, limiting the immediate generalization\nof such scheduling and resource allocation policies to large-scale systems. The\ninterference and fading patterns among plants and controllers in the network,\nhowever, induce a time-varying graph that can be used to construct policy\nrepresentations based on graph neural networks (GNNs), with the number of\nlearnable parameters now independent of the number of plants in the network.

In this\npaper, we propose Evolution Gym, the first large-scale benchmark for\nco-optimizing the design and control of soft robots.

Evaluating the algorithms\non our benchmark platform, we observe robots exhibiting increasingly complex\nbehaviors as evolution progresses, with the best evolved designs solving many\nof our proposed tasks. Additionally, even though robot designs are evolved\nautonomously from scratch without prior knowledge, they often grow to resemble\nexisting natural creatures while outperforming hand-designed robots.\nNevertheless, all tested algorithms fail to find robots that succeed in our\nhardest environments.

However, to the best\nof our knowledge, current VAE-based SE methods only apply VAE to the model\nspeech signal, while noise is modeled using the traditional non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) model. One of the most important reasons for using NMF is\nthat these VAE-based methods cannot disentangle the speech and noise latent\nvariables from the observed signal. Based on Bayesian theory, this paper\nderives a novel variational lower bound for VAE, which ensures that VAE can be\ntrained in supervision, and can disentangle speech and noise latent variables\nfrom the observed signal. This means that the proposed method can apply the VAE\nto model both speech and noise signals, which is totally different from the\nprevious VAE-based SE works. More specifically, the proposed DRL method can\nlearn to impose speech and noise signal priors to different sets of latent\nvariables for SE. The experimental results show that the proposed method can\nnot only disentangle speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal\nbut also obtain a higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and speech\nquality score than the similar deep neural network-based (DNN) SE method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 18:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

We currently lack a\nfar-infrared observatory capable of observing HD, and the most common gas mass\ntracer, CO, suffers from a poorly constrained CO-to-H$_2$ ratio. Expanding on\nprevious work, we investigate if N2H+, a chemical tracer of CO poor gas, can be\nused to observationally measure the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and correct CO-based gas\nmasses. Using disk structures obtained from the literature, we set up\nthermochemical models for three disks, TW Hya, DM Tau and GM Aur, to examine\nhow well the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and gas mass can be measured from N2H+ and C18O\nline fluxes. Furthermore, we compare these gas masses to independently gas\nmasses measured from archival HD observations. The N2H+ (3-2)/C18O (2-1) line\nratio scales with the disk CO-to-H$_2$ ratio.

The theory has one\ndimensionless coupling which formally runs to a Landau pole in the ultraviolet.\nWe show that many properties of the system are universal in the double\nfine-tuning limit.

However, the background noise distorts these structures in a\nnonuniform way. The existing deep acoustic signal enhancement (ASE)\narchitectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this\nproblem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP)\nmechanism into a conventional convolutional recurrent neural network, termed as\nTAP-CRNN. The proposed approach considers both global and local attention for\nASE tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional layer to extract\nlocal information of the acoustic signals and then a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) architecture is used to characterize temporal contextual information.\nSecond, we exploit a novelattention mechanism to contextually process salient\nregions of the noisy signals.

Our results show that overall electricity prices,\ngeneration costs, profits, and quantities for conventional generators decrease,\nwhereas quantities and profits for RES generators increase with RES\npenetration.

If the\ncrack front structure is not properly accounted for, energy balance will either\nappear to fail or lead to unrealistic results. Here, we study the influence of\nthe secondary structure of low-speed crack propagation in hydrogels under\ntensile loading conditions. We first show that these cracks are bistable;\neither simple (cracks having no secondary structure) or faceted crack states\n(formed by steps propagating along crack fronts) can be generated under\nidentical loading conditions. The selection of either crack state is determined\nby the form of the initial `seed' crack; perfect seed cracks generate simple\ncracks while a small local mode~III component generates crack fronts having\nmultiple steps. Step coarsening eventually leads to single steps that propagate\nalong crack fronts. As they evolve, steps locally change the instantaneous\nstructure and motion of the crack front, breaking transverse translational\ninvariance. In contrast to simple cracks, faceted cracks can, therefore, no\nlonger be considered as existing in a quasi-2D system. For both simple and\nfaceted cracks we simultaneously measure the energy flux and local dissipation\nalong these crack fronts over velocities, $v$, spanning $0<v<0.2c_R$ ($c_R$ is\nthe Rayleigh wave speed). We find that, in the presence of secondary structure\nwithin the crack front, the implementation of energy balance must be\ngeneralized for 3D systems; faceted cracks reveal energy balance, only when we\naccount for the local dynamic dissipation at each point along the crack front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 20:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The global analysis revealed that,\nin the Mach range 0.1 to 0.9, for thick boundary layers, only R1 and R2 modes\ncould become unstable, whereas for thin boundary layer up to R4 could be\nunstable. Compressibility was very destabilizing at low Mach. At moderate Mach\nthe instability either saturated with Mach or had an irregular dependence.\nAnalysis of the Rossiter mode eigenfunctions indicated that the acoustic\nfeedback scaled to Ma^3, and explained the strong destabilizing effect of\ncompressibility. The irregular dependence was associated with resonances\nbetween Rossiter modes and acoustic cavity modes. The analysis explained why\nthe irregular Mach dependence occurred only for higher order Rossiter modes. In\nthis parameter region three dimensional modes are stable or marginally\nunstable. Two-dimensional simulations were performed to evaluate how much of\nthe nonlinear regime could be captured by the linear stability results. As the\nflow became more unstable, an increasing more complex final stage was reached.\nYet the spectra present distinct tones that are close to linear predictions.\nHowever, a closer look reveals the dominant frequency in the saturated state\ncorresponds to R1 while linear theory predicts R2 as the most unstable mode.\nThis is associated with a nonlinear thickening of the mixing layer in the\nnonlinear regime. Moreover, the frequencies are much closer to Rossiter\nempirical predictions than the linear instability ones. Even at these\nconditions close to critical, the spectra are well described by the mode R1 and\na cascade of nonlinearly generated harmonics, with no reminiscence of the\nlinear instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 20:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2022 14:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

The active\nflap can modulate the leading edge vortex shedding with larger flapping\namplitude and regulate the foil heaving motion. The ratio of the competing\nmodal energy is proposed to evaluate the control efficacy of the morphing\nsurface, and the onset of the lock-in is associated with the ratio approaching\nunity.

Due to data not being centrally\navailable, Multi-Discriminator (MD)-GANs training framework employs multiple\ndiscriminators that have direct access to the real data. Distributedly training\na joint GAN model entails the risk of free-riders, i.e., participants that aim\nto benefit from the common model while only pretending to participate in the\ntraining process. In this paper, we conduct the first characterization study of\nthe impact of free-riders on MD-GAN. Based on two production prototypes of\nMD-GAN, we find that free-riders drastically reduce the ability of MD-GANs to\nproduce images that are indistinguishable from real data, i.e., they increase\nthe FID score -- the standard measure to assess the quality of generated\nimages. To mitigate the model degradation, we propose a defense strategy\nagainst free-riders in MD-GAN, termed DFG. DFG distinguishes free-riders and\nbenign participants through periodic probing and clustering of discriminators'\nresponses based on a reference response of free-riders, which then allows the\ngenerator to exclude the detected free-riders from the training. Furthermore,\nwe extend our defense, termed DFG+, to enable discriminators to filter out\nfree-riders at the variant of MD-GAN that allows peer exchanges of\ndiscriminators networks. Extensive evaluation on various scenarios of\nfree-riders, MD-GAN architecture, and three datasets show that our defenses\neffectively detect free-riders. With 1 to 5 free-riders, DFG and DFG+ averagely\ndecreases FID by 5.22% to 11.53% for CIFAR10 and 5.79% to 13.22% for CIFAR100\nin comparison to an attack without defense. In a shell, the proposed DFG(+) can\neffectively defend against free-riders without affecting benign clients at a\nnegligible computation overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 21:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Recent studies have developed various\napproaches to estimate optimal warping between functions and provide\nnon-Euclidean models. However, a principled, linear, generative model on time\nwarping functions is still under-explored. This is a highly challenging problem\nbecause the space of warping functions is non-linear with the conventional\nEuclidean metric. To address this problem, we propose a stochastic process\nmodel for time warping functions, where the key is to define a linear,\ninner-product structure on the time warping space and then transform the\nwarping functions into a sub-space of the $\\mathbb L^2$ Euclidean space. With\ncertain constraints on the warping functions, this transformation is an\nisometric isomorphism. In the transformed space, we adopt the $\\mathbb L^2$\nbasis in the Hilbert space for representation. This new framework can easily\nbuild generative model on time warping by using different types of stochastic\nprocess. It can also be used to conduct statistical inferences such as\nfunctional PCA, functional ANOVA, and functional regressions. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this new framework by using it as a new prior\nin the Bayesian registration, and propose an efficient gradient method to\naddress the important maximum a posteriori estimation. We illustrate the new\nBayesian method using simulations which properly characterize nonuniform and\ncorrelated constraints in the time domain.

However, the labels of samples in a relevant but different\ndataset are available. As a result, researchers have relied on unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to leverage the labels in a dataset (the source domain) to\nperform better classification in a different, unlabeled dataset (target\ndomain). Existing non-generative adversarial solutions for UDA aim at achieving\ndomain confusion through adversarial training. The ideal scenario is that\nperfect domain confusion is achieved, but this is not guaranteed to be true. To\nfurther enforce domain confusion on top of the adversarial training, we propose\na novel UDA algorithm, \\textit{E-ADDA}, which uses both a novel variation of\nthe Mahalanobis distance loss and an out-of-distribution detection subroutine.\nThe Mahalanobis distance loss minimizes the distribution-wise distance between\nthe encoded target samples and the distribution of the source domain, thus\nenforcing additional domain confusion on top of adversarial training. Then, the\nOOD subroutine further eliminates samples on which the domain confusion is\nunsuccessful.

Refined CKS\nplanet radii revealed that small planets are bifurcated into two distinct\npopulations: super-Earths (smaller than 1.5 $R_E$) and sub-Neptunes (between\n2.0 and 4.0 $R_E$), with few planets in between (the \"Radius Gap.\") Several\ntheoretical models of the Radius Gap predict variation with stellar mass, but\ntesting these predictions are challenging with CKS DR1 due to its limited\n$M_\\star$ range of 0.8-1.4 $M_\\odot$. Here, we present CKS DR2 with 411\nadditional spectra and derived properties focusing on stars of 0.5-0.8\n$M_\\odot$. We found the Radius Gap follows $R_p \\propto P^m$ with $m = -0.10\n\\pm 0.03$, consistent with predictions of XUV- and core-powered mass-loss\nmechanisms. We found no evidence that $m$ varies with $M_\\star$. We observed a\ncorrelation between the average sub-Neptune size and $M_\\star$. Over 0.5 to 1.4\n$M_\\odot$, the average sub-Neptune grows from 2.1 to 2.6 $R_E$, following $R_p\n\\propto M_\\star^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha = 0.25 \\pm 0.03$. In contrast, there is no\ndetectable change for super-Earths. These $M_\\star$-$R_p$ trends suggests that\nprotoplanetary disks can efficiently produce cores up to a threshold mass of\n$M_c$, which grows linearly with stellar mass according to $M_c \\approx 10\nM_E~(M_\\star / M_\\odot)$. There is no significant correlation between\nsub-Neptune size and stellar metallicity (over $-$0.5 to $+$0.5 dex) suggesting\na weak relationship between planet envelope opacity and stellar metallicity.\nFinally, there is no significant variation in sub-Neptune size with stellar age\n(over 1 to 10 Gyr), which suggests that the majority of envelope contraction\nconcludes after $\\sim$1 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Rigid\nbody modeling has thus long remained a fundamental tool and is, by far, the\nmost popular simulation strategy currently employed for modeling stiff solids.\nAt the same time, numerical models of a rigid body continue to pose a number of\nknown challenges and trade-offs including intersections, instabilities,\ninaccuracies, and/or slow performances that grow with contact-problem\ncomplexity. In this paper we revisit this problem and present ABD, a simple and\nhighly effective affine body dynamics framework, which significantly improves\nstate-of-the-art stiff simulations. We trace the challenges in the rigid-body\nIPC (incremental potential contact) method to the necessity of linearizing\npiecewise-rigid (SE(3)) trajectories and subsequent constraints. ABD instead\nrelaxes the unnecessary (and unrealistic) constraint that each body's motion be\nexactly rigid with a stiff orthogonality potential, while preserving the rigid\nbody model's key feature of a small coordinate representation. In doing so ABD\nreplaces piecewise linearization with piecewise linear trajectories. This, in\nturn, combines the best from both parties: compact coordinates ensure small,\nsparse system solves, while piecewise-linear trajectories enable efficient and\naccurate constraint (contact and joint) evaluations. Beginning with this simple\nfoundation, ABD preserves all guarantees of the underlying IPC model e.g.,\nsolution convergence, guaranteed non-intersection, and accurate frictional\ncontact. Over a wide range and scale of simulation problems we demonstrate that\nABD brings orders of magnitude performance gains (two- to three-order on the\nCPU and an order more utilizing the GPU, which is 10,000x speedups) over prior\nIPC-based methods with a similar or higher simulation quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 00:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

In such\nsituations, the flow has a non-parabolic cross-gap velocity profile -- an\neffect that is ignored by Darcy models conventionally used for such Hele-Shaw\nflows. The WRIBL technique systematically accounts for the cross-gap variation\nof viscosity and yields reduced-order equations for the gap-averaged fluid flow\nrate. As a test case, we consider a fluid with a temperature-dependent\nviscosity and analyse the previously-studied problem of thermoviscous\nfingering: a hot fluid flowing through a Hele-Shaw geometry with cold walls\nspontaneously forms channels of low-viscosity, hot fluid, separated by regions\nof high-viscosity, cold fluid. The temperature of the cold walls is assumed\neither to be constant, a scenario that mimics the upward flow of magma through\nfissures in the Earth's crust, or to vary linearly along the direction of flow.\nIn both cases, the predictions of the WRIBL model, regarding the multiplicity\nof uniform steady flow states and their linear stability, are compared with\nthat of the hitherto used, ad hoc, Darcy model (Helfrich, J.

Existing approaches do not consider the characteristics\nof those agent accounts and are not suitable to the streaming settings.\nTherefore, we propose MonLAD and MonLAD-W to detect money laundering agent\naccounts in a transaction stream by keeping track of their residuals and other\nfeatures; we devise AnoScore algorithm to find anomalies based on the robust\nmeasure of statistical deviation. Experimental results show that MonLAD\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on real-world data and finds various\nsuspicious behavior patterns of money laundering. Additionally, several\ndetected suspected accounts have been manually-verified as agents in real money\nlaundering scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Rather than focusing on a single attack method or data\nmodality, we build on influence estimation, which quantifies each training\ninstance's contribution to a model's prediction.

However, this dependency has been described only\nthrough the two well-known matroid instances, namely the Fano and non-Fano\nmatroids, which, in turn, limits its scope only to the fields with\ncharacteristic two. In this paper, we extend this scope to demonstrate the\nreliance of linear index coding rate on fields with characteristic three. By\nconstructing two index coding instances of size 29, we prove that for the first\ninstance, linear coding is optimal only over the fields with characteristic\nthree, and for the second instance, linear coding over any field with\ncharacteristic three can never be optimal. Then, a variation of the second\ninstance is designed as the third index coding instance of size 58. For this\ninstance, it is proved that while linear coding over any field with\ncharacteristic three cannot be optimal, there exists a nonlinear code over the\nfields with characteristic three, which achieves its optimal rate. Connecting\nthe first and third index coding instances in two specific ways, called no-way\nand two-way connections, will lead to two new index coding instances of size 87\nand 91, for which linear coding is outperformed by nonlinear codes.\n  Another main contribution of this paper is the reduction of the key\nconstraints on the space of the linear coding for the first and second index\ncoding instances, each of size 29, into a matroid instance with the ground set\nof size 9, whose linear representability is dependent on the fields with\ncharacteristic three. The proofs and discussions provided in this paper through\nusing these two relatively small matroid instances will shed light on the\nunderlying reason causing the linear coding to become insufficient for the\ngeneral index coding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 03:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

An incident weak signal field with a few hundreds of kHz difference\nfrom the LO field is mixed with the LO field in Rydberg system to generate an\nintermediate frequency (IF) signal, which is read out by the Rydberg\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (Rydberg-EIT) spectroscopy. Not like\nresonant EIT-AT spectra, we realize the electric field measurement of the\nsignal frequency from 2 GHz to 5 GHz using a single Rydberg state. A minimum\ndetectable filed strength is down to 2.31~$\\mu$V/cm and a linear dynamic range\nis over 65~dB. The minimum detectable filed is comparable with a resonant\nmicrowave-dressed Rydberg heterodyne receiver using the same system, which is\n1.45~$\\mu$V/cm.

Despite their wide application, the success of traditional\nlink prediction algorithms is hindered by three major challenges -- link\nsparsity, node attribute noise and dynamic changes -- that are faced by many\nreal-world networks. To address these challenges, we propose a Contextualized\nSelf-Supervised Learning (CSSL) framework that fully exploits structural\ncontext prediction for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework learns a\nlink encoder to infer the link existence probability from paired node\nembeddings, which are constructed via a transformation on node attributes. To\ngenerate informative node embeddings for link prediction, structural context\nprediction is leveraged as a self-supervised learning task to boost the link\nprediction performance. Two types of structural context are investigated, i.e.,\ncontext nodes collected from random walks vs. context subgraphs. The CSSL\nframework can be trained in an end-to-end manner, with the learning of model\nparameters supervised by both the link prediction and self-supervised learning\ntasks. The proposed CSSL is a generic and flexible framework in the sense that\nit can handle both attributed and non-attributed networks, and operate under\nboth transductive and inductive link prediction settings. Extensive experiments\nand ablation studies on seven real-world benchmark networks demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed self-supervision based link prediction\nalgorithm over state-of-the-art baselines, on different types of networks under\nboth transductive and inductive settings. The proposed CSSL also yields\ncompetitive performance in terms of its robustness to node attribute noise and\nscalability over large-scale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 03:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 11:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

Reward functions are typically compared by considering\nthe behavior of optimized policies, but this approach conflates deficiencies in\nthe reward function with those of the policy search algorithm used to optimize\nit. To address this challenge, Gleave et al. (2020) propose the\nEquivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance.

Recent work has shown that neural networks can learn such\nsymmetries directly from data using Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs).

In this\npaper, we ask whether it is possible to identify and decompose conservative and\ndissipative dynamics simultaneously. We propose Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural\nNetworks (D-HNNs), which parameterize both a Hamiltonian and a Rayleigh\ndissipation function. Taken together, they represent an implicit Helmholtz\ndecomposition which can separate dissipative effects such as friction from\nsymmetries such as conservation of energy. We train our model to decompose a\ndamped mass-spring system into its friction and inertial terms and then show\nthat this decomposition can be used to predict dynamics for unseen friction\ncoefficients. Then we apply our model to real world data including a large,\nnoisy ocean current dataset where decomposing the velocity field yields useful\nscientific insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 04:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 02:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Nevertheless, FL training suffers\nfrom slow convergence and unstable performance due to stragglers caused by the\nheterogeneous computational resources of clients and fluctuating communication\nrates. This paper proposes a coded FL framework to mitigate the straggler\nissue, namely stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL). In this framework,\neach client generates a privacy-preserving coded dataset by adding additive\nnoise to the random linear combination of its local data. The server collects\nthe coded datasets from all the clients to construct a composite dataset, which\nhelps to compensate for the straggling effect.

Recent works account for this variability\nby modifying existing anchor-based detectors or relying on complex\npre/post-processing. Anchor-based methods spread a set of pre-defined bounding\nboxes on the input image, most of which are invalid.

The problems are\nmore formidable in the dynamic surroundings without prior knowledge of traffic\ndemands. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a flexible\nDIP (FDIP) network. In the proposed network, we classify the queues at the\noutput port into multiple groups. Each group operates with different cycle\nlengths. FDIP can assign the time-sensitive flows with different groups, hence\ndelivering diverse QoS requirements, simultaneously. The ultra-low latency\ncommunication can be achieved by specific groups with short cycle lengths.\nMoreover, the flexible scheduling with diverse cycle lengths improves resource\nutilization, hence increasing the throughput (i.e., the number of acceptable\ntime-sensitive flows). We formulate a throughput maximization problem that\njointly considers the admission control, transmission path selection, and cycle\nlength assignment.

However, once differential privacy inducing noise is introduced into a\nvoting system, the deterministic social choice function used to release an\naggregated choice may not be ideal anymore. It might change the power balances\nbetween the voters. It could be the case that an alternate social choice\nfunction becomes more ideal to aggregate the preferences. There could be a\nconstraint to operate the voting system at a specific level of either privacy\nor influence or welfare, and one would like to know the effects on rest of the\nunconstrained choices. In this paper, we introduce notions of welfare and\nprobabilistic influence of privatization mechanisms to help precisely answer\nsuch questions through the proposed results. Throughout the paper, we restrict\nour work to social choice functions where several voters vote for either of two\ncandidates. We present two different ways of proving each of our results that\nconnects privacy with welfare & probabilistic influence: i.) by using first\nprinciples from combinatorics/probability, ii.) by using Fourier analysis of\nBoolean functions. Finally, we analyze the accuracy of the private mechanism on\nvarious social choice functions. The results in this paper thereby help bridge\ntwo prominent fields of social choice theory and differential privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 06:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

While the trades accomplished using PDAs are worth trillions of\ndollars, finding a reliable bidding strategy in such auctions is still a\nchallenge as it requires the consideration of future auctions. A participating\nbuyer in a PDA has to design its bidding strategy by planning for current and\nfuture auctions. Many equilibrium-based bidding strategies proposed are complex\nto use in real-time. In the current exposition, we propose a scale-based\nbidding strategy for buyers participating in PDA.

The underlying task at\nhand is to carefully model fine-grained features of the signatures to\ndistinguish between genuine and forged ones, which differ only in minute\ndeformities. This makes OSV more challenging compared to other verification\nproblems. In this work, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that\nleverages self-supervised representation learning as well as metric learning\nfor writer-independent OSV. First, we train an image reconstruction network\nusing an encoder-decoder architecture that is augmented by a 2D spatial\nattention mechanism using signature image patches. Next, the trained encoder\nbackbone is fine-tuned with a projector head using a supervised metric learning\nframework, whose objective is to optimize a novel dual triplet loss by sampling\nnegative samples from both within the same writer class as well as from other\nwriters. The intuition behind this is to ensure that a signature sample lies\ncloser to its positive counterpart compared to negative samples from both\nintra-writer and cross-writer sets. This results in robust discriminative\nlearning of the embedding space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work of using self-supervised learning frameworks for OSV.

Neuropathological characterization was performed on the brain and\nspinal cord of one patient. Most patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n\nexpansion in RFC1. In addition to the core CANVAS phenotype (sensory\nneuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome, and vestibular impairment), we observed\nchronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement (55%),\ndysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%).

However, the SSIC only considers image coding and its\ngenerated SSB only contains the static object information. In this paper, we\nextend the idea of semantically structured coding from video coding perspective\nand propose an advanced Semantically Structured Video Coding (SSVC) framework\nto support heterogeneous intelligent applications. Video signals contain more\nrich dynamic motion information and exist more redundancy due to the similarity\nbetween adjacent frames.

In this work, we present a new\nparadigm named Explore-And-Match for NLVG that seamlessly unifies the strengths\nof two streams of NLVG methods: proposal-free and proposal-based; the former\nexplores the search space to find time segments directly, and the latter\nmatches the predefined time segments with ground truths. To achieve this, we\nformulate NLVG as a set prediction problem and design an end-to-end trainable\nLanguage Video Transformer (LVTR) that can enjoy two favorable properties,\nwhich are rich contextualization power and parallel decoding. We train LVTR\nwith two losses. First, temporal localization loss allows time segments of all\nqueries to regress targets (explore). Second, set guidance loss couples every\nquery with their respective target (match). To our surprise, we found that\ntraining schedule shows divide-and-conquer-like pattern: time segments are\nfirst diversified regardless of the target, then coupled with each target, and\nfine-tuned to the target again. Moreover, LVTR is highly efficient and\neffective: it infers faster than previous baselines (by 2X or more) and sets\ncompetitive results on two NLVG benchmarks (ActivityCaptions and Charades-STA).\nCodes are available at https://github.com/sangminwoo/Explore-And-Match.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 13:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 05:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 05:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

Motivated by\nrecent developments in 3D IGM tomography observations as well as matter density\nfield reconstruction techniques applied to galaxy redshift samples at $z\\sim\n2$, we examine the possibility of observationally testing FGPA by directly\nexamining the relationship between the Ly$\\alpha$ transmission and the\nunderlying matter density field. Specifically, we analyze the EAGLE, Illustris,\nIllustrisTNG and Nyx cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, that were run with\ndifferent codes and sub-grid models. While the FGPA is an excellent description\nof the IGM in lower-density regions, the slope of the transmission-density\ndistribution at higher densities is significantly affected by feedback\nprocesses causing the FGPA to break down in that regime. Even without added\nfeedback, we find significant deviations caused by hydrodynamical effects\narising from non-linear structure growth. We then proceed to make comparisons\nusing realistic mock data assuming the sightline sampling and spectral\nproperties of the recent CLAMATO survey, and find that it would be challenging\nto discern between the FGPA and hydrodynamical models with current data sets.\nHowever, the improved sightline sampling from future extremely large telescopes\nor large volumes from multiplexed spectroscopic surveys such as Subaru PFS\nshould allow for stringent tests of the FGPA, and make it possible to detect\nthe effect of galaxy feedback on the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 01:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Speeding up the\nprotocol by simply shortening the pulses leads to non-resonant leakage of\nexcitations to higher levels of the transmon accompanied by higher decoherence.\nWe discuss how to correct for such leakages by applying counter pulses to\nde-excite these higher levels.

It\nis applicable to a wide range of settings, e.g. asymmetric channels, channels\nwith state and/or cost constraints, and the Wyner-Ziv problem, and can provably\nachieve the capacity. For the channels with state (Gelfand-Pinsker) setting,\nthe proposed coding scheme has two advantages compared to the nested linear\ncode. First, it achieves the capacity of any channel with state (e.g.\nasymmetric channels). Second, simulation results show that the proposed code\nachieves a smaller error rate compared to the nested linear code.

To overcome such limitations, in\nthis paper, we propose to utilize the radio signals, which can traverse\nobstacles and are unaffected by the lighting conditions to achieve silhouette\nsegmentation. The proposed RFMask framework is composed of three modules. It\nfirst transforms RF signals captured by millimeter wave radar on two planes\ninto spatial domain and suppress interference with the signal processing\nmodule. Then, it locates human reflections on RF frames and extract features\nfrom surrounding signals with human detection module. Finally, the extracted\nfeatures from RF frames are aggregated with an attention based mask generation\nmodule. To verify our proposed framework, we collect a dataset containing\n804,760 radio frames and 402,380 camera frames with human activities under\nvarious scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can\nachieve impressive human silhouette segmentation even under the challenging\nscenarios(such as low light and occlusion scenarios) where traditional\noptical-camera-based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst investigation towards segmenting human silhouette based on millimeter\nwave signals. We hope that our work can serve as a baseline and inspire further\nresearch that perform vision tasks with radio signals.

In the present work the total 14N(p,gamma)15O cross\nsection was measured with a method complementary to the available data sets.\nThe cross section was measured with activation, based on the detection of the\nannihilation radiation following the beta+ decay of the reaction product 15O.\nThis method, which provides directly the astrophysically important total cross\nsection, was never used for the 14N(p,gamma)15O cross section measurement in\nthe studied energy range.

When the GPR's detecting direction is\nperpendicular to a pipeline, a hyperbolic characteristic would be formed on the\nGPR B-scan image. However, in real-world applications, the direction of\npipelines on the existing pipeline map could be inaccurate, and it is hard to\nensure the moving direction of GPR to be actually perpendicular to underground\npipelines. In this paper, a novel model is proposed to estimate the direction\nand radius of pipeline and revise the existing pipeline map from GPR B-scan\nimages. The model consists of two parts: GPR B-scan image processing and\nEllipse Iterative Inversion Algorithm (EIIA). Firstly, the GPR B-scan image is\nprocessed with downward-opening point set extracted. The obtained point set is\nthen iteratively inverted to the elliptical cross section of the buried\npipeline, which is caused by the angle between the GPR's detecting direction\nand the pipeline's direction.

To this end, we propose a novel blockwise synchronous\ndecoding algorithm with a hybrid approach that combines endpoint prediction and\nendpoint post-determination. In the endpoint prediction, we compute the\nexpectation of the number of tokens that are yet to be emitted in the encoder\nfeatures of the current blocks using the CTC posterior. Based on the\nexpectation value, the decoder predicts the endpoint to realize continuous\nblock synchronization, as a running stitch. Meanwhile, endpoint\npost-determination probabilistically detects backward jump of the source-target\nattention, which is caused by the misprediction of endpoints. Then it resumes\ndecoding by discarding those hypotheses, as back stitch. We combine these\nmethods into a hybrid approach, namely run-and-back stitch search, which\nreduces the computational cost and latency. Evaluations of various ASR tasks\nshow the efficiency of our proposed decoding algorithm, which achieves a\nlatency reduction, for instance in the Librispeech test set from 1487 ms to 821\nms at the 90th percentile, while maintaining a high recognition accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 09:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Mispronunciation detection is one of the\ncore components of Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems\nwhich is a subset of CALL. Studies on automated pronunciation error detection\nbegan in the 1990s, but the development of fullfledged CAPTs has only\naccelerated in the last decade due to an increase in computing power and\navailability of mobile devices for recording speech required for pronunciation\nanalysis. Detecting Pronunciation errors is a hard problem to solve as there is\nno formal definition of correct and incorrect pronunciation. As a result,\ntypically prosodic and phoneme errors such as phoneme substitution, insertion,\nand deletion are detected. Also, it has been agreed upon that learning\npronunciation should focus on speaker intelligibility rather than sounding like\nan L1 English speaker. Initially, methods were developed on posterior\nlikelihood called Good of Pronunciation using Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden\nMarkov Model and Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model approaches.

In doped tubes, the\neffective Coulomb interaction drives the competition between Luttinger liquid\nand Wigner crystal, whereas in undoped narrow-gap tubes it dictates the Mott or\nexcitonic nature of the correlated insulator observed at low temperature. Here,\nby computing the dielectric function of selected narrow- and zero-gap tubes\nfrom first principles, we show that the standard effective-mass model of\nscreening systematically underestimates the interaction strength at long\nwavelength, hence missing the binding of low-energy excitons. The reason is\nthat the model critically lacks the full three-dimensional topology of the\ntube, being adapted from graphene theory.

Specifically, given a speech utterance, we first feed the utterance\nto a teacher network to obtain corresponding representation. Then the same\nutterance is perturbed and fed to a student network. The student network is\ntrained to output representation resembling that of the teacher. At the same\ntime, the teacher network is updated as moving average of student's weights\nover training steps. In order to prevent representation collapse, we apply an\nin-utterance contrastive loss as pre-training objective and impose position\nrandomization on the input to the teacher. SPIRAL achieves competitive or\nbetter results compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-training method wav2vec\n2.0, with significant reduction of training cost (80% for BASE model, 65% for\nLARGE model). Furthermore, we address the problem of noise-robustness that is\ncritical to real-world speech applications.

We propose a family of semi-supervised estimators for the\nresponse quantile(s) based on the two data sets, to improve the estimation\naccuracy compared to the supervised estimator, i.e., the sample quantile from\nthe labeled data. These estimators use a flexible imputation strategy applied\nto the estimating equation along with a debiasing step that allows for full\nrobustness against misspecification of the imputation model. Further, a\none-step update strategy is adopted to enable easy implementation of our method\nand handle the complexity from the non-linear nature of the quantile estimating\nequation. Under mild assumptions, our estimators are fully robust to the choice\nof the nuisance imputation model, in the sense of always maintaining root-n\nconsistency and asymptotic normality, while having improved efficiency relative\nto the supervised estimator. They also attain semi-parametric optimality if the\nrelation between the response and the covariates is correctly specified via the\nimputation model.

This\nraises the fascinating prospect of evaluating cosmic life on a statistical\nbasis. One key statistic is the occurrence rate of life-bearing worlds, $f_{\\rm\nL}$, the 'frequency of life' term in the famous Drake Equation. Measuring\n$f_{\\rm L}$ would give profound insight into how common life is and may help to\nconstrain origin-of-life theories. I propose $f_{\\rm L}$ as the goal for the\nDRAKE mission (Dedicated Research for Advancing Knowledge of Exobiology): a\ntransit spectroscopy survey of M-dwarf habitable zone terrestrial planets. I\ninvestigate how the uncertainty on the observed value of $f_{\\rm L}$ scales\nwith sample size. I determine that sampling error dominates over observational\nerror and that the uncertainty is a function of the observed $f_{\\rm L}$ value.\nI show that even small sample sizes can provide significant constraints on\n$f_{\\rm L}$, boding well for the transit spectroscopy approach. I perform a\nfeasibility study of the DRAKE mission using a nominal instrument design and\nmission plan. Due to low observing efficiencies, DRAKE may need to be\nincorporated into a wider-ranging deep-space or lunar observatory. A 50-planet\nsurvey could constrain $f_{\\rm L}$ to $\\leq$ 0.06 (at 95% confidence) if the\nsample $f_{\\rm L}$ = 0, or 0.03-0.2 if the sample $f_{\\rm L}$ = 0.1. This can\nbe achieved (on average) in 10 years using a 17-m telescope with an\nunrestricted field-of-regard. DRAKE is a viable approach to attempting the\nfirst experimental measurement of $f_{\\rm L}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 10:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Here, the system vulnerability refers to\nthe existence of key observation sequences that could be exploited by a\nspecific smart sensor attack to cause damage infliction. We consider a\nnondeterministic smart attack, i.e., there might exist more than one attack\nchoice over each received observation, and adopt our previously proposed\nmodeling framework, where such an attack is captured by a standard finite-state\nautomaton. For a given supervisor S and a smart sensor attack model A, another\nsmart attack model A' is called attack equivalent to A with respect to S, if\nthe resulting compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of the\nsupervisor S and attack model A', is control equivalent to the original\ncompromised supervisor, defined as the composition of S and A. Following the\nspirit of supervisor reduction that relies on the concept of control\ncongruence, we will show that, this problem of synthesizing a reduced smart\nattack model A' that is attack equivalent to A with respect to S, can be\ntransformed to a classical supervisor reduction problem, making all existing\nsynthesis tools available for supervisor reduction directly applicable to our\nproblem. A simplified and ideally minimum-state attack model can reveal all\nnecessary observation sequences for the attacker to be successful, thus,\nreminds system designers to take necessary precautions in advance, which may\nimprove system resilience significantly. An example is presented to show the\neffectiveness of our proposed attack model reduction technique to identify the\nsystem vulnerability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 11:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

In particular, the work studies the $K$-user\ncache-aided broadcast channel with a limited number of cache states, and\nexplores the effect of cache state association strategies in the presence of\narbitrary user activity levels; a combination that strikes at the very core of\nthe coded caching problem and its crippling subpacketization bottleneck. We\nfirst present a statistical analysis of the average worst-case delay\nperformance of such subpacketization-constrained (state-constrained) coded\ncaching networks, and provide computationally efficient performance bounds as\nwell as scaling laws for any arbitrary probability distribution of the\nuser-activity levels.

This optimized strategy\nis based on the principle that users that overlap more, interfere more, and\nthus have higher priority to secure complementary cache states.

Age of\ninformation (AoI) is used as the metric to characterize the information\nfreshness, defined as the time elapsed since the latest received status update\nwas generated. In error-prone wireless networks, prior studies indicated that\nAutomatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) does not help improve the average AoI\nperformance of single-hop networks, because sending a new packet always carries\nthe most up-to-date information (i.e., discarding the old packet). We believe\nthat this observation does not apply to two-hop networks. For example, when a\npacket transmission fails in the second hop, although a new packet has more\nrecent information, it may require more time to be delivered (i.e., the\ncommunication has to restart from the first hop), thus leading to a high AoI.\nThis paper analyzes the theoretical average AoI of two-hop networks with and\nwithout ARQ. Specifically, we model the two schemes using Markov chains, from\nwhich we derive the average AoI. Our theoretical and simulation results confirm\nthat, unlike single-hop networks, ARQ should be used in two-hop networks to\nachieve lower average AoI. In particular, when ARQ is used, the successful\ndecoding probability of the second hop has a greater impact on the average AoI\nthan that of the first hop. Overall, our findings provide insight into the ARQ\ndesign for two-hop timely status update systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 11:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Although several formation channels of such binaries are known,\nconsiderable theoretical uncertainties associated with each channel defeat the\nrobust prediction of how much each channel contributes to the total merger rate\ndensity. Given that the time evolution of the merger rate density in some\nchannels is (exactly or nearly) independent of BH masses, clarifying this\nfeature from observational data will shed some light on the nature of BH\nbinaries. On the basis of this motivation, we formulate a methodology to\nperform a statistical test of whether the mass distribution of BH mergers\nevolves over time by hypothesis testing. Our statistical test requires neither\na priori specification of the mass distribution, which is largely uncertain,\nnor that of the time dependence of merger rate. We then apply it to mock data\nfor some concrete shapes of the merger rate density and show that the proposed\nmethod rejects/(does not reject) the null hypothesis correctly for a large\nsample size. After this verification, the method is applied to a catalog of the\ngravitational-wave events obtained during the LIGO-Virgo's third observing run.\nWe find that the selection bias degrades the effectiveness of our method for\nthe O3 catalog owing to the reduction in the number of and the maximum\nredshifts of the merger events that we can explore. Within the range where the\nmethod can be applied, there is no indication of the time evolution of the mass\ndistribution of merger rate density.

This is a fast and accurate method,\nrecently studied in a VRP setting. Furthermore, we explore the use of machine\nlearning to infer how to best balance multiple objectives such as distance,\nprobability and penalties.

Loop unification is closely related to Narrowing as\nthe schematic constructions can be seen as a rewrite rule applied during\nunification, and primal grammars, as we deal with recursive term constructions.\nHowever, loop unification relaxes the restrictions put on variables as fresh as\nwell as used extra variables may be introduced by rewriting. In this work we\nconsider an important special case, so called semiloop unification. We provide\na sufficient condition for unifiability of the entire sequence based on the\nstructure of a sufficiently long initial segment. It remains an open question\nwhether this condition is also necessary for semiloop unification and how it\nmay be extended to loop unification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 13:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

For example,\npredicting where from/to and when people intend to travel by taxi can support\nfleet managers to distribute resources; better predicting traffic\nspeeds/congestion allows for pro-active control measures or for users to better\nchoose their paths. Making spatio-temporal predictions is known to be a hard\ntask, but recently Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on\nnon-euclidean spatial data. However, most GNN models require a predefined\ngraph, and so far, researchers rely on heuristics to generate this graph for\nthe model to use. In this paper, we use Neural Relational Inference to learn\nthe optimal graph for the model. Our approach has several advantages: 1) a\nVariational Auto Encoder structure allows for the graph to be dynamically\ndetermined by the data, potentially changing through time; 2) the encoder\nstructure allows the use of external data in the generation of the graph; 3) it\nis possible to place Bayesian priors on the generated graphs to encode domain\nknowledge.

This paper investigates the fundamental\naspects of the problem, by addressing the optimal design of simple two-bar\nactive and passive redundant systems. Progressive collapse is objectively\naddressed, differentiating consequences of direct collapse of statically\ndeterminate structures, and progressive collapse of redundant, statically\nindeterminate structures. It is well known that reliability of a structural\nsystem also depends on nonstructural factors, or factors beyond structural\ndesign, such as unanticipated loading, manufacturing quality, quality of\nworkmanship and human errors. These factors can be taken into account in an\nencompassing risk analysis, which accounts for physical and epistemic\nuncertainties, and which contributes a fixed latent failure probability to the\nstructural optimization problem. Results presented herein show that the latent\nfailure probability is the single most important parameter in determining\noptimal solutions, in System RBDO and in RO solutions. When the latent failure\nprobability is smaller than target (System RBDO) or optimal (RO) failure\nprobabilities, there is an equivalence between redundant and non-redundant\n(hyperstatic and isostatic) designs. However, when the latent reliability is\nsmaller than target or optimal reliabilities, optimal designs become\nnecessarily redundant (hyperstatic); as the only way to make system reliability\nlarger than the latent reliability is by making structural systems redundant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 13:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Our aim is to formulate a stochastic\ndescription for the statistics of spin-2 modes which seed the background of\ngravitational waves from inflation. Using basic principles of quantum\nmechanics, we determine a probability density for coarse-grained tensor fields,\nwhich satisfies a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation at superhorizon scales. The\ncorresponding noise and drift are computable, and depend on the cosmological\nsystem under consideration. Our general formulas are applied to a variety of\ncosmological scenarios, also considering cases seldom considered in the context\nof stochastic inflation, and which are important for their observational\nconsequences. We start obtaining the expected expressions for noise and drift\nin pure de Sitter and power-law inflation, also including a discussion of\neffects of non-attractor phases. We then apply our methods to describe\nscenarios with a transition from inflation to standard cosmological eras of\nradiation and matter domination. We show how the interference between modes\nflowing through the cosmological horizon, and modes spontaneously produced at\nsuperhorizon scales, can affect the stochastic evolution of coarse-grained\ntensor quantities. In appropriate limits, we find that the corresponding\nspectrum of tensor modes at horizon crossing matches with the results of\nquantum field theory calculations, but we also highlight where differences can\narise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

With a rising number of radar sensors\nand the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference\nis inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar\ndata are required to run the early processing steps on specialized radar sensor\nhardware. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints,\ni.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield\npromising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding\nresource-constraints, however, CNNs typically exceed the hardware's capacities\nby far.\n  In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising\nand interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization of\n(i) weights and (ii) activations of different CNN-based model architectures.\nThis quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and\nduring inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and\ncontrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the\nstraight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete\nweights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base\nmodels for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest\nmodels. We achieve a memory reduction of around 80\\% compared to the\nreal-valued baseline. Due to practical reasons, however, we recommend the use\nof 8 bits for weights and activations, which results in models that require\nonly 0.2 megabytes of memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

However, adoption by\nresource-constrained groups, such as local municipalities, regulatory agencies,\nand researchers, has been hampered by the lack of a cost-effective,\nreadily-accessible baseline platform that can be adapted to their unique\nmissions.

Many bioinformatic\napplications require a specific decomposition where the paths correspond to\nsome underlying data that generated the flow. For real inputs, no optimization\ncriteria guarantees to uniquely identify the correct decomposition. Therefore,\nwe propose to report safe paths, i.e., subpaths of at least one path in every\nflow decomposition.\n  Ma, Zheng, and Kingsford [WABI 2020] addressed the existence of multiple\noptimal solutions in a probabilistic framework, i.e., non-identifiability.\nLater [RECOMB 2021], they gave a quadratic-time algorithm based on a global\ncriterion for solving a problem called AND-Quant, which generalizes the problem\nof reporting whether a given path is safe.\n  We give the first local characterization of safe paths for flow\ndecompositions in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), leading to a practical\nalgorithm for finding the complete set of safe paths. We evaluated our\nalgorithms against the trivial safe algorithms (unitigs, extended unitigs) and\nthe popularly used heuristic (greedy-width) for flow decomposition on RNA\ntranscripts datasets.

The greedy-width algorithm though reporting a better coverage, has\nsignificantly lower precision on complex graphs. Overall, our algorithm\noutperforms (by $\\approx 20\\%$) greedy-width on a unified metric (F-Score) when\nthe dataset has significant number of complex graphs. Moreover, it has superior\ntime ($3-5\\times$) and space efficiency ($1.2-2.2\\times$), resulting in a\nbetter and more practical approach for bioinformatics applications of flow\ndecomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

The algorithms\navailable in the literature work with implicit representations of the strategy\nspace and mainly resort to Linear Programming and column generation techniques\nto enlarge incrementally the strategy space. Such representations prevent the\nadoption of standard tools such as abstraction generation, game solving, and\nsubgame solving, which demonstrated to be crucial when solving huge, real-world\ntwo-player zero-sum games. Differently from these works, we answer the question\nof whether there is any suitable game representation enabling the adoption of\nthose tools. In particular, our algorithms convert a sequential team game with\nadversaries to a classical two-player zero-sum game. In this converted game,\nthe team is transformed into a single coordinator player who only knows\ninformation common to the whole team and prescribes to the players an action\nfor any possible private state. Interestingly, we show that our game is more\nexpressive than the original extensive-form game as any state/action\nabstraction of the extensive-form game can be captured by our representation,\nwhile the reverse does not hold. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the\nresulting Public Team game may be exponentially larger than the original one.\nTo limit this explosion, we provide three algorithms, each returning an\ninformation-lossless abstraction that dramatically reduces the size of the\ntree. These abstractions can be produced without generating the original game\ntree. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting\nexperimental results on Kuhn and Leduc Poker games, obtained by applying\nstate-of-art algorithms for two-player zero-sum games on the converted games\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

The low rank approach is based on our\nearlier work (arxiv: 2106.08834). It takes advantage of the fact that the\ndifferential operators in the Vlasov equation are tensor friendly, based on\nwhich we propose to dynamically and adaptively build up low rank solution basis\nby adding new basis functions from discretization of the differential equation,\nand removing basis from a singular value decomposition (SVD)-type truncation\nprocedure. For the discretization, we adopt a high order finite difference\nspatial discretization together with a second order strong stability preserving\nmulti-step time discretization.\n  While the SVD truncation will remove the redundancy in representing the high\ndimensional Vlasov solution, it will destroy the conservation properties of the\nassociated full conservative scheme. In this paper, we develop a conservative\ntruncation procedure with conservation of mass, momentum and kinetic energy\ndensities. The conservative truncation is achieved by an orthogonal projection\nonto a subspace spanned by $1$, $v$ and $v^2$ in the velocity space associated\nwith a weighted inner product. Then the algorithm performs a weighted SVD\ntruncation of the remainder, which involves a scaling, followed by the standard\nSVD truncation and rescaling back. The algorithm is further developed in high\ndimensions with hierarchical Tucker tensor decomposition of high dimensional\nVlasov solutions, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. An extensive set of\nnonlinear Vlasov examples are performed to show the effectiveness and\nconservation property of proposed conservative low rank approach. Comparison is\nperformed against the non-conservative low rank tensor approach on conservation\nhistory of mass, momentum and energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Many recent pipelines capture or\nsynthesize large quantities of city geometry using scanners or procedural\nmodeling pipelines. Such geometry is intricate and realistic, however the\ngeneration of photo-realistic textures for such large scenes remains a problem.\nWe propose to generate textures for input target 3D meshes driven by the\ntextural style present in readily available datasets of panoramic photos\ncapturing urban environments. Re-targeting such 2D datasets to 3D geometry is\nchallenging because the underlying shape, size, and layout of the urban\nstructures in the photos do not correspond to the ones in the target meshes.\nPhotos also often have objects (e.g., trees, vehicles) that may not even be\npresent in the target geometry. To address these issues we present a method,\ncalled Projective Urban Texturing (PUT), which re-targets textural style from\nreal-world panoramic images to unseen urban meshes. PUT relies on contrastive\nand adversarial training of a neural architecture designed for unpaired\nimage-to-texture translation. The generated textures are stored in a texture\natlas applied to the target 3D mesh geometry.

Such a large output space\nmakes learning hard and requires vast amounts of labeled data. Different\napproaches leverage alternate sources of supervision. One approach -- entropy\nregularization -- posits that decision boundaries should lie in low-probability\nregions. It extracts supervision from unlabeled examples, but remains agnostic\nto the structure of the output space. Conversely, neuro-symbolic approaches\nexploit the knowledge that not every prediction corresponds to a valid\nstructure in the output space. Yet, they does not further restrict the learned\noutput distribution. This paper introduces a framework that unifies both\napproaches. We propose a loss, neuro-symbolic entropy regularization, that\nencourages the model to confidently predict a valid object. It is obtained by\nrestricting entropy regularization to the distribution over only valid\nstructures.

Subgraph matching algorithms enumerate all isomorphic\nembeddings of a query graph q in a data graph G. An important branch of\nmatching algorithms exploit the backtracking search approach which recursively\nextends intermediate results following a matching order of query vertices. It\nhas been shown that the matching order plays a critical role in time efficiency\nof these backtracking based subgraph matching algorithms. In recent years, many\nadvanced techniques for query vertex ordering (i.e., matching order generation)\nhave been proposed to reduce the unpromising intermediate results according to\nthe preset heuristic rules. In this paper, for the first time we apply the\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) techniques to\ngenerate the high-quality matching order for subgraph matching algorithms.\nInstead of using the fixed heuristics to generate the matching order, our model\ncould capture and make full use of the graph information, and thus determine\nthe query vertex order with the adaptive learning-based rule that could\nsignificantly reduces the number of redundant enumerations.

An effective way to reduce mutual\ninterference can be found in sparsity and selectivity of neurons. According to\nAljundi et al. and Hadsell et al., imposing sparsity at the representational\nlevel is advantageous for continual learning because sparse neuronal\nactivations encourage less overlap between parameters, resulting in less\ninterference. Similarly, highly selective neural networks are likely to induce\nless interference since particular response in neurons will reduce the chance\nof overlap with other parameters. Considering that the human brain performs\ncontinual learning over the lifespan, finding conditions where sparsity and\nselectivity naturally arises may provide insight for understanding how the\nbrain functions. This paper investigates various conditions that naturally\nincrease sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. This paper tested\ndifferent optimizers with Hoyer's sparsity metric and CCMAS selectivity metric\nin MNIST classification task. It is essential to note that investigations on\nthe natural occurrence of sparsity and selectivity concerning various\nconditions have not been acknowledged in any sector of neuroscience nor machine\nlearning until this day. This paper found that particular conditions increase\nsparsity and selectivity such as applying a large learning rate and lowering a\nbatch size. In addition to the relationship between the condition, sparsity,\nand selectivity, the following will be discussed based on empirical analysis:\n1. The relationship between sparsity and selectivity and 2.

We analyze the effectiveness of detractors with respect to\nparameters such as evaporation rate of misleading pheromone and fraction of\ndetractors in the colony.
