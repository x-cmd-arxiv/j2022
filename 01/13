Some of these properties can be\nconveniently exploited in the framework of circadian oscillations. When\ninterpreted as a biological oscillator that determines the alternation\nsleep/awake, the dynamic variable exhibits some interesting features that can\nbe related to biological behavior. We analyze in the paper the phenomenon of\nentrainment of van der Pol-type circadian pacemaker to daylight cycle. We\ndetermine the amplitude and frequency of the circadian model without natural\nforcing light, and find that the agreement of between analytical and numerical\nresults hardly depend on the stiffness coefficient, $ \\mu $ of circadian\noscillations. It is shown that a practical and precise drive which imitates the\neffects of the conditions of natural light can be introduced in the system and\nanalytically treated. Considering the effects of forcing light on the sleep\naware cycle model, we find that a strong drive destroys the circadian\noscillations and thus we confirm the importance of darkness for regular\ncircadian oscillations. Moreover, we observe the reverse situation when we take\ninto account the phase in the forcing light. For instance, for $\\phi = \\pi/2$\nand the duration of daylight $D_L = 12h$, the phenomenon of quenching of\ncircadian oscillations disappears. The comparison between analytical treatment\nand numerical simulations of effects of light is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Two types of\nsolutions based on digital and analog schemes are used typically. The\ndigital-based solution takes quantization and entropy coding for compression,\nwhereas transmissions via wireless channels may cause catastrophic errors owing\nto the all-or-nothing behavior in entropy coding. The analog-based solutions\nsuch as AirNet and AirComp use analog modulation for the parameter\ntransmissions. However, such an analog scheme often causes significant\ndistortion due to the source signal's large power without compression gain.\nThis paper proposes a novel hybrid digital-analog transmission-Federated\nAirNet--for the model parameter transmissions in federated learning. The\nFederated AirNet integrates low-rate digital coding and energy-compact analog\nmodulation. The digital coding offers the baseline of the model parameters and\ncompacts the source signal power.

In particular, our protocol is able to drive the walker\nto a desired target node. The idea is based on continuously monitoring the\nposition of the quantum walker on the graph and then to apply a unitary\nfeedback operation based on the information obtained from measurement.

We approximate corrections to a homogenization approximation\nusing a moment-expansion method, replacing the Green's function by its\nfree-space form, and test predictions against simulation. We show how, in two\nor three dimensions, the leading-order impact of disorder can be captured in a\nhomogenization approximation for the ensemble mean concentration through a\nmodification to Da that grows with diminishing sink size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 12:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Indeed, the\nwake/sleep system stems from biological systems that follow a circadian rhythm\ndetermined by the light/dark alternation. The oscillations can be modeled by\nthe higher order non-linearity van der Pol -type equation driven by a term that\nmimics the light cycle. In this work noise in the illumination is introduced to\ninvestigate its effect on the human circadian cycle. It is found that the\npresence of noise is detrimental for the sleep/wake rhythm, except for some\nspecial values for which it may favor regular oscillations. Depending for\nsystem parameters, noise induces regularities, such as stochastic resonance: if\nthe natural light is turned off, it emerges that there is an optimal value of\nintensity noise which most deteriorates the regularity of the cycle, it is the\nphenomenon of anti-coherent resonance. Also, the phenomenon of stochastic\nresonance occurs: in the presence of the drive of natural light, there is an\noptimal noise intensity which improves the evolution of the wake / sleep\nsystem. However, there is a critical value of the noise beyond which the system\nbecomes chaotic; indeed, for sufficiently high noise levels (how high depends\nupon the parameter of the system), the sleep/wake cycle evolves in a random and\nunpredictable manner, for whatever parameters of the external light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Usually, MSC methods use graphs (or affinity\nmatrices) fusion to learn a common structure, and further apply graph-based\napproaches to clustering. Despite progress, most of the methods do not\nestablish the connection between graph learning and clustering. Meanwhile,\nconventional graph fusion strategies assign coarse-grained weights to combine\nmulti-graph, ignoring the importance of local structure. In this paper, we\npropose a fine-grained graph learning framework for multi-view subspace\nclustering (FGL-MSC) to address these issues. To utilize the multi-view\ninformation sufficiently, we design a specific graph learning method by\nintroducing graph regularization and local structure fusion pattern.

Accordingly, an iterative algorithm\nis proposed to solve the above joint optimization problem, which obtains the\nlearned graph, the clustering representation, and the fusion weights\nsimultaneously.

Data reduction\ntechniques, such as lossy compression, help to mitigate this issue by\ndecreasing the size of data generated by these applications. SZ, a current\nstate-of-the-art lossy compressor, is able to achieve high compression ratios,\nbut the prediction/quantization methods used introduce dependencies which\nprevent parallelizing this step of the compression. Recent work proposes a\nparallel dual prediction/quantization algorithm for GPUs which removes these\ndependencies. However, some HPC systems and applications do not use GPUs, and\ncould still benefit from the fine-grained parallelism of this method. Using the\ndual-quantization technique, we implement and optimize a SIMD vectorized CPU\nversion of SZ, and create a heuristic for selecting the optimal block size and\nvector length. We also investigate the effect of non-zero block padding values\nto decrease the number of unpredictable values along compression block borders.\nWe measure performance of vecSZ against an O3 optimized CPU version of SZ using\ndual-quantization, pSZ, as well as SZ-1.4. We evaluate our vectorized version,\nvecSZ, on the Intel Skylake and AMD Rome architectures using real-world\nscientific datasets. We find that applying alternative padding reduces the\nnumber of outliers by 100\\% for some configurations. Our implementation also\nresults in up to 32\\% improvement in rate-distortion and up to 15$\\times$\nspeedup over SZ-1.4, achieving a prediction and quantization bandwidth in\nexcess of 3.4 GB/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 18:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

However, definitively\ndistinguishing pairs of lensed sources from random associations is a\nchallenging problem. We investigate the degree to which unlensed events mimic\nlensed ones because of the overlap of parameters due to a combination of random\ncoincidence and errors in parameter estimation. We construct a mock catalog of\nlensed and unlensed events. We find that the false alarm probability (FAP)\nbased on coincidental overlaps of the chirp mass, sky location, and coalescence\nphase are approximately $9\\%$, $1\\%$, and $10\\%$ per pair, respectively.\nCombining all three, the overall FAP per pair is $\\sim10^{-4}$. As the number\nof events, $N$, in the GW catalogs increases, the number of random pairs of\nevents increases as $\\sim N^2$. Meanwhile, the number of lensed events will\nincrease linearly with $N$, implying that for sufficiently high $N$, the false\nalarms will always dominate over the true lensing events. This issue can be\ncompensated for by placing higher thresholds on the lensing candidates (e.g.,\nselecting a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold), which will lead to\nbetter parameter estimation and, thus, lower FAP per pair -- at the cost of\ndramatically decreasing the size of the lensing sample (by $\\sim\n1/\\mbox{SNR}^3$). We show that with our simple overlap criteria for current\ndetectors at design sensitivity, the false alarms will dominate for realistic\nlensing rates ($\\lesssim10^{-3}$) even when selecting the highest SNR pairs.\nThese results highlight the necessity to design alternative identification\ncriteria beyond simple waveform and sky location overlap.

We show that hydrogen-rich\ncollapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine can\nnaturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction\nforms a mildly-relativistic shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers\ncooling emission that dominates the high velocity optical signal during the\nfirst few weeks, with a typical energy of $ \\sim 10^{50}-10^{51} $ erg. During\nthis time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical\nlightcurve exhibits a fast decay of $ L \\propto t^{-2.4} $. After a few weeks,\nwhen the velocity of the emitting shell is $ \\sim 0.01 $ c, the cocoon becomes\ntransparent, and the cooling envelope governs the emission. The interaction\nbetween the cocoon and the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron\nself-absorbed emission in the radio bands, featuring a steady rise on a month\ntimescale. After a few months the relativistic outflow decelerates, enters the\nobserver's line of sight, and powers the peak of the radio lightcurve, which\nrapidly decays thereafter.

Spectral lines and their variability reveal the\npresence of a B-type spectrum and a hot continuum source in the visible. The\nhot source confirms GALEX UV photometry. Because there is a lack of spectral\nlines for the hot source in the visible, the spectral fitting gives only the\nlower temperature limit of the hot source, which is 50 000 K, and the upper\nlimit for the B-type star of 11 100 K.

Although 3D convolution can efficiently aggregate local context\nto suppress local redundancy from a small 3D neighborhood, it lacks the\ncapability to capture global dependency because of the limited receptive field.\nAlternatively, vision transformers can effectively capture long-range\ndependency by self-attention mechanism, while having the limitation on reducing\nlocal redundancy with blind similarity comparison among all the tokens in each\nlayer.

Specifically, we\ninvestigate the interactions between terahertz excitations in a structure\ncomposed of Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and GaAs materials. We find that the interaction\nbetween the Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ layer and AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells with\nintersubband transitions (ISBTs) in the terahertz frequency regime creates new\nhybrid modes, namely Dirac plasmon-phonon-ISBT polaritons. The formation of\nthese hybrid modes results in anti-crossings (spectral mode splitting) whose\nmagnitude is an indication of the strength of the coupling. By varying the\nstructural parameters of the constituent materials, our numerical calculations\nreveal that the magnitude of splitting depends strongly on the doping level and\nthe scattering rate in the AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells, as well as on the\nthickness of the GaAs spacer layer that separates the quantum-well structure\nfrom the TI layer. Our results reveal the material and device parameters\nrequired to obtain experimentally-observable signatures of strong coupling.

The presence of this\nmassive 2DHG at the TI/III-V interface shifts the dispersion of the Dirac\nplasmon-ISBT polaritons to higher frequencies. The damping rate at this\ninterface, in contrast, compensates the effect of the 2DHG.

In contrast, the\nfield dwarf variability occurrence rate drops for spectral types $>$L9. We\nexamine the variability amplitudes of young objects and find an enhancement in\nmaximum amplitudes compared to field dwarfs. We speculate that the observed\nrange of amplitudes within a spectral type may be influenced by secondary\neffects such as viewing inclination and/or rotation period.

While high mass brown dwarfs ($>30\nM_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$) spin up over time, the same trend is not apparent for lower\nmass objects ($<30 M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$), likely due to the small number of\nmeasured periods for old, low-mass objects. The rotation periods of companion\nbrown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects are consistent with those of isolated\nobjects with similar ages and masses, suggesting similar angular momentum\nhistories. Within the AB Doradus group, we find a high variability occurrence\nrate and evidence for common angular momentum evolution.

It is highly\nuseful in situations where the search requirements are not well understood and\nhence it has been widely adopted by search engines to guide users' search\nactivity. For news websites, user queries have a time sensitive nature inherent\nin them. When some new event happens, there is a sudden burst in queries\nrelated to that event and such queries are sustained over a period of time\nbefore fading away with that event.

Moreover, most of the existing methods for\nestimating the number of communities assume the number of communities to be\nfixed and not scale with the network size $n$. The few methods that assume the\nnumber of communities to increase with the network size $n$ are only valid when\nthe average degree $d$ of a network grows at least as fast as $O(n)$ (i.e., the\ndense case) or lies within a narrow range. This presents a challenge in\nclustering large-scale network data, particularly when the average degree $d$\nof a network grows slower than the rate of $O(n)$ (i.e., the sparse case). To\naddress this problem, we proposed a new sequential procedure utilizing multiple\nhypothesis tests and the spectral properties of Erd\\\"{o}s R\\'{e}nyi graphs for\nestimating the number of communities in sparse stochastic block models (SBMs).\nWe prove the consistency of our method for sparse SBMs for a broad range of the\nsparsity parameter.

Meanwhile, because of the\ndiminishing magnetic susceptibility, the nature and the magnitude of\ncurrent-induced magnetic dynamics remain poorly characterized in\nantiferromagnets, whereas spurious effects further complicate experimental\ninterpretations.

We show that in the\nunderparameterized regime the network learns eigenfunctions of an integral\noperator $T_{K^\\infty}$ determined by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at rates\ncorresponding to their eigenvalues. For example, for uniformly distributed data\non the sphere $S^{d - 1}$ and rotation invariant weight distributions, the\neigenfunctions of $T_{K^\\infty}$ are the spherical harmonics. Our results can\nbe understood as describing a spectral bias in the underparameterized regime.\nThe proofs use the concept of \"Damped Deviations\", where deviations of the NTK\nmatter less for eigendirections with large eigenvalues due to the occurence of\na damping factor. Aside from the underparameterized regime, the damped\ndeviations point-of-view can be used to track the dynamics of the empirical\nrisk in the overparameterized setting, allowing us to extend certain results in\nthe literature. We conclude that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying\nperspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Despite\nits fundamental role in relativistic field theory, the concept of causality and\nthe associated spacetime light cone and event horizon has not been considered\nin connection with interacting Weyl fermionic excitations in quantum matter.\nHere, by using charge-density wave (CDW) as an example, we unveil the behavior\nof interacting Weyl fermions and show that a Weyl fermion in a system can open\na band gap by interacting only with other Weyl fermions that lie within its\nenergy-momentum dispersion cone. In this sense, causal connections or\ninteractions are only possible within overlapping dispersion cones and each\ndispersion cone thus constitutes a solid-state analogue of the more\nconventional `event horizon' of high-energy physics. Our study provides a\nuniversal framework for considering interacting relativistic quasiparticles in\ncondensed matter by separating them into energy-like and momentum-like\nrelationships in analogy with the time-like and space-like events in\nhigh-energy physics. Finally, we consider two different candidate materials for\nhosting the Weyl CDW phase: (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and Mo$_3$Al$_2$C.

Under a\nsuitable decay condition on $V$ and the absence of embedded eigenvalues of $H$,\nwe first prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on\n$L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ for all $1<p<\\infty$: $$ \\|W_\\pm\nf\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R})}+\\|W_\\pm^* f\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R})}\\lesssim\n\\|f\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R})}. $$ This result is further extended to the weighted\n$L^p$-boundedness with the sharp $A_p$-bounds for general even $A_p$-weights\nand to the boundedness on the Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\\mathbb{R})$. For the\nlimiting case $p=1$, we also obtain several weak-type boundedness, including\n$W_\\pm\\in \\mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\\infty})\\cap \\mathbb B(\\mathcal{H}^1,L^1)$ and\n$W_\\pm^*\\in \\mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\\infty})\\cap \\mathbb B(L^\\infty, \\mathrm{BMO})$.\nThese results especially hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a\nresonance.

Thus,\na more cost-efficient and broadly accessible tool is desired to cover the\ntraditionally untested patients. In the past few years, deep-learning-based\nalgorithms have been proposed to predict MSI directly from haematoxylin and\neosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Such algorithms can be\nsummarized as (1) patch-level MSI/MSS prediction, and (2) patient-level\naggregation.

In order to shed some light on it, we study\nself-similar solutions to the 1D Burgers equation in detail, completing the\nmost general form of similarity profiles that it can possibly possess. In\nparticular, on top of the well-known source-type solution we identify a\nkink-type solution. It is represented by one of the confluent hypergeometric\nfunctions, viz. Kummer's function $M.$\n  For the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, on top of the celebrated Burgers vortex\nwe derive yet another solution to the associated Fokker-Planck equation. This\ncan be regarded as a 'conjugate' to the Burgers vortex, just like the kink-type\nsolution above. Some asymptotic properties of this kind of solution have been\nworked out. Implications for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations are suggested.\n  Second, we address an application of self-similar solutions to explore more\ngeneral kind of solutions.

To fight against the disease, a series of\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques are developed and applied to real-world\nscenarios such as safety monitoring, disease diagnosis, infection risk\nassessment, lesion segmentation of COVID-19 CT scans,etc. The coronavirus\nepidemics have forced people wear masks to counteract the transmission of\nvirus, which also brings difficulties to monitor large groups of people wearing\nmasks. In this paper, we primarily focus on the AI techniques of masked facial\ndetection and related datasets. We survey the recent advances, beginning with\nthe descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. Thirteen available\ndatasets are described and discussed in details. Then, the methods are roughly\ncategorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based\nmethods. Conventional methods are usually trained by boosting algorithms with\nhand-crafted features, which accounts for a small proportion. Neural\nnetwork-based methods are further classified as three parts according to the\nnumber of processing stages. Representative algorithms are described in detail,\ncoupled with some typical techniques that are described briefly. Finally, we\nsummarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the\nlimitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions. To\nour knowledge, this is the first survey about masked facial detection methods\nand datasets.

The information obtained by WoM has shown to be a dominant factor in\ncustomers' purchase decisions creating an endogenous demand structure. Service\nproviders can monitor how their service is perceived by consumers through\ndifferent methods, for example surveys. Although this requires an additional\neffort, the understanding and integration of endogenous demand into operational\ndecisions offer great benefits. In this paper, we study a service system where\ncustomers are sensitive to the on-demand access to the service. Customers form\na perception based on the information obtained by WoM communication and the\nadvertisement. Depending on the type of the service environment, service\ncapacity can be flexible or constant. We consider two types of service\nproviders: aware firm that has complete information on endogenous demand\nstructure, and na\\\"ive firm that has partial information. Our focus is to\nunderstand the optimal advertisement and capacity decisions, and the value of\ninformation on the underlying demand. For firms that have flexible service\ncapacity, we show that it is optimal to employ aggressive advertisement\nstrategies in the early stages. Myopic naive firms often misinterpret the\nmarket conditions and cease operating, where they could in fact realize profit.\nFor the cases where the capacity is not flexible, it may not be possible to\navoid negative WoM. Therefore, the service provider is forced to keep the level\nof advertisements more compatible with the actual quality of the service. This\nprevents the firm from overcrowding the system through advertisement without\nconsidering the service quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 03:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

We then discuss phenomenological impacts of the case with the additional\nscalar bosons with the mass near 1 TeV. Even when they are too heavy to be\ndirectly detected at current and future experiments at hadron colliders, the\nlarge deviation in the triple Higgs boson coupling can be a signature for\nfirst-order phase transition due to quantum effects of such heavy additional\nHiggs bosons. On the other hand, gravitational waves from the first-order phase\ntransition are found to be weaker in this case as compared to that with lower\nmasses of additional scalar bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 05:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 08:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2022 04:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Unfortunately, how long a program may run - or if it\nmay indeed stop at all - cannot be answered in the general case. This is why\nstate-of-the-art throughput estimation tools usually focus on a subset of\noperations and make several simplifying assumptions. Correctly identifying\nthese sets of constraints and regions of interest in the program typically\nrequires source code, specialized tools, and dedicated expert knowledge.\nWhenever a single instruction is modified, this process must be repeated,\nincurring high costs when iteratively developing timing sensitive code in\npractice.\n  In this paper, we present MCAD, a novel and lightweight timing analysis\nframework that can identify the effects of code changes on the\nmicroarchitectural level for binary programs. MCAD provides accurate\ndifferential throughput estimates by emulating whole program execution using\nQEMU and forwarding traces to LLVM for instruction-level analysis. This allows\ndevelopers to iterate quickly, with low overhead, using common tools:\nidentifying execution paths that are less sensitive to changes over\ntiming-critical paths only takes minutes within MCAD.

While in the non-Markovian regime, the accumulated\nphases become detuning-dependent, giving rise to non-Lorentzian lineshapes,\ncharacterized by multiple side peaks and total transmission points. Another\ninteresting phenomenon in the non-Markovian regime is generation of broad\nphotonic band gap by a single giant atom.

Each model focuses on the\ncorresponding single domain and aims to yield an expertized domain-specific\nsegmentation model.

Existing works only learn temporal patterns with\nthe help of single inter-variable dependencies. However, there are multi-scale\ntemporal patterns in many real-world MTS. Single inter-variable dependencies\nmake the model prefer to learn one type of prominent and shared temporal\npatterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network\n(MAGNN) to address the above issue. MAGNN exploits a multi-scale pyramid\nnetwork to preserve the underlying temporal dependencies at different time\nscales. Since the inter-variable dependencies may be different under distinct\ntime scales, an adaptive graph learning module is designed to infer the\nscale-specific inter-variable dependencies without pre-defined priors. Given\nthe multi-scale feature representations and scale-specific inter-variable\ndependencies, a multi-scale temporal graph neural network is introduced to\njointly model intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies.\nAfter that, we develop a scale-wise fusion module to effectively promote the\ncollaboration across different time scales, and automatically capture the\nimportance of contributed temporal patterns.

To reduce the reliance on labeled data, a new model called\nSnapshotNet is proposed as a self-supervised feature learning approach, which\ndirectly works on the unlabeled point cloud data of a complex 3D scene. The\nSnapshotNet pipeline includes three stages. In the snapshot capturing stage,\nsnapshots, which are defined as local collections of points, are sampled from\nthe point cloud scene. A snapshot could be a view of a local 3D scan directly\ncaptured from the real scene, or a virtual view of such from a large 3D point\ncloud dataset. Snapshots could also be sampled at different sampling rates or\nfields of view (FOVs), thus multi-FOV snapshots, to capture scale information\nfrom the scene. In the feature learning stage, a new pre-text task called\nmulti-FOV contrasting is proposed to recognize whether two snapshots are from\nthe same object or not, within the same FOV or across different FOVs. Snapshots\ngo through two self-supervised learning steps: the contrastive learning step\nwith both part and scale contrasting, followed by a snapshot clustering step to\nextract higher level semantic features. Then a weakly-supervised segmentation\nstage is implemented by first training a standard SVM classifier on the learned\nfeatures with a small fraction of labeled snapshots. The trained SVM is used to\npredict labels for input snapshots and predicted labels are converted into\npoint-wise label assignments for semantic segmentation of the entire scene\nusing a voting procedure. The experiments are conducted on the Semantic3D\ndataset and the results have shown that the proposed method is capable of\nlearning effective features from snapshots of complex scene data without any\nlabels.

This\npaper focuses on knowledge graph completion by predicting linkage between\nentities, which is a fundamental yet critical task. Semantic matching is a\npotential solution as it can deal with unseen entities, which the translational\ndistance based methods struggle with. However, to achieve competitive\nperformance as translational distance based methods, semantic matching based\nmethods require large-scale datasets for the training purpose, which are\ntypically unavailable in practical settings.

For convex models (e.g.\nlogistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in\nclosed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an\nattack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as\ninput the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target\ndata point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on image classifiers\ntrained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and systematically investigate which factors of\nstandard machine learning pipelines affect reconstruction success.

Another line of research uses a\njoint encoder to interact video with texts, but results in low efficiency since\neach text-video pair needs to be fed into the model. In this work, we enable\nfine-grained video-text interactions while maintaining high efficiency for\nretrieval via a novel pretext task, dubbed as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ),\nwhere a parametric module BridgeFormer is trained to answer the \"questions\"\nconstructed by the text features via resorting to the video features.\nSpecifically, we exploit the rich semantics of text (i.e., nouns and verbs) to\nbuild questions, with which the video encoder can be trained to capture more\nregional content and temporal dynamics. In the form of questions and answers,\nthe semantic associations between local video-text features can be properly\nestablished. BridgeFormer is able to be removed for downstream retrieval,\nrendering an efficient and flexible model with only two encoders.

Calculations that explore non-equilibrium properties by\nusing l as a constraint provide a thorough explanation for this behavior. We\nfind that at bulk two-phase coexistence, V (l) for both complete wetting and\npartial wetting is monotonic with exponential decay. Remarkably, at the\nfirst-order wetting phase transition, V(l) is independent of l. This anomaly\nexplains the infinite continuous degeneracy of the grand potential reported\nearlier. As a physical application, using V(l) we study the three-phase contact\nline where the interface meets the wall under a contact angle theta.

Contrary to what happens at a usual\nfirst-order wetting transition in systems with short-range forces, tau does not\napproach a nonzero positive constant for theta going to zero, but instead\napproaches zero (from below) as would be expected for a critical wetting\ntransition.

Here, we\nexamine whether new advances in the field of nulling interferometry, such as\nthe concept of kernel nulling, challenge this assumption.\n  Methods: We develop a tool designed to derive the photon-limited signal to\nnoise ratio of a large sample of simulated planets for different architecture\nconfigurations and beam combination schemes. We simulate four basic\nconfigurations: the double Bracewell/X-array, and kernel nullers with three,\nfour and five telescopes respectively.\n  Results: We find that a configuration of five telescopes in a pentagonal\nshape, using a five aperture kernel nulling scheme, outperforms the X-array\ndesign in both search (finding more planets) and characterisation (obtaining\nbetter signal, faster) when total collecting area is conserved. This is\nespecially the case when trying to detect Earth twins (temperate, rocky planets\nin the habitable zone), showing a 23% yield increase over the X-array. On\naverage, we find that a five telescope design receives 1.2 times the signal\nover the X-array design.\n  Conclusions: With the results of this simulation, we conclude that the Emma\nX-array configuration may not be the best architecture choice for the upcoming\nLIFE mission, and that a five telescope design utilising kernel nulling\nconcepts will likely provide better scientific return for the same collecting\narea, provided that technical solutions for the required achromatic phase\nshifts can be implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 11:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 02:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

It is clear that entanglement created due to the\nnonlinearity property has been arisen by some different methods. This study in\ncontrast uses a unique approach in which a cryogenic low noise amplifier is\ndesigned and using the transistor nonlinearity effect (third-order\nnonlinearity) entangled microwave photons are created. It is supposed that the\nlow noise amplifier contains two coupled oscillators resonating with different\nfrequencies. The mentioned oscillators are coupled to each other through the\ngate-drain capacitor and nonlinear transconductance as an important factor by\nwhich the entangled microwave photons are strongly manipulated.

The\ndynamic version of many graph problems are the key for a plethora of real-world\nproblems in transportation, telecommunication, and social networks. In recent\nyears, using deep learning techniques to find heuristic solutions for NP-hard\ngraph combinatorial problems has gained much interest as these learned\nheuristics can find near-optimal solutions efficiently. However, most of the\nexisting methods for learning heuristics focus on static graph problems. The\ndynamic nature makes NP-hard graph problems much more challenging to learn, and\nthe existing methods fail to find reasonable solutions.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Graph Temporal Attention\nwith Reinforcement Learning (GTA-RL) to learn heuristic solutions for\ngraph-based dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. The GTA-RL\narchitecture consists of an encoder capable of embedding temporal features of a\ncombinatorial problem instance and a decoder capable of dynamically focusing on\nthe embedded features to find a solution to a given combinatorial problem\ninstance. We then extend our architecture to learn heuristics for the real-time\nversion of combinatorial optimization problems where all input features of a\nproblem are not known a prior, but rather learned in real-time. Our\nexperimental results against several state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms\nand optimal solvers demonstrate that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art learning-based approaches in terms of effectiveness and\noptimal solvers in terms of efficiency on dynamic and real-time graph\ncombinatorial optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 11:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

A\ntypical approach to obtaining alternative SR results is to train multiple SR\nmodels with different loss weightings and exploit the combination of these\nmodels. Instead of using multiple models, we present a more efficient method to\ntrain a single adjustable SR model on various combinations of losses by taking\nadvantage of multi-task learning. Specifically, we optimize an SR model with a\nconditional objective during training, where the objective is a weighted sum of\nmultiple perceptual losses at different feature levels. The weights vary\naccording to given conditions, and the set of weights is defined as a style\ncontroller. Also, we present an architecture appropriate for this training\nscheme, which is the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block equipped with spatial\nfeature transformation layers.

For a high\nReynolds number, it is reported that the development of 3D single-mode RTI\nwould undergo four different stages: linear growth stage, saturated velocity\ngrowth stage, reacceleration stage and turbulent mixing stage. A series of\ncomplex interfacial structures with large topological changes can be observed\nat the turbulent mixing stage, which always preserve the symmetries with\nrespect to the middle axis at a low Atwood number, and the lines of symmetry\nwithin spike and bubble are broken as the Atwood number is increased. Five\nstatistical methods for computing the spike and bubble growth rates are then\nanalyzed to reveal the growth law of 3D single-mode RTI in turbulent mixing\nstage. It is found that the spike late-time growth rate shows an overall\nincrease with the Atwood number, while the bubble growth rate seems to be\nindependence of the Atwood number, approaching a constant of around 0.1. When\nthe Reynolds number decreases, the later stages cannot be reached gradually and\nthe evolution of phase interface presents a laminar flow state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 12:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Selection bias is one of the most important issues\nof the existing observational data based approaches, which is actually caused\nby multiple types of unobserved exposure strategies (e.g. promotions and\nholiday effects). Though various methods have been proposed to address this\nproblem, they are mainly relying on the implicit debiasing techniques but not\nexplicitly modeling the unobserved exposure strategies. By explicitly\nReconstructing Exposure STrategies (REST in short), we formalize the\nrecommendation problem as the counterfactual reasoning and propose the debiased\nsocial recommendation method. In REST, we assume that the exposure of an item\nis controlled by the latent exposure strategies, the user, and the item. Based\non the above generation process, we first provide the theoretical guarantee of\nour method via identification analysis.

The goal of this study is to investigate the small-scale magnetic\nfields of the two spectroscopic binary T Tauri stars V1878 Ori and V4046 Sgr.\nThis is done to complete the observational characterisation of the surface\nmagnetic fields of these stars because only their large-scale magnetic fields\nhave been studied with Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) so far. Methods. To\ninvestigate the small-scale magnetic fields, the differential Zeeman\nintensification of near-infrared Ti I lines was investigated using\nhigh-resolution archival spectra obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph at the\nCFHT. In order to study the binary components separately, the spectra were\ndisentangled by considering observations taken at different orbital phases. The\nZeeman-intensification analysis was performed based on detailed polarised\nradiative transfer calculations aided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo\ninference, treating magnetic field filling factors and other stellar parameters\nthat could affect the spectra as free parameters. Results. The obtained average\nmagnetic field strengths of the components of V1878 Ori are 1.33 and 1.57 kG,\nrespectively. Previous ZDI studies of V1878 Ori recovered about 14 and 20% of\nthis magnetic field strength. For V4046 Sgr, the magnetic field strengths are\n1.96 and 1.83 kG, respectively. In this case, about 12 and 9% of the total\nmagnetic field strength was detected by ZDI. Conclusions. The small-scale\nmagnetic field strengths obtained from Zeeman intensification are similar for\nthe two components of each binary. This is in contrast to the large-scale\nmagnetic fields obtained from ZDI investigations, performed using the same\nobservations. While the large-scale field might look significantly different.\nThis indicates that the efficiency of the magnetic dynamo is comparable for the\ncomponents of the two binaries, because most energy is carreid by the small\nscale fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 13:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

In this\npaper we present SmartCitizen app, a MSN application designed in the framework\nof a smart city project to stimulate the active participation of citizens in\ngenerating and sharing useful contents related to the quality of life in their\ncity. The app has been developed on top of a context- and social-aware\nmiddleware platform (CAMEO) able to integrate the main features of\npeople-centric computing paradigms, lightening the app developer effort.\nExisting middleware platforms generally focus on one single people-centric\nparadigm, exporting a limited set of features to mobile applications. CAMEO\novercomes these limitations. Experimental results shown in this paper can also\nrepresent the technical guidelines for the development of heterogeneous\npeople-centric mobile applications, embracing different application domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

In the term\n\"memory-efficient\" SSE, we encompass both the goals of local SSE, and\npage-efficient SSE. The centerpiece of our approach is a novel connection\nbetween those two goals. We introduce a map, called the Generic Local\nTransform, which takes as input a page-efficient SSE scheme with certain\nspecial features, and outputs an SSE scheme with strong locality properties. We\nobtain several results.\n  (1) First, for page-efficient SSE, we build a dynamic scheme with page\nefficiency $O(\\log \\log N)$ and storage efficiency $O(1)$, called LayeredSSE.\nThe main technical innovation behind LayeredSSE is a new weighted extension of\nthe two-choice allocation process, of independent interest.\n  (2) Second, we introduce the Generic Local Transform, and combine it with\nLayeredSSE to build a dynamic SSE scheme with storage efficiency $O(1)$,\nlocality $O(1)$, and read efficiency $O(\\log\\log N)$, under the condition that\nthe longest list is of size $O(N^{1-1/\\log \\log \\lambda})$.

Monitoring the\nunderwater environments and their inhabitants is of fundamental importance to\nunderstand the evolution of these systems and implement safeguard policies.\nHowever, assessing and tracking biodiversity is often a complex task,\nespecially in large and uncontrolled environments, such as the oceans. One of\nthe most popular and effective methods for monitoring marine biodiversity is\npassive acoustics monitoring (PAM), which employs hydrophones to capture\nunderwater sound. Many aquatic animals produce sounds characteristic of their\nown species; these signals travel efficiently underwater and can be detected\neven at great distances. Furthermore, modern technologies are becoming more and\nmore convenient and precise, allowing for very accurate and careful data\nacquisition. To date, audio captured with PAM devices is frequently manually\nprocessed by marine biologists and interpreted with traditional signal\nprocessing techniques for the detection of animal vocalizations. This is a\nchallenging task, as PAM recordings are often over long periods of time.\nMoreover, one of the causes of biodiversity loss is sound pollution; in data\nobtained from regions with loud anthropic noise, it is hard to separate the\nartificial from the fish sound manually. Nowadays, machine learning and, in\nparticular, deep learning represents the state of the art for processing audio\nsignals. Specifically, sound separation networks are able to identify and\nseparate human voices and musical instruments.

Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the\npotential to significantly reduce FLOPs and computational resources. In this\nwork, we propose a new automatic pruning method - Sparse Connectivity Learning\n(SCL). Specifically, a weight is re-parameterized as an element-wise\nmultiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network\nconnectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a\nunit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a\nstraight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that\nthe proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables\nconverge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs\ncan satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for\ndiscrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are\nvery unbalanced, hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature\nto optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse\nmasks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization\nterm in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or\nhyper-parameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is\nexplored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity\nfor the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic\npruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically\nlearn and select important network connections for various baseline network\nstructures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the SOTA\nhuman-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs\nreduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Although\ninner-product operations consist of simple kernel evaluations, their vast\nnumber poses a challenge in ultra-low latency (ULL) applications, because the\ntime needed for computing the inner products might exceed the sub-millisecond\nlatency requirement. To address this problem, this study demonstrates the\nacceleration of the inner-product operations through massive parallelization.\nThe result is a GPU-accelerated real-time OFDM receiver that enables\nsub-millisecond latency detection to meet the requirements of 5th generation\n(5G) and beyond ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) systems.\nMoreover, the parallelization and acceleration techniques explored and\ndemonstrated in this study can be extended to many other signal processing\nalgorithms in Hilbert spaces, such as those based on projection onto convex\nsets (POCS) and adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM) algorithms.\nExperimental results and comparisons with the state-of-art confirm the\neffectiveness of our techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 09:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 22:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

Understanding the mixed\nalkali effect (MAE) in oxide glasses is of fundamental importance for tailoring\nthe glass compositions to control the mobility of ions and, therefore, the\nglass properties that depend on it, such as ion release, glass transition\ntemperature, and ionic conductivity. However, most of the previously designed\nbioactive glasses were based on trial-and-error, which is due to the complex\nglass structure that is non-trivial to analyze and, thus, the lack of a clear\npicture of the glass structure at short- and medium-range order. Accordingly,\nwe use molecular dynamics simulations to study whether using the MAE can\ncontrol the bioactivity and properties of 45S5 glass and its structural\norigins. We showed that the network connectivity, a structural parameter often\nused to access the bioactivity of silicate glasses, does not change with Na\nsubstitution with Li or K. On the contrary, the elastic moduli showed a strong\ndependence on the type of the modifier, as they increased with increasing mean\nfield strength. Similarly, the mobility of the glass elements was significantly\naffected by the type of modifier used to substitute Na. The change of the\nproperties is further discussed and explained using changes at the short- and\nmedium-range structure by giving evidence of previous experimental findings.\nFinally, we highlight the origin of the non-existence of the MAE, the effect of\nthe modifier on the bioactivity of the glasses, the importance of dynamical\ndescriptors in predicting the bioactivity of oxide glasses, and we provide the\nnecessary insights, at the atomic scale, needed for further development of\nbioactive glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

The\nproliferation of wind turbines in combination with large damage from upward\nlightning necessitates an improved understanding under which conditions the\nself-initiated and the undetected subtype of upward lightning occur. To find\nlarger-scale meteorological conditions favorable for self-initiated and\nundetectable upward lightning, this study uses a random forest machine learning\nmodel. It combines direct measurements at the specially instrumented tower at\nGaisberg mountain in Austria with explanatory variables from larger-scale\natmospheric reanalysis data (ERA5).

As algorithms for problem solving, we consider decision trees of five\ntypes: (i) using membership queries, (ii) using equivalence queries, (iii)\nusing both membership and equivalence queries, (iv) using proper equivalence\nqueries, and (v) using both membership and proper equivalence queries. As time\ncomplexity, we study the depth of decision trees. In the worst case, with the\ngrowth of the number of elements in the problem description, the minimum depth\nof decision trees of the first type either grows as a logarithm or linearly,\nand the minimum depth of decision trees of each of the other types either is\nbounded from above by a constant or grows as a logarithm, or linearly.
