The introduction of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging\nhas significantly reduced the chances of cardiac aliasing. However, the\nnecessity of covering the entire brain at high spatial resolution restrain the\nshortest TR to just over 0.5 seconds, which is in turn not sufficiently short\nto resolve cardiac pulsation beyond 60 beats per minute. Recently,\nhyper-sampling of the fMRI time-series has been introduced to overcome this\nissue. While each anatomical location is sampled every TR seconds, the time\nbetween consecutive excitations is shorter and thus adequate to resolve cardiac\npulsation. In this study, we show that it is feasible to temporally and\nspatially resolve cardiac waveforms at each voxel location by combining a\ndedicated hyper-sampling decomposition scheme with SMS. We developed the\ntechnique on 774 healthy subjects selected from the Human Connectome Project\n(HCP) and validated the technology against the RETROICOR method. The proposed\napproach, which we name Data-driven WHOle-brain CArdiac signal REgression from\nhighly accelerated simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI acquisitions (WHOCARES), is\nfully data-driven, does not make specific assumptions on cardiac pulsatility,\nand is independent from external physiological recordings so that the\nretrospective correction of fMRI data becomes possible when such measurements\nare not available.

We utilized high-resolution\nlocation-based datasets in implementing spatial network analysis and dynamic\nclustering techniques to uncover the overall disparate access to grocery stores\nfor socially vulnerable populations during different phases of the disaster.\nThree access indicators are examined using network-centric measures: number of\nunique stores visited, average trip time to stores, and average distance to\nstores.

We propose theoretically tractable Markovian\ntemporal network models in which each edge flips between the active and\ninactive states in continuous time. The different models have different amounts\nof concurrency while we can tune the models to share the same statistics of\nedge activation and deactivation (and hence the fraction of time for which each\nedge is active) and the structure of the aggregate (i.e., static) network. We\nanalytically calculate the amount of concurrency of edges sharing a node for\neach model. We then numerically study effects of concurrency on epidemic\nspreading in the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) dynamics on\nthe proposed temporal network models. We find that the concurrency enhances\nepidemic spreading near the epidemic threshold while this effect is small in\nsome cases. When the infection rate is substantially larger than the epidemic\nthreshold, the concurrency suppresses epidemic spreading. In sum, our numerical\nsimulations indicate that the impact of concurrency on epidemic spreading is\nmodest.

Using a process-tracing paradigm that externalises human planning,\nwe find that people quickly adapt how much planning they perform to the cost\nand benefit of planning. To discover the underlying metacognitive learning\nmechanisms we augmented a set of reinforcement learning models with\nmetacognitive features and performed Bayesian model selection.

FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face\nimage of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image,\ni.e., frontal pose, homogeneous background, etc. The quality estimation is\nbuilt as the similarity between the original and the restored images, since low\nquality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare three\ndifferent numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the\nrestored images, b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of\nthe GAN. The results demonstrate that FaceQgen's quality measures are good\nestimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments include a comparison\nwith other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general\nimages, in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison\nshows that, even though FaceQgen does not surpass the best existing face\nquality assessment methods in terms of face recognition accuracy prediction, it\nachieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised\nlearning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data-driven learning\nbased on a single high quality image per subject), having the capacity to\nimprove its performance in the future with adequate refinement of the model and\nthe significant advantage over competing methods of not needing quality labels\nfor its development.

Central to the proposed framework is\nthe ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming\nelectronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based\non the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly\ninclude the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML\nenergy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration\ninto invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A\ngeneral theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and\ntwo types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of\nan internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to\nthe descriptor of the classical fields are presented.

In his published paper of November 18, 1915, Einstein presented a\nsolution to the problem of the perihelion motion of Mercury and obtained the\ncorrect result of 43 seconds of arc per century. Before 1915, Einstein had\nestablished non-covariant field equations (the Entwurf field equations). But in\n1915, he changed his mind and dropped these equations and was led to general\ncovariance. In a manuscript written in 1913, Einstein and his best friend\nMichele Besso tried to solve the Entwurf field equations to attain the\nperihelion advance of Mercury. The end result arrived at by Einstein was 1821\nseconds of arc per century. To make a long story short, the field of a static\nSun produced an advance of the perihelion of Mercury of 18 seconds of arc per\ncentury. Einstein kept quiet about this result and continued to work on the\nEntwurf theory. Janssen and Renn ask: If we follow the prescriptions of Karl\nPopper, why did Einstein not accept that his Entwurf theory had been falsified?\nThey further ask: Given the undeniable importance of Besso's earlier\ncalculations, why did Einstein not invite Besso as a co-author of his November\n1915 paper on the perihelion motion of Mercury? Besso did not even get an\nacknowledgment in Einstein's paper. After a brief review of Einstein's and\nBesso's early attempts at calculating the advance of the perihelion of Mercury,\nI discuss falsification and confirmation by previously known evidence and then\npropose an answer to the above two questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 18:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

The paper presents some key techniques that make\nlock-free locks practical and more general.

The idea is based on using a shared log among processes running\nthe same protected code. Importantly, the approach can be library based,\nrequiring very little if any change to standard code -- code just needs to use\nthe idempotent versions of memory operations (load, store, LL/SC, allocation,\nfree).\n  We have implemented a C++ library called Flock based on the ideas.

However, cumulative exposure is\nphototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet\nfluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well\nsuited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are\ncomputationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this\nchallenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed\nto achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial\ndirection (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,\nacquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive\nsensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage.

To demonstrate our\ntechnique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish\nembryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a\nconfocal microscope.

Inferring the albedo map of\na planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps\nmay yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by\nchanging clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated\nphotometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free\nsurface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a\nBayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a\nplanet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on\nsynthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth.\nWe find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to\nreconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to\nmake assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible\nphotometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location\nis a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the\nEarth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach\nremoves only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the\nfull-phase geometry of observations combined with the short correlation length\nfor Earth clouds. For exoplanets with Earth-like climatology, it may be hard to\ndo much better than a cloud-averaged map. We surmise that cloud removal will be\nmost successful for exoplanets imaged near quarter phase that harbour large\ncloud systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The excitation properties\nassociated to the M1/GT symmetry need to be clarified within consistent\ntheoretical approach. In this work, the relationship between the M1 and GT\ntransitions in Ca isotopes is investigated in a unified framework based on the\nrelativistic energy-density functional (REDF) with point-coupling interactions,\nusing the relativistic quasi-particle random-phase approximation (RQRPA). It is\nshown that the isovector-pseudovector (IV-PV) residual interaction affects both\ntransitions, and the symmetry of M1 and giant-GT transitions is disrupted by\nthis interaction in closed-shell nuclei. In open-shell Ca isotopes, the\nproton-neutron pairing in the residual RQRPA interaction also plays a role in\nGT transitions. Due to the interplay between these interactions, the M1/GT\nsymmetry can be restored especially in the $^{42}$Ca nucleus, i.e., the\ngiant-GT strength can become comparable to that of the M1 mode in terms of the\nunified spin-isospin transitions by adjusting the PN-pairing strength to\nreproduce the experimental low-lying GT-excitation energies. The mirror\nsymmetry of both M1 and GT transitions is also demonstrated for open-shell\nmirror partners, $^{42}$Ca and $^{42}$Ti.

Scaling arguments suggest that the\nleading order torque averaged over cylindrical surfaces should arise from the\nLorentz force. Decadal fluctuations in the magnetic field inside the core,\ndriven by convective flows, could then force decadal changes in the Lorentz\ntorque and generate zonal accelerations.

Depending on the final structure and composition, the\noutcome can range from a thermonuclear explosion, to the formation of a neutron\nstar in an electron-capture supernova (ECSN). It has been recently demonstrated\nthat stars in this mass range may initiate explosive oxygen burning when their\ncentral densities are still below $\\rho_{\\rm c} \\lesssim 10^{9.6}$ g cm$^{-3}$.\nThis makes them interesting candidates for type Ia supernovae -- which we call\n(C)ONe SNe Ia -- and might have broader implications for the formation of\nneutron stars via ECSNe. Here, we model the evolution of 252 helium stars with\ninitial masses in the $0.8-3.5$ M$_\\odot$ range, and metallicities between\n$Z=10^{-4}$ and $0.02$. We use these models to constrain the central densities,\ncompositions and envelope masses at the time of explosive oxygen ignition. We\nfurther investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass loss rate\nassumptions using additional models with varying wind efficiencies. We find\nthat helium stars with masses between $\\sim$1.8 and 2.7 M$_\\odot$ evolve onto\n$1.35-1.37$ M$_\\odot$ (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central\ndensities between $\\rm \\log_{10}(\\rho_c)\\sim 9.3$ and 9.6. We constrain the\namount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning, and conclude that\nit plays a critical role in determining the final outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass\ndegenerate cores that retain more than $\\sim 0.005$ M$_\\odot$ of carbon result\nin (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass become ECSNe. We find that\n(C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low\nmetallicities ECSNe dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 20:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 10:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

One of the eventual goals of this approach is to derive results in\ncomputational complexity theory by studying appropriate topological objects\nwhich characterize them. The link which relates these two seemingly separated\nfields is logic, more precisely a subdomain of finite model theory known as\nlogic on words. It allows for a description of complexity classes as certain\nfamilies of languages, possibly non-regular, on a finite alphabet. Very few is\nknown about the duality theory relative to fragments of first-order logic on\nwords which lie outside of the scope of regular languages.

We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is\napproximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and\nthe neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research\ncompares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear\ncombination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the\nsolution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when\napproximating smooth physical fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 23:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

The Josephson junction consists of two \"magnetic\" superconductors\nS$_{m}$ (superconducting film covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer), spin\nfilters Fl and a ferromagnetic layer F with or without DW (DWs). The spin\nfilters Fl allow electrons to pass with one specific spin orientation, such\nthat the Josephson coupling is governed by a fully polarized long-range triplet\ncomponent. In the absence of DW(s), the Josephson and spin currents are nonzero\nwhen the right and left filters, Fl$_{r,l}$, pass electrons with equal spin\norientation and differ only by a temperature-independent factor. They become\nzero when the \\textbf{spins} of the triplet Cooper pairs passing through the\nFl$_{r,l}$ have opposite directions. Furthermore, for the different chiralities\nof the injected triplet Cooper pairs the spontaneous currents arise in the\njunction yielding a diode effect. Once a DW is introduced, it reduces the\ncritical Josephson current $I_{c}$ in the case of equal spin polarization and\nmakes it finite in the case of opposite spin orientation. The critical current\n$I_{c}$ is maximal when the DW is in the center of the F film. A deviation of\nthe DW from the center generates a force that pushes the DW to the center of\nthe F film.

However, despite\nbeing more resourceful than UEs, allocating ENs' resources to a given favorable\nset of users (e.g., closer to ENs) may block other UEs from their services.\nThis is often the case for most existing approaches that only aim to maximize\nthe network social welfare or minimize the total energy consumption but do not\nconsider the computing/battery status of each UE. This work develops an\nenergy-based proportional-fair framework to serve all users with multiple tasks\nwhile considering both their service requirements and energy/battery levels in\na multi-layer edge network. The resulting problem for offloading tasks and\nallocating resources toward the tasks is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming,\nwhich is NP-hard. To tackle it, we leverage the fact that the relaxed problem\nis convex and propose a distributed algorithm, namely the dynamic\nbranch-and-bound Benders decomposition (DBBD). DBBD decomposes the original\nproblem into a master problem (MP) for the offloading decisions and multiple\nsubproblems (SPs) for resource allocation. To quickly eliminate inefficient\noffloading solutions, MP is integrated with powerful Benders cuts exploiting\nthe ENs' resource constraints. We then develop a dynamic branch-and-bound\nalgorithm (DBB) to efficiently solve MP considering the load balance among ENs.\nSPs can either be solved for their closed-form solutions or be solved in\nparallel at ENs, thus reducing the complexity. The numerical results show that\nDBBD returns the optimal solution in maximizing the proportional fairness among\nUEs.

We\nformulate and solve equations of the density distributions in $\\nu$-clusters.\nIn the non-relativistic case, they are reduced to the Lane-Emden equation. We\nfind that (i) stable configurations exist for any number of neutrinos, $N$;\n(ii) there is a maximal central density $\\sim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ determined by the\nneutrino mass; (iii) for a given $m_\\phi$ there is a minimal value of $Ny^3$\nfor which stable configurations can be formed; (iv) for a given strength of\ninteraction, $S_\\phi = (ym_\\nu/m_\\phi)^2$, the minimal radius of $\\nu$-clusters\nexists. We discuss the formation of $\\nu$-clusters from relic neutrino\nbackground in the process of expansion and cooling of the Universe. One\npossibility realized for $S_\\phi > 700$ is the development of instabilities in\nthe $\\nu$-background at $T < m_\\nu$ which leads to its fragmentation. For\nallowed values of $y$, cooling of $\\nu$-clusters due to $\\phi$-bremsstrahlung\nand neutrino annihilation is negligible. The sizes of $\\nu$-clusters may range\nfrom $\\sim$ km to $\\sim 5$ Mpc.

To overcome these difficulties and\nstudy the uncertainties of the adsorption-isotherm parameters, in this work,\nbased on the Bayesian sampling framework, we propose a statistical approach for\nestimating the adsorption isotherms in various chromatography systems.

In\ninformation management field, a large number of texts containing personal\ninformation are produced by users every day. As the model training on\ninformation from users is likely to invade personal privacy, many methods have\nbeen proposed to block the learning and memorizing of the sensitive data in raw\ntexts. In this paper, we try to do this more linguistically via distorting the\ntext while preserving the semantics. In practice, we leverage a recently our\nproposed metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence, to evaluate the semantic\npreservation during the distortion. Based on the metric, we propose two\nframeworks for semantics-preserved distortion, a generative one and a\nsubstitutive one. We conduct experiments on named entity recognition,\nconstituency parsing, and machine reading comprehension tasks. Results from our\nexperiments show the plausibility and efficiency of our distortion as a method\nfor personal privacy protection.

With the utilization of\nblockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can\nbe efficiently solved.

Recent\nprogress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear\ninteraction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data\nencourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information,\nwhich is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature\naggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation,\neither by the concatenation or using a linear layer.

Most\nexisting approaches focus on single-domain fake news detection (SFND), which\nleads to unsatisfying performance when these methods are applied to\nmulti-domain fake news detection. As an emerging field, multi-domain fake news\ndetection (MFND) is increasingly attracting attention. However, data\ndistributions, such as word frequency and propagation patterns, vary from\ndomain to domain, namely domain shift. Facing the challenge of serious domain\nshift, existing fake news detection techniques perform poorly for multi-domain\nscenarios. Therefore, it is demanding to design a specialized model for MFND.\nIn this paper, we first design a benchmark of fake news dataset for MFND with\ndomain label annotated, namely Weibo21, which consists of 4,488 fake news and\n4,640 real news from 9 different domains. We further propose an effective\nMulti-domain Fake News Detection Model (MDFEND) by utilizing a domain gate to\naggregate multiple representations extracted by a mixture of experts.

We present a detailed observational study of QRS121102 and its host\ngalaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its\nflux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the\nK-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic\nrefractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at\nthe host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the\nscintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the\npossibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated\nthe mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with\nQRS121102 from the width of the H\\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution\noptical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity\ndispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the\nSMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity\nconstraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN.

Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this\nsequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the\nexploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient.

A very interesting idea\nthen is to consider scalar field dark energy models in quantum gravitationally\ncorrected cosmologies with the RS-II Braneworld being one of the most well\nknown in this regard. So in this work, we consider RS-II Braneworld based\nscalar field dark energy models and try to look out for the existence of finite\ntime singularities in these regimes both through a dynamical system\nperspective, for which we employ the Goriely-Hyde singularity analysis method,\nand a physical perspective. Our approach is general in the sense that it is not\nlimited to any particular class of potentials or for any constrained parameter\nregion for the brane tension and is valid for both Quintessence and phantom\ndark energy regimes. We firstly show through Goriely-Hyde procedure that finite\ntime singularities can exist in these models for a limited set of initial\nconditions and that this result would hold irrespective of any consideration\ngiven to the swampland dS conjecture. We then discuss the physical nature of\nthe singularities that can occur in this regime, where we use a well motivated\nansatz for the Hubble parameter and show that these models of dark energy can\nallow for weak singularities like those of Type III and Type IV and can also\nallow for strong singularities like the Big Rip (Type I).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 07:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 16:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

A fast\ncalculation method for tie-line security regions in high dimension is studied\nin this paper. The high-dimension polytope across all the time periods is\ndecomposed as a Cartesian production of lower-dimension polytopes at each time\nperiod by leveraging dispatch levels of generations. For each lower-dimension\npolytope, the computational burden brought by multiple border buses is\nalleviated by aggregating tie-line power.

For example, in the automotive industry, car makers decrease the\nselling prices of fuel-inefficient cars when the oil price rises. Meanwhile,\nthe firm can implement a risk-hedging strategy using the financial asset\njointly with its operational decisions. Motivated by this, we develop and solve\na general model that integrates financial risk hedging into a price-setting\nnewsvendor. The optimal hedging strategy is calculated analytically, which\nleads to an explicit objective function for optimizing pricing and service\nlevels. We find that, in general, the presence of hedging reduces the optimal\nprice. It also reduces the optimal service level when the asset price trend\npositively impacts product demand (``asset price benefits demand''); meanwhile,\nit may increase the optimal service level by a small margin when the impact is\nnegative (``asset price hurts demand'').

An\ninterval-valued generalized orthogonal fuzzy group decision-making method is\nproposed based on the Yager operator and CRITIC-WASPAS method with unknown\nweights. The method integrates Yager operator, CRITIC, WASPAS, and interval\nvalue generalized orthogonal fuzzy group. Its merits lie in allowing\ndecision-makers greater freedom, avoiding bias due to decision-makers' weight,\nand yielding accurate evaluation. The research includes: expanding the interval\nvalue generalized distance measurement method for comparison and application of\nsimilarity measurement and decision-making methods; developing a new scoring\nfunction for comparing the size of interval value generalized orthogonal fuzzy\nnumbers,and further existing researches. The proposed interval-valued Yager\nweighted average operator (IVq-ROFYWA) and Yager weighted geometric average\noperator (IVq-ROFYWG) are used for information aggregation. The CRITIC-WASPAS\ncombines the advantages of CRITIC and WASPAS, which not only work in the single\ndecision but also serve as the basis of the group decision. The in-depth study\nof the decision-maker's weight matrix overcomes the shortcomings of taking the\ndecision as a whole, and weighs the decision-maker's information aggregation.\nFinally, the group decision algorithm is used for hypertension risk management.\nThe results are consistent with decision-makers' opinions. Practice and case\nanalysis have proved the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. At\nthe same time, it is compared with other operators and decision-making methods,\nwhich proves the method effective and feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 08:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

As a bio-inspired vision sensor with\nhigh temporal resolution, it has a huge potential for computer vision. However,\nthe sampling model in current Spike camera is so susceptible to quantization\nand noise that it cannot capture the texture details of objects effectively. In\nthis work, a robust visual sampling model inspired by receptive field (RVSM) is\nproposed where wavelet filter generated by difference of Gaussian (DoG) and\nGaussian filter are used to simulate receptive field. Using corresponding\nmethod similar to inverse wavelet transform, spike data from RVSM can be\nconverted into images. To test the performance, we also propose a high-speed\nmotion spike dataset (HMD) including a variety of motion scenes. By comparing\nreconstructed images in HMD, we find RVSM can improve the ability of capturing\ninformation of Spike camera greatly. More importantly, due to mimicking\nreceptive field mechanism to collect regional information, RVSM can filter high\nintensity noise effectively and improves the problem that Spike camera is\nsensitive to noise largely. Besides, due to the strong generalization of\nsampling structure, RVSM is also suitable for other neuromorphic vision sensor.\nAbove experiments are finished in a Spike camera simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 08:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Energy spectra of GCRs measured\nduring different epochs of solar activity provide crucial information for a\nthorough understanding of solar and heliospheric phenomena.

It was found that wetting properties of such\nstructured surfaces depend on temperature and thermal treatment history -\nlamellae are wetted easier at elevated temperature or after cooling to room\ntemperature when the polymer is soft because of the easier deformability of\nlamellae. The shape of lamellae deformed by droplets can be temporarily fixed\nat low temperature and remains fixed upon heating to room temperature. Heating\nabove the transition temperature of the shape-memory polymer restores the\norginal shape. The high aspect ratio allows tuning of geometry not only\nmanually, as it is done in most works reported previously, but can also be made\nby a liquid droplet and is controlled by temperature. The liquid in combination\nwith thermoresponsive topography present a new kind of wetting behavior.\nMoreover, the mechanical properties can be controlled - the polymer can either\nbe hard or soft at room temperature depending on thermal pre-history.

In this paper, we create a mismatch between the two wakes by\nintroducing a size difference in the cylinder pair, such that the effects of\none wake on the other can be distinguished. Depending on the size and gap\nratios between the two cylinders, the coupled wake exhibits distinct dynamical\nfeatures including the quasi-periodic flow, synchronized flow, and chaotic\nflow. Through advanced spectral analysis of lift coefficients and dynamic mode\ndecomposition of the flow fields, we reveal that the quasi-periodic flows are\nmainly composed of two primary frequencies associated with vortex shedding in\nthe near wakes of the two cylinders. Both wakes impose their own frequencies on\nthe other, resulting in the beating phenomenon in the lift coefficients. The\ntriad interactions between the two wakes generate the sideband frequencies,\nwhich are associated with modal structures that are mostly active in the far\nwake. The transition from quasi-periodicity to synchronization is dominated by\nthe vortex shedding behind the larger cylinder, to which the wake of the\nsmaller cylinder locks in.

It is also known as kriging and is the Bayesian counterpart to the\nfrequentist kernel ridge regression. Most of the theoretical work on GP\nregression has focused on a large-$n$ asymptotics, characterising the behaviour\nof GP regression as the amount of data increases. Fixed-sample analysis is much\nmore difficult outside of simple cases, such as locations on a regular grid. In\nthis work we perform a fixed-sample analysis that was first studied in the\ncontext of approximation theory by Driscoll & Fornberg (2002), called the \"flat\nlimit\". In flat-limit asymptotics, the goal is to characterise kernel methods\nas the length-scale of the kernel function tends to infinity, so that kernels\nappear flat over the range of the data. Surprisingly, this limit is\nwell-defined, and displays interesting behaviour: Driscoll & Fornberg showed\nthat radial basis interpolation converges in the flat limit to polynomial\ninterpolation, if the kernel is Gaussian. Leveraging recent results on the\nspectral behaviour of kernel matrices in the flat limit, we study the flat\nlimit of Gaussian process regression. Results show that Gaussian process\nregression tends in the flat limit to (multivariate) polynomial regression, or\n(polyharmonic) spline regression, depending on the kernel. Importantly, this\nholds for both the predictive mean and the predictive variance, so that the\nposterior predictive distributions become equivalent. Our results have\npractical consequences: for instance, they show that optimal GP predictions in\nthe sense of leave-one-out loss may occur at very large length-scales, which\nwould be invisible to current implementations because of numerical\ndifficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 10:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 07:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Furthermore, we\nreveal that each individual transformation is not capable of detecting\nadversarial examples in a robust way, and propose a DNN-based approach referred\nto as \\emph{AdvJudge}, which combines scores of 9 image transformations.\nWithout knowing which individual scores are misleading or not misleading,\nAdvJudge can make the right judgment, and achieve a significant improvement in\ndetection rate. Finally, we utilize an explainable AI tool to show the\ncontribution of each image transformation to adversarial detection.\nExperimental results show that the contribution of image transformations to\nadversarial detection is significantly different, the combination of them can\nsignificantly improve the generic detection ability against state-of-the-art\nadversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 10:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 05:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 15:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

Recently, vision\ntransformer is introduced into the field of re-identification and achieves the\nmost advanced results by constructing the relationship of global features\nbetween patch sequences. However, the performance of vision transformer in\nextracting local features is inferior to that of convolutional neural network.\nTherefore, we design a partial feature transformer-based person\nre-identification framework named PFT.

The fluid film is modelled as a\nquasi-2D flow problem on the interface between the solids governed by the\naveraged Reynolds equation. The averaged Reynolds equation accounts for surface\nroughness utilizing spatially homogenized, effective fluid parameters and for\ncavitation through a positivity constraint imposed on the pressure field. In\ncontrast to existing approaches, the proposed model accounts for the\nco-existence of frictional contact tractions and hydrodynamic fluid tractions\nat every local point on the contact surface of the interacting bodies and\ncovers the entire range from boundary lubrication to mixed, elastohydrodynamic,\nand eventually to full film hydrodynamic lubrication in one unified modelling\nframework with smooth transition between these different regimes.

The time-frequency distribution of the\nsignal power can be estimated with Gabor atoms, or wavelets, localized in time\nand frequency by a window function. Such analysis is limited by the\nHeisenberg-Gabor uncertainty, which does not allow a high-resolution\nlocalization of power with individual wavelets simultaneously in time and\nfrequency. As a result, the temporal and spectral leakage affects the\ntime-frequency distribution, limiting the identification of sharp features in\nthe power spectrum. This paper presents a time-frequency regression method\nwhere instead of a single window, a stack of wavelets with different windows\nspanning a wide range of resolutions is used to scan power at each\ntime-frequency location.

Consequently, commonly used\nagent decision-making frameworks, such as event-condition-action rules, are\noften required to focus only on a narrow range of behaviours. We argue that\nthese behavioural frameworks often do not reflect real-world scenarios and fail\nto capture how behaviours can develop in response to stimuli. There has been an\nincreased interest in Machine Learning methods and their potential to simulate\nintelligent adaptive behaviours in recent years. One method that is beginning\nto gain traction in this area is Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Using the Geant4 toolkit for this experiment,\nneutron fluxes and their energy spectra were calculated at the location of\nexperimental samples without a moderator and with a moderator of different\nthickness (1-5 cm). An analysis of the experimental results showed that when\nobjects without lead shielding and without a moderator are irradiated, the dye\nmolecules are completely destroyed.

We study the process of phagocytosis by\nconsidering a simplified coarse grained model of a three-dimensional vesicle,\nhaving uniform adhesion interaction with a rigid particle, in the presence of\ncurved membrane proteins and active cytoskeletal forces. Complete engulfment is\nachieved when the bending energy cost of the vesicle is balanced by the gain in\nthe adhesion energy. The presence of curved (convex) proteins reduces the\nbending energy cost by self-organizing with higher density at the highly curved\nleading edge of the engulfing membrane, which forms the circular rim of the\nphagocytic cup that wraps around the particle. This allows the engulfment to\noccur at much smaller adhesion strength. When the curved proteins exert\noutwards protrusive forces, representing actin polymerization, at the leading\nedge, we find that engulfment is achieved more quickly and at lower protein\ndensity. We consider spherical as well as non-spherical particles, and find\nthat non-spherical particles are more difficult to engulf in comparison to the\nspherical particles of the same surface area. For non-spherical particles, the\nengulfment time crucially depends upon the initial orientation of the particles\nwith respect to the vesicle.

These data have important applications ranging\nfrom transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be\novercome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited\nsample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.\n  To address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating\nsynthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is\ntrained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as\ninput and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.\n  Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing\nboth the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over\nlonger time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with\nprivacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel\nsequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model\nintroduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and\nreal data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human\nmobility, and protect user privacy.\n  Location based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were\nused in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics.

Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,\nscaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning\nstyle. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a\nnon-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise\nlearning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled\nfrom the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the\noriginal, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops\nan evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of\ninformation among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher\nperformance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled\ndataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset.

Our technique is based on a double-loop inexact accelerated\nproximal gradient (APG) method for minimizing the summation of a non-smooth but\nproximable convex function and two smooth convex functions with different\nsmoothness constants and computational costs. Compared to the standard APG\nmethod, the inexact APG method can reduce the total computation cost if one\nsmooth component has higher computational cost but a smaller smoothness\nconstant than the other. With this property, the inexact APG method can be\napplied to approximately solve the subproblems of a proximal augmented\nLagrangian method for affine-constrained composite convex optimization and the\nsmooth approximation for bilinear saddle-point structured non-smooth convex\noptimization, where the smooth function with a smaller smoothness constant has\nsignificantly higher computational cost.

The difference is\nthat our inexact APG method can efficiently stop the inner loop by using a\ncomputable condition based on a measure of stationarity violation, while the\ngradient sliding methods need to pre-specify the number of iterations for the\ninner loop. Numerical experiments demonstrate significantly higher efficiency\nof our methods over an optimal primal-dual first-order method and the gradient\nsliding methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 15:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

However, the existing scalable\ncompression methods face two challenges: reduced compression performance and\ninsufficient scalability.

Specifically, we introduce a feature separation backbone to\ndivide the image information into basic and scalable features, then\nredistribute the features channel by channel through an information\nrearrangement strategy. In this way, we can generate a continuously scalable\nbitstream via one-pass encoding. In addition, we reuse the decoder to reduce\nthe parameters and computational complexity of DeepFGS. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our DeepFGS outperforms all learning-based scalable image compression\nmodels and conventional scalable image codecs in PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics.

In this study, we\ninvestigate the erosion symptoms discussed in code reviews, as well as their\ntrends, and the actions taken by developers. Specifically, we conducted an\nempirical study with the two most active Open Source Software (OSS) projects in\nthe OpenStack community (i.e., Nova and Neutron). We manually checked 21,274\ncode review comments retrieved by keyword search and random selection, and\nidentified 502 code review comments (from 472 discussion threads) that discuss\nerosion. Our findings show that (1) the proportion of erosion symptoms is\nrather low, yet notable in code reviews and the most frequently identified\nerosion symptoms are architectural violation, duplicate functionality, and\ncyclic dependency; (2) the declining trend of the identified erosion symptoms\nin the two OSS projects indicates that the architecture tends to stabilize over\ntime; and (3) most code reviews that identify erosion symptoms have a positive\nimpact on removing erosion symptoms, but a few symptoms still remain and are\nignored by developers. The results suggest that (1) code review provides a\npractical way to reduce erosion symptoms; and (2) analyzing the trend of\nerosion symptoms can help get an insight about the erosion status of software\nsystems, and subsequently avoid the potential risk of architecture erosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Many of these\nnon-intuitive effects are lumped collectively under the term thixotropy;\nhowever, no proper nouns are associated with the key phenomena observed in such\nmaterials. Thixotropy arises from the ability of a complex structured fluid to\nremember its prior deformation history, so it is natural to name the\ndimensionless group representing such behavior with respect to the ability to\nremember. In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne was mother of the nine Muses and the\ngoddess of memory. We thus propose the definition of a Mnemosyne number as the\ndimensionless product of the thixotropic time scale and the imposed rate of\ndeformation. The Mnemosyne number is thus a measure of the flow strength\ncompared to the thixotropic timescale. Since long transients responses are\nendemic to thixotropic materials, one also needs to consider the duration of\nflow. The relevant dimensionless measure of this duration can be represented in\nterms of a mutation number which compares the timescale of\nexperiment/observation to the thixotropic timescale. Collating the mutation\nnumber and the Mnemosyne number, we construct a general two-dimensional map of\nthixotropic behavior, and quantify these ideas using canonical thixotropic\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 15:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This paper works\ntowards designing more effective speech-based interfaces to query the\nstructured data in relational databases. We first identify a new task named\nSpeech-to-SQL, which aims to understand the information conveyed by human\nspeech and directly translate it into structured query language (SQL)\nstatements. A naive solution to this problem can work in a cascaded manner,\nthat is, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) component followed by a\ntext-to-SQL component. However, it requires a high-quality ASR system and also\nsuffers from the error compounding problem between the two components,\nresulting in limited performance. To handle these challenges, we further\npropose a novel end-to-end neural architecture named SpeechSQLNet to directly\ntranslate human speech into SQL queries without an external ASR step.\nSpeechSQLNet has the advantage of making full use of the rich linguistic\ninformation presented in speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt to directly synthesize SQL based on arbitrary natural language\nquestions, rather than a natural language-based version of SQL or its variants\nwith a limited SQL grammar. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nproblem and model, we further construct a dataset named SpeechQL, by\npiggybacking the widely-used text-to-SQL datasets. Extensive experimental\nevaluations on this dataset show that SpeechSQLNet can directly synthesize\nhigh-quality SQL queries from human speech, outperforming various competitive\ncounterparts as well as the cascaded methods in terms of exact match\naccuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 15:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

This situation changed in the early 2010's, with the community\nconverging on the common terminology of \"geomagnetic\" and \"Askaryan\" radiation\nto describe the two emission mechanisms. However, this convergence arose from\ndiscussions at various conferences and workshops, and was ultimately reached\nthrough agreement between simulation codes and experimental measurements.

I identify well-determined frequency regimes where the radiation from\nthe Askaryan effect will be bremsstrahlung-like and Cherenkov-like, being\nrespectively below/above 1 GHz in EAS and 100 MHz in dense media; and where\ngeomagnetic emission will be transverse-current-like and where it will resemble\nsynchrotron radiation, respectively below/above a few GHz in EAS, depending on\nthe height of cascade development.

Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive\nlearning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a\nprefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data\naugmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following\nquestions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle\ncan be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be\nconstructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?\nAccordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the\naugmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of\ngraph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of\nimage manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form\ncontrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior\nlearnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization\n(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.\nEventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated\norganically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and\nautomated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art\ngraph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small\ngraphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without\nresorting to human expertise or downstream validation.

The project includes setup optimization,\ndata collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen\nwere quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an\niPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a\ndark closet with a dark background. During data collection, the test subject\nfirst wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and\nspeaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV darklight. The fluorescence from the tonic\nwater droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in\nslo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation\nand Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of\noral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the\nloudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and\nestablished using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of\nmasks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks\nblocked droplets to varying extent. Masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker\nmaterial were found to block the most droplets. This low-cost technique can be\neasily constructed at home using materials that total to a cost of less than\n$50. Despite the minimal cost, the method is very accurate and the data is\nquantifiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 19:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Early 19th century beads made\nof lead-potassium glass are the object of the study. Non-uniformly distributed\ninternal stresses were introduced into the studied glass during bead\nmanufacturing. Corrosion of 19th century bead glass has been shown to comprise\nseveral mutually connected processes developing in parallel and intensifying\none another. These processes are the depolymerization of glass, the directed\nmigration of alkali-metal impurities and local glass leaching, and the\nnucleation of micro discontinuities followed by the formation of micro cracks\nand their gradual growth. In course of time, their cumulative and apparently\nsynergistic effect results in glass fracturing terminated with bead crumbling\ninto tiny discoloured particles. All these phenomena are controlled by the\ninternal stress originated from the bead production process. Thus, the\nphenomenon of stressed bead glass corrosion is the process of the internal\nstress relaxation in glass through the nucleation and growth of cracks, which\nlasts for many decades at room temperature. It is dramatically accelerated when\nbeads are heat treated. Annealing at 300{\\deg}C for 15 min. is sufficient for\nartificial ageing of initially intact beads. The corrosion has been observed to\noccur in glass even if beads are kept in well-controlled museum environment.\nThe local thermal-fluctuation mechanism is proposed to account for the\ncorrosion phenomenon on an atomic scale. The approach based on the\nthermal-fluctuation mechanism is applicable to describe degradation and\ndestruction processes in various solid substances and composite materials under\nstress; this approach enables understanding the phenomena of formation and\ndegradation of nanostructures, e. g., heterostructures with quantum wells or\nquantum dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 17:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 09:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Current microreinforced\ncomposites do not yet reach the same level of complexity in their\nmicrostructures, resulting in poorer properties. To achieve complex\nmicrostructuration, magnetically-assisted slip casting (MASC) was conducted\nusing a setup with 4 degrees of freedom. Among all possible microstructures, a\nhybrid design between nacre-like and helicoidal arrangements was selected due\nto its ability to tilt and twist the crack path. The hybrid microstructured\nspecimen fabricated, consisting of aluminum oxide micro platelets in a silicone\nmatrix, were tested under compression and their mechanical performance\ncompared. Although nacre-like composites exhibited the highest strength and\ntoughness, helicoidal hybrids could show some ductility and higher stiffness.\nThe fabrication strategy proposed here could thus be a simple route to study\nmore complex microstructures in view of increasing the toughness of\nmicroplatelet reinforced composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 00:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Starting from the Essential Science Indicators (ESI)\nschema of classification of subject area, we obtained the yearly disciplinary\nprofiles of a worldwide graph, where on each node sits a country, in the two\ntime intervals [1980-1988] and [1992-2017], the fall of the Berlin Wall being\nthe watershed. We analyse the empirical pairwise cross-correlation matrices of\nthe time series of disciplinary profiles. The contrast with random matrix\ntheory proves that, beyond measurement noise, the empirical cross-correlation\nmatrices bring genuine information. Arising from the Shannon theorem as the\nleast-structured model consistent with the measured pairwise correlations, the\nstationary probability distribution of disciplinary profiles can be described\nby a Boltzmann distribution related to a generalized $n_d$-dimensional\nHeisenberg model. The set of network interactions of the Heisenberg model have\nbeen inferred and to it they have been applied two clusterization methods,\nhierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. On a geopolitical\nplane this allow to obtain a characterization of the worldwide bilateral\ninteractions based on physical modeling. A simple geopolitical analysis reveals\nthe consistency of the results obtained and gives a boost to deeper historical\nanalysis.

First, starting from the 3D\ngoverning system of a hyperelastic (neo-Hookean) plate, a consistent\nfinite-strain plate equation system is formulated through a series-expansion\nand truncation approach. Based on the plate equation system, the problem of\nshape-programming is studied under the stress-free assumption. By equating the\nstress components in the plate equations to be zero, the explicit relations\nbetween growth functions and geometrical quantities of the target shape of the\nplate are derived. Then, a theoretical scheme of shape-programming is proposed,\nwhich can be used to identify the growth fields corresponding to arbitrary 3D\nshapes of the plate. To demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme, some typical\nexamples are studied. The predicted growth functions in these examples are\nadopted in the numerical simulations, from which the target shapes of the plate\ncan be recovered completely. The scheme of shape-programming proposed in the\ncurrent work is applicable for manufacture of intelligent soft devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 09:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}
