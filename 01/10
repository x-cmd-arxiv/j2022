Despite the convenience offered by\nM-Banking Apps, users are often distrustful of the security of the applications\ndue to an increasing trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-attacks, and\ndata breaches. Considering the upsurge in cyber security vulnerabilities of\nM-Banking Apps and the paucity of research in this domain, this study was\nconducted to empirically measure user-perceived security of M-Banking Apps. A\ntotal of 315 responses from study participants were analysed using\ncovariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The results indicated\nthat most constructs of the baseline Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and\nUse of Technology (UTAUT2) structure were validated. Perceived security,\ninstitutional trust and technology trust were confirmed as factors that affect\nuser's intention to adopt and use M-Banking Apps. However, perceived risk was\nnot confirmed as a significant predictor. The current study further revealed\nthat in the context of M-Banking Apps, the effects of security and trust are\ncomplex. The impact of perceived security and institutional trust on\nbehavioural intention was moderated by age, gender, experience, income, and\neducation, while perceived security on use behaviour was moderated by age,\ngender, and experience. The effect of technology trust on behavioural intention\nwas moderated by age, education, and experience. Overall, the proposed\nconceptual model achieved acceptable fit and explained 79% of the variance in\nbehavioural intention and 54.7% in use behaviour of M-Banking Apps, higher than\nthat obtained in the original UTAUT2.

COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing many\ninfected patients and deaths. CT image-based diagnosis of COVID-19 can provide\nquick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation method of\ninfection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis.\nPrevious methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection\nregions have a considerable variation in their sizes. Such processes easily\nmiss small infection regions. Patch-based process is effective for segmenting\nsmall targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult in\ninfection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various\nreceptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The\nreceptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of\nvolumes where patches are clipped from.

We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various\nintensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes\nnormalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results\ngenerated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes.

This overview shall provide an\nunderstanding of current and guide future research. Method: To provide this\noverview, we conducted a systematic literature review. The survey comprises 116\npublications that address counterexample explanations for model checking.\nResults: Most primary studies provide counterexample explanations graphically\nor as traces, minimize counterexamples to reduce complexity, localize errors in\nthe models expressed in the input formats of model checkers, support linear\ntemporal logic or computation tree logic specifications, and use model checkers\nof the Symbolic Model Verifier family. Several studies evaluate their\napproaches in safety-critical domains with industrial applications. Conclusion:\nWe notably see a lack of research on counterexample explanation that targets\nprobabilistic and real-time systems, leverages the explanations to\ndomain-specific models, and evaluates approaches in user studies. We conclude\nby discussing the adequacy of different types of explanations for users with\nvarying domain and formal methods expertise, showing the need to support\nlaypersons in understanding model checking results to increase adoption of\nformal methods in industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 17:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

To achieve this, a new computational framework is\npresented that integrates phase field fracture and cohesive zone models to\nsimulate fibre breakage, matrix cracking and fibre-matrix debonding. The\ncomposite microstructure is represented by an embedded cell at the vicinity of\nthe crack tip, whilst the rest of the sample is modelled as an anisotropic\nelastic solid. The model is first validated against experimental data of\ntransverse matrix cracking from single-notched three-point bending tests.

The results show that these microstructures are very efficient in\nenhancing the fracture toughness via fibre-matrix debonding, fibre breakage and\ncrack deflection.

We propose a new method for decomposing\npoint estimates from a regression model via weights placed on data clusters.\nThe weights are informed only by the model specification and data availability\nand thus can be used to explicitly link the effects of data imbalance and model\nassumptions to actual model estimates. The weight matrix has been understood in\nlinear models as the hat matrix in the existing literature.

We also provide metrics that summarize the borrowing\nfactors and are practically useful.

Here instead,\na single substitution rule makes its shape, and when applying it, forces the\ntiling to be aperiodic. The proposed monotile, called HexSeed, is self-ruling.\nIt consists of 16 identical hexagons, called subtiles, all with edgy borders\nrepresenting the same binary marking. No motif is needed on the subtiles to\nmake it work. Additional motifs can be added to the monotile to provide some\ninsights. The proof of aperiodicity is presented with the use of such motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 20:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In\nthis work we analyse a high resolution three-dimensional general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disk which is\ntilted by $65^{\\circ}$ with respect to the black hole spin axis.

A privacy-enhanced technology is also\nproposed in FEDFOREST to further defeat the privacy of the FL systems.\nExtensive experiments on 4 cyberattack datasets of different tasks demonstrate\nthat FEDFOREST is effective, efficient, interpretable, and extendable.\nFEDFOREST ranks first in the collaborative learning and cybersecurity\ncompetition 2021 for Chinese college students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 02:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Based on the data from the optical and near-infrared (IR) photometric\nsurveys, including the Gaia Survey, the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS), the\nSurvey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH), the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS) and the near-infrared $YJK_{\\rm{S}}$ VISTA survey of the Magellanic\nClouds system (VMC), we have obtained multi-band photometric stellar samples\ncontaining over 6 million stars in the LMC and SMC area. Based on the\nmeasurements of the proper motions and parallaxes of the individual stars from\nGaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3), we have built clean samples that contain\nstars from the LMC, SMC and Milky Way (MW), respectively. We apply the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) fitting to the individual sample stars to estimate\ntheir reddening values. As a result, we have derived the best-fitting reddening\nvalues of ~ 1.9 million stars in the LMC, 1.5 million stars in the SMC and 0.6\nmillion stars in the MW, which are used to construct dust reddening maps in the\nMCs. Our maps are consistent with those from the literature. The resultant\nhigh-resolution dust maps in the MCs are not only important tools for reddening\ncorrection of sources in the MCs, but also fundamental for the studies of the\ndistribution and properties of dust in the two galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 03:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

However, in this\nstudy on generalizable pedestrian detectors, we show that, current pedestrian\ndetectors poorly handle even small domain shifts in cross-dataset evaluation.\nWe attribute the limited generalization to two main factors, the method and the\ncurrent sources of data. Regarding the method, we illustrate that biasness\npresent in the design choices (e.g anchor settings) of current pedestrian\ndetectors are the main contributing factor to the limited generalization. Most\nmodern pedestrian detectors are tailored towards target dataset, where they do\nachieve high performance in traditional single training and testing pipeline,\nbut suffer a degrade in performance when evaluated through cross-dataset\nevaluation.

Also, price-based demand response is implemented in\nthe model to build a cost-reducing opportunity for consumers. Applying Shapley\nvalue, the optimum cost of the MMG system is fairly allocated between\nmicrogrids. To enhance the confidence level of results, data uncertainties are\nincorporated into the model. The uncertainties of renewable outputs, demand,\nand prices of trading with the main grid are applied in the model.

This happens primarily due to the use of\nT-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus,\nthere are hardly any work dealing with datasets with dimensions more than\nhundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle\ndatasets with dimensions even more than 7000! In this context, we propose an\nadaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of\n``numeric underflow\" and ``fake minimum\" that arise for existing fuzzy systems\nwhile dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an Adaptive\nTakagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to\nperform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this\ncontext, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the\nconsequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two\nsuccessive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design\nan enhanced fuzzy rule base (En-FRB), which maintains adequate rules but does\nnot grow the number of rules exponentially with dimension that typically\nhappens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated Feature Selection and Rule\nExtraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: (i)\nfeature selection, (ii) rule extraction, and (iii) fine tuning. The\neffectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five\nare in more than 2000 dimension including two with dimension greater than 7000.\nThis may be the first time fuzzy systems are realized for classification\ninvolving more than 7000 input features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 06:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Thus, samples could be observed at any\nlevel of the hierarchy, e.g., [\"Albatross\"] or [\"Albatross\", \"Laysan\nAlbatross\"], and examples discerned at coarse categories are often neglected in\nthe conventional setting of HMC. In this paper, we study the HMC problem in\nwhich objects are labeled at any level of the hierarchy. The essential designs\nof the proposed method are derived from two motivations: (1) learning with\nobjects labeled at various levels should transfer hierarchical knowledge\nbetween levels; (2) lower-level classes should inherit attributes related to\nupper-level superclasses. The proposed combinatorial loss maximizes the\nmarginal probability of the observed ground truth label by aggregating\ninformation from related labels defined in the tree hierarchy. If the observed\nlabel is at the leaf level, the combinatorial loss further imposes the\nmulti-class cross-entropy loss to increase the weight of fine-grained\nclassification loss. Considering the hierarchical feature interaction, we\npropose a hierarchical residual network (HRN), in which granularity-specific\nfeatures from parent levels acting as residual connections are added to\nfeatures of children levels.

Extensive experiments upon several\nreal-life large-scale datasets demonstrate that, our proposed system can\naccelerate the generative adversarial model training by 7.1x. Using around 7.6%\nsamples, SCIS yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art imputation\nmethods in a much shorter computation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 08:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In these frameworks, bistatic/passive radar\ndeployments with directional beams explore the angular search space and\nidentify mobile users/radar targets. Subsequently, directional communication\nlinks are established with these mobile users. Consequently, JRC parameters\nsuch as the time trade-off between the radar exploration and communication\nservice tasks have direct implications on the network throughput. Using tools\nfrom stochastic geometry (SG), we derive several system design and planning\ninsights for deploying such networks and demonstrate how efficient radar\ndetection can augment the communication throughput in a JRC system.\nSpecifically, we provide a generalized analytical framework to maximize the\nnetwork throughput by optimizing JRC parameters such as the\nexploration/exploitation duty cycle, the radar bandwidth, the transmit power,\nand the pulse repetition interval. The analysis is further extended to\nmonostatic radar conditions, which is a special case in our framework. The\ntheoretical results are experimentally validated through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Our analysis highlights that for a larger bistatic range, lower\noperating bandwidth and a higher duty cycle must be employed to maximize the\nnetwork throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a reduced success in radar\ndetection due to higher clutter density deteriorates the overall network\nthroughput. Finally, we show peak reliability of 70% of the JRC link metrics\nfor a single bistatic transceiver configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 09:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 09:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 06:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

To accelerate the\nscanning process, methods by k-space undersampling and deep learning based\nreconstruction have been popularised. This work introduced SwinMR, a novel Swin\ntransformer based method for fast MRI reconstruction. The whole network\nconsisted of an input module (IM), a feature extraction module (FEM) and an\noutput module (OM).

The LiMES function involved in the model is an ``additively\nnonseparable'' weakly convex function but is defined with the Moreau envelope\nreturning the minimum of a ``separable'' convex function. This mixed nature of\nseparability and nonseparability allows an application of the LiMES model to\nthe underdetermined case with an efficient algorithmic implementation. Two\nlinear/affine operators play key roles in the model: one corresponds to the\nprojection mentioned above and the other takes care of robust\nregression/classification. A necessary and sufficient condition for convexity\nof the smooth part of the objective function is studied. Numerical examples\nshow the efficacy of LiMES in applications to sparse modeling and robust\nregression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 09:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 13:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Research by Fu et al. shows that the\nalgorithms based on Monotonic Search Network (MSNET), such as NSG and NSSG,\nhave achieved the state-of-the-art search performance in efficiency.

However, most existing researches focus on reducing\nmodel's prediction error but ignore the error caused by the uneven distribution\nof spatial events within a region. In this paper, we study a region\npartitioning problem, namely optimal grid size selection problem (OGSS), which\naims to minimize the real error of spatiotemporal prediction models by\nselecting the optimal grid size. In order to solve OGSS, we analyze the upper\nbound of real error of spatiotemporal prediction models and minimize the real\nerror by minimizing its upper bound. Through in-depth analysis, we find that\nthe upper bound of real error will decrease then increase when the number of\nmodel grids increase from 1 to the maximum allowed value. Then, we propose two\nalgorithms, namely Ternary Search and Iterative Method, to automatically find\nthe optimal grid size. Finally, the experiments verify that the error of\nprediction has the same trend as its upper bound, and the change trend of the\nupper bound of real error with respect to the increase of the number of model\ngrids will decrease then increase. Meanwhile, in a case study, by selecting the\noptimal grid size, the order dispatching results of a state-of-the-art\nprediction-based algorithm can be improved up to 13.6%, which shows the\neffectiveness of our methods on tuning the region partition for spatiotemporal\nprediction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 09:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

However, it is currently\nunknown if the bosonic dressing field is composed of phonons or magnons.

We\nemploy element-specific X-ray reflectivity at the FLASH free-electron laser to\ndemonstrate the reduction of the upper band-edge at the O 1s-2p core-valence\nresonance (K-edge) whereas the antiferromagnetic order is probed via X-ray\nmagnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) at the Ni 2p-3d resonance (L2-edge).

For CPU-like devices, we propose a novel CPU-efficient\nGhost (C-Ghost) module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations.\nBased on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear\ntransformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could\nfully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed C-Ghost\nmodule can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing\nconvolutional neural networks. C-Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack\nC-Ghost modules, and then the lightweight C-GhostNet can be easily established.\nWe further consider the efficient networks for GPU devices. Without involving\ntoo many GPU-inefficient operations (e.g.,, depth-wise convolution) in a\nbuilding stage, we propose to utilize the stage-wise feature redundancy to\nformulate GPU-efficient Ghost (G-Ghost) stage structure.

This\npaper proposes an efficient transformer architecture that adjusts the inference\ncomputational cost adaptively with desired inference latency speedup. The\nproposed encoder model can work with fewer Floating Point Operations (FLOPs)\nthan the original Transformer architecture. In fine-tuning phase, the proposed\nmethod detects more important hidden sequence elements (word-vectors) in each\nencoder layer by a proposed Attention Context Contribution (ACC) metric. It\neliminates the less important word-vectors based on a new strategy. A\nmathematical inference speedup analysis is proposed to estimate the speedup\naccurately to adjust the latency and computational cost of fine-tuning and\ninference phases. After the fine-tuning phase, by the method offline-tuning\nproperty, the inference latency of the model can be adjusted in a wide range of\ninference speedup selections. The proposed method is applied to the BERTbase\nmodel for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most of the word-vectors\nin higher BERT encoder layers have less contribution to the subsequent layers;\nhence, they can be eliminated to improve the inference latency. Experimental\nresults on extensive sentiment analysis, classification, and regression\nbenchmarks like GLUE showed that the method is effective in various datasets.\nThe proposed method improves the inference latency of BERTbase by up to 4.8\ntimes with less than 0.75% accuracy drop on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 07:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 17:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 13:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

We modelled the\nhigh-precision CHEOPS transit light curves together with systematic\ninstrumental noise using multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression informed\nby a set of instrumental parameters.

Combining the transit times derived from CHEOPS, with the other\ntransit times available in the literature, we find no significant orbital\nperiod variation for WASP-103b. However, the data show a hint of an orbital\nperiod increase instead of a decrease, as is expected for tidal decay.

In addition, our approach ensures that the\ngenerated image is realistic. Since quantitative metrics cannot be employed to\nevaluate the interpretability of the model, we carried out a user study to\nassess different aspects of our approach.

The morphing capability holds significance in the\nabilities of fishes to swim upstream without spending too much energy and that\nof birds to glide for extended periods of time. Simplifying the wing or fins to\na foil, morphing refers to the ability of the foil to change its camber\nsmoothly, without sharp bends on the foil surface. This allows precise control\nover flow separation and vortex shedding. Compared to conventional\ntrailing-edge extensions or flaps, used in rudders and elevators in submarines\nand ships, morphing foils provide better control of thrust and lift\ncharacteristics. This study aims at understanding the importance of the\nmorphing of foil combined with a sinusoidal heaving motion on thrust\ngeneration. A two-dimensional variational stabilized Petrov-Galerkin moving\nmesh framework is utilized for modelling the incompressible low Reynolds number\nflow across the flapping foil. The morphing motion is characterized by the\nextent of morphing, measured as an angle of deviation from the initial camber,\nand the point of initiation of morphing on the foil as a percentage of its\nchord length. The effect of the foil morphing and the heaving motion on the\npropulsive performance are investigated.

This leaves potential signatures in\nthe sky averaged 21-cm signal (global), as well as in the 21-cm fluctuations,\nwhich can be sought for with ongoing and future 21-cm global and intensity\nmapping experiments. To do so reliably, it is crucial to include effects such\nas the dark-matter/baryon relative velocity and Lyman-Werner star-formation\nfeedback, which also act as delaying mechanisms, as well as CMB and \\lya\nheating effects, which can significantly change the amplitude and timing of the\nsignal, depending on the strength of X-ray heating sourced by the remnants of\nthe first stars. Here we model the 21-cm signal in FDM cosmologies across CD\nand EoR using a modified version of the public code 21cmvFAST that accounts for\nall these additional effects, and is directly interfaced with the Boltzmann\ncode CLASS so that degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical\nparameters can be fully explored. We examine the prospects to distinguish\nbetween the CDM and FDM models and forecast joint astrophysical, cosmological\nand FDM parameter constraints achievable with intensity mapping experiments\nsuch as HERA and global signal experiments like EDGES. We find that HERA will\nbe able to detect FDM particle masses up to $m_{\\rm FDM}\\! \\sim\n\\!10^{-19}\\,{\\rm eV}\\!-\\!10^{-18}\\,{\\rm eV}$, depending on foreground\nassumptions, despite the mitigating effect of the delaying and heating\nmechanisms included in the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 14:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In a suspension of many squirmers, they\nalso interact hydrodynamically via flow fields that are initiated by their\nswimming motion and by gravity. Swimming under the combined action of flow\nfield vorticity and gravitational torque is called gyrotaxis. Using the method\nof multi-particle collision dynamics, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of a\nmany-squirmer system floating above the bottom surface. Due to gyrotaxis they\nexhibit pronounced cluster formation with increasing gravitational torque. The\nclusters are more volatile at low values but compactify to smaller clusters at\nlarger torques. The mean distance between clusters is mainly controlled by the\ngravitational torque and not the global density. Furthermore, we observe that\nneutral squirmers form clusters more easily, whereas pullers require larger\ngravitational torques due to their additional force-dipole flow fields. We do\nnot observe clustering for pusher squirmers. Adding a rotlet dipole to the\nsquirmer flow field induces swirling clusters. At high gravitational strengths,\nthe hydrodynamic interactions with the no-slip boundary create an additional\nvertical alignment for neutral squirmers, which also supports cluster\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

We consider three known\ndark matter density profiles such as the Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Scalar Field\nDark Matter (SFDM), and the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) from the Burkert\nprofile. To achieve this goal, we used how the positional angles are measured\nby Ishihara et al. method based on Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) on the optical\nmetric. With the help of the non-asymptotic form of the GBT, the longitudinal\nangle difference is also calculated. First, we find the emergence of apparent\ndivergent terms on the said profiles, which indicates that the spacetime\ndescribing the black hole-dark matter combination is non-asymptotic. We showed\nthat these apparent divergent terms vanish when the distance of the source and\nreceiver are astronomically distant from the black hole.

We describe how such collision integrals are derived and what\nassumptions are required for them to have a closed form, how to prove the\nH-theorems for them, and why, for a system carrying sufficiently large\nelectric-fluctuation energy, collisionless relaxation should be fast. It is\nsuggested that collisionless dynamics may favour maximising entropy locally in\nphase space before converging to global maximum-entropy states. Relaxation due\nto interspecies interaction is examined, leading, inter alia, to spontaneous\ntransient generation of electron currents. The formalism also allows efficient\nrecovery of `true' collision integrals for both classical and quantum plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 14:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 08:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

However, it is still unclear what\nfeatures the Solar System's disk could have produced during its gas phase. By\nrunning 2D isothermal hydro-simulations and a dust evolution model, we derive\nsynthetic images at 1.3 mm wavelength using the radiative transfer code\nRADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the\nradial gas velocities of the disk, creating traffic jams in the dust.

By deriving the images at\n1.3mm from these dust distributions, we show that the traffic jams, observable\nwith a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and\nrings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a\nsystem of 3 compact giant planets does not automatically produce bright outer\nrings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations\nof disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant\nplanet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either\nin the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. Finally, we find\nthat, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust\nmasses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared\nto the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick\nregions.

While \\code{QuasarNET}, which is a standard CNN\nadopted in the SDSS routine and is constructed by 4 convolutional layers (no\nResNet structure), with kernel sizes of $10$, to measure the redshift via\nidentifying seven emission lines (\\textit{local} patterns), fails in estimating\nredshift of $\\sim 1.3\\%$ of visually inspected quasars in DR16Q catalog, and it\ngives 97.8$\\%$ for $|\\Delta\\nu|< 6000~ \\rm km/s$ and 97.9$\\%$ for $|\\Delta\\nu|<\n12000~ \\rm km/s$. Hence, FNet provides similar accuracy to \\code{QuasarNET},\nbut it is applicable for a wider range of SDSS spectra, especially for those\nmissing the clear emission lines exploited by \\code{QuasarNET}. These\nproperties of \\code{FNet}, together with the fast predictive power of machine\nlearning, allow \\code{FNet} to be a more accurate alternative for the pipeline\nredshift estimator and can make it practical in the upcoming catalogs to reduce\nthe number of spectra to visually inspect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Our aim is to examine the\naccretion process of the low-mass young stellar object CR Cha on a wide range\nof timescales from minutes to a decade by analyzing both photometric and\nspectroscopic observations from 2006, 2018, and 2019. We carried out period\nanalysis on the light curves of CR Cha from the TESS mission and the ASAS-SN\nand the ASAS-3 databases. We studied the color variations of the system using\n$I,J,H,K$-band photometry obtained contemporaneously with the TESS observing\nwindow. We analyzed the amplitude, timescale, and the morphology of the\naccretion tracers found in a series of high-resolution spectra obtained in 2006\nwith the AAT/UCLES, in 2018 with the HARPS, and in 2019 with the ESPRESSO and\nthe FEROS spectrographs. All photometric data reveal periodic variations\ncompatible with a 2.327 days rotational period, which is stable in the system\nover decades. Moreover, the ASAS-SN and ASAS-3 data hint at a long-term\nbrightening by 0.2 mag, between 2001 and 2008, and of slightly less than 0.1\nmag in the 2015 - 2018 period. The near-infrared color variations can be\nexplained by either changing accretion rate or changes in the inner disk\nstructure. Our results show that the amplitude of the variations in the\nH$\\alpha$ emission increases on timescales from hours to days/weeks, after\nwhich it stays similar even when looking at decadal timescales. On the other\nhand, we found significant morphological variations on yearly/decadal\ntimescales, indicating that the different physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe line profile changes, such as accretion or wind, are present to varying\ndegrees at different times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

We\nfind that the relative Askaryan fraction has a radial dependence increasing\nwith the distance from the shower axis -- with a plateau around the Cherenkov\nring. We further find that the Askaryan fraction depends on shower parameters\nlike zenith angle and the distance to the shower maximum.

The homogenization\nmethod is based on a power series expansion which allows determining the\nmacroscopic (homogenized) bidomain model from the microscopic bidomain problem\nat each structural level. First, we use the two-scale asymptotic expansion to\nhomogenize the extracellular problem. Then, we apply a three-scale asymptotic\nexpansion in the intracellular problem to obtain its homogenized equation at\ntwo levels. The first upscaling level of the intracellular structure yields the\nmesoscopic equation and the second step of the homogenization leads to obtain\nthe intracellular homogenized equation. Both the mesoscopic and microscopic\ninformation is obtained by homogenization to capture local characteristics\ninside the cardiac tissue structure. Finally, we obtain the macroscopic\nbidomain model and the heart domain coincides with the intracellular medium and\nextracellular one, which are two inter-penetrating and superimposed continua\nconnected at each point by the cardiac cellular membrane. The interest of the\nproposed method comes from the fact that it combines microscopic and mesoscopic\ncharacteristics to obtain a macroscopic description of the electrical behavior\nof the heart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

This research was developed based on the process's identification\nprocess, which is still manual (conventional). Although currently there are\nmany technologies in the identification process, they still need development.\nThus, this research is one of the developments in the field of image processing\ntechnology. The sample data uses datasets from previous studies with a total of\n100 egg images. The egg object in the image is a single object. From these\ndata, the classification of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data.\nChicken egg image data became input in image processing, with the initial\nprocess is segmentation. This initial segmentation aims to get the cropped\nimage according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image\npreprocessing with grayscaling and image enhancement methods. This method\n(image enhancement) used two combination methods: contrast limited adaptive\nhistogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The improved\nimage becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS\nuses five parameters, namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.\nThe five parameters entered into the SVM classifier method to identify the\nfertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments, the method\nproposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%.\nThus, the implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future\nresearch improvements. In addition, it may be possible to use a second-order\nfeature extraction method to improve its accuracy and improve supervised\nlearning for classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 04:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-30"}

Being relatively\neasy to generate and hard to detect, these attacks pose a security breach that\nmany suggested defenses try to mitigate. However, the evaluation of the effect\nof attacks and defenses commonly relies on traditional classification metrics,\nwithout adequate adaptation to adversarial scenarios. Most of these metrics are\naccuracy-based, and therefore may have a limited scope and low distinctive\npower.

Furthermore, GUDN uses raw\nlabel semantics combined with a helpful label reinforcement strategy to\neffectively explore the latent space between texts and labels, narrowing the\nsemantic gap, which can further improve predicted accuracy. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that GUDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Eurlex-4k\nand has competitive results on other popular datasets. In an additional\nexperiment, we investigated the input lengths' influence on the\nTransformer-based model's accuracy.

Local levels of oxygen strongly affect the\nresponse of tumours to the administration of different therapeutic modalities\nand, more generally, to the phenomenon of resistance to treatments. Several\ninterventions have been proposed to improve tumour oxygenation, being the\nelevation of the local temperature (hyperthermia) an important one. While other\nfactors such as the metabolic activity have to be considered, the proficiency\nof the tumour vascular system is a key factor both for the tissue oxygenation\nand for its temperature maps. Consequently, the interplay of these factors has\nattracted considerable attention from the mathematical modelling perspective.\nHere we put forward a transport-based system of partial differential equations\naimed at describing the dynamics of healthy and tumour cell subpopulations at\nthe microscale in a region placed between two blood vessels. By using this\nmodel with diverse flow conditions, we analyse the oxygen and temperature\nprofiles that arise in different scenarios of vascular status, both during free\nprogression and under thermal therapy. We find that low oxygen levels are\nassociated to elevations of temperature in locations preferentially populated\nby hypoxic cells, and hyperthermia-induced cell death, being strongly dependent\non blood flow, would only appear under highly disrupted conditions of the local\nvasculature. This results in a noticeable effect of heat on hypoxic cells.\nAdditionally, when pronounced cell death occurs, it is followed by a\nsignificant increase in the oxygen levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

This\nresearch focuses on the digitalisation of governments, their challenges, and\nsuccess factors. It is found that government faces difficulties in formulating\nstrategies, proper planning, execution strategies, and a lack of organised\ninformation and expertise. However, success can be achieved by working on\ncapabilities of the future workforce, creating leaders for tomorrow, generating\ndigitalisation capabilities, and bringing a purpose-driven digitalisation\nbefore digital government transformation. Overall, the study's findings suggest\nthat digital government transformation creates value, enhances relations,\nimproves service delivery, grows economy, pushes economic activities, enhances\ncitizen engagement, increases the policy implementation and their efficiency,\nand affects business growth positively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 05:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}
