The state is coupled to an external environment which can be\ndescribed by a Fano-Anderson type Hamiltonian. Solving the quantum Langevin\nequation, we obtain the Greens functions which are used to compute the time\nevolved first and second moments of the quadrature operators. From the\nquadrature operator moments, we construct the covariance matrix which is used\nto measure the coherence in the system. The coherence is measured using the\nrelative entropy of coherence measure. We consider three different classes of\nspectral densities in our analysis viz, the Ohmic, the sub-Ohmic, and the\nsuper-Ohmic densities. In our work, we study the dynamics of the coherent\nstate, squeezed state, and displaced squeezed state. For all these states we\nobserve that when the coupling with the system and the environment is weak, the\ncoherence monotonically decreases and eventually vanishes in a long time. Thus\nall the states exhibit Markovian evolution in the weak coupling limit. In the\nstrong coupling limit, the dynamics for the initial period is Markovian and\nafter a certain period, it becomes non-Markovian where we observe an\nenvironmental backaction on the system. Thus in the strong coupling limit, we\nobserve a dynamical crossover from Markovian nature to non-Markovian behavior.\nThis crossover is very abrupt under some environmental conditions and for some\nparameters of the quantum state. Using a quantum master equation approach we\nverify the crossover from the dynamics of the dissipation and fluctuation\nparameters and the results endorse those obtained from coherence dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Learning from multimodal data is of great interest in machine\nlearning and statistics research as this offers the possibility of capturing\ncomplementary information among modalities. Multimodal modeling helps to\nexplain the interdependence between heterogeneous data sources, discovers new\ninsights that may not be available from a single modality, and improves\ndecision-making. Recently, coupled matrix-tensor factorization has been\nintroduced for multimodal data fusion to jointly estimate latent factors and\nidentify complex interdependence among the latent factors. However, most of the\nprior work on coupled matrix-tensor factors focuses on unsupervised learning\nand there is little work on supervised learning using the jointly estimated\nlatent factors. This paper considers the multimodal tensor data classification\nproblem. A Coupled Support Tensor Machine (C-STM) built upon the latent factors\njointly estimated from the Advanced Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (ACMTF)\nis proposed. C-STM combines individual and shared latent factors with multiple\nkernels and estimates a maximal-margin classifier for coupled matrix tensor\ndata. The classification risk of C-STM is shown to converge to the optimal\nBayes risk, making it a statistically consistent rule. C-STM is validated\nthrough simulation studies as well as a simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis. The\nempirical evidence shows that C-STM can utilize information from multiple\nsources and provide a better classification performance than traditional\nsingle-mode classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Still, it is\nunclear how disk-bearing stars stop their accretion. To provide insight into\nthe last stages of accretion in low-mass young stars, we conducted a survey of\ndisk-bearing stars that are thought to be non-accretors to identify stars still\naccreting at very low rates. Here we present the first catalog of the survey of\n170 disk-bearing non-accreting stars in Chamaeleon I, Orion OB1, Upper\nScorpius, $\\gamma$ Velorum, and Upper Centaurus Lupus, using He I\n$\\lambda$10830 as a sensitive probe of accretion.

While the difference between the outer disk signature and\naccretion status is unclear, we find a difference between the inner disk excess\nand accretion status. There is no preference in the mass of the newly\nidentified accretors, suggesting that the processes inhibiting accretion do not\ndirectly depend on mass in the typical mass range of T Tauri stars.

To do this, we introduce a novel approach that allows an expert to\ntake control of the agent at any moment during a simulation and provide optimal\nsolutions to its problematic situations. Our experiments show that this\napproach leads to better policies both in terms of quantitative evaluation and\nin human-likeliness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Typically, classification rules or decision trees are\nused due to the intelligibility of their logic-based expressions. However,\ndecision trees can grow too deep and rule sets can become too large to\napproximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share\nancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured\nvisual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules.\nTo address these issues, we present a workflow that includes novel algorithmic\nand interactive solutions. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules\n(HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined\nparameters. We also contribute SuRE, a visual analytics (VA) system that\nintegrates HSR and interactive surrogate rule visualizations. Particularly, we\npresent a novel feature-aligned tree to overcome the shortcomings of existing\nrule visualizations. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter\nsensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and\nfind that it scales reasonably well and outperforms decision trees in many\nrespects. We also evaluate the visualization and the VA system by a usability\nstudy with 24 volunteers and an observational study with 7 domain experts. Our\ninvestigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to\nperform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many\ninteresting observations that can be useful for future research on designing\neffective rule-based VA systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

To mitigate\nthis adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms employed soft moderation\ninterventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts. Despite the\nrecent popularity of these moderation interventions, we lack empirical analyses\naiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly\nduring challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we analyze\nthe use of warning labels on TikTok, focusing on COVID-19 videos. First, we\nconstruct a set of 26 COVID-19 related hashtags, then we collect 41K videos\nthat include those hashtags in their description. Second, we perform a\nquantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning\nlabels on TikTok. Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using\nthematic analysis, on 222 COVID-19 related videos to assess the content and the\nconnection between the content and the warning labels. Our analysis shows that\nTikTok broadly applies warning labels on TikTok videos, likely based on\nhashtags included in the description. More worrying is the addition of COVID-19\nwarning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to COVID-19\n(23% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to\nCOVID-19). Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows\nthat 7.7% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include\nwarning labels, 37.3% share benign information and include warning labels, and\nthat 35% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a\nwarning label) are made for fun.

There is a unitary freedom in the\nconstruction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals, which can be chosen to\nproduce Wannier functions that have advantageous properties. A popular choice\nfor this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to\nmaximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the\nspatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier\nfunctions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are\nassociated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier\nfunctions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously.\nThis can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a\nkey feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density\nfunctional approximations.

An ${\\rm Rm}$- and ${\\rm\nPm}$-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is\npredicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic\nfield-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by\ntearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the\nsaturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale\nsteepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated\nAlfv\\'enic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the\nresistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the\nmagnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the\nfield-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale\nmagnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be\nconsistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters\nand recent laboratory experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 19:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

This leads to poor spectrum\nutilization, the fundamental objective of shared spectrum systems.\n  To allocate spectrum near-optimally to secondary users in general scenarios,\nwe fundamentally need to have knowledge of the signal path-loss function.

However, the complex structure inherent in OAM states makes\ntheir detection and classification nontrivial in many circumstances. Most of\nthe current detection schemes are based on models of the OAM states built upon\nthe use of Laguerre-Gauss modes. However, this may not in general be sufficient\nto capture full information on the generated states. In this paper, we go\nbeyond the Laguerre-Gauss assumption, and employ Hypergeometric-Gaussian modes\nas the basis states of a refined model that can be used -- in certain scenarios\n-- to better tailor OAM detection techniques. We show that enhanced\nperformances in OAM detection are obtained for holographic projection via\nspatial light modulators in combination with single-mode fibers, and for\nclassification techniques based on a machine learning approach. Furthermore, a\nthree-fold enhancement in the single-mode fiber coupling efficiency is obtained\nfor the holographic technique, when using the Hypergeometric-Gaussian model\nwith respect to the Laguerre-Gauss one. This improvement provides a significant\nboost in the overall efficiency of OAM-encoded single-photon detection systems.\nGiven that most of the experimental works using OAM states are effectively\nbased on the generation of Hypergeometric-Gauss modes, our findings thus\nrepresent a relevant addition to experimental toolboxes for OAM-based protocols\nin quantum communication, cryptography and simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Strongly magnetized plasmas are characterized by higher energy\npeaks and broader particle distributions. In relativistically moving\nastrophysical jets, it is believed that the flow is launched Poynting flux\ndominated and that the resulting magnetic instabilities may create a turbulent\nenvironment inside the jet, i.e., the regime of relativistic turbulence. In\nthis paper, we extend previous PIC simulation results to larger values of\nplasma magnetization by linearly extrapolating the diffusion and advection\ncoefficients relevant for the turbulent plasmas under consideration. We use\nthese results to build a single zone turbulent jet model that is based on the\nglobal parameters of blazar emission region, and consistently calculate the\nparticle distribution and resulting synchrotron and inverse Compton emission\nspectra. We then test our model by comparing its predictions with the\nbroad-band quiescent emission spectra of a dozen blazars.

Moreover, we\nalso find bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching in both\nbulge and disk structures, treated separately. Hence, intrinsic galaxy\nquenching must be due to a stable mechanism operating over cosmic time, and the\nsame quenching mechanism must be effective in both bulge and disk regions.\nDespite the success of bulge mass in predicting quenching, we find that central\nvelocity dispersion is even more predictive (when available in spectroscopic\ndata sets).

However, achieving this efficiency (for intra coding)\nrequires 31x computational complexity compared to HEVC, making it challenging\nfor low power and real-time applications. This paper, proposes a novel machine\nlearning approach that jointly and separately employs two modalities of\nfeatures, to simplify the intra coding decision. First a set of features are\nextracted that use the existing DCT core of VVC, to assess the texture\ncharacteristics, and forms the first modality of data. This produces high\nquality features with almost no overhead. The distribution of intra modes at\nthe neighboring blocks is also used to form the second modality of data, which\nprovides statistical information about the frame. Second, a two-step feature\nreduction method is designed that reduces the size of feature set, such that a\nlightweight model with a limited number of parameters can be used to learn the\nintra mode decision task. Third, three separate training strategies are\nproposed (1) an offline training strategy using the first (single) modality of\ndata, (2) an online training strategy that uses the second (single) modality,\nand (3) a mixed online-offline strategy that uses bimodal learning. Finally, a\nlow-complexity encoding algorithms is proposed based on the proposed learning\nstrategies. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods can\nreduce up to 24% of encoding time, with a negligible loss of coding efficiency.\nMoreover, it is demonstrated how a bimodal learning strategy can boost the\nperformance of learning. Lastly, the proposed method has a very low\ncomputational overhead (0.2%), and uses existing components of a VVC encoder,\nwhich makes it much more practical compared to competing solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

The\nspike-like emission in the dynamic spectrum was enhanced by means of\nhigh-pass-time filtering. We identified a number of spikes in the NRH images.\nDue to the lower temporal resolution of the NRH, multiple spikes detected in\nthe dynamic spectrum appeared as single structures in the images. These spikes\nhad an average size of ~200\" and their observed brightness temperature was\n1.4-5.6x10^9K, providing a significant contribution to the emission of the\ntype-II burst front. At variance with a previous study on the type-IV\nassociated spikes, we found no systematic displacement between the spike\nemission and the emission between spikes. At 327.0 MHz, the type II emission\nwas located about 0.3 RSUN above the pre-existing continuum emission, which,\nwas located 0.1 RSUN above the western limb. This study indicates that the\nspike-like chains aligned along the type II burst MHD shock front are not a\nperturbation of the type II emission, as in the case of type IV spikes, but a\nmanifestation of the type II emission itself.

We present Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of 18\noptically selected local Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) to study the\nkinematics and distribution of the optical emission-line gas. MUSE observations\nreveal a distribution of gas morphologies including ten complex networks of\nfilaments extending up to 10 kpc to two compact (<3 kpc) and five extended (>5\nkpc) disk-dominated structures. Some rotating disks show rings and elongated\nstructures arising from the central disk. The kinematics of the stellar\ncomponent is mainly rotation-dominated, which is very different from the\ndisturbed kinematics and distribution found in the filamentary sources. The\nionized gas is kinematically decoupled from the stellar component for most\nsystems, suggesting an external origin for the gas. We also find that the\nHalpha luminosity correlates with the cold molecular mass. By exploring the\nthermodynamical properties of the hot atmospheres, we find that the filamentary\nsources and compact disks are found in systems with small central entropy\nvalues and tcool/teddy ratios. This suggests that, like for Brightest Cluster\nGalaxies in cool core clusters, the ionized gas are likely formed from hot halo\ngas condensations, consistently with the Chaotic Cold Accretion simulations (as\nshown via the C-ratio, Tat, and k-plot). We note that gaseous rotating disks\nare more frequent than in BCGs. An explanation for the origin of the gas in\nthose objects is a contribution to gas fueling by mergers or group satellites,\nas qualitatively hinted by some sources of the present sample. Nonetheless, we\ndiscuss the possibility that some extended disks could also be a transition\nstage in an evolutionary sequence including filaments, extended disks and\ncompact disks, as described by hot gas condensation models of cooling flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

This work presents an analytical calculation of\nthe SFF of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model (CSMM), which was first introduced to\ndescribe the intermediate level statistics of disordered electrons at the\nmobility edge. The CSMM is characterized by a parameter $ 0 \\leq q\\leq 1$,\nwhere the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE) is recovered for $q\\to 0$. The CSMM\nwas later found as a matrix model description of $U(N)$ Chern-Simons theory on\n$S^3$, which is dual to a topological string theory characterized by string\ncoupling $g_s=-\\log q$. The spectral form factor is proportional to a colored\nHOMFLY invariant of a $(2n,2)$-torus link with its two components carrying the\nfundamental and antifundamental representations, respectively. We check that\ntaking $N \\to \\infty$ whilst keeping $q<1$ reduces the connected SFF to an\nexact linear ramp of unit slope, confirming the main result from\narXiv:2012.11703 for the specific case of the CSMM. We then consider the `t\nHooft limit, where $N \\to \\infty$ and $q \\to 1^-$ such that $y = q^N $ remains\nfinite. As we take $q\\to 1^-$, this constitutes the opposite extreme of the CUE\nlimit. In the `t Hooft limit, the connected SFF turns into a remarkable\nsequence of polynomials which, as far as the authors are aware, have not\nappeared in the literature thus far. A gap opens in the spectrum and, after\nunfolding by a constant rescaling, the connected SFF approximates a linear ramp\nof unit slope for all $y$ except $y \\approx 1$, where the connected SFF goes to\nzero. We thus find that, although the CSMM was introduced to describe\nintermediate statistics and the `t Hooft limit is the opposite limit of the\nCUE, we still recover Wigner-Dyson universality for all $y$ except $y\\approx\n1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 13:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 14:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Our analysis shows that while GCR anisotropies are present over\na wide range of energies, there is a decreasing trend in the amplitude of\nsecond-order anisotropy with increasing energy during anisotropy episodes. A\nstronger pitch-angle scattering at the higher velocities is argued as a\npotential cause for this energy dependence. A possible cause for this velocity\ndependence arising from weak rigidity dependence of the scattering mean free\npath and resulting velocity-dominated scattering rate is discussed.

For example, LIME and SHAP can interpret what input features\ncontribute more to a classifier's output predictions. Different numerical\nmetrics (e.g., accuracy) can be used to easily compare two classifiers.\nHowever, few works can interpret the contribution of a data feature to a\nclassifier in comparison with its contribution to another classifier. This\ncomparative interpretation can help to disclose the fundamental difference\nbetween two classifiers, select classifiers in different feature conditions,\nand better ensemble two classifiers. To accomplish it, we propose a\nlearning-from-disagreement (LFD) framework to visually compare two\nclassification models. Specifically, LFD identifies data instances with\ndisagreed predictions from two compared classifiers and trains a discriminator\nto learn from the disagreed instances. As the two classifiers' training\nfeatures may not be available, we train the discriminator through a set of\nmeta-features proposed based on certain hypotheses of the classifiers to probe\ntheir behaviors. Interpreting the trained discriminator with the SHAP values of\ndifferent meta-features, we provide actionable insights into the compared\nclassifiers. Also, we introduce multiple metrics to profile the importance of\nmeta-features from different perspectives. With these metrics, one can easily\nidentify meta-features with the most complementary behaviors in two\nclassifiers, and use them to better ensemble the classifiers.

Intriguingly, it has been\nproposed that the extraction of this charged ash could create a radial electric\nfield, efficiently driving ExB rotation. However, existing theories ignore the\nresponse of the nonresonant particles, which play a critical role in enforcing\nmomentum conservation in quasilinear theory. Because cross-field charge\ntransport and momentum conservation are fundamentally linked, this\nnon-consistency throws the whole effect into question. Here, we review recent\ndevelopments that have largely resolved this question of rotation drive by\nalpha channeling. We build a simple, general, self-consistent quasilinear\ntheory for electrostatic waves, applicable to classic examples such as the\nbump-on-tail instability. As an immediate consequence, we show how waves can\ndrive currents in the absence of momentum injection even in a collisionless\nplasma. To apply this theory to the problem of ash extraction and rotation\ndrive, we develop the first linear theory able to capture the alpha channeling\nprocess. The resulting momentum-conserving linear-quasilinear theory reveals a\nfundamental difference between the reaction of nonresonant particles to plane\nwaves that grow in time, versus steady-state waves that have nonuniform spatial\nstructure, allowing rotation drive in the latter case while precluding it in\nthe former. This difference can be understood through two conservation laws,\nwhich demonstrate the local and global momentum conservation of the theory.\nFinally, we show how the oscillation-center theories often obscure the\ntime-dependent nonresonant recoil, but ultimately lead to similar results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

It carries a doping dependent but temperature\nindependent pseudogap at the Fermi surface, which causes the deviations from\nnormal metallic behavior, also in the specific heat. Here, a more coherent,\nunbiased assessment of all data, including planar Cu, is presented and\nconsequences are discussed, since the planar Cu data were collected and\nanalyzed prior to the O data. The main finding is that the planar Cu shifts for\none direction of the external magnetic field largely follow from the same\nstates and pseudogap. This explains the shift suppression stated more recently,\nwhich leads to the failure of the Korringa relation in contrast to an\nenhancement of the relaxation due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations\noriginally proposed. However, there is still the need for a second spin\ncomponent that appears to be associated with the Cu $3d(x^2-y^2)$ hole to\nexplain the complex Cu shift anisotropy and family dependence. Furthermore, it\nis argued that the planar Cu relaxation which was reported recently to be\nrather ubiquitous for the cuprates, must be related to this universal density\nof states and the second spin component, while not being affected by the simple\npseudogap. Thus, while this universal metallic density of states with a\npseudogap is also found in the planar Cu data, there is still need for a more\nelaborate scenario that eludes planar O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Superposition coding is exploited to allocate a fraction of the total\npower to each part before they are all multiplexed and transmitted\nsimultaneously, exploiting the entire available bandwidth. At the receiver, a\ntwo-step decoding process is proposed to decode the active light emitting diode\nindex before the complex symbol is retrieved.

CHIME observes a two degree\nwide stripe covering the entire meridian at any given moment, observing 3/4 of\nthe sky every day due to Earth rotation. An FX correlator utilizes FPGAs and\nGPUs to digitize and correlate the signals, with different correlation products\ngenerated for cosmological, fast radio burst, pulsar, VLBI, and 21 cm absorber\nbackends. For the cosmology backend, the $N_\\mathrm{feed}^2$ correlation matrix\nis formed for 1024 frequency channels across the band every 31 ms. A data\nreceiver system applies calibration and flagging and, for our primary\ncosmological data product, stacks redundant baselines and integrates for 10 s.\nWe present an overview of the instrument, its performance metrics based on the\nfirst three years of science data, and we describe the current progress in\ncharacterizing CHIME's primary beam response. We also present maps of the sky\nderived from CHIME data; we are using versions of these maps for a cosmological\nstacking analysis as well as for investigation of Galactic foregrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 21:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 03:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 02:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The impurity spectral function is determined in\nthe real-frequency domain, avoiding any potential errors due to the numerical\nanalytic continuation in previous $T$-matrix calculations and the small\nspectral broadening parameter used in variational calculations. In the\nweak-coupling limit, we find that the quasiparticle decay rate of both\nattractive and repulsive polarons does not increase significantly with\nincreasing temperature, and therefore Fermi polarons may remain well-defined\nfar above Fermi degeneracy. In contrast, near the unitary limit with strong\ncoupling, the decay rate of Fermi polarons rapidly increase and the\nquasiparticle picture breaks down close to the Fermi temperature. We analyze in\ndetail the recent ejection and injection radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy\nmeasurements, performed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and at\nEuropean Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy (LENS), respectively.

As a result, the measured\ndecay rate of Fermi polarons could be significantly larger than the calculated\nquasiparticle decay rate at zero momentum.

However, the optical properties of\nnear-surface glacier ice are not well known since most prior work has focused\non ice made in the laboratory or from deep cores.

We employ a photon-counting\ndetector to overcome the high losses associated with diffuse optics.

In order to use MCT to infer how species are coexisting, one must\nrelate a complex model (which simulates coexistence in the real world) to\nsimple models in which previously proposed explanations for coexistence have\nbeen codified. This can be accomplished in three steps: 1) relating the\nconstruct of coexistence to invasion growth rates, 2) mathematically\npartitioning the invasion growth rates into coexistence mechanisms (i.e.,\nclasses of explanations for coexistence), and 3) relating coexistence\nmechanisms to simple explanations for coexistence. Previous research has\nprimarily focused on step 2.

This research work\nexplores the application of deep learning models in an alternative approach\nthat uses the semantic segmentation of jet fires flames to extract main\ngeometrical attributes, relevant for fire risk assessments. A comparison is\nmade between traditional image processing methods and some state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models. It is found that the best approach is a deep learning\narchitecture known as UNet, along with its two improvements, Attention UNet and\nUNet++. The models are then used to segment a group of vertical jet flames of\nvarying pipe outlet diameters to extract their main geometrical\ncharacteristics. Attention UNet obtained the best general performance in the\napproximation of both height and area of the flames, while also showing a\nstatistically significant difference between it and UNet++. UNet obtained the\nbest overall performance for the approximation of the lift-off distances;\nhowever, there is not enough data to prove a statistically significant\ndifference between Attention UNet and UNet++.

There are many existing methods for\ndigital privacy protection, including network security, cryptography, and\naccess control. However, there is still a gap in the digital privacy protection\nlevels available for users. This paper studies the digital privacy divide (DPD)\nproblem in ICT systems. First, we introduce an online DPD study for\nunderstanding the DPD problem by collecting responses from 776 ICT users using\ncrowdsourcing task assignments. Second, we propose a factor analysis-based\nstatistical method for generating the DPD index from a set of observable DPD\nquestion variables. In particular, the DPD index provides one scaled measure\nfor the DPD gap by exploring the dimensionality of the eight questions in the\nDPD survey. Third, we introduce a DPD proportional odds model for analyzing the\nrelationship between the DPD status and the socio-demographic patterns of the\nusers. Our results show that the DPD survey meets the internal consistency\nreliability with rigorous statistical measures, e.g., Cronbach's $\\alpha=0.92$.\nFurthermore, the DPD index is shown to capture the underlying communality of\nall DPD variables. Finally, the DPD proportional odds model indicates a strong\nstatistical correlation between the DPD status and the age groups of the ICT\nusers. For example, we find that young users (15-32 years) are generally more\nconcerned about their digital privacy than senior ones (33 years and over).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Such control in the penetration depth for\na particular wavelength of light has been previously demonstrated using\nintegrated photon-trapping nanostructures. In this paper, we show that an\noptimized periodic nanostructure design can control the penetration depth for a\nwide range of visible and near-infrared wavelengths simultaneously. A\nconventional silicon APD structure suffers from high photocarrier loss due to\nrecombination for shorter wavelengths as they are absorbed near the surface\nregion, while silicon has low absorption efficiency for longer wavelengths.\nThis optimized nanostructure design allows shorter wavelengths of light to\npenetrate deeper into the device, circumventing recombination sites while\ntrapping the longer wavelengths in the thin silicon device by bending the\nvertically propagating light into horizontal modes. This manipulation of\npenetration depth improves the absorption in the device, increasing light\nsensitivity while nanostructures reduce the reflectance from the top surface.\nWhile delivery of light near the multiplication region reduces the\nphotogenerated carrier loss and shortens transit time, leading to high\nmultiplication gain in APDs and SPADs over a wide spectral range. These high\ngain APDs and SPADs will find their potential applications in Time-Of-Flight\nPositron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET), Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging\nMicroscopy (FLIM), and pulse oximetry where high detection efficiency and high\ngain-bandwidth is required over a multitude of wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 01:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Nevertheless, the challenge of\nhow to effectively learn GNNs with very few labels is still under-explored. As\none of the prevalent semi-supervised methods, pseudo-labeling has been proposed\nto explicitly address the label scarcity problem. It aims to augment the\ntraining set with pseudo-labeled unlabeled nodes with high confidence so as to\nre-train a supervised model in a self-training cycle. However, the existing\npseudo-labeling approaches often suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they\ntend to conservatively expand the label set by selecting only high-confidence\nunlabeled nodes without assessing their informativeness. Unfortunately, those\nhigh-confidence nodes often convey overlapping information with given labels,\nleading to minor improvements for model re-training. Second, these methods\nincorporate pseudo-labels to the same loss function with genuine labels,\nignoring their distinct contributions to the classification task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel informative pseudo-labeling framework, called\nInfoGNN, to facilitate learning of GNNs with extremely few labels. Our key idea\nis to pseudo label the most informative nodes that can maximally represent the\nlocal neighborhoods via mutual information maximization. To mitigate the\npotential label noise and class-imbalance problem arising from pseudo labeling,\nwe also carefully devise a generalized cross entropy loss with a class-balanced\nregularization to incorporate generated pseudo labels into model re-training.\nExtensive experiments on six real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and\nstrong self-supervised methods on graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 01:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

As a result, users' concerns about their security and safety\nissues arise along with the prevalence of smart home deployments. In a smart\nhome, various anomalies (such as fire or flooding) could happen, due to cyber\nattacks, device malfunctions, or human mistakes. These concerns motivate\nresearchers to propose various anomaly detection approaches. Existing works on\nsmart home anomaly detection focus on checking the sequence of IoT devices'\nevents but leave out the temporal information of events. This limitation\nprevents them to detect anomalies that cause delay rather than\nmissing/injecting events. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel\nanomaly detection method that takes the inter-event intervals into\nconsideration. We propose an innovative metric to quantify the temporal\nsimilarity between two event sequences. We design a mechanism to learn the\ntemporal patterns of event sequences of common daily activities.

However, there are several challenges in\napplying these language models to solve programming language-related problems\ndirectly. For instance, the shift of domain knowledge between natural language\n(NL) and programming language (PL) requires understanding the semantic and\nsyntactic information from the data from different perspectives. To this end,\nwe propose the AstBERT model, a pre-trained PL model aiming to better\nunderstand the financial codes using the abstract syntax tree (AST).\nSpecifically, we collect a sheer number of source codes (both Java and Python)\nfrom the Alipay code repository and incorporate both syntactic and semantic\ncode knowledge into our model through the help of code parsers, in which AST\ninformation of the source codes can be interpreted and integrated. We evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed model on three tasks, including code question\nanswering, code clone detection and code refinement.

For unsupervised graph representation methods\nsuch as graph contrastive learning, it is difficult to acquire labels in\nreal-world scenarios, making traditional supervised graph attack methods\ndifficult to be applied to test their robustness. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised gradient-based adversarial attack that does not rely on\nlabels for graph contrastive learning. We compute the gradients of the\nadjacency matrices of the two views and flip the edges with gradient ascent to\nmaximize the contrastive loss.

Observations reveal that shocks can be driven by fast coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) and play essential roles in particle accelerations. A critical\nratio, $\\delta$, derived from a shock standoff distance normalized by the\nradius of curvature (ROC) of a CME, allows us to estimate shock and ambient\ncoronal parameters. However, true ROCs of CMEs are difficult to measure due to\nobserved projection effects.\n  Aims. We investigate the formation mechanism of a shock driven by an\naspherical CME without evident lateral expansion. Through three-dimensional\n(3D) reconstructions without a priori assumptions of the object morphology, we\nestimate two principal ROCs of the CME surface and demonstrate how the\ndifference between two principal ROCs of the CME affects the estimate of the\ncoronal physical parameters.\n  Methods. The CME was observed by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and\nHeliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instruments and the Large Angle and\nSpectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). We used the mask-fitting method to obtain\nthe irregular 3D shape of the CME and reconstructed the shock surface using the\nbow-shock model. Through smoothings with fifth-order polynomial functions and\nMonte Carlo simulations, we calculated the ROCs at the CME nose.\n  Results. We find that (1) the maximal ROC is 2-4 times the minimal ROC of the\nCME. A significant difference between the CME ROCs implies that the assumption\nof one ROC of an aspherical CME could cause over-/under- estimations of the\nshock and coronal parameters. (2) The shock nose obeys the bow-shock formation\nmechanism, considering the constant standoff distance and the similar speed\nbetween the shock and CME around the nose. (3) With a more precise $\\delta$\ncalculated via 3D ROCs in space, we derive corona parameters at high latitudes\nof about -50$^{\\circ}$, including the Alfv{\\'e}n speed and the coronal magnetic\nfield strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 06:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Furthermore, by verifying the jamming performance on a\nhardware platform, it is shown that our method significantly improves the bit\nerror rate compared to other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

To address this problem, we introduce a\nmathematical model that accounts for both growth and, for the first time,\netching to describe the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal\ndichalcogenides. We consider several experimental observations that lead to a\ndifferential equation based on several terms corresponding to different supply\nmechanisms, describing the time-dependent change in flake size. By solving this\nequation and fitting two independently obtained experimental data sets, we find\nthat the flake area is the leading term in our model. We show that the\ndifferential equation can be solved analytically when only this term is\nconsidered, and that this solution provides a general description of complex\ngrowth and shrinkage phenomena. Physically, the dominance suggests that the\nsupply of material via the flake itself contributes most to its net growth.\nThis finding also implies a predominant interplay between insertion and release\nof atoms and their motion in the form of a highly dynamic process within the\nflake. In contrast to previous assumptions, we show that the flake edges do not\nplay an important role in the actual size change of the two-dimensional\ntransition metal dichalcogenide flakes during chemical vapour deposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 09:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

However, the richness of ImageNet imposes difficulties for\nresearchers to visually find any useful patterns of misclassification. Here, to\nhelp find these patterns, we propose \"Superclassing ImageNet dataset\". It is a\nsubset of ImageNet which consists of 10 superclasses, each containing 7-116\nrelated subclasses (e.g., 52 bird types, 116 dog types). By training neural\nnetworks on this dataset, we found that: (i) Misclassifications are rarely\nacross superclasses, but mainly among subclasses within a superclass. (ii)\nEnsemble networks trained each only on subclasses of a given superclass perform\nbetter than the same network trained on all subclasses of all superclasses.\nHence, we propose a two-stage Super-Sub framework, and demonstrate that: (i)\nThe framework improves overall classification performance by 3.3%, by first\ninferring a superclass using a generalist superclass-level network, and then\nusing a specialized network for final subclass-level classification. (ii)\nAlthough the total parameter storage cost increases to a factor N+1 for N\nsuperclasses compared to using a single network, with finetuning, delta and\nquantization aware training techniques this can be reduced to 0.2N+1. Another\nadvantage of this efficient implementation is that the memory cost on the GPU\nduring inference is equivalent to using only one network. The reason is we\ninitiate each subclass-level network through addition of small parameter\nvariations (deltas) to the superclass-level network. (iii) Finally, our\nframework promises to be more scalable and generalizable than the common\nalternative of simply scaling up a vanilla network in size, since very large\nnetworks often suffer from overfitting and gradient vanishing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 10:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

In this paper, we\naddress the problem of JSON similarity lookup queries: given a query document\nand a distance threshold $\\tau$, retrieve all JSON documents that are within\n$\\tau$ from the query document. Due to its recursive definition, JSON data are\nnaturally represented as trees. Different from other hierarchical formats such\nas XML, JSON supports both ordered and unordered sibling collections within a\nsingle document. This feature poses a new challenge to the tree model and\ndistance computation. We propose JSON tree, a lossless tree representation of\nJSON documents, and define the JSON Edit Distance (JEDI), the first edit-based\ndistance measure for JSON documents. We develop an algorithm, called QuickJEDI,\nfor computing JEDI by leveraging a new technique to prune expensive sibling\nmatchings.

In\nhigh temperature cuprate superconductors, the existence of the electron\ncoupling with phonons and other boson modes and its role in producing high\ntemperature superconductivity remain unclear. The evidence of the\nelectron-boson coupling mainly comes from the angle-resolved photoemission\n(ARPES) observations of the ~70meV nodal dispersion kink and the ~40meV\nantinodal kink. However, the reported results are sporadic and the nature of\nthe involved bosons are still under debate. Here we report new findings of\nubiquitous two coexisting electron-mode couplings in cuprate superconductors.\nBy taking ultra-high resolution laser-based ARPES measurements, combined with\nthe improved second derivative analysis method, we discovered that the\nelectrons are coupled simultaneously with two sharp phonon modes with energies\nof ~70meV and ~40meV in different superconductors with different doping levels,\nover the entire momentum space and at different temperatures above and below\nthe superconducting transition temperature.

Key to these fields\nis the use of information asymmetry across architectural modules to bias which\nskills are learnt.

However, in a road traffic junction\nscenario, the vehicle typically receives partial observations from the\ntransportation environment, while DRL needs to rely on long-term rewards to\ntrain a reliable model by maximising the cumulative rewards, which may take the\nrisk when exploring new actions and returning either a positive reward or a\npenalty in the case of collisions.

Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and\nenergy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with\nit enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed\nand stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for\nlocomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and\nwater visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step~-- or are\nmissing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can\ndegrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent\nsurfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and\ngeneral solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception.\nThis severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel\nout the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly.

In this paper, we focus our\nattention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from one modality\n(e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g., image). Most\nof the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems require a high number\nof labeled training samples and also do not allow fast and memory-efficient\nretrieval due to their intrinsic characteristics. These issues limit the\napplicability of the existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale\napplications in RS. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel\ndeep unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for RS\ntext-image retrieval. The proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1)\nfeature extraction module (which extracts deep representations of the\ntext-image modalities); and 2) hashing module (which learns to generate\ncross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations). Within the\nhashing module, we introduce a novel multi-objective loss function including:\ni) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in both intra-\nand inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is enforced\nacross two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; iii)\nbinarization objectives for generating representative hash codes.

In the process of LPC, pixel conversion is performed\nby region; that is, pixels in the same regions are converted to the same\nconversion values, which will occupy a smaller size, and then the available\nroom can be reserved to accommodate additional data.

To this end, the proposed\nHDhuman uses a human reconstruction network with a pixel-aligned spatial\ntransformer and a rendering network that uses geometry-guided pixel-wise\nfeature integration to achieve high-quality human reconstruction and rendering.\nThe designed pixel-aligned spatial transformer calculates the correlations\nbetween the input views, producing human reconstruction results with\nhigh-frequency details. Based on the surface reconstruction results, the\ngeometry-guided pixel-wise visibility reasoning provides guidance for\nmulti-view feature integration, enabling the rendering network to render\nhigh-quality images at 2k resolution on novel views. Unlike previous neural\nrendering works that always need to train or fine-tune an independent network\nfor a different scene, our method is a general framework that is able to\ngeneralize to novel subjects. Experiments show that our approach outperforms\nall the prior generic or specific methods on both synthetic data and real-world\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 13:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 12:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The key idea is to augment the\nlearner with an automatic control system that would be able to perform the\ntrained activity if it had direct access to the learner's body as an actuator.\nThe aiding system will supply the following visual cues to the learner: 1.\nFeedback of the current body posture; 2.

Overall, this\nheterogeneity level requires complex hardware and a full-fledged software stack\nto orchestrate the execution and exploit platform features. For this reason,\nenabling agile design space exploration becomes a crucial asset for this new\nclass of low-power SoCs. In this scenario, high-level simulators play an\nessential role in breaking the speed and design effort bottlenecks of\ncycle-accurate simulators and FPGA prototypes, respectively, while preserving\nfunctional and timing accuracy.

Omicron is the fifth variant of\nconcern (VOC), which comprises more than 10 mutations in the receptor-binding\ndomain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the lack of extensive research\nregarding Omicron has raised the need to establish correlations to understand\nthis variant by structural comparisons. Here, we evaluate, correlate, and\ncompare its genomic sequences through an immunoinformatic approach with wild\nand mutant RBD forms of the spike protein to understand its epidemiological\ncharacteristics and responses towards existing drugs for better patient\nmanagement. Our computational analyses provided insights into infectious and\npathogenic trails of the Omicron variant. In addition, while the analysis\nrepresented South Africa's Omicron variant being similar to the\nhighly-infectious B.1.620 variant, mutations within the prominent proteins are\nhypothesized to alter its pathogenicity. Moreover, docking evaluations revealed\nsignificant differences in binding affinity with human receptors, ACE2 and\nNRP1. Owing to its characteristics of rendering existing treatments\nineffective, we evaluated the drug efficacy against their target protein\nencoded in the Omicron through molecular docking approach. Most of the tested\ndrugs were proven to be effective.

Given the scope of the\nBeyondPlanck analysis, a limited set of data is included in the component\nseparation process, leading to foreground parameter degeneracies. In order to\nproperly constrain the Galactic foreground parameters, we improve upon the\nprevious $\\texttt{Commander}$ component separation implementation by adding a\nsuite of algorithmic techniques. These algorithms are designed to improve the\nstability and computational efficiency for weakly constrained posterior\ndistributions. These are: 1) joint foreground spectral parameter and amplitude\nsampling, building on ideas from Miramare; 2) component-based monopole\ndetermination; 3) joint spectral parameter and monopole sampling; and 4)\napplication of informative spatial priors for component amplitude maps.

The presence of WBPs\ncan be efficiently quantified using recently introduced shadow tomography of\nthe quantum state with a classical computer. We demonstrate that avoidance of\nWBPs suffices to ensure sizable gradients in the initialization. In addition,\nwe demonstrate that decreasing the gradient step size, guided by the entropies\nallows to avoid WBPs during the optimization process. This paves the way for\nefficient barren plateau free optimization on near-term devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 10:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Consequently, they achieve unsatisfactory performance in downstream\ntasks such as classification, segmentation, etc. To fill this gap, we propose a\ngeneric Contour-Perturbed Reconstruction Network (CP-Net), which can\neffectively guide self-supervised reconstruction to learn semantic content in\nthe point cloud, and thus promote discriminative power of point cloud\nrepresentation. First, we introduce a concise contour-perturbed augmentation\nmodule for point cloud reconstruction. With guidance of geometry disentangling,\nwe divide point cloud into contour and content components. Subsequently, we\nperturb the contour components and preserve the content components on the point\ncloud. As a result, self supervisor can effectively focus on semantic content,\nby reconstructing the original point cloud from such perturbed one.

Thus, existing researches on adopting options in multi-agent scenarios\nstill rely on single-agent option discovery and fail to directly discover the\njoint options that can improve the connectivity of the joint state space of\nagents. In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to directly compute\nmulti-agent options with collaborative exploratory behaviors among the agents,\nwhile still enjoying the ease of decomposition.

Using these two\nfeature-representation approaches, we train Machine-Learning (ML) models, for\nthe purpose of predicting the correctness of a response and of an answer. The\ntrained models are used as the basis of an ML-based aggregation methodology\nthat, contrary to other ML-based techniques, has the advantage of being a\n\"one-shot\" technique, independent from the crowd-specific composition and\npersonal record, and adaptive to various types of situations. To evaluate our\nmethodology, we collected 2490 responses for different tasks, which we used for\nfeature engineering and for the training of ML models. We tested our\nfeature-representation approaches through the performance of our proposed\nML-based aggregation methods. The results show an increase of 20% to 35% in the\nsuccess rate, compared to the use of standard rule-based aggregation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Such brittleness erodes our trust in CNN-based automated\ndiagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we describe a\nsimple and effective method to learn robust CNNs for left ventricle (LV)\nquantification, including cavity and myocardium areas, directional dimensions,\nand regional wall thicknesses. The key to the success of our approach is the\nuse of the biologically-inspired steerable pyramid transform (SPT) as fixed\nfront-end processing, which brings three computational advantages to LV\nquantification. First, the basis functions of SPT match the anatomical\nstructure of the LV as well as the geometric characteristics of the estimated\nindices. Second, SPT enables sharing a CNN across different orientations as a\nform of parameter regularization, and explicitly captures the scale variations\nof the LV in a natural way. Third, the residual highpass subband can be\nconveniently discarded to further encourage robust feature learning. A concise\nand effective metric, named Robustness Ratio, is proposed to evaluate the\nrobustness under various input perturbations. Extensive experiments on 145\ncardiac sequences show that our SPT-augmented method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy, but is\nsignificantly more robust under input perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 06:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

Since more than a hundred\nthousand patents were filed by similarly as many inventors during the\nobservational period, this amounts to a massive bipartite network, too large to\nbe analysed as a whole. Therefore, we decompose the bipartite network by\nutilising an essential characteristic of the network: most inventors tend to\nstay active only for a relatively short period, while new ones become active at\neach point in time. Consequently, the adjacency matrix carries several\nstructural zeros. To accommodate for these, we propose a bipartite variant of\nthe Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) in which we let the actor\nset vary over time, differentiate between inventors that already submitted\npatents and those that did not, and account for pairwise statistics of\ninventors. Our results corroborate the hypotheses that inventor characteristics\nand knowledge flows play a crucial role in the dynamics of invention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 11:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The empirical results based on data collected from the OECD\ndatabase from 1985-2017 and causal impact using a Bayesian structural\ntime-series model (proposed by Google) point towards a conclusion that joining\nthe EU has had a significant impact on patents performance in Romania, Estonia,\nPoland, Czech Republic, Croatia and Lithuania, although in the latter two\ncountries the impact was negative. For the rest of the EU-13 countries there is\nno significant effect on patent performance.

We propose a \"top-down\" remnant mass\nprescription where we remove mass from the star for each possible mass-loss\nmechanism, instead of relying on the fallback onto a \"proto-compact-object\" to\nget the final mass. For one of these mass-loss mechanisms, we fit the\nmetallicity-dependent mass lost to pulsational-pair instability supernovae from\nnumerical simulations. By imposing no mass loss in the absence of pulses, our\napproach recovers the existing compact object masses prescription at the low\nmass end and ensures continuity across the\ncore-collapse/pulsational-pair-instability regime. Our remnant mass\nprescription can be extended to include other mass-loss mechanisms at the final\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 21:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We uniquely model the\nreinforcement learning environment as a joint and connected composition of\nusers and geospatial contexts (POIs, POI categories, functional zones). An\nevent that a user visits a POI in stream updates the states of both users and\ngeospatial contexts; the agent perceives the updated environment state to make\nonline recommendations. Specifically, we model a mixed-user event stream by\nunifying all users, visits, and geospatial contexts as a dynamic knowledge\ngraph stream, in order to model human-human, geo-human, geo-geo interactions.\nWe design an exit mechanism to address the expired information challenge,\ndevise a meta-path method to address the recommendation candidate generation\nchallenge, and develop a new deep policy network structure to address the\nvarying action space challenge, and, finally, propose an effective adversarial\ntraining method for optimization.
