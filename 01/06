One major application is to intracellular diffusion, where\nthe targets typically represent some form of reactive biochemical substrate.\nMost studies of the narrow capture problem treat the target boundaries as\ntotally absorbing. In this paper, we analyze the three-dimensional narrow\ncapture problem in the more realistic case of partially reactive target\nboundaries. We begin by considering classical Robin boundary conditions.\nMatching inner and outer solutions of the single-particle probability density,\nwe derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each\nreactive surface in powers of $\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon \\rho$ is a given\ntarget size. In turn, the fluxes determine the splitting probabilities for\ntarget absorption. We then extend our analysis to more general types of\nreactive targets by combining matched asymptotic analysis with an\nencounter-based formulation of diffusion-mediated surface reactions. That is,\nwe derive an asymptotic expansion of the joint probability density for particle\nposition and the boundary local time. The effects of surface reactions are then\nincorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.\nFinally, we illustrate the theory by exploring how the leading-order\ncontributions to the splitting probabilities depend on the choice of surface\nreactions. In particular, we show that there is an effective renormalization of\nthe target radius of the form $\\rho\\rightarrow \\rho-\\widetilde{\\Psi}(1/\\rho)$,\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\Psi}$ is the Laplace transform of the stopping local time\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 16:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

In both cases, process stability and resulting part\nquality depend on dynamic interactions between powder particles and a fluid\nphase, i.e., molten metal or liquid binder. The present work proposes a\nversatile computational modeling framework for simulating such coupled\nmicrofluid-powder dynamics problems involving thermo-capillary flow and\nreversible phase transitions. In particular, a liquid and a gas phase are\ninteracting with a solid phase that consists of a substrate and mobile powder\nparticles while simultaneously considering temperature-dependent surface\ntension and wetting effects. In case of laser-metal interactions, the effect of\nrapid evaporation is incorporated through additional mechanical and thermal\ninterface fluxes. All phase domains are spatially discretized using smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics. The method's Lagrangian nature is beneficial in the\ncontext of dynamically changing interface topologies. Special care is taken in\nthe formulation of phase transitions, which is crucial for the robustness of\nthe computational scheme. While the underlying model equations are of a very\ngeneral nature, the proposed framework is especially suitable for the mesoscale\nmodeling of various AM processes. To this end, the generality and robustness of\nthe computational modeling framework is demonstrated by several\napplication-motivated examples representing the specific AM processes binder\njetting, material jetting, directed energy deposition, and powder bed fusion.\nAmong others, it is shown how the dynamic impact of droplets in binder jetting\nor the evaporation-induced recoil pressure in powder bed fusion leads to powder\nmotion, distortion of the powder packing structure, and powder particle\nejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 16:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 11:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Existing energy system\nmodels, however, fail to consider bilateral electricity markets while in\nreality, these constitute a major part of all energy trades. In this paper, we\npropose an improved energy system model that endogenously considers mixed\nbilateral and pool markets. In this model, we also introduce three externality\ncost items that account for the social cost of technologies, carbon\ntaxes/renewable energy subsidies, and the bilateral product differentiation in\nthe bilateral market, respectively.

We define the observed NLR\nradius as the farthest distance from the nucleus within which both\n[Oiii]/H\\beta and [Nii]/H\\alpha ratios fall in the AGN region of the BPT\ndiagram and the H\\alpha equivalent width is required to be larger than 3.0\\AA.\nThe extent of the KDR is defined as the distance from the nucleus within which\nthe AGN hosts galaxies shows a more disturbed gas kinematics than the control\ngalaxies. The kinematics derived from the [Oiii] line profiles reveal that, on\naverage, the most luminous AGN (L[Oiii] > 3.8 * 10^40 erg s^-1) possess higher\nresidual difference between the gaseous and stellar velocities and velocities\ndispersion than their control galaxies. Spatially resolved NLR's and KDR's were\nfound in 55 and 46 AGN host galaxies, with corrected radii 0.2 < r_KDR,c < 2.3\nkpc and 0.4 < r_NLR,c < 10.1 kpc, with a relation between the two given by log\nr_KDR,c = (0.53\\pm0.12) log r_NLR,c + (1.07\\pm0.22), respectively. The\nextension of the KDR corresponds to about 30 per cent of that of the NLR.\nAssuming that the KDR is due to an AGN outflow, we have estimated ionised gas\nmass outflow rates that range between 10^-5 and \\approx 1 Myr^-1, and kinetic\npowers that range from 10^34 to 10^40 erg s^-1. Comparing the power of the AGN\nionised outflows with the AGN luminosities, they are always below the 0.05\nL_AGN model threshold for having an important feedback effect on their\nrespective host galaxies. The mass outflow rates (and power) of our AGN sample\ncorrelate with their luminosities, populating the lowest AGN luminosity range\nof the correlations previously found for more powerful sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 16:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Gap junctions are\nprevalent in most animal organs and tissues, providing a direct diffusion\npathway for both electrical and chemical communication between cells. Most\nanalytical models of gap junctions focus on the steady-state diffusive flux and\nthe associated effective diffusivity. Here we investigate the relaxation to\nsteady state in terms of the so-called local accumulation time. The latter is\ncommonly used to estimate the time to form a protein concentration gradient\nduring morphogenesis. The basic idea is to treat the fractional deviation from\nthe steady-state concentration as a cumulative distribution for the local\naccumulation time. One of the useful features of the local accumulation time is\nthat it takes into account the fact that different spatial regions can relax at\ndifferent rates. We consider both static and dynamic gap junction models. The\nformer treats the gap junction as a resistive channel with effective\npermeability $\\mu$, whereas the latter represents the gap junction as a\nstochastic gate that randomly switches between an open and closed state. The\nlocal accumulation time is calculated by solving the diffusion equation in\nLaplace space and then taking the small-$s$ limit. We show that the\naccumulation time is a monotonically increasing function of spatial position,\nwith a jump discontinuity at the gap junction. This discontinuity vanishes in\nthe limit $\\mu \\rightarrow \\infty$ for a static junction and $\\beta \\rightarrow\n0$ for a stochastically-gated junction, where $\\beta$ is the rate at which the\ngate closes.\n  Finally, our results are generalized to the case of a linear array of cells\nwith nearest neighbor gap junction coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 16:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Given the high densities\nin these systems, radiative shocks are expected to form. However, in the\npresence of high velocities, the formation of adiabatic shocks is also\npossible. A case of interest is when the two types of shocks occur\nsimultaneously. These dense jets/outflows are excellent candidates for\nlaboratory experiments as demonstrated by MHD scaling. We aim at studying the\ncombination of adiabatic and radiative shocks in these systems. We focus on\ndetermining the conditions under which this combination is feasible together\nwith its physical implications. We perform an analytical study of the shocks in\nboth types of sources for a set of parameters. The hydrodynamical evolution of\na jet colliding with an ambient medium is studied with 2D numerical simulations\nconfirming our initial theoretical estimates. We show that for a wide set of\nparameters the combination of an adiabatic and a radiative shock is possible at\nthe working surface of the termination region in jets from young stars and\nnovae outflows. We find that instabilities are developed at the contact\ndiscontinuity, mixing the shocked materials. Also, we explore the MHD parameter\nscaling required for studying protostellar jets and novae outflows using\nlaboratory experiments on laser facilities. The coexistence of an adiabatic and\na radiative shock is expected at the termination region of protostellar jets\nand novae outflows. This scenario is very promising for particle acceleration\nand gamma-ray emission. The parameters for scaled laboratory experiments are\nvery much in line with plasma conditions achievable in currently operating\nhigh-power laser facilities.

In this paper, we compare such a\nplasma with one arising from two pre-magnetised plasma jets whose creation is\nidentical save for the addition of a strong external magnetic field imposed by\na pulsed magnetic field generator (`MIFEDS'). We investigate the differences\nbetween the two turbulent systems using a Thomson-scattering diagnostic, X-ray\nself-emission imaging and proton radiography. The Thomson-scattering spectra\nand X-ray images suggest that the presence of the external magnetic field has a\nlimited effect on the plasma dynamics in the experiment. While the presence of\nthe external magnetic field induces collimation of the flows in the colliding\nplasma jets and the initial strengths of the magnetic fields arising from the\ninteraction between the colliding jets are significantly larger as a result of\nthe external field, the energy and morphology of the stochastic magnetic fields\npost-amplification are indistinguishable.

One major area\nof improvement is using machine learning models to represent the complex\nrelationship between the mean flow field gradients and the Reynolds stress\ntensor. In the present work, modifications to improve the stability of previous\noptimal eddy viscosity approaches for RANS simulations are presented and\nevaluated. The optimal eddy viscosity is reformulated with a non-negativity\nconstraint, which promotes numerical stability.

Study design and setting: We use\ndata from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for\nRheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) to supplement RCT evidence obtained from the\nliterature, by emulating target trials of treatment sequences to estimate\ntreatment effects in each line of therapy. Treatment effects estimates from the\ntarget trials inform a bivariate network meta-analysis (NMA) of first and\nsecond-line treatments. Results: Summary data were obtained from 21 trials of\nbiologic therapies including 2 for second-line treatment and results from six\nemulated target trials of both treatment lines. Bivariate NMA resulted in a\ndecrease in uncertainty around the effectiveness estimates of the second-line\ntherapies, when compared to the results of univariate NMA, and allowed for\npredictions of treatment effects not evaluated in second-line RCTs. Conclusion:\nBivariate NMA provides effectiveness estimates for all treatments in first- and\nsecond-line, including predicted effects in second-line where these estimates\ndid not exist in the data. This novel methodology may have further\napplications, for example for bridging networks of trials in children and\nadults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 17:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

The\ndevelopment of new modeling tools which are able to account for the\nmultidisciplinary nature of this problem becomes extremely relevant in order to\nmeet both structure and control performance criteria. This paper proposes a\nnovel methodology to analytically model large truss structures in a\nsub-structuring framework. A three dimensional unit cube element has been\ndesigned and validated with a Finite Element commercial software. This model is\ncomposed by multiple two-dimensional sub-mechanisms assembled using\nblock-diagram models. This constitutes the building block for constructing\ncomplex truss structures by repetitions of the element. The accurate vibration\ndescription of the system and its minimal representation, as well as the\npossibility of accounting for parametric uncertainties in its mechanical\nparameters, make it an appropriate tool to perform robust Structure/Control\nco-design. In order to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach, a\nco-design study case is proposed by combining a multidisciplinary optimization\napproach based on particle swarm algorithm and multiple structured robust\nHinf-synthesis. This has been used to optimize the pointing performances of an\nhigh pointing antenna, minimizing the perturbations coming from the Solar Array\nMechanisms (SADM) of two solar panels, performing active control by means of\nmultiple proof mass actuators, and simultaneously reduce the mass of the\ntruss-structure which connects the antenna to the main spacecraft body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 17:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

We study the task of estimating\nunknown parameters encoded in a channel in the sequential setting. A sequential\nstrategy is the most general way to use a channel multiple times. Our goal is\nto establish lower bounds (called Cramer-Rao bounds) on the estimation error.\nThe bounds we develop are universally applicable; i.e., they apply to all\npermissible quantum dynamics. We consider the use of catalysts to enhance the\npower of a channel estimation strategy. This is termed amortization. The power\nof a channel for a parameter estimation is determined by its Fisher\ninformation. Thus, we study how much a catalyst quantum state can enhance the\nFisher information of a channel by defining the amortized Fisher information.\nWe establish our bounds by proving that for certain Fisher information\nquantities, catalyst states do not improve the performance of a sequential\nestimation protocol compared to a parallel one. The technical term for this is\nan amortization collapse. We use this to establish bounds when estimating one\nparameter, or multiple parameters simultaneously. Our bounds apply universally\nand we also cast them as optimization problems. For the single parameter case,\nwe establish bounds for general quantum channels using both the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative (SLD) Fisher information and the right logarithmic\nderivative (RLD) Fisher information. The task of estimating multiple parameters\nsimultaneously is more involved than the single parameter case, because the\nCramer-Rao bounds take the form of matrix inequalities. We establish a scalar\nCramer-Rao bound for multiparameter channel estimation using the RLD Fisher\ninformation. For both single and multiparameter estimation, we provide a no-go\ncondition for the so-called Heisenberg scaling using our RLD-based bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 17:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

A defining characteristic of\nexternal-memory data structures is that there is a stark asymmetry between\nqueries and inserts/updates/deletes: by making the former slightly\nasymptotically slower, one can make the latter significantly asymptotically\nfaster (even allowing for operations with sub-constant amortized I/Os). This\nasymmetry makes it so that rotation-based search trees are not optimal (or even\nclose to optimal) in insert/update/delete-heavy external-memory workloads. To\nstudy dynamic optimality for such workloads, one must consider a different\nclass of data structures.\n  The natural class of data structures to consider are what we call\nbuffered-propagation trees. Such trees can adapt dynamically to the locality\nproperties of an input sequence in order to optimize the interactions between\ndifferent inserts/updates/deletes and queries. We also present a new form of\nbeyond-worst-case analysis that allows for us to formally study a continuum\nbetween static and dynamic optimality. Finally, we give a novel data structure,\ncalled the \\jellotree, that is statically optimal and that achieves dynamic\noptimality for a large natural class of inputs defined by our beyond-worst-case\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 18:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

However, as a non-contact proximity sensing scheme\nis easily affected by the disturbance of peripheral objects or surroundings, it\nrequires considerable sensitive data processing than contact sensing, limiting\nthe use of its further utilization.

In this\nstudy, we investigate the suppression of thermoacoustic instability in a lean\npremixed, laboratory-scale combustor using experiments and analysis. Starting\nwith a self-excited thermoacoustic instability in the combustor, we find that a\nprogressive increase in the swirler rotation rate transitions the system from\nthermoacoustic instability to the suppressed state through a state of\nintermittency. To model such transition while also quantifying the underlying\nsynchronization characteristics, we extend the model of Dutta et al. [Phys.\nRev.

The assumption that coupling strength among the oscillators\nis a linear combination of acoustic and swirler rotation frequency is justified\n\\textit{a posteriori}. The link between the model and experimental results is\nquantitatively established by implementing an optimization algorithm for model\nparameter estimation. We show that the model replicates the bifurcation\ncharacteristics, time series, probability density function (PDF), and power\nspectral density (PSD) of the various dynamical states observed during the\ntransition to the suppressed state, to excellent accuracy. Specifically, the\nmodel captures the change in the PDF of pressure and heat release rate\nfluctuations from a bimodal distribution during thermoacoustic instability to a\nunimodal distribution during suppression.

We find generally\nthat relaxation of engineered symmetry generators proceeds by i) an initial\nrelaxation on microscopic timescales to a prethermal plateau whose height is\nindependent of noise, ii) a linear relaxation regime with a noise-dependent\nrate, followed by iii) a slow logarithmic relaxation regime that is only\npresent for quasiperiodic noise. We glean the essential features of these\nregimes via scaling collapses and show that they can be generally explained by\nthe spectral properties of the various noise waveforms considered. In\nparticular, the quasiperiodic noise is characterised by highly time dependent\nspectrum with a noise floor that mimics white noise, and peaks that grow\nsharper with time.

The star-formation sites that are\nthe building blocks of clusters start out mass segregated with one or a few\nmassive stars at their center. As they merge the newly formed clusters maintain\nthis feature, causing them to have mass-segregated substructures without\nthemselves being centrally condensed. The merged clusters relax to a centrally\ncondensed mass segregated configuration through dynamical interactions between\ntheir members, but this process does not finish before feedback expels the\nremaining gas from the cluster. In the simulated runs the gas-free clusters\nthen become unbound and break up.

In other scenarios, e.g.,\nsimultaneous estimation of the couplings, the light is usually the optimal\nsubsystem. This can be explained as light is the mediator between the other two\nsubsystems.

Motivated by the recent advances in representation\nlearning with deep networks, this paper revisits the use of subspace alignment\nfor UDA and proposes a novel adaptation algorithm that consistently leads to\nimproved generalization.

Furthermore,\nsubspace alignment leads to intrinsically well-regularized models that\ndemonstrate strong generalization even in the challenging partial DA setting.\nFinally, the design of our UDA framework inherently supports progressive\nadaptation to new target domains at test-time, without requiring retraining of\nthe model from scratch. In summary, powered by powerful feature learners and an\neffective optimization strategy, we establish subspace-based DA as a highly\neffective approach for visual recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 20:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

To this end, nine commercial size\nexperiments were conducted to test the effect of a phytogenic feed additive and\nthree approaches were applied to the data. Materials and Methods: In all\nexperiments, 1-day-old male Cobb 500 chicks were used and fed corn-soybean meal\ndiets. Two dietary treatments were tested: T1, control diet and T2, control\ndiet + feed additive at a 0.05% inclusion rate. The experimental units were\nbroiler houses (7 experiments), floor pens (1 experiment) and cages (1\nexperiment). The response variables were final body weight, feed intake, feed\nconversion ratio, mortality and production efficiency. Analyses of variance of\ndata from each and all the experiments were performed using SAS under\ncompletely randomized non-blocked or blocked designs, respectively. The\nmeta-analyses were performed in R programming language. Results: No\nstatistically significant effects were found in the evaluated variables in any\nof the independent experiments (p>0.12), nor following the application of a\nblock design (p>0.08).

Estimates to date have typically\nassumed that the Milky Way's stellar disc is axisymmetric and in a\nsteady-state. Yet the Milky Way disc is neither, exhibiting prominent spiral\narms and a bar, and vertical and radial oscillations. We assess the impact of\nthese assumptions on determinations of the local dark matter density by\napplying a free-form, steady-state, Jeans method to two different N-body\nsimulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. In one, the galaxy has experienced an\nancient major merger, similar to the hypothesized Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus; in\nthe other, the galaxy is perturbed more recently by the repeated passage and\nslow merger of a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy. We assess the impact of each of\nthe terms in the Jeans-Poisson equations on our ability to correctly extract\nthe local dark matter density from the simulated data. We find that common\napproximations employed in the literature - axisymmetry and a locally flat\nrotation curve - can lead to significant systematic errors of up to a factor\n~1.5 in the recovered surface mass density ~2kpc above the disc plane, implying\na fractional error on the local dark matter density of order unity. However,\nonce we add in the tilt term and the rotation curve term in our models, we\nobtain an unbiased estimate, consistent with the true value within our 95%\nconfidence intervals for realistic 20% uncertainties on the baryonic surface\ndensity of the disc. Other terms - the axial tilt, 2:nd Poisson and time\ndependent terms - contribute less than 10% to the local dark matter density\n(given current data) and can be safely neglected for now. In the future, as\nmore data become available, these terms will need to be included in the\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 21:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

MPS are a class of\nphysically-relevant quantum states which arise in the study of quantum\nmany-body systems.

The proposed method\nconsists of three stages: (1) the contrast-limited adaptive histogram\nequalization (CLAHE) is applied to the original images and concatenated to the\nextracted edges in order to create 4D images; (2) the patches of size 80 * 80 *\n80 * 2 are randomly selected from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted patches\nare passed into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the lesions.\nFinally, the proposed method was compared to previous studies of the same\ndataset. Results: The current study evaluates the model, with a test set of\nISIB challenge data. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly surpasses existing methods in terms of Dice similarity and\nAbsolute Volume Difference while the proposed method use just one modality\n(FLAIR) to segment the lesions. Conclusions: The authors have introduced an\nautomated approach to segment the lesions which is based on, at most, two\nmodalities as an input. The proposed architecture is composed of convolution,\ndeconvolution, and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results\nshow, the proposed method outperforms well compare to other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 21:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

However, due to\nrecent side-channel attacks, the commercial secure processors failed to deliver\nthe promises of a secure isolated execution environment. Sensitive information\ninside the secure execution environment always gets leaked via side channels.\nThis work considers the most powerful software-based side-channel attackers,\ni.e., an All Digital State Observing (ADSO) adversary who can observe all\ndigital states, including all digital states in secure enclaves. Traditional\nsignature schemes are not secure in ADSO adversarial model. We introduce a new\ncryptographic primitive called One-Time Signature with Secret Key Exposure\n(OTS-SKE), which ensures no one can forge a valid signature of a new message or\nnonce even if all secret session keys are leaked. OTS-SKE enables us to sign\nattestation reports securely under the ADSO adversary. We also minimize the\ntrusted computing base by introducing a secure co-processor into the system,\nand the interaction between the secure co-processor and the attestation\nprocessor is unidirectional. That is, the co-processor takes no inputs from the\nprocessor and only generates secret keys for the processor to fetch. Our\nexperimental results show that the signing of OTS-SKE is faster than that of\nElliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used in Intel SGX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 21:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

We turn to natural systems for inspiration\nsince they inherently demonstrate network pruning with the consequence of\nyielding more efficient networks for a specific set of tasks. This bio-inspired\napproach allows us to leverage network pruning to optimally sparsify a DNN\narchitecture in order to perform flight tasks with as few neural connections as\npossible, however, there are limits to sparsification. Specifically, as the\nnumber of connections falls below a critical threshold, flight performance\ndrops considerably. We develop sparsification paradigms and explore their\nlimits for control tasks. Monte Carlo simulations also quantify the statistical\ndistribution of network weights during pruning given initial random weights of\nthe DNNs. We demonstrate that on average, the network can be pruned to retain\napproximately 7% of the original network weights, with statistical\ndistributions quantified at each layer of the network. Overall, this work shows\nthat sparsely connected DNNs are capable of predicting the forces required to\nfollow flight trajectories.

The main cause is that, in terms\nof network architectures, they could not capture long-term rain streak\ninformation in the time-lapse data during training owing to the lack of memory\ncomponents.

Previously, this lag has been attributed to a combined effect of\noutward convecting solar wind and inward propagating GCRs. However, the lag's\namplitude and its solar-cycle dependence are still not fully understood (Ross &\nChaplin, 2019). By investigating the solar surface magnetic field, we find that\nthe source of heliospheric magnetic field -- the open magnetic flux on the Sun,\nalready lags behind SSN before it convects into heliosphere along with the\nsolar wind. The delay during odd cycles is longer than that during sequential\neven cycles. Thus, we propose that the GCR lag is primarily due to the greatly\nlate opening of the solar magnetic field with respect to SSN, though solar wind\nconvection and particle transport in the heliosphere also matter. We further\ninvestigate the origin of the open flux from different latitudes of the Sun and\nfound that the total open flux is significantly contributed by that from low\nlatitudes where coronal mass ejections frequently occur and also show an\nodd-even cyclic pattern.

On the other side, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for\nblack-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling\nefficiency.

On\nthe other hand, we introduce a comfortability function of a graph for the\nquantum walk, which shows how many quantum walkers can stay in the interior,\nand we succeed in showing the comfortability of the walker in terms of\ncombinatorial properties of the internal graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 05:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

This result\ngeneralises previous efforts that dealt only with discrete circuits. Moreover,\nit shows through the example of a parallel-plate SQUID circuit that assigning\nindividual, discrete capacitances to each individual Josephson junction, as\nproposed by treatments of discrete circuits, is only possible if we allow for\nnegative, time-dependent and even singular capacitances. In this report, we\nprovide numerical evidence to substantiate this result by performing\nfinite-difference simulations on a parallel-plate SQUID.

With the popularization of data-driven methods, the\npast decades have witnessed promising progress on ASP by approaching the\nproblem with the schemes of tile-level scene classification or\nsegmentation-based image analysis, when using high-resolution aerial images.\nHowever, the former scheme often produces results with tile-wise boundaries,\nwhile the latter one needs to handle the complex modeling process from pixels\nto semantics, which often requires large-scale and well-annotated image samples\nwith pixel-wise semantic labels. In this paper, we address these issues in ASP,\nwith perspectives from tile-level scene classification to pixel-wise semantic\nlabeling. Specifically, we first revisit aerial image interpretation by a\nliterature review. We then present a large-scale scene classification dataset\nthat contains one million aerial images termed Million-AID. With the presented\ndataset, we also report benchmarking experiments using classical convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Finally, we perform ASP by unifying the tile-level\nscene classification and object-based image analysis to achieve pixel-wise\nsemantic labeling. Intensive experiments show that Million-AID is a challenging\nyet useful dataset, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating newly\ndeveloped algorithms. When transferring knowledge from Million-AID, fine-tuning\nCNN models pretrained on Million-AID perform consistently better than those\npretrained ImageNet for aerial scene classification.

In this setting, the\nFederated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining\n$\\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard\noptimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on\nsmoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss\nfunctions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this\nadditional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent\n(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank\nstructure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of\ncommunication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server\ncan use to approximate clients' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM\nproblem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can\nhave superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle\ncomplexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some\nassumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,\n$\\eta$-H\\\"older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle\ncomplexity of FedLRGD scales like $\\phi m(p/\\epsilon)^{\\Theta(d/\\eta)}$ and\nthat of FedAve scales like $\\phi m(p/\\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant\nfactors), where $\\phi\\gg 1$ is a \"communication-to-computation ratio,\" $p$ is\nthe parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when\n$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD\nbeats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of\nanalyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of\nlatent variable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 07:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

In\nthat respect, quantiles are of particular interest, as they often capture the\nuser's utility. For example, if a video connection has high tail latency, the\nperceived quality will suffer, even if the average and median latencies are\nlow.\n  In this work, we consider the problem of approximating the per-item\nquantiles. Elements in our stream are (ID, latency) tuples, and we wish to\ntrack the latency quantiles for each ID.\n  Existing quantile sketches are designed for a single number stream (e.g.,\ncontaining just the latency). While one could allocate a separate sketch\ninstance for each ID, this may require an infeasible amount of memory.

Finally, we present SQUAD, a method that\ncombines sampling and sketching while improving the asymptotic space\ncomplexity. Intuitively, SQUAD uses a background sampling process to capture\nthe behaviour of the latencies of an item before it is allocated with a sketch,\nthereby allowing us to use fewer samples and sketches.

While the traditional\nback-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants\nare effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima\nand are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown\nthat the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a\nconvex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs.\nHowever, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential\ncomplexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this\nwork, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two\nefficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The\nfirst algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier\n(ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate\ncounterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several\niterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving\nthe approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic.\nThe second algorithm, based on the \"sampled convex programs\" theory, is simpler\nto implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an\napproximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN\ntraining landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We\napply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop\nconvex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis\nexplicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to\nmore sophisticated architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 08:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

Previous research has evaluated the energy consumption of\nthe distributed data processing platforms in the isolated cloud and edge\nenvironments.

The special case of the Einstein-Maxwell system is also discussed: It\nsuffices that at least one fiber closes in on a circle to deduce that the\nfive-dimensional space-time has afiber bundle structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 09:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 07:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 08:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

In some cases, training with more samples may even hurt\nthe performance of the evaluation is carried out in one of those datasets.

This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context\nbut not future context. Though recent refinement-based models can exploit both\npast and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based\non pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of\nthese models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner\nin the first stage and a refiner in the second stage), which can only be\nexecuted sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional\nTransformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context\nimplicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.\nSpecifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and\nright-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and\noptionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the\nfinal caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level\nensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on the MSCOCO benchmark\nand find that the compact architecture, which serves as a regularization for\nimplicitly exploiting bidirectional context, and the sentence-level ensemble\nplay more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining\nwith word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of the sentence-level ensemble\nis further enlarged.

However, developers can create or pick arbitrary\nidentifiers when writing source code. Freely chosen identifiers lead to the\nnotorious out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem that negatively affects model\nperformance. Recently, Karampatsis et al. showed that using the Byte Pair\nEncoding (BPE) algorithm to address the OOV problem can improve the language\nmodels' predictive performance on source code. However, a drawback of BPE is\nthat it cannot split the identifiers in a way that preserves the meaningful\nsemantics.

This paper\nproposes a new user-centric cooperative transmissions-based handover scheme,\ni.e., the group-cell handover (GCHO) scheme, with the aim of reducing the\nhandover rate in UDNs. In the proposed scheme, the boundary of the cooperating\ncluster depends on the distance among the user equipment (UE) and cooperating\nBSs. The new scheme captures the dynamicity and irregularity of the cooperating\ncluster topology resulting from randomly distributed BSs. Based on\nstochastic-geometry tools where BSs locations are modeled as the Poison point\nprocess (PPP), we derive an analytical expression of the handover rate for the\nUE with an arbitrary movement trajectory.

We work out the effective action of quantum gravity on the branes.\nIn the perturbative formulation, it is given by an infinite sum of Pauli-Fierz\nactions. In the non-perturbative formulation, the effective action is composed\nof a higher derivative gravity and a matter action. Usually, a higher\nderivative gravity can be renormalizable but suffers the ghost problem. For our\ncase, since the effective theory on the brane is equivalent to Einstein gravity\nin the bulk, it must be ghost-free. We notice that the matter action plays an\nimportant role in eliminating the ghost. We also provide evidences that the\nhigher derivative gravity on the brane is equivalent to a ghost-free\nmulti-gravity. Besides, we prove that the effective action yields the correct\nWeyl anomaly. Interestingly, although the effective action on the brane is an\ninfinite tower of higher derivative gravity, the holographic Weyl anomaly is\nexactly the same as that of Einstein gravity. We also analyze the mass spectrum\nof wedge holography. Remarkably, there is always a massless mode of gravitons\non the end-of-the-world branes in wedge holography. This happens because one\nimposes Neumann boundary condition on both branes. On the other hand, the\nmassless mode disappears if one imposes Dirichlet boundary condition on one of\nthe branes as in brane world theory and AdS/BCFT. Finally, we verify the first\nlaw of entanglement entropy for wedge holography. Interestingly, the massive\nfluctuations are irrelevant to the first order perturbation of the holographic\nentanglement entropy. Thus, in many aspects, the effective theory on the brane\nbehaves like massless Einstein gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 11:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 10:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

According to\nPontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), some optimality conditions for the\nsolutions of the nonlinear optimal interception problem are established, and\nthe structure of the corresponding optimal control is presented. By employing\nthe optimality conditions, we formulate a parameterized system so that its\nsolution space is the same as that of the nonlinear optimal interception\nproblem. As a consequence, a simple propagation of the parameterized system,\nwithout using any optimization method, is sufficient to generate enough sampled\ndata for the mapping from current state and time-to-go to the optimal guidance\ncommand. By virtue of the universal approximation theorem, a feedforward neural\nnetwork, trained by the generated data, is able to represent the mapping from\ncurrent state and time-to-go to the optimal guidance command. Therefore, the\ntrained network eventually can generate fixed-impact-time nonlinear optimal\nguidance within a constant time. Finally, the developed nonlinear optimal\nguidance is exemplified and studied through simulations, showing that the\nnonlinear optimal guidance law performs better than existing interception\nguidance laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 11:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

The mechanism reduction is\nmodeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector,\neach entry corresponding to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The\noptimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism size given the error\ntolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the\nDeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective\nfunction in the optimization problem. In order to explore high dimensional\nBoolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted data sampling and DNN\ntraining procedure are implemented.

We show that it is possible to pick $(d,\\infty)$-RLL subcodes of a\ncapacity-achieving (over the unconstrained BMS channel) sequence of RM codes\nsuch that the subcodes achieve, under bit-MAP decoding, rates of\n$C\\cdot{2^{-\\left \\lceil \\log_2(d+1)\\right \\rceil}}$, where $C$ is the capacity\nof the BMS channel. Finally, we also introduce techniques for upper bounding\nthe rate of any $(1,\\infty)$-RLL subcode of a specific capacity-achieving\nsequence of RM codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 13:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

The asymmetry in the phase distribution is\nintroduced by shifting the coordinates in a complex plane. The results show\nthat auto-focusing properties of aALBs remain invariant with respect to the\nasymmetry parameters. However, a controlled variation in the phase asymmetry\nallows to control the spatial intensity distribution of aALBs. In an ideal ALB\ncontaining equal intensity three bright lobes (for $m=3$), by introducing\nasymmetry most of the intensity can be transferred to any one of single bright\nlobe, and forms a high-power density lobe. A precise spatial position of\nhigh-power density lobe can be controlled by the asymmetry parameter $\\beta$\nand $m$, and we have determined the empirical relations for them. We have found\nthat for the specific values of $\\beta$, the intensity in the high-power\ndensity lobe can be enhanced by $\\sim$6 times the intensity in other bright\nlobes. The experimental results show a good agreement with the numerical\nsimulations.

This partially reflects the move towards low\ncarbon economies and the increased reliance on renewable power generation\nsystems. There has been a reduction in the use of traditional fossil fuel\ngeneration systems, which provide a stable base load, and this has been\nreplaced with more unpredictable renewable generation. As a consequence, the\navailable load on the grid is becoming more unstable. To cope with this\nvariability, the UK National Grid has placed emphasis on the investigation of\nvarious technical mechanisms (e.g. implementation of smart grids, energy\nstorage technologies, auxiliary power sources), which may be able to prevent\ncritical situations, when the grid may become sometimes unstable. The\nsuccessful implementation of these mechanisms may require large numbers of\nelectrical consumers (e.g. HVAC systems, food refrigeration systems) for\nexample to make additional investments in energy storage technologies (food\nrefrigeration systems) or to integrate their electrical demand from industrial\nprocesses into the National Grid (HVAC systems). However, in the situation of\nfood refrigeration systems, during these critical situations, even if the\nthermal inertia within refrigeration systems may maintain effective performance\nof the device for a short period of time (e.g. under 1 minute) when the\nelectrical input load into the system is reduced, this still carries the\nparamount risk of food safety even for very short periods of time (e.g. under 1\nminute). Therefore before considering any future actions (e.g. investing in\nenergy storage technologies) to prevent the critical situations when grid\nbecomes unstable, it is also needed to understand during the normal use how the\ntemperature profiles evolve along the time inside these massive networks of\nfood refrigeration systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 17:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

SW originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the\nresulting complex variations they cause within the systems between the Sun and\nEarth. These systems are tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates\na need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their\npredictions. One example of such a dynamical system is the thermosphere, the\nneutral region of Earth's upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has\nsevere repercussions in the context of satellite drag and collision avoidance\noperations for objects in low Earth orbit. Even with (assumed) perfect driver\nforecasts, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate\nneutral mass density predictions. Continuing efforts are being made to improve\nmodel accuracy, but density models rarely provide estimates of uncertainty. In\nthis work, we propose two techniques to develop nonlinear ML models to predict\nthermospheric density while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates: Monte\nCarlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution, both\nusing the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function. We\nshow the performance for models trained on local and global datasets. This\nshows that NLPD provides similar results for both techniques but the direct\nprobability method has a much lower computational cost. For the global model\nregressed on the SET HASDM density database, we achieve errors of 11% on\nindependent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Using an\nin-situ CHAMP density dataset, both techniques provide test error on the order\nof 13%. The CHAMP models (on independent data) are within 2% of perfect\ncalibration for all prediction intervals tested. This model can also be used to\nobtain global predictions with uncertainties at a given epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 14:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

The effect of training group\nsize was investigated using data (200 subjects) from the standard system. The\nPTX system was used to compare SC-UPs to PTX-UPs (15 subjects). In two\nadditional subjects, prospective imaging using SC-UP was studied.\n  Results: Average flip angle error fell from 9.5+/-0.5% for 'default'\nexcitation to 3.0+/-0.6% using SC-UPs trained over 50 subjects. Performance of\nthe UPs was found to steadily improve as training group size increased, but\nstabilized after ~15 subjects.

Consequently, a\nnew trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of\nconfounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in\nrecommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause\nconfounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO)\ninference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate\nuser-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent\nBernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with\nfactorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by\nvariational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders,\nunder mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause\nconfounders.

This allows us to\nanalyze the inter-event times by studying the fixed points of the ``angle''\nmap, which represents the evolution of the ``angle'' of the state from one\nevent to the next. We provide a sufficient condition for the convergence or\nnon-convergence of inter-event times to a steady state value under a\nscale-invariant event-triggering rule. With the help of ergodic theory, we\nprovide a sufficient condition for the asymptotic average inter-event time to\nbe a constant for all non-zero initial states of the system. Then, we consider\na special case where the ``angle'' map is an orientation-preserving\nhomeomorphism. Using rotation theory, we comment on the asymptotic behavior of\nthe inter-event times, including on whether the inter-event times converge to a\nperiodic sequence. We also analyze the asymptotic average inter-event time as a\nfunction of the ``angle'' of the initial state of the system.

The internal dynamics in a\nself-gravitating system is affected even by a constant external field. In disk\ngalaxies the EFE can induce warps and modify the rotational speeds. Due to the\nnon-linearity of MOND, it is difficult to derive analytic expressions of this\nimportant effect in a disk. Here we study numerically the EFE in two\nnon-relativistic Lagrangian theories of MOND: the `Aquadratic-Lagrangian'\ntheory (AQUAL) and `Quasilinear MOND' (QUMOND). For AQUAL we consider only the\naxisymmetric field configurations with the external field along the disk axis,\nor a spherical galaxy with test-particle orbits inclined to the external field.\nFor the more manageable QUMOND we calculate also the three-dimensional field\nconfigurations, with the external field inclined to the disk axis. We\ninvestigate particularly to what degree an external field modifies the\nquasi-flat part of rotation curves. While our QUMOND results agree well with\npublished numerical results in QUMOND, we find that AQUAL predicts weaker EFE\nthan published AQUAL results. However, AQUAL still predicts stronger EFE than\nQUMOND, which demonstrates current theoretical uncertainties. We also\nillustrate how the MOND prediction on the rising part of the rotation curve, in\nthe inner parts, depends largely on disk thickness but only weakly on a\nplausible external field for a fixed galaxy model. Finally, we summarize our\nresults for the outer parts as an improved, approximate analytic expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 15:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 16:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

In CQNC, realizing a\nnegative-mass oscillator in the system leads to exact cancellation of the\nbackaction noise from the mechanics due to destructive quantum interference.\nSqueezed vacuum injection enhances this cancellation and allows sub-SQL\nsensitivity to be reached in a wide frequency band and at much lower input\nlaser powers.

High-fidelity three-dimensional numerical simulations were\nperformed using both variable and constant absorptivity models and the\npredictions compared with experimental data. The results of the present work\nunravel the crucial effect of absorptivity on the physics of internal flow in\nlaser material processing. The difference between melt-pool shapes obtained\nusing fibre and CO$_2$ laser sources is explained, and factors affecting the\nlocal energy absorption are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 19:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

This can result in spinal pain and related problems. Therefore,\na means to remind people about their sitting habits and provide recommendations\nto counterbalance, such as physical exercise, is important. Posture recognition\nfor seated postures have not received enough attention as most works focus on\nstanding postures. Wearable sensors, pressure or force sensors, videos and\nimages were used for posture recognition in the literature. The aim of this\nstudy is to build Machine Learning models for classifying sitting posture of a\nperson by analyzing data collected from a chair platted with two 32 by 32\npressure sensors at its seat and backrest. Models were built using five\nalgorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Na\\\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression,\nSupport Vector Machine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). All the models are\nevaluated using KFold cross-validation technique. This paper presents\nexperiments conducted using the two separate datasets, controlled and\nrealistic, and discusses results achieved at classifying six sitting postures.\nAverage classification accuracies of 98% and 97% were achieved on the\ncontrolled and realistic datasets, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 20:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}
