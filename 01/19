The misinformation\ndistribution is then incorporated into the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, or\nRecovered) model, which substitutes the single rate parameter in the\ntraditional SIR model. Then, on a multi-community network, we study the\npropagation of misinformation numerically and show that the proposed blockchain\nenabled social media network outperforms the baseline network in flattening the\ncurve of the infected population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 00:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 20:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

This differs from existing planners in that the \"dynamic\" is not\nexplicitly handled during the search process in planning.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel explainable FEG framework, Coep. It highlights and integrates\ntwo types of event knowledge, sequential knowledge of direct event-event\nrelations and inferential knowledge that reflects the intermediate character\npsychology between events, such as intents, causes, reactions, which\nintrinsically pushes the story forward. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting\nissue, we design two modules, Im and Gm, for each type of knowledge, which are\ncombined via prompt tuning. First, Im focuses on understanding inferential\nknowledge to generate commonsense explanations and provide a soft prompt vector\nfor Gm. We also design a contrastive discriminator for better generalization\nability. Second, Gm generates future events by modeling direct sequential\nknowledge with the guidance of Im. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrate\nthat our approach can generate more coherent, specific, and logical future\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 11:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Instead of recomputing the $k$-core,\nwhich is time-consuming, we study how to maintain the $k$-core efficiently.\nThat is, when inserting or deleting an edge, we need to identify the affected\nvertices by searching for more vertices. The state-of-the-art order-based\nmethod maintains an order, the so-called $k$-order, among all vertices, which\ncan significantly reduce the searching space.

A linear frequency offset (FO) across\nFDA antennas yields a range-angle dependent beampattern that allows for joint\nestimation of range and direction-of-arrival (DoA). Prior works on FDA largely\nfocus on the one-dimensional linear array to estimate only azimuth angle and\nrange while ignoring the elevation and Doppler velocity. However, in many\napplications, the latter two parameters are also essential for target\nlocalization. Further, there is also an interest in radar systems that employ\nfewer measurements in temporal, Doppler, or spatial signal domains. We address\nthese multiple challenges by proposing a co-prime L-shaped FDA, wherein\nco-prime FOs are applied across the elements of L-shaped co-prime array and\neach element transmits at a non-uniform co-prime pulse repetition interval\n(C$^3$ or C-Cube). This co-pulsing FDA yields significantly large\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for target localization in the\nrange-azimuth-elevation-Doppler domain while also reducing the time-on-target\nand transmit spectral usage. By exploiting these DoFs, we develop C-Cube\nauto-pairing (CCing) algorithm, in which all the parameters are ipso facto\npaired during a joint estimation.

To address this shortcoming, we develop ``robust''\nextensions of CTL and CTL*, which we name robust CTL (rCTL) and robust CTL*\n(rCTL*). Both extensions are syntactically similar to their parent logics but\nemploy multi-valued semantics to distinguish between ``large'' and ``small''\nviolations of the specification. We show that the multi-valued semantics of\nrCTL make it more expressive than CTL, while rCTL* is as expressive as CTL*.\nMoreover, we show that the model checking problem, the satisfiability problem,\nand the synthesis problem for rCTL and rCTL* have the same asymptotic\ncomplexity as their non-robust counterparts, implying that robustness can be\nadded to branching-time logics for free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 16:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 09:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 17:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 04:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

First-order GNNs are well known to be incomplete,\ni.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen\nthrough the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed\nto increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more\ngenerally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.\nThe most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph\nrepresentation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a\nbond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated\nwith the distance between atoms, and the resulting \"distance graph NNs\" (dGNN)\nhave empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in\nchemical ML, with all known indistinguishable configurations being resolved in\nthe fully-connected limit, which is equivalent to infinite or sufficiently\nlarge cutoff. Here we present a counterexample that proves that dGNNs are not\ncomplete even for the restricted case of fully-connected graphs induced by 3D\natom clouds. We construct pairs of distinct point clouds whose associated\ngraphs are, for any cutoff radius, equivalent based on a first-order\nWeisfeiler-Lehman test.

This paper investigates\ncombinatorial bandit algorithms for the bid optimization of advertising\ncampaigns subject to uncertain budget and ROI constraints. We study the nature\nof both the optimization and learning problems. In particular, when focusing on\nthe optimization problem without uncertainty, we show that it is inapproximable\nwithin any factor unless P=NP, and we provide a pseudo-polynomial-time\nalgorithm that achieves an optimal solution. When considering uncertainty, we\nprove that no online learning algorithm can violate the (ROI or budget)\nconstraints during the learning process a sublinear number of times while\nguaranteeing a sublinear pseudo-regret. Thus, we provide an algorithm, namely\nGCB, guaranteeing sublinear regret at the cost of a potentially linear number\nof constraints violations. We also design its safe version, namely GCB_{safe},\nguaranteeing w.h.p. a constant upper bound on the number of constraints\nviolations at the cost of a linear pseudo-regret. More interestingly, we\nprovide an algorithm, namely GCB_{safe}(\\psi,\\phi), guaranteeing both sublinear\npseudo-regret and safety w.h.p. at the cost of accepting tolerances \\psi and\n\\phi in the satisfaction of the ROI and budget constraints, respectively.

The goal of this foundational\narticle is to introduce the notion of a curved operad, and to develop the\noperadic calculus at this new level. The algebraic side of the curved operadic\ncalculus provides us with universal constructions: using a new notion of curved\noperadic bimodules, we construct curved universal enveloping algebras. Since\nthere is no notion of quasi-isomorphism in the curved context, we develop the\nhomotopy theory of curved operads using new methods. This approach leads us to\nintroduce the new notion of a curved absolute operad, which is the notion\nKoszul dual to counital cooperads non-necessarily conilpotent, and we construct\na complete Bar-Cobar adjunction between them. We endow curved absolute operads\nwith a suitable model category structure. We establish a magical square of\nduality functors which intertwines this complete Bar-Cobar construction with\nthe Bar-Cobar adjunction between unital operads and conilpotent curved\ncooperads. This allows us to compute minimal cofibrant resolutions for various\ncurved absolute operads. Using the complete Bar construction, we show a general\nHomotopy Transfer Theorem for curved algebras.

It consists in learning a model on a small amount of annotated\ndata (annotation budget) and in choosing the best set of points to annotate in\norder to improve the previous model and gain in generalization. In deep\nlearning, active learning is usually implemented as an iterative process in\nwhich successive deep models are updated via fine tuning, but it still poses\nsome issues. First, the initial batch of annotated images has to be\nsufficiently large to train a deep model. Such an assumption is strong,\nespecially when the total annotation budget is reduced.

We show\nthe gapless surface-states are described by $2^{D-1}$-component, massless Dirac\nfermions.

Among\ngalaxies with a high fraction (>70%) of their young stars in a thin disk\n(h/R~0.1) we find that: (i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing\ngas mass on halo scales (>~20 kpc), with radiative losses offset by compression\nheating; (ii) this hot accretion proceeds until angular momentum support slows\ninward motion, at which point the gas cools to T~10^4 K or less; (iii) prior to\ncooling, the accreting gas develops an angular momentum distribution that is\naligned with the galaxy disk, and while cooling transitions from a\nquasi-spherical spatial configuration to a more flattened, disk-like\nconfiguration. We show that the existence of this \"rotating cooling flow\"\naccretion mode is strongly correlated with the fraction of stars forming in a\nthin disk among a sample of 17 z~0 galaxies spanning a halo mass range of\n10^10.5 solar masses to 10^12 solar masses, or a stellar mass range 10^8 solar\nmasses to 10^11 solar masses.

We find significant changes\ncompared to the commonly used non-rotating, single-star scenario. The largest\ndifferences are noticeable at low metallicity, where the mechanical-energy\nbudget is substantially increased. So as to establish the maximal (i.e.\nobtained by neglecting dissipation in the near circumstellar environment)\ninfluence of winds on the early stages of galaxy formation, we use our new\nfeedback estimates to simulate the formation and evolution of a sub-$L_*$\ngalaxy at redshift 3 (hosted by a dark-matter halo with a mass of $1.8\\times\n10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$) and compare the outcome with simulations in which only\nsupernova (SN) feedback is considered. Accounting for the continuous energy\ninjection by winds reduces the total stellar mass, the metal content, and the\nburstiness of the star-formation rate as well as of the outflowing gas mass.\nHowever, our numerical experiment suggests that the enhanced mechanical\nfeedback from the winds of rotating and binary stars has a limited impact on\nthe most relevant galactic properties compared to the non-rotating single-star\nscenario. Eventually, we look at the relative abundance between the metals\nentrained in winds and those ejected by SNe and find that it stays nearly\nconstant within the simulated galaxy and its surrounding halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 18:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Our sample\nwas continuum-selected with F775W<=27.5, and spectroscopic redshifts were\nassigned or constrained for all the sources thanks to the deepest (100- to\n140-hour) existing Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer\n(MUSE) data with adaptive optics. The final sample includes 21 galaxies that\nare purely F775W-magnitude selected within the redshift range z=2.9-4.4 and\nwithin a UV magnitude range -20<=M1500<= -18, thus avoiding any bias toward\nLAEs. We tested whether galaxy's Ly${\\alpha}$ emission is significantly more\nextended than the MUSE PSF-convolved continuum component. We find 17 LAHs and\nfour non-LAHs. We report the first individual detections of extended\nLy${\\alpha}$ emission around non-LAEs. The Ly${\\alpha}$ halo fraction is thus\nas high as $81.0^{+10.3}_{-11.2}$%, which is close to that for LAEs at z=3-6 in\nthe literature. This implies that UV-selected galaxies generally have a large\namount of hydrogen in their CGM. We derived the mean surface brightness (SB)\nprofile for our LAHs with cosmic dimming corrections and find that Ly${\\alpha}$\nemission extends to 5.4 arcsec (~40 physical kpc at the midpoint redshift\nz=3.6) above the typical 1${\\sigma}$ SB limit. The incidence rate of\nsurrounding gas detected in Ly${\\alpha}$ per one-dimensional line of sight per\nunit redshift, dn/dz, is estimated to be $0.76^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ for galaxies\nwith M1500<= -18 mag at z~3.7. Assuming that Ly${\\alpha}$ emission and\nabsorption arise in the same gas, this suggests, based on abundance matching,\nthat LAHs trace the same gas as damped Ly${\\alpha}$ systems (DLAs) and\nsub-DLAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 19:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

We fitted the\nsuperfluid dark matter model to the rotation curves of 169 galaxies in the\nSPARC sample. We found that the mass-to-light ratios obtained with superfluid\ndark matter are generally acceptable in terms of stellar populations.

In that case, we can no longer expect superfluid dark matter to\nreproduce the phenomenologically observed scaling relations that make MOND\nappealing.

Classification of association schemes and\nrealizable anyon systems are complex combinatorial problems and we tackle a\npart of it with a quantum walk application based approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 20:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Resource-constrained edge servers and accelerators tend\nto be multiplexed across multiple IoT applications, introducing the potential\nfor performance interference between latency-sensitive workloads. In this\npaper, we design analytic models to capture the performance of DNN inference\nworkloads on shared edge accelerators, such as GPU and edgeTPU, under different\nmultiplexing and concurrency behaviors. After validating our models using\nextensive experiments, we use them to design various cluster resource\nmanagement algorithms to intelligently manage multiple applications on edge\naccelerators while respecting their latency constraints. We implement a\nprototype of our system in Kubernetes and show that our system can host 2.3X\nmore DNN applications in heterogeneous multi-tenant edge clusters with no\nlatency violations when compared to traditional knapsack hosting algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

One approach for solving\nthis puzzle is to correlate UHECRs with high-energy neutrinos, since neutrinos\nare a direct probe of hadronic interactions of cosmic rays and are not\ndeflected by magnetic fields. In this paper, we present three different\napproaches for correlating the arrival directions of neutrinos with the arrival\ndirections of UHECRs. The neutrino data is provided by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory and ANTARES, while the UHECR data with energies above $\\sim$50 EeV\nis provided by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array. All\nexperiments provide increased statistics and improved reconstructions with\nrespect to our previous results reported in 2015. The first analysis uses a\nhigh-statistics neutrino sample optimized for point-source searches to search\nfor excesses of neutrinos clustering in the vicinity of UHECR directions. The\nsecond analysis searches for an excess of UHECRs in the direction of the\nhighest-energy neutrinos. The third analysis searches for an excess of pairs of\nUHECRs and highest-energy neutrinos on different angular scales. None of the\nanalyses has found a significant excess, and previously reported\nover-fluctuations are reduced in significance. Based on these results, we\nfurther constrain the neutrino flux spatially correlated with UHECRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 18:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 12:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

The standard UDA requires sharing the source data\nwith the target, having potential data privacy leaking risks. To protect the\nsource data's privacy, we first propose to share the source feature\ndistribution instead of the source data. However, sharing only the source\nfeature distribution may still suffer from the membership inference attack who\ncan infer an individual's membership by the black-box access to the source\nmodel. To resolve this privacy issue, we further study the under-explored\nproblem of privacy-preserving domain adaptation and propose a method with a\nnovel differential privacy training strategy to protect the source data\nprivacy. We model the source feature distribution by Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) under the differential privacy setting and send it to the target client\nfor adaptation. The target client resamples differentially private source\nfeatures from GMMs and adapts on target data with several state-of-art UDA\nbackbones.

Sleep is thought to be essential for normal brain\ndevelopment. Importantly, studies have shown that sleep enhances critical\nperiod plasticity and promotes experience-dependent synaptic pruning in the\ndeveloping mammalian brain. Therefore, normal plasticity during critical\nperiods depends on proper sleep. Problems falling and staying asleep occur at a\nhigher rate in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relative to typical development.\nIn this review, we explore the potential link between sleep, critical period\nplasticity, and ASD. First, we review the importance of critical period\nplasticity in typical development and the role of sleep in this process. Next,\nwe summarize the evidence linking ASD with deficits in synaptic plasticity in\nrodent models of high-confident ASD gene candidates. We then show that almost\nall the high-confidence rodent models of ASD that show sleep deficits also\ndisplay plasticity deficits. Given how important sleep is for critical period\nplasticity, it is essential to understand the connections between synaptic\nplasticity, sleep, and brain development in ASD. However, studies investigating\nsleep or plasticity during critical periods in ASD mouse models are lacking.\nTherefore, we highlight an urgent need to consider developmental trajectory in\nstudies of sleep and plasticity in neurodevelopmental disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

The ability to design novel proteins tailored for specific\npurposes could transform our ability to respond timely to these issues. Recent\nadvances in the field of artificial intelligence are now setting the stage to\nmake this goal achievable. Protein sequences are inherently similar to natural\nlanguages: Amino acids arrange in a multitude of combinations to form\nstructures that carry function, the same way as letters form words and\nsentences that carry meaning. Therefore, it is not surprising that throughout\nthe history of Natural Language Processing (NLP), many of its techniques have\nbeen applied to protein research problems. In the last few years, we have\nwitnessed revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of NLP. The implementation\nof Transformer pre-trained models has enabled text generation with human-like\ncapabilities, including texts with specific properties such as style or\nsubject. Motivated by its considerable success in NLP tasks, we expect\ndedicated Transformers to dominate custom protein sequence generation in the\nnear future. Finetuning pre-trained models on protein families will enable the\nextension of their repertoires with novel sequences that could be highly\ndivergent but still potentially functional. The combination of control tags\nsuch as cellular compartment or function will further enable the controllable\ndesign of novel protein functions. Moreover, recent model interpretability\nmethods will allow us to open the 'black box' and thus enhance our\nunderstanding of folding principles. While early initiatives show the enormous\npotential of generative language models to design functional sequences, the\nfield is still in its infancy.

Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and\ntransferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that\nlack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain\nprior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19,\nmanifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical\nstructure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the\ninfluence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream\nprognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a\ngenerative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns\nfactorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the\nstructure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized\nto generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but\ninherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ndisentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in\nLSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19\noutcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both\ndatasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in\nLSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in\nsemi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE\nis also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo. By \"re-mixing\" the texture\nand shape factors, we generate meaningful hybrid images that can augment the\ntraining set. This data augmentation method can further improve COVOC\nprediction performance. The improvement is consistent even when we directly\nevaluate the Subset-1 trained model on Subset-2 without any fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

During a given unit of time, each\nbamboo grows by $h_i$, and then the bamboo-trimming algorithm gets to trim one\nof the bamboo back down to height zero. The goal is to minimize the height of\nthe tallest bamboo, also known as the backlog. The bamboo trimming problem is\nclosely related to many scheduling problems, and can be viewed as a variation\nof the widely-studied fixed-rate cup game, but with constant-factor resource\naugmentation.\n  Past work has given sophisticated pinwheel algorithms that achieve the\noptimal backlog of 2 in the bamboo trimming problem. It remained an open\nquestion, however, whether there exists a simple algorithm with the same\nguarantee -- recent work has devoted considerable theoretical and experimental\neffort to answering this question. Two algorithms, in particular, have appeared\nas natural candidates: the Reduce-Max algorithm (which always cuts the tallest\nbamboo) and the Reduce-Fastest$(x)$ algorithm (which cuts the fastest-growing\nbamboo out of those that have height at least $x$). Both algorithms are\nconjectured to achieve backlog 2.\n  This paper improves the bounds for both Reduce-Fastest and Reduce-Max. Among\nother results, we show that the exact optimal backlog for Reduce-Fastest$(x)$\nis $x + 1$ for all $x \\ge 2$ (proving a conjecture of D'Emidio, Di Stefano, and\nNavarra in the case of $x = 2$), and we show that Reduce-Fastest$(1)$ does not\nachieve backlog 2 (disproving a conjecture of D'Emidio, Di Stefano, and\nNavarra).\n  Finally, we show that there is a different algorithm, which we call the\nDeadline-Driven Strategy, that is both very simple and achieves the optimal\nbacklog of 2. This resolves the question as to whether there exists a simple\nworst-case optimal algorithm for the bamboo trimming problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 23:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 16:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

However, stellar interferometers from space\nhave not been realized because of technical difficulties. Two beams coming from\nindividual satellites separated by more than a few tens of meters should\nprecisely interfere such that the optical-path and angular differences between\nthe two beams are reduced at the wavelength level. Herein, we propose a novel\nbeam combiner for space interferometers that records the spectrally-resolved\ninterferometric fringes using the densified pupil spectroscopic technique. As\nthe detector plane is optically conjugated to a plane, on which the two beams\ninterfere, we can directly measure the relative phase difference between the\ntwo beams. Additionally, when an object within the field of view is obtained\nwith a modest signal-to-noise ratio, we can extract the true complex amplitude\nfrom a continuous broadband fringe (i.e., one exposure measurement), without\nscanning a delay line and chopping interferometry. We discovered that this\nspectral imaging method is validated for observing the solar system objects by\nsimulating the reflected light from Europa with a small stellar interferometer.\nHowever, because the structure of the object spectrum may cause a systematic\nerror in the measurement, this method may be limited in extracting the true\ncomplex amplitude for other astronomical objects. Applying this spectral\nimaging method to general astrophysics will facilitate further research. The\nbeam combiner and spectral imaging method are applied to a formation-flying\nstellar interferometer with multiple small satellites in a Sun-synchronous\norbit for observation of the solar system objects in visible and near-infrared.\nWe present an overview of SEIRIOS and the optimized optical design for a\nlimited-volume spacecraft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 23:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

The\nratio of the measured $^{71}$Ge production rates to the predicted rates for the\ninner and the outer target volumes are calculated from the known neutrino\ncapture cross section. Comparable deficits in the measured ratios relative to\npredicted values are found for both zones, with the $4 \\sigma$ deviations from\nunity consistent with the previously reported gallium anomaly. If interpreted\nin the context of neutrino oscillations, the deficits give best fit oscillation\nparameters of $\\Delta m^2=3.3^{+\\infty}_{-2.3}$ eV$^2$ and sin$^2\n2\\theta=0.42^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, consistent with $\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_s$\noscillations governed by a surprisingly large mixing angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 01:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 00:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Continual\nlearning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it\nbelieves will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including\nbiases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that\nwill be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that\ninform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal\nestimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing\nactions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome\ncontingencies have never been observed before.

To efficiently support these queries\nin a streaming setting, we model terms as events and explore a probabilistic\nmodel of geographical distribution that allows us to estimate the frequency of\nterms in locations that are not kept in a stream sketch or summary.

However, these methods heavily rely on the\ncharacteristics of classification tasks which inhibits their application to\nmore general scenarios. To address this issue, we present MetaV, the first\ntask-agnostic model fingerprinting framework which enables fingerprinting on a\nmuch wider range of DNNs independent from the downstream learning task, and\nexhibits strong robustness against a variety of ownership obfuscation\ntechniques. Specifically, we generalize previous schemes into two critical\ndesign components in MetaV: the \\textit{adaptive fingerprint} and the\n\\textit{meta-verifier}, which are jointly optimized such that the meta-verifier\nlearns to determine whether a suspect model is stolen based on the concatenated\noutputs of the suspect model on the adaptive fingerprint.

We aim\nto jointly optimize the beamforming of RISs and radar to maximize communication\nperformance while maintaining radar detection performance. The investigated\nproblem is challenging, and thus we transform it into an equivalent but more\ntractable form by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a penalty\ndual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm to solve the resultant problem.\nMoreover, we consider two special cases: the large radar transmit power\nscenario and the low radar transmit power scenario. For the former, we prove\nthat the beamforming design is only determined by the communication channel and\nthe corresponding optimal joint beamforming strategy can be obtained in\nclosed-form. For the latter, we minimize the mutual interference via the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. By combining the solutions of these two cases,\na low-complexity algorithm is also developed.

As a corollary, we obtain a combinatorial formula for the $\\kappa$\nclasses in terms of boundary strata.\n  For degree-$n$ products of $\\omega$ classes, the special fiber is a finite\nreduced union of (boundary) points, and its cardinality is one of the\nmultidegrees of the corresponding embedding $\\Omega_n: \\overline{M}_{0,n+3}\\to\n\\mathbb{P}^1\\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{P}^n$. In the case of the product\n$\\omega_1\\cdots \\omega_n$, these points exhibit a connection to permutation\npattern avoidance. Finally, we show that in certain cases, a prior\ninterpretation of the multidegrees via tournaments can also be obtained by\ndegenerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 04:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Currently, several approaches have\nbeen proposed for binary-source code matching by jointly learning the\nembeddings of binary code and source code in a common vector space. Despite\nmuch effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source\ncode written in a single programming language. However, in practice, software\napplications are often written in different programming languages to cater for\ndifferent requirements and computing platforms. Matching binary and source code\nacross programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining\nmulti-language and multi-platform applications. To this end, this paper\nformulates the problem of cross-language binary-source code matching, and\ndevelops a new dataset for this new problem. We present a novel approach XLIR,\nwhich is a Transformer-based neural network by learning the intermediate\nrepresentations for both binary and source code. To validate the effectiveness\nof XLIR, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two tasks of cross-language\nbinary-source code matching, and cross-language source-source code matching, on\ntop of our curated dataset.

Thus, these optical gates usually lack\nreconfigurability and are incapable within or through dynamic complex\nmedia/environment, such as fog and turbid water. In this work, as a conceptual\ndemonstration, we propose reconfigurable optical logic operations through\nscattering media with transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. A light beam\nis reflected by a spatial light modulator divided into several subregions\nfunctioning as logic units, with each displayed with predetermined wavefronts\nvia transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. Each modulated wavefront\ntransmits through the scattering medium to form a desired light field. The\ninterference of these light fields generates bright optical focus at\npre-assigned locations, representing different logic states. As a proof of\nconcept, we experimentally demonstrate five basic logic functions (AND, OR,\nNOT, NAND, NOR). As the transmission matrix of the scattering medium/system can\nbe measured instantly to adapt to environment perturbation, the method, if\nfurther engineered, opens new venues towards reconfigurable optical logic\ncomputing in a dynamically complex environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 06:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2022 03:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

However, existing deep image\nsteganography methods only consider the visual similarity of container images\nto host images, and neglect the statistical security (stealthiness) of\ncontainer images. Besides, they usually hides data limited to image type and\nthus relax the constraint of lossless extraction. In this paper, we address the\nabove issues in a unified manner, and propose deep image steganography that can\nembed data with arbitrary types into images for secure data hiding and lossless\ndata revealing. First, we formulate the data hiding as an image colorization\nproblem, in which the data is binarized and further mapped into the color\ninformation for a gray-scale host image. Second, we design a conditional\ninvertible neural network which uses gray-scale image as prior to guide the\ncolor generation and perform data hiding in a secure way. Finally, to achieve\nlossless data revealing, we present a multi-stage training scheme to manage the\ndata loss due to rounding errors between hiding and revealing processes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform secure\ndata hiding by generating realism color images and successfully resisting the\ndetection of steganalysis.

Due to insufficient task-specific training data and corresponding ground\ntruth, most existing end-to-end image fusion methods easily fall into\noverfitting or tedious parameter optimization processes. Two-stage methods\navoid the need of large amount of task-specific training data by training\nencoder-decoder network on large natural image datasets and utilizing the\nextracted features for fusion, but the domain gap between natural images and\ndifferent fusion tasks results in limited performance. In this study, we design\na novel encoder-decoder based image fusion framework and propose a\ndestruction-reconstruction based self-supervised training scheme to encourage\nthe network to learn task-specific features. Specifically, we propose three\ndestruction-reconstruction self-supervised auxiliary tasks for multi-modal\nimage fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and multi-focus image fusion based on\npixel intensity non-linear transformation, brightness transformation and noise\ntransformation, respectively. In order to encourage different fusion tasks to\npromote each other and increase the generalizability of the trained network, we\nintegrate the three self-supervised auxiliary tasks by randomly choosing one of\nthem to destroy a natural image in model training. In addition, we design a new\nencoder that combines CNN and Transformer for feature extraction, so that the\ntrained model can exploit both local and global information. Extensive\nexperiments on multi-modal image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and\nmulti-focus image fusion tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations.\nThe code will be publicly available soon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 07:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

By looking at\nthe micro-scales, the average droplet diameter hardly changes with the oil\nvolume fraction neither for O/W nor for W/O. However, for W/O it is about 50%\nlarger than that of O/W. At the macro-scales, the effective viscosity of O/W is\nhigher when compared to that of W/O. These asymmetric behaviors can be traced\nback to the presence of surface-active contaminants in the system.

We uncover a -6/5 scaling dependence of the droplet size on the\nReynolds number of the flow. Combining the scaling dependence and the droplet\nWeber number, we conclude that the droplet fragmentation, which determines the\ndroplet size, occurs within the boundary layer and is controlled by the dynamic\npressure caused by the gradient of the mean flow, as proposed by Levich (1962),\ninstead of the dynamic pressure due to turbulent fluctuations, as proposed by\nKolmogorov (1949). The present findings provide an understanding of both the\nmicroscopic droplet formation and the macroscopic rheological behaviors in\ndynamic emulsification, and connects them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Here, we study the impact of\nsalt concentration on the slow aging dynamics of CNC gels following the\ncessation of a high-shear flow that fully fluidizes the sample. We show that\nthe higher the salt content, the faster the recovery of elasticity upon flow\ncessation. Most remarkably, the elastic modulus $G'$ obeys a time-composition\nsuperposition principle: the temporal evolution of $G'$ can be rescaled onto a\nuniversal sigmoidal master curve spanning 13 orders of magnitude in time for a\nwide range of salt concentrations. Such a rescaling is obtained through a\ntime-shift factor that follows a steep power-law decay with increasing salt\nconcentration, until it saturates at large salt content. These findings are\nrobust to changes in the type of salt and in the CNC content. We further show\nthat both linear and nonlinear rheological properties of CNC gels of various\ncompositions, including, e.g., the frequency-dependence of viscoelastic spectra\nand the yield strain, can be rescaled based on the sample age along the general\nmaster curve.

For the two K stars and the Sun, the rate at which\nthe toroidal field is generated from surface poloidal field is similar to the\nrate at which toroidal flux is lost through flux emergence.

With most studies focusing on COVID-19\ndisinformation in social media, little attention has been paid to how\nmainstream news outlets framed COVID-19 narratives compared to alternative\nsources. To fill this gap, we use cognitive network science and natural\nlanguage processing to reconstruct time-evolving semantic and emotional frames\nof 5745 Italian news, that were massively re-shared on Facebook and Twitter,\nabout COVID-19 vaccines. We found consistently high levels of\ntrust/anticipation and less disgust in the way mainstream sources framed the\ngeneral idea of \"vaccine/vaccino\". These emotions were crucially missing in the\nways alternative sources framed COVID-19 vaccines. More differences were found\nwithin specific instances of vaccines. Alternative news included titles framing\nthe AstraZeneca vaccine with strong levels of sadness, absent in mainstream\ntitles. Mainstream news initially framed \"Pfizer\" along more negative\nassociations with side effects than \"AstraZeneca\". With the temporary\nsuspension of the latter, on March 15th 2021, we identified a\nsemantic/emotional shift: Even mainstream article titles framed \"AstraZeneca\"\nas semantically richer in negative associations with side effects, while\n\"Pfizer\" underwent a positive shift in valence, mostly related to its higher\nefficacy. \"Thrombosis\" entered the frame of vaccines together with fearful\nconceptual associations, while \"death\" underwent an emotional shift, steering\ntowards fear in alternative titles and losing its hopeful connotation in\nmainstream titles. Our findings expose crucial aspects of the emotional\nnarratives around COVID-19 vaccines adopted by the press, highlighting the need\nto understand how alternative and mainstream media report vaccination news.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 11:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Continuous measurements of the magnetic flux density in the return yoke\nare not possible and the usual practice uses software modelling of the magnetic\nsystem with special 3D computer programs. The flux return yoke of the Compact\nMuon Solenoid (CMS) magnet encloses a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid with a\n6-m-diameter by 12.5-m-length free bore and consists of five dodecagonal\nthree-layered barrel wheels around the coil and four endcap disks at each end.\nThe yoke steel blocks serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection\nsystem. A TOSCA 3D model of the CMS magnet has been developed to describe the\nmagnetic field outside of the solenoid volume, which was measured with a\nfield-mapping machine. To verify the magnetic flux distribution calculated in\nthe yoke steel blocks, direct measurements of the magnetic flux density with 22\nflux loops installed in selected regions of the yoke were performed during the\nCMS magnet test in 2006 when four \"fast\" discharges of the CMS coil were\ntriggered manually to test the magnet protection system. No fast discharge of\nthe CMS magnet from its operational current of 18.2 kA, which corresponds to a\ncentral magnetic flux density of 3.8 T, has been performed that time. For the\nfirst time, in this paper we present measurements of the magnetic flux density\nin the steel blocks of the return yoke based on the several standard linear\ndischarges of the CMS magnet from the operational magnet current of 18.2 kA. To\nprovide these measurements, the voltages induced in the flux loops have been\nmeasured with six 16-bit DAQ modules and integrated offline over time.

This allows to highlight the nonadiabatic dynamical\nfeatures of the PMD, which is indispensable for their further investigation in\ncomplex computationally demanding scenarios. The method is firstly demonstrated\non a one-dimensional problem, and further applied in three-dimensions for the\nattoclock. The method is validated by a comparison of analytical results via\nthe strong-field approximation with numerical solutions of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 13:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

The device fingerprinting technology\nextracts fingerprints according to the hardware and software characteristics of\nthe device, which can achieve long-term tracking of the device. The primary\ngoal of device fingerprinting is to accurately and uniquely identify a device,\nwhich requires the generated fingerprints to have good stability. However, the\nfingerprints generated by existing fingerprinting technologies are not stable\nenough or change frequently, making it impossible to track the target device\nfor a long time. In this paper, we propose a novel DRAM-based fingerprinting\ntechnique. The device fingerprint generated by our technique has high stability\nand can be used to track the device for a long time. We leverage the Rowhammer\ntechnique to repeatedly and quickly access a row in DRAM to get bit flips. We\nthen construct a physical fingerprint of the device based on the locations of\nthe collected bit flips. The evaluation results of the uniqueness and\nreliability of the physical fingerprint show that it can be used to distinguish\ndevices with the same hardware and software configuration. The experimental\nresults of device identification in laboratory settings show that our proposed\ntechnique can accurately identify the target device by establishing a\nfingerprint database for device matching. Even if the device modifies\nsoftware-level parameters such as MAC address, IP address, or even reinstalls\nthe operating system, we can accurately identify the target device. This\ndemonstrates that our proposed fingerprinting technique can generate stable\nfingerprints that are not affected by software layer parameters, enabling the\ntracking of target devices for more than five months.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 13:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 08:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

The key\nto our approach is a novel solver that iteratively solves for per-view depth\nmap and normal map by optimizing an energy potential based on the locally\nplanar assumption. Specifically, the algorithm updates depth map by propagating\nfrom neighboring pixels with slanted planes, and updates normal map with local\nprobabilistic plane fitting. Both two steps are monitored by a customized\nconfidence map. This solver is not only effective as a post-processing tool for\nplane-based depth refinement and completion, but also differentiable such that\nit can be efficiently integrated into deep learning pipelines. Our multi-view\nstereo system employs multiple optimization steps of the solver over the\ninitial prediction of depths and surface normals. The whole system can be\ntrained end-to-end, decoupling the challenging problem of matching pixels\nwithin poorly textured regions from the cost-volume based neural network.\nExperimental results on ScanNet and RGB-D Scenes V2 demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance of the proposed deep MVS system on multi-view\ndepth estimation, with our proposed solver consistently improving the depth\nquality over both conventional and deep learning based MVS pipelines.

Despite the huge effort made to\nstudy this property and to introduce analytical criteria able to check whether\na dynamic system satisfies this property or not, there is no general analytical\ncriterion to automatically check the state observability when the dynamics are\nalso driven by unknown inputs. Here, we introduce the general analytical\nsolution of this fundamental problem, often called the unknown input\nobservability problem. This paper provides the general analytical solution of\nthis problem, namely, it provides the systematic procedure, based on automatic\ncomputation (differentiation and matrix rank determination), that allows us to\nautomatically check the state observability even in the presence of unknown\ninputs (Algorithm 6.1). A first solution of this problem was presented in the\nsecond part of the book: \"Observability: A New Theory Based on the Group of\nInvariance\" [45]. The solution presented by this paper completes the previous\nsolution in [45]. In particular, the new solution exhaustively accounts for the\nsystems that do not belong to the category of the systems that are \"canonic\nwith respect to their unknown inputs\". The analytical derivations largely\nexploit several new concepts and analytical results introduced in [45].\nFinally, as a simple consequence of the results here obtained, we also provide\nthe answer to the problem of unknown input reconstruction which is intimately\nrelated to the problem of state observability. We illustrate the implementation\nof the new algorithm by studying the observability properties of a nonlinear\nsystem in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion, whose dynamics are\ndriven by two unknown inputs and one known input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 14:02:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 09:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 06:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In\norder to make timely and well-informed decisions, it is imperative to be able\nto come up with proxies for these parameters which can be sampled quickly and\nefficiently, especially during disruptive events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecently, there has been a lot of focus on using remote sensing data for this\npurpose.

Considering an anisotropic atmosphere, we present here\na three-dimensional approach to estimate the disk-averaged polarization that\narises due to the oblateness of the planets. We solve the multiple-scattering\nvector radiative transfer equations at each location on the planet's disk and\ncalculate the local Stokes vectors and then calculate the disk-integrated flux\nand linear polarization. For a cloud-free atmosphere, the polarization signal\nis observable only in the visible wavelength region.

Quantization is\napplied to reduce the latency and storage cost of CNNs. Among the quantization\nmethods, Binary and Ternary Weight Networks (BWNs and TWNs) have a unique\nadvantage over 8-bit and 4-bit quantization. They replace the multiplication\noperations in CNNs with additions, which are favoured on In-Memory-Computing\n(IMC) devices. IMC acceleration for BWNs has been widely studied. However,\nthough TWNs have higher accuracy and better sparsity than BWNs, IMC\nacceleration for TWNs has limited research. TWNs on existing IMC devices are\ninefficient because the sparsity is not well utilized, and the addition\noperation is not efficient.\n  In this paper, we propose FAT as a novel IMC accelerator for TWNs.

A silicon imaging detector meeting these requirements\nwill have a ratio of detector thickness to pixel size of six or more, roughly\ntwice that of legacy imaging sensors. This implies greater diffusion of X-ray\ncharge packets. We investigate consequences for sensor performance, reporting\ncharge diffusion measurements in a fully-depleted, 50um thick, back-illuminated\nCCD with 8um pixels. We are able to measure the size distributions of charge\npackets produced by 5.9 keV and 1.25 keV X-rays in this device. We find that\nindividual charge packets exhibit a gaussian spatial distribution, and\ndetermine the frequency distribution of event widths for a range of internal\nelectric field strength levels. We find a standard deviation for the largest\ncharge packets, which occur near the entrance window, of 3.9um. We show that\nthe shape of the event width distribution provides a clear indicator of full\ndepletion and infer the relationship between event width and interaction depth.\nWe compare measured width distributions to simulations. We compare traditional,\n'sum-above-threshold' algorithms for event amplitude determination to 2D\ngaussian fitting of events and find better spectroscopic performance with the\nformer for 5.9 keV events and comparable results at 1.25 keV.

This is due to deep\nlearning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level\nperformance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized\nto address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical\nimages. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to\nproduce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator,\na model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to\nthe generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several\ntechnical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery.\nFirst, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an\nidentical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features.\nSecond, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer\nfails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem\nwhereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving\noptimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being\nprovided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic\nimagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been\nno survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the\ncontext of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and\ntaxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical\nimaging domain.

For the minimal extension, we make\nuse of vector-like family, SM-like scalar (plus a singlet flavon), and\n$U(1)^\\prime$ symmetry. A first BSM model in my first work is to explain both\nthe electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments at the same time, while\nkeeping the constraints $\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma$ decay and neutrino trident\nproduction.

A second BSM\nmodel in my second work shares the same motivation, to explain both anomalies,\nhowever it goes one step further by considering the strong hierarchical\nstructure of the SM into the second BSM model. In this BSM model, the SM\nappears as an effective theory spontaneously broken from the $U(1)^\\prime$\nsymmetry. Both anomalies are studied in the neutrino sector first and it\nreveals that the neutrino contributions are too small to explain their\nexperimental bounds, so leading to a conclusion that the neutrinos can not\nexplain both anomalies simultaneously.

Whereas, an arriving handoff call is given preemptive repeat\npriority over a new call in service when all the channels are occupied and at\nleast one of the channel is occupied with a new call otherwise the handoff call\nis dropped, and consequently, this preempted new call will join the orbit. In\nthe catastrophic scenario, when a disaster causes the shut down of the entire\nsystem and failure of all functioning channels, a set of backup channels is\nquickly deployed to restore services. The Markov chain's ergodicity criteria\nare established by demonstrating that it belongs to the class of asymptotically\nquasi-Toeplitz Markov chains (AQTMC). For the approximate computation of the\nstationary distribution, a new approach is developed.\n  An optimization problem to obtain optimal value of total number of backup\nchannels has been formulated and dealt by employing non dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 12:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

However, it comes with two major constraints: dependency\non extensive labeled data and training costs. Transfer learning in deep\nlearning, known as Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), attempts to reduce such\ndependency and costs by reusing an obtained knowledge from a source data/task\nin training on a target data/task. Most applied DTL techniques are\nnetwork/model-based approaches. These methods reduce the dependency of deep\nlearning models on extensive training data and drastically decrease training\ncosts. As a result, researchers detected Covid-19 infection on chest X-Rays\nwith high accuracy at the beginning of the pandemic with minimal data using DTL\ntechniques. Also, the training cost reduction makes DTL viable on edge devices\nwith limited resources. Like any new advancement, DTL methods have their own\nlimitations, and a successful transfer depends on some adjustments for\ndifferent scenarios. In this paper, we review the definition and taxonomy of\ndeep transfer learning and well-known methods. Then we investigate the DTL\napproaches by reviewing recent applied DTL techniques in the past five years.\nFurther, we review some experimental analyses of DTLs to learn the best\npractice for applying DTL in different scenarios. Moreover, the limitations of\nDTLs (catastrophic forgetting dilemma and overly biased pre-trained models) are\ndiscussed, along with possible solutions and research trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 04:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 20:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

In the ideal disorder-free situation, a two-dimensional band\ngap insulator has an activation energy for conductivity equal to half the band\ngap, $\\Delta$. But transport experiments usually exhibit a much smaller\nactivation energy at low temperature, and the relation between this activation\nenergy and $\\Delta$ is unclear. Here we consider the temperature-dependent\nconductivity of a two-dimensional narrow gap semiconductor on a substrate\ncontaining Coulomb impurities, mostly focusing on the case when amplitude of\nthe random potential $\\Gamma \\gg \\Delta$. We show that the conductivity\ngenerically exhibits three regimes and only the highest temperature regime\nexhibits an activation energy that reflects the band gap. At lower\ntemperatures, the conduction proceeds through nearest-neighbor or\nvariable-range hopping between electron and hole puddles created by the\ndisorder. We show that the activation energy and characteristic temperature\nassociated with these processes steeply collapse near a critical impurity\nconcentration. Larger concentrations lead to an exponentially small activation\nenergy and exponentially long localization length, which in mesoscopic samples\ncan appear as a disorder-induced insulator-to-metal transition. We arrive at a\nsimilar disorder driven steep insulator-metal transition in thin films of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators with very large dielectric constant,\nwhere due to confinement of electric field internal Coulomb impurities create\nlarger disorder potential. Away from neutrality point this unconventional\ninsulator-to-metal transition is augmented by conventional metal-insulator\ntransition at small impurity concentrations, so that we arrive at\ndisorder-driven re-entrant metal-insulator-metal transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 23:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 19:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

To achieve this, a prototype module\nfor the use with the Decawave transceiver DW1000 was implemented and added to\nFruityMesh, an Internet of Things (IoT) mesh network of the company M-Way\nSolutions. The focus of the network is low-power communication based on\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This includes, for example, Building Automation,\nLighting Management and Asset Tracking. Especially the last stated point\nbenefits from a position tracking as precise as possible and a long battery\nlife. Therefore, FruityMesh is used to perform a signal-strength based\nlocalization with the existing BLE messages. Due to absorption, interference,\nand diffraction, these measurements tend to fluctuate and allow a positioning\naccuracy within 1.5m. With the integration of Ultra Wide Band and the Time of\nArrival (ToA) method, a centimeter-precise localization was made possible in\nthe course of this work, which at the same time causes only small additional\ncosts in general.

The Principal's problem is to find optimal incentives given the\navailable information, e.g., a manager setting optimal wages for its employees.\nWhereas the Principal is often assumed rational, comparatively little is known\nabout solutions when the Principal is boundedly rational, especially in the\nsequential setting, with multiple Agents, and with multiple information\nchannels. Here, we develop RIRL, a deep reinforcement learning framework that\nsolves such complex PA problems with a rationally inattentive Principal. Such a\nPrincipal incurs a cost for paying attention to information, which can model\nforms of bounded rationality. We use RIRL to analyze rich economic phenomena in\nmanager-employee relationships. In the single-step setting, 1) RIRL yields\nwages that are consistent with theoretical predictions; and 2) non-zero\nattention costs lead to simpler but less profitable wage structures, and\nincreased Agent welfare. In a sequential setting with multiple Agents, RIRL\nshows opposing consequences of the Principal's inattention to different\ninformation channels: 1) inattention to Agents' outputs closes wage gaps based\non ability differences; and 2) inattention to Agents' efforts induces a social\ndilemma dynamic in which Agents work harder, but essentially for free.\nMoreover, RIRL reveals non-trivial relationships between the Principal's\ninattention and Agent types, e.g., if Agents are prone to sub-optimal effort\nchoices, payment schedules are more sensitive to the Principal's attention\ncost. As such, RIRL can reveal novel economic relationships and enables\nprogress towards understanding the effects of bounded rationality in dynamic\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 20:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Another notable issue is that some information situating on a written\non paper isn't easily cant be detected beyond skimming, which is a process\nnormally being used to fast track records on a flipping pages, and sometimes\nthere's also the fact that written records situating on papers can only situate\nin one location at a certain time unless the custodian has given up and made\ncopies for everything. This study will check the feasibility of a web-based\nclient monitoring software for Greatleaf Land Inc. By using ISO 25010, the\nstudy will determine if it is beneficial for Greatleaf Land Inc. to have an\nonline monitoring software rather than settling to the traditional method that\nis currently being used by their company.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

This work derives simple analytical expressions for the\ncross-track and along-track errors of an aircraft whose INS consists solely of\na three-axis gyroscope system with perfect knowledge of the vertical direction.\nThe error signal of each gyroscope is Gaussian white noise and drift modeled as\na first-order Markov random walk. These expressions provide a straightforward\nmean of calculating the FDE of an aircraft as a function of the flight\nduration, velocity, noise amplitude, drift amplitude, and drift's time\nconstant. These expressions are validated with Monte-Carlo simulations of long\nflights. This model quantifies the noise-versus-drift trade-off for a gyroscope\nin an inertial navigation system. It can save time when estimating the noise\nand drift that a gyroscope must exhibit to satisfy a given position-error\nrequirement, or vice versa. They are used in particular to confirm the values,\noften cited without demonstration, of the noise and drift required to meet the\nmaximum position error of an aircraft imposed by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration's required navigation performance 10 specification. Finally, it\ndemonstrates that using the minimum in the measured Allan deviation of a\ngyroscope as a metric of the drift is incorrect, because it fails to capture\nthe drift's time constant. The proper metric is the maximum in the Allan\ndeviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 07:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

Augmented Reality is now widely used in the\neducation sector at level K to 12. AR is expected to be generally adopted in\ntwo to three years in higher education and four to five years in K to 12.\nApplying AR technology in the education sector especially in STEM subjects, can\nresult in having a smart campus. In adopting a SMART Campus strategy, education\npractitioners must address many intrinsic issues in science, technology,\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. For example, in physics, there\nare expensive or insufficient laboratory systems, system faults, and difficulty\nsimulating other experimental circumstances. In technology, many schools do not\nhave enough computers. In engineering, there are only a few instructors who are\nknowledgeable in computer aided design (CAD). In mathematics, few teachers\nincorporate technology into their lessons often because they believe it is\nstill better to teach through the traditional methods. Hence, In this paper we\ndiscuss how AR is being used now in different learning areas in STEM to open\nnew doors to researchers and teachers as they transition their schools into\nSMART campuses with the use of AR apps. Aligned with this, a suggested\nframework for school administrators and policymakers is proposed based on a\nreview of the positive benefits of different AR apps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}
