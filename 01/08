Among these bounds, the\nones coming from microlensing surveys lead to the strongest constraints in the\nmass range from $\\sim 10^{-10}$ to a few M$_{\\odot}$. The upper part of this\nrange precisely corresponds to the mass window inside which the formation of\nPBHs should be boosted due to the QCD phase transition in the early Universe,\nwhich makes the microlensing probes particularly important.

Specifically, having observed\nthat de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the outputs from\nbackbone for target localization, there is no direct feedback from the matching\nmodule to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. More concretely,\nonly the matching module can directly access the target information (in the\nreference frame), while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind\nto the reference target. As a consequence, the accumulation effect of\ntarget-irrelevant interference in the shallow stages may degrade the feature\nquality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem from a\ndifferent angle by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the\nSiamese-like backbone networks (InBN). At the core of InBN is a general\ninteraction modeler (GIM) that injects the prior knowledge of reference image\nto different stages of the backbone network, leading to better\ntarget-perception and robust distractor-resistance of candidate feature\nrepresentation with negligible computation cost.

One popular technique is the parametrized\ninspiral test of general relativity (a realization of the parametrized\npost-Einsteinian framework), where the gravitational waveform, as calculated in\nEinstein's theory as a series expansion in the orbital velocity, is\nparametrically deformed at a given set of orders in velocity. However, most\ncurrent approaches usually only analyze the data while considering a single,\nspecific modification at a time. Are then constraints placed with a single\nmodification robust to our ignorance of higher post-Newtonian order\ncorrections? We show here that for a wide class of theories, specifically those\nthat admit a post-Newtonian expansion, single-parameter tests are indeed\nrobust. In particular, through a series of full Bayesian parameter estimation\nstudies on several different sets of synthetic data, we show that\nsingle-parameter constraints are not degraded but rather are improved by the\ninclusion of multiple parameters, provided one includes information about the\nmathematical structure of the series. We then exemplify this with a specific\ntheory of gravity, shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the\nwaveform has been calculated to higher post-Newtonian orders than leading. We\nshow that the inclusion of these higher order terms strengthens\nsingle-parameter constraints, instead of weakening them, and that the\nstrengthening is very mild. This analysis therefore provides strong evidence\nthat single-parameter post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity are robust\nto ignorance of high post-Newtonian order terms in the general relativistic\ndeformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 17:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 20:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Decision-making is\nconsidered by preferentially querying data labels according to expected value\nof perfect information (EVPI).

In particular, when designing chemical\nreactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), a detailed understanding of the\nhydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. An\nFBR allows experts to conduct different types of chemical reactions involving\nmultiphase materials, especially interaction between gas and solids. During\nsuch complex chemical processes, formation of void regions in the reactor,\ngenerally termed as bubbles, is an important phenomenon. Study of these bubbles\nhas a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency. But\nphysical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and\nnon-trivial. Therefore, to study such chemical processes and bubble dynamics, a\nstate-of-the-art massively parallel computational fluid dynamics discrete\nelement model (CFD-DEM), MFIX-Exa is being developed for simulating multiphase\nflows. Despite the proven accuracy of MFIX-Exa in modeling bubbling phenomena,\nthe very-large size of the output data prohibits the use of traditional post\nhoc analysis capabilities in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues\nand allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an\nefficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end visual analytics\npipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles using statistical\ntechniques, followed by a flexible and interactive visual exploration of bubble\ndynamics in the post hoc analysis phase. Positive feedback from the experts has\nindicated the efficacy of the proposed approach for exploring bubble dynamics\nin very-large scale multiphase flow simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 17:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Many researchers have utilized deep learning\nsystems to diagnose pulmonary disorders using chest X-rays (CXRs). However,\nsuch systems require exhaustive training efforts on large-scale data to\neffectively diagnose chest abnormalities. Furthermore, procuring such\nlarge-scale data is often infeasible and impractical, especially for rare\ndiseases. With the recent advances in incremental learning, researchers have\nperiodically tuned deep neural networks to learn different classification tasks\nwith few training examples. Although, such systems can resist catastrophic\nforgetting, they treat the knowledge representations independently of each\nother, and this limits their classification performance. Also, to the best of\nour knowledge, there is no incremental learning-driven image diagnostic\nframework that is specifically designed to screen pulmonary disorders from the\nCXRs.

Although significant research has\nbeen directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation\nto scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large\nvariations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as\nfog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised\nadaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and\nmulti-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method\n(FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported\nby the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high\nself-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based\nloss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained\nat different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to\ngenerate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These\nscale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We\nevaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes\nadaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation\nscenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images.\nSpecifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy\nDriving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes\nto Foggy Zurich.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 18:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 13:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 20:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

In\npractice, one-stage detectors are more prevalent in the industry because they\nhave a simple and fast pipeline that is easy to deploy. However, in the\nlong-tailed scenario, this line of work has not been explored so far. In this\npaper, we investigate whether one-stage detectors can perform well in this\ncase. We discover the primary obstacle that prevents one-stage detectors from\nachieving excellent performance is: categories suffer from different degrees of\npositive-negative imbalance problems under the long-tailed data distribution.\nThe conventional focal loss balances the training process with the same\nmodulating factor for all categories, thus failing to handle the long-tailed\nproblem. To address this issue, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) that\nrebalances the loss contribution of positive and negative samples of different\ncategories independently according to their imbalance degrees. Specifically,\nEFL adopts a category-relevant modulating factor which can be adjusted\ndynamically by the training status of different categories.

It has previously been conjectured that not more than one pair of\nobservers can detect Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt \"Bell-nonlocal\" correlations in\na similar set-up. This is intriguing since it is possible to have an\narbitrarily long sequence of Bell-nonlocal correlations when only a single\nobserver is allowed to share a bipartite state with multiple observers at the\nother end.

Surprisingly, most methods treat the 3D\nmodeling and tracking of bodies and hands separately. Here we formulate a model\nof hands and bodies interacting together and fit it to full-body 4D sequences.\nWhen scanning or capturing the full body in 3D, hands are small and often\npartially occluded, making their shape and pose hard to recover. To cope with\nlow-resolution, occlusion, and noise, we develop a new model called MANO (hand\nModel with Articulated and Non-rigid defOrmations). MANO is learned from around\n1000 high-resolution 3D scans of hands of 31 subjects in a wide variety of hand\nposes. The model is realistic, low-dimensional, captures non-rigid shape\nchanges with pose, is compatible with standard graphics packages, and can fit\nany human hand. MANO provides a compact mapping from hand poses to pose blend\nshape corrections and a linear manifold of pose synergies. We attach MANO to a\nstandard parameterized 3D body shape model (SMPL), resulting in a fully\narticulated body and hand model (SMPL+H).

The methods\nemploy two different approaches: halo-based pasting (HP) and particle-based\npasting (PP). The former pastes gas density and pressure onto halos and\nrequires only a halo catalogue, and the latter considers the contribution from\nfield particles as well, i.e., particles that do not belong to any halos and\nthus utilise the full particle information. Therefore, the PP algorithm\nincorporates secondary effects beyond the HP algorithm: asphericity of halos\nand contribution from diffuse gas. In particular, such a diffuse component is\nthe dominant source of the kinetic SZ effect. As validation of our methods, we\nhave produced 108 all-sky maps with HP and 108 flat-sky maps, which cover $5\n\\times 5 \\, \\mathrm{deg}^2$ with both HP and PP, and measured power spectra of\nthe maps. Our method can produce a mock map within a few hours, even for\nall-sky coverage with a parallel computational environment.

However, its role in the framework set by the scaling\nrelations in galaxy evolution remains to be understood. In this work we follow\nup on the galaxy sample from the GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, an ALMA blind survey at\n1.1mm covering a continuous area of 72.42arcmin$^2$ using two array\nconfigurations. We derived physical properties, such as star formation rates,\ngas fractions, depletion timescales, and dust temperatures for the galaxy\nsample built from the survey. There exists a subset of galaxies that exhibit\nstarburst-like short depletion timescales, but they are located within the\nscatter of the so-called main sequence of SFGs. These are dubbed starbursts in\nthe main sequence and display the most compact star formation and they are\ncharacterized by the shortest depletion timescales, lowest gas fractions, and\nhighest dust temperatures of the galaxy sample, compared to typical SFGs at the\nsame stellar mass and redshift. They are also very massive, accounting for\n$\\sim 60\\%$ of the most massive galaxies in the sample ($\\log\n(M_{\\rm{*}}/M_{\\odot}) > 11.0$). We find trends between the areas of the\nongoing star formation regions and the derived physical properties for the\nsample, unveiling the role of compact star formation as a physical driver of\nthese properties. Starbursts in the main sequence appear to be the extreme\ncases of these trends. We discuss possible scenarios of galaxy evolution to\nexplain the results drawn from our galaxy sample. Our findings suggest that the\nstar formation rate is sustained in SFGs by gas and star formation compression,\nkeeping them within the main sequence even when their gas fractions are low and\nthey are presumably on the way to quiescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Within this formalism, one\ncan treat, on the same footing, inter-particle interactions, external drives\nand/or perturbations, and coupling to baths with a (piece-wise) continuum set\nof degrees of freedom. After a historical overview on the theory of transport\nin quantum systems, we present a modern introduction of the NEGF approach to\nquantum transport. We discuss the inclusion of inter-particle interactions\nusing diagrammatic techniques, and the use of the so-called embedding and\ninbedding techniques which take the bath couplings into account\nnon-perturbatively. In various limits, such as the non-interacting limit and\nthe steady-state limit, we then show how the NEGF formalism elegantly reduces\nto well-known formulae in quantum transport as special cases. We then discuss\nnon-equilibrium transport in general, for both particle and energy currents.\nUnder the presence of a time-dependent drive - encompassing pump-probe\nscenarios as well as driven quantum systems - we discuss the transient as well\nas asymptotic behavior, and also how to use NEGF to infer information on the\nout-of-equilibrium system. As illustrative examples, we consider model systems\ngeneral enough to pave the way to realistic systems. These examples encompass\none- and two-dimensional electronic systems, systems with electron-phonon\ncouplings, topological superconductors, and optically responsive molecular\njunctions where electron-photon couplings are relevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 19:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 13:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

The\nkey challenge is that form-like documents in these business workflows can be\nlaid out in virtually infinitely many ways; hence, a good solution to this\nproblem should generalize to documents with unseen layouts and languages. A\nsolution to this problem requires a holistic understanding of both the textual\nsegments and the visual cues within a document, which is non-trivial. While the\nnatural language processing and computer vision communities are starting to\ntackle this problem, there has not been much focus on (1) data-efficiency, and\n(2) ability to generalize across different document types and languages.\n  In this paper, we show that when we have only a small number of labeled\ndocuments for training (~50), a straightforward transfer learning approach from\na considerably structurally-different larger labeled corpus yields up to a 27\nF1 point improvement over simply training on the small corpus in the target\ndomain. We improve on this with a simple multi-domain transfer learning\napproach, that is currently in production use, and show that this yields up to\na further 8 F1 point improvement. We make the case that data efficiency is\ncritical to enable information extraction systems to scale to handle hundreds\nof different document-types, and learning good representations is critical to\naccomplishing this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 19:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

The position of SN2010jp is found to reside along a chain of diffuse\nstarlight that is probably an outer spiral arm or tidal tail of the interacting\ngalaxy pair NGC2207/IC2163. There is one bright HII region projected within 1\nkpc, and there is faint extended Halpha emission immediately surrounding the\ncontinuum source at the position of SN2010jp, which has $M_{F555W} = -7.7 (\\pm\n0.2)$ mag. In principle, the lingering light could arise from late-time\ncircumstellar material (CSM) interaction, an evolved supergiant, a host star\ncluster, or some combination of these. Steady flux over 3 yr and a lack of\nstrong, spatially unresolved Halpha emission make ongoing CSM interaction\nunlikely. If an evolved supergiant dominates, its observed luminosity implies\nan initial mass of roughly 22 $M_{\\odot}$ and an age older than roughly 8 Myr.\nIf the source is a star cluster, then its colour and absolute magnitude imply\nan age of 8-13 Myr and a modest cluster initial mass of log($M/M_{\\odot}$) =\n3.6-3.8. Extended Halpha emission out to a radius of 30 pc reveals a faint\nevolved HII region, pointing to recent star formation with at least one late\nO-type star.

Fabrication attacks are the easiest to\nadminister -- an adversary simply sends (extra) frames on a CAN -- but also the\neasiest to detect because they disrupt frame frequency. To overcome time-based\ndetection methods, adversaries must administer masquerade attacks by sending\nframes in lieu of (and therefore at the expected time of) benign frames but\nwith malicious payloads. Research efforts have proven that CAN attacks, and\nmasquerade attacks in particular, can affect vehicle functionality. Examples\ninclude causing unintended acceleration, deactivation of vehicle's brakes, as\nwell as steering the vehicle. We hypothesize that masquerade attacks modify the\nnuanced correlations of CAN signal time series and how they cluster together.\nTherefore, changes in cluster assignments should indicate anomalous behavior.\nWe confirm this hypothesis by leveraging our previously developed capability\nfor reverse engineering CAN signals (i.e., CAN-D [Controller Area Network\nDecoder]) and focus on advancing the state of the art for detecting masquerade\nattacks by analyzing time series extracted from raw CAN frames. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that masquerade attacks can be detected by computing time series\nclustering similarity using hierarchical clustering on the vehicle's CAN\nsignals (time series) and comparing the clustering similarity across CAN\ncaptures with and without attacks. We test our approach in a previously\ncollected CAN dataset with masquerade attacks (i.e., the ROAD dataset) and\ndevelop a forensic tool as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of\nthe proposed approach for detecting CAN masquerade attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 20:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 19:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Similarly, within a spectrograph's bandpass, there may be\nmany emission lines of interest. The brightness of these targets and lines can\nbe orders of magnitude different, which poses a challenge to instrument and\nmission design. A single exposure can saturate the bright emission and/or have\na low signal to noise ratio (SNR) for faint emission. Traditional high dynamic\nrange (HDR) techniques solve this problem by either combining multiple\nsequential exposures of varied duration or splitting the light to different\nsensors.

The binding energy being around in the\nrange between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals\ninteractions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and\nthese two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude\nrange of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer\ndistance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain.

Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis\nsubsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The\nbifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control\ntreatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any\ncontrol under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will\nperform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop\nour complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control\nmodel, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic\npractices as optimization objective function to measure the development of\nsepsis.

This\nwas done by training two VGGb SER models on ASED, one using Mel-spectrograms\nand the other using MFCC. Four forms of training were tried, standard\ncross-validation, and three variants based on sentences, dialects and speaker\ngroups. Thus, a sentence used for training would not be used for testing, and\nthe same for a dialect and speaker group. The conclusion was that MFCC features\nare superior under all four training schemes. MFCC was therefore adopted for\nExperiment 2, where VGGb and three other existing models were compared on ASED:\nRESNet50, Alex-Net and LSTM.

Under the proper conditions, nuclei can\nbreak into two (sometimes three) fragments which will subsequently decay by\nemitting particles. This phenomenon is called nuclear fission. Since different\nfission events may produce different fragmentations, the end-products of all\nfissions that occurred in a small chemical sample of matter comprise hundreds\nof different isotopes, including $\\alpha$ particles, together with a large\nnumber of emitted neutrons, photons, electrons and antineutrinos. The\nextraordinary complexity of this process, which happens at length scales of the\norder of a femtometer, mostly takes less than a femtosecond but is not\ncompletely over until all the lingering $\\beta$ decays have completed - which\ncan take years - is a fascinating window into the physics of atomic nuclei.\nWhile fission may be more naturally known in the context of its technological\napplications, it also plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of heavy elements\nin astrophysical environments. In both cases, experimental measurements are not\nsufficient to provide complete data. Simulations are needed, yet at levels of\naccuracy and precision that pose formidable challenges to nuclear theory.

The weak solar activity reduces the number\nof energetic eruptions from the Sun and hence the number of space weather\nevents. The speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), interplanetary (IP)\nshocks, and the background solar wind all declined in SC 24. One of the main\nheliospheric consequences of weak solar activity is the reduced total (magnetic\n+ gas) pressure, magnetic field strength, and Alfv\\'en speed. There are three\ngroups of phenomena that decline to different degrees in SC 24 relative to the\ncorresponding ones in SC 23: (i) those that decline more than SSN does, (ii)\nthose that decline like SSN, and (iii) those that decline less than SSN does.\nThe decrease in the number of severe space weather events such as high-energy\nsolar energetic particle (SEP) events and intense geomagnetic storms is deeper\nthan the decline in SSN. CMEs expand anomalously and hence their magnetic\ncontent is diluted resulting in weaker geomagnetic storms. The reduction in the\nnumber of intense geomagnetic storms caused by corotating interaction regions\nis also drastic. The diminished heliospheric magnetic field in SC 24 reduces\nthe efficiency of particle acceleration, resulting in fewer high-energy SEP\nevents. The numbers of IP type II radio bursts, IP socks, and high-intensity\nenergetic storm particle events closely follow the number of fast and wide CMEs\n(and approximately SSN). The number of halo CMEs in SC 24 declines less than\nSSN does, mainly due to the weak heliospheric state. Phenomena such as IP CMEs\nand magnetic clouds related to frontside halos also do not decline\nsignificantly. The mild space weather is likely to continue in SC 25, whose\nstrength has been predicted to be not too different from that of SC 24.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 01:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The second stage uses the shared encoder and trains a LAS rescorer for\nstudent model using the trained RNN-T+LAS teacher model. Finally, we perform\ndeep-finetuning for the student model with a shared RNN-T encoder, RNN-T\ndecoder, and LAS rescorer. Our experimental results on standard LibriSpeech\ndataset show that our system can achieve a high compression rate of 55% without\nsignificant degradation in the WER compared to the two-pass teacher model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 02:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Unlike\nprevious methods that assume a shared changepoint at all spatial locations or\nignore spatial correlation, our method treats changepoints as a spatial\nprocess. This allows our model to respect spatial heterogeneity and exploit\nspatial correlations to improve estimation. Our method is derived from the\nubiquitous cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic that dominates changepoint\ndetection in functional time series. However, instead of directly searching for\nthe maximum of the CUSUM based processes, we build spatially correlated\ntwo-piece linear models with appropriate variance structure to locate all\nchangepoints at once. The proposed linear model approach increases the\nrobustness of our method to variability in the CUSUM process, which, combined\nwith our spatial correlation model, improves changepoint estimation near the\nedges. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that our method\noutperforms existing functional changepoint estimators in terms of both\nestimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification, under either weak and\nstrong spatial correlation, and weak and strong change signals. Finally, we\ndemonstrate our method using a temperature data set and a coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 02:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

The cold classical objects at radial distance r=42-47 au from the\nSun are predominantly very red (spectral slope s>17%) and often exist as\nequal-size binaries (~30% observed binary fraction). This has been taken as\nevidence for the in-situ formation of cold classicals. Interestingly, a small\nfraction (~10%) of cold classicals is less red with s<17%, and these \"blue\"\nbodies are often found in wide binaries. Here we study the dynamical\nimplantation of blue binaries from r<42 au. We find that they can be implanted\ninto the cold classical belt from a wide range of initial radial distances, but\nthe survival of the widest blue binaries -- 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 --\nimplies formation at r>30 au. This would be consistent with the hypothesized\nless-red to very-red transition at 30<r<40 au. For any reasonable choice of\nparameters (Neptune's migration history, initial disk profile, etc.), however,\nour model predicts a predominance of blue singles, rather than blue binaries,\nwhich contradicts existing observations. We suggest that wide blue binaries\nformed in situ at r=42-47 au and their color reflects early formation in a\nprotoplanetary gas disk. The predominantly VR colors of cold classicals may be\nrelated to the production of methanol and other hydrocarbons during the late\nstages of the disk, when the temperature at 45 au dropped to 20 K and carbon\nmonoxide was hydrogenated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 02:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

This work investigates how slight distinctions in\nskin-to-skin contact influence both the recognition of cued emotional messages\n(e.g., anger, sympathy) and the rating of emotional content (i.e., arousal,\nvalence). By self-selecting preferred gestures (e.g., holding, stroking),\ntouchers convey distinct messages by touching the receiver's forearm.\nSkin-to-skin contact attributes (e.g., velocity, depth, area) are optically\ntracked in high resolution.

The results indicate touchers subtly, but significantly, vary contact\nattributes of a gesture to communicate distinct messages, which are\nrecognizable by receivers. This tuning also correlates with receivers' arousal\nand valence. For instance, arousal increases with velocity for stroking, and\ndepth for holding. Moreover, as shown here with human-to-human touch, valence\nis tied with velocity, which is the same trend as reported with brushes.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate energy extraction caused by MR in the ergosphere of a rapidly\nspinning BH with broken Lorentz symmetry by a background bumblebee vector\nfield. The desired rotating BH solution differentiates from the standard Kerr\nBH via the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $l$, which comes from\nnonminimal coupling between the bumblebee field with nonzero vacuum expectation\nvalue and gravity.

Despite\nthe prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain inputs of a\nparticipant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can dominate the joint\ninference towards the direction of the adversary's will and force other\n(victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing rewards that are\nusually offered regarding the importance of their contributions in federated\nlearning scenarios. We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving\ntheir existence in typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods\nto synthesize ADIs of various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We\nfurther launch greybox fuzz testing, guided by the saliency score of ``victim''\nparticipants, to perturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore\nthe VFL attack surface in a privacy-preserving manner. We conduct an in-depth\nstudy on the influence of critical parameters and settings in synthesizing\nADIs. Our study reveals new VFL attack opportunities, promoting the\nidentification of unknown threats before breaches and building more secure VFL\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 06:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 10:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Prior works mainly use label distribution or mean score information to\nindicate a coarse-grained bias. In this paper, we explore to excavate the\nconfusion matrix, which carries the fine-grained misclassification details, to\nrelieve the pairwise biases, generalizing the coarse one.

The EH\nsource opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete time\ninstants, and sends the status updates to a sink node over a time-varying\nwireless link. At any discrete time instant, the EH node decides whether to\nascertain the link quality using its stored energy (called probing) and then,\ndecides whether to sample a process and communicate the data based on the\nchannel probe outcome. The trade-off is between the freshness of information\navailable at the sink node and the available energy at the energy buffer of the\nsource node. To this end, infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) theory\nis used to formulate the problem of minimization of time-averaged expected AoI\nfor a single energy harvesting source node.

However, prior works have shown that dynamic parallelism may impose\na high performance penalty when a large number of small grids are launched. The\nlarge number of launches results in high launch latency due to congestion, and\nthe small grid sizes result in hardware underutilization.\n  To address this issue, we propose a compiler framework for optimizing the use\nof dynamic parallelism in applications with nested parallelism. The framework\nfeatures three key optimizations: thresholding, coarsening, and aggregation.\nThresholding involves launching a grid dynamically only if the number of child\nthreads exceeds some threshold, and serializing the child threads in the parent\nthread otherwise. Coarsening involves executing the work of multiple thread\nblocks by a single coarsened block to amortize the common work across them.\nAggregation involves combining multiple child grids into a single aggregated\ngrid.\n  Our evaluation shows that our compiler framework improves the performance of\napplications with nested parallelism by a geometric mean of 43.0x over\napplications that use dynamic parallelism, 8.7x over applications that do not\nuse dynamic parallelism, and 3.6x over applications that use dynamic\nparallelism with aggregation alone as proposed in prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 08:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Here, we provide a framework to characterize the transmission spectra\nof ringed exoplanets. We develop an analytical prescription to include rings in\nthe transmission spectra for arbitrarily viewing geometries. We also establish\na simple post-processing model that can include the ring's effects on\nprecomputed ring-free spectra. The ring flattens the transmission spectrum for\na wide range of viewing geometries, consistent with the featureless spectra of\nextremely low-density exoplanets. Near-future observations by JWST at longer\nwavelengths would be able to distinguish the aerosol and ring scenarios. We\nalso find that rocky rings might cause a silicate feature at $\\sim$10 $\\mu$m if\nthe ring's optical depth is around unity. Thus, the ring's spectral features,\nif detected, would provide tight constrains on the physical properties of\nexoplanetary rings. We also discuss the ring's stability and suggest that thick\nrings are sustainable only at the equilibrium temperature of $\\lesssim$300 K\nfor the ring's age comparable to Kepler planets. This might indicate the\nintrinsic deficit of thick rings in the Kepler samples, unless rings are much\nyounger than the planets as suggested for Saturn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 08:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 01:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

While there\nare efficient methods for collecting data from the surface web, large-scale\ndark web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures. In\nparticular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting\ntype of these measures in the dark web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and\nblocks automated crawlers by forcing the user to enter a combination of\nhard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the dark web, CAPTCHA images are\nmeticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character\nlength to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking.

In this context, most\nresearchers have tried to classify hyperspectral images by using deep learning\nmethods and classification success over 90% has been achieved for these images.\nDeep neural networks (DNN) actually consist of two parts: i) Convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and ii) fully connected neural network (FCNN).

It is convenient to use convolution filters on images or time\nsignals. In hyperspectral images, each pixel is represented by a signature\nvector which consists of individual features that are independent of each\nother.

To tackle these limitations,\nthe Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in\nconjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing\nand Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large\nand multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality DA.

In this letter, we report a weighted optimization\ntechnique for dynamic rate-adaptive single-pixel imaging and sensing, which\nonly needs to train the network for one time that is available for any sampling\nrates.

Many of\nthese working environments are unstructured with uncertain and dynamic\nobstacles. UAV collision frequently happens. An UAV with high agility is highly\ndesired to adjust its motions to adapt to these environmental dynamics.\nHowever, UAV agility is restricted by its battery power output; particularly,\nan UAV's power system cannot be aware of its actual power need in motion\nplanning while the need is dynamically changing as the environment and UAV\ncondition vary. It is difficult to accurately and timely align the power supply\nwith power needs in motion plannings. This mismatching will lead to an\ninsufficient power supply to an UAV and cause delayed motion adjustments,\nlargely increasing the risk of collisions with obstacles and therefore\nundermine UAV agility. To improve UAV agility, a novel intelligent power\nsolution, Agility-Enhanced Power Supply (AEPS), was developed to proactively\nprepare appropriate amount powers at the right timing to support motion\nplanning with enhanced agility. This method builds a bridge between the\nphysical power system and UAV planning. With agility-enhanced motion planning,\nthe safety of UAV in complex working environment will be enhanced. To evaluate\nAEPS effectiveness, missions of \"patrol missions for community security\" with\nunexpected obstacles were adopted; the power supply is realized by hybrid\nintegration of fuel cell, battery, and capacitor. The effectiveness of AEPS in\nimproving UAV agility was validated by the successful and timely power supply,\nimproved task success rate and system safety, and reduced mission duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 14:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

First, we divide the document into two\nparts (e.g., title and abstract, etc) which construct a coupled text pair.\nThen, we adopt negative sampling to construct uncoupled text pairs whose two\nparts are from different documents. Finally, we train the model to judge\nwhether the text pair is coupled or uncoupled and use the obtained embedding of\ncoupled text pairs as the embedding of documents. We perform experiments on\nthree datasets for one information retrieval task and two recommendation tasks.\nThe experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CTPE model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 15:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

This paper for the first time investigates\nsome superficial biases that are specific to the temporal grounding task, and\nproposes a novel targeted solution. Most alarmingly, we observe that existing\ntemporal ground models heavily rely on some biases (e.g., high preference on\nfrequent concepts or certain temporal intervals) in the visual modal. This\nleads to inferior performance when generalizing the model in cross-scenario\ntest setting. To this end, we propose a novel method called Debiased Temporal\nLanguage Localizer (DebiasTLL) to prevent the model from naively memorizing the\nbiases and enforce it to ground the query sentence based on true inter-modal\nrelationship. Debias-TLL simultaneously trains two models. By our design, a\nlarge discrepancy of these two models' predictions when judging a sample\nreveals higher probability of being a biased sample.

Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model\nwhich bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both. The model\nrepresents time series of cases and fatalities as a mixture of Gaussian curves,\nproviding a flexible function class to learn from data compared to traditional\nmechanistic models. Although the model is non-mechanistic, we show that it\narises as the natural outcome of a stochastic process based on a networked SIR\nframework.

We also analyse how these technologies can\naffect the fundamental assumptions on the role of organisations (either private\nor public) as mechanisms for the coordination of labour. We propose that these\ntechnologies can fundamentally affect: (i) the distribution of rewards within\nan organisation and (ii) the structure of its transaction costs.

It is helpful for people with disabilities due\nto disabling people who could type or enter texts at a limited slow speed.\nAlso, it is beneficial for people with dyslexia and those people who are not\nwell with spells of words. Though, an input technology, for instance, the next\nword suggestion facilitates the typing process in smartphones as an example.\nThis means that when a user types a word, then the system suggests the next\nwords to be chosen in which the necessary word by the user. Besides, it can be\nused in entertainment as a gam, for example, to determine a target word and\nreach it or tackle it within 10 attempts of prediction. Generally, the systems\ndepend on a text corpus, which was provided in the system to conduct the\nprediction. Writing every single word is time-consuming, therefore, it is\nvitally important to decrease time consumption by reducing efforts to input\ntexts in the systems by offering most probable words for the user to select,\nthis could be done via next word prediction systems. There are several\ntechniques can be found in literature, which is utilized to conduct a variety\nof next word prediction systems by using different approaches. In this paper, a\nsurvey of miscellaneous techniques towards the next word prediction systems\nwill be addressed. Besides, the evaluation of the prediction systems will be\ndiscussed. Then, a modal technique will be determined to be utilized for the\nnext word prediction system from the perspective of easiness of implementation\nand obtaining a good result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 10:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

This distribution was\ncompared with the well-known Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which does not\ntake into account relativistic effects. Applications and comparisons between\nthe two distributions were carried out in three situations: i) protons at solar\nsurface temperature, ii) electrons at Lawson's criterion temperature, and iii)\nprotons at quasar temperatures. It was found that the value of the ratio\nbetween the rest mass of the particle considered and the temperature of the\nsystem determines the need to consider or not a relativistic treatment for the\nvelocity distribution function of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 18:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

These cross sections are evaluated at values lower than $10^{-30}$\ncm$^2$ which vary by several orders of magnitude according to the models.\nExperimental measurements would be required to constrain the models but it is a\nreal challenge to measure such low cross sections. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that inelastic electron scattering is the main nuclear excitation\nmechanism in a $^{181}$Ta target irradiated with a new intense 10 - 30 keV\nelectron beam produced with a biased laser-plasma. Calculations show that\nthrough the detection of conversion electrons, it should be possible to measure\nthe nuclear excitation yields. The effect of electron beam heating and of\nplasma deposition on the tantalum target are quantified, thus allowing the\ndimensioning of a possible experimental configuration to study $(e,e')$\nprocesses in this range of energy for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 05:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

The\nrationale behind is fourfold: first, defensive security mechanisms for robots\nare still on their early stages, not covering the complete threat landscape.\nSecond, the inherent complexity of robotic systems makes their protection\ncostly, both technically and economically. Third, robot vendors do not\ngenerally take responsibility in a timely manner, extending the zero-days\nexposure window (time until mitigation of a zero-day) to several years on\naverage. Fourth, contrary to the common-sense expectations in 21st century and\nsimilar to Ford in the 1920s with cars, most robot manufacturers oppose or\ndifficult robot repairs.\n  The Robot Hacking Manual (RHM) is an introductory series about cybersecurity\nfor robots, with an attempt to provide comprehensive case studies and\nstep-by-step tutorials with the intent to raise awareness in the field and\nhighlight the importance of taking a security-first approach.
