We use data for loops of X2.1-class-flaring active region\n(AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, September 6; and non-flaring\nactive region (AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, October 26.\nBy using spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we\ncalculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops. We apply the\nLomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature\nseries of each strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the\nflaring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4 min. These temperature oscillations\nshow very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe that the\ntemperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10\nminutes before the transverse oscillations and continue for a long time\nduration even after the transverse oscillations are ended. The temperature\namplitudes are increased at the flaring time (during 20 min) in the flaring\nloops. The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring loops are\nranged from 8.5 min to 30 min, but their significances are less (below 0.5) in\ncomparison with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the detected temperature\nperiods for the non-flaring loops' strips are less probable in comparison with\nthe flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations.\n  Based on our confined observations, it seems that the flaring loops' periods\nshow more diversity and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than\nthe non-flaring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect requires more\nextensive statistical research and broader observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 16:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

To accomplish this goal, we employ a multi-fidelity\nGaussian process as the surrogate model of the ItR function, and develop a new\nacquisition based on which the optimized next sample can be selected in terms\nof its location in the sample space and the fidelity level.

However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises\nand have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop\nsignificantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs\non many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs\nwith limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited.\nTherefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs\nwith limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and\nlimited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To\nmitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy\nedges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight\nor eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate\nthe issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to\nregularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better\ntrain GNNs.

Many recent works\nand shared tasks in both NLP and IR communities have focused on identifying the\nneed of asking clarifying questions and methodologies of generating them. These\nworks assume asking clarifying questions is a safe alternative to retrieving\nresults. As existing conversational search models are far from perfect, it's\npossible and common that they could retrieve or generate bad clarifying\nquestions. Asking too many clarifying questions can also drain user's patience\nwhen the user prefers searching efficiency over correctness. Hence, these\nmodels can get backfired and harm user's search experience because of these\nrisks by asking clarifying questions.\n  In this work, we propose a simulation framework to simulate the risk of\nasking questions in conversational search and further revise a risk-aware\nconversational search model to control the risk.

The\nbenefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward\nfunction as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot\nmanner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of\nnovel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical\nproperties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and\nthe standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the\nbenefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including\nreward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring\nfor offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 19:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Homopolymeric nucleotide repeats (HP),\nthe most simple tandem repeats, are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes.\nYet the HP distributions and roles in coronavirus genome evolution are poorly\ninvestigated. In this study, we characterize the HP distributions and trends in\nthe genomes of bat and human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results\nshow that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is abundant in HPs, and has augmented HP\ncontents during evolution.

Code\ngenerators for API clients can enhance productivity, but they tend to generate\nuniversal purpose code, and on the other hand the networking primitives of IoT\ndevices are platform specific, especially when security mechanisms such as\nTransport Layer Security are part of the picture. This paper presents\n\\texttt{cpp-tiny-client}, an API client generator developed as a plugin for the\nOpenAPI Generator project, which can tailor the generated code based on the IoT\nplatform specified by the user. Our work allows to generate correct code for\nAPI clients for IoT devices, and thus can empower a developer with more\nproductivity and a faster time-to-market for its own applications. By combining\ntogether mainstream technologies only, \\texttt{cpp-tiny-client} offers a gentle\nlearning curve. Moreover, experiments show that the generated code has a\nreasonable footprint, at least with respect to the IoT devices that were used\nin the validation of the work. The code related to this work is available\nthrough the OpenAPI Generator project~\\cite{OpenAPIGenerator}.

Classical BO methods assume that the\nobjective function is a black box. However, internal information about\nobjective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing\na manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of\nparts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.\nRecent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve\nperformance. We call these \"grey-box\" BO methods because they treat objective\ncomputation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box\napproach with so-called \"white-box\" first-principles knowledge of objective\nfunction computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of\ncomposite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate\nindividual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and\nmulti-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the\nobjective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 02:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

The results show that there was a simple strategy\nthat US government could implemented in order to reduce the negative effect of\nCOVID-19. Because of that the answer to the paper's title is yes. If lockdown\npolicies consider the heterogenous characteristics of population and impose\nmore restrictions on old people and control the interactions between them and\nthe rest of population the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people lives and\nUS economy reduced dramatically.

When it comes to Signal Processing (SP) for BCI,\nthere has been a surge of interest on Steady-State motion-Visual Evoked\nPotentials (SSmVEP), where motion stimulation is utilized to address key issues\nassociated with conventional light-flashing/flickering. Such benefits, however,\ncome with the price of having less accuracy and less Information Transfer Rate\n(ITR). In this regard, the paper focuses on the design of a novel SSmVEP\nparadigm without using resources such as trial time, phase, and/or number of\ntargets to enhance the ITR. The proposed design is based on the intuitively\npleasing idea of integrating more than one motion within a single SSmVEP target\nstimuli, simultaneously. To elicit SSmVEP, we designed a novel and innovative\ndual frequency aggregated modulation paradigm, referred to as the Dual\nFrequency Aggregated steady-state motion Visual Evoked Potential (DF-SSmVEP),\nby concurrently integrating \"Radial Zoom\" and \"Rotation\" motions in a single\ntarget without increasing the trial length.

A\npneumatic force sensor differs from other force sensors in that it can work as\na force sensor and as an elastic element. These features facilitate the\nimplementation of force control by SEA, by reducing the number of components\nrequired. On the other hand, the pneumatic force sensor has reduced proportions\nto facilitate its installation in manipulator robots and biomechatronic\nprostheses. The first step that was made for the development of the pneumatic\nforce sensor was the construction of the mathematical model of the sensor, to\nlater use the MATLAB / Simulink software to simulate it. With the data obtained\nfrom the simulation of the mathematical model, the CAD model and the sensor\nplanes were developed in SolidWorks software. Subsequently, the prototype of\nthe pneumatic force sensor was built based on the plans made in the SolidWorks\nsoftware. Once the stage of construction of the pneumatic force sensor was\ncompleted, the calibration and classification of the force sensor was carried\nout based on the UNE-EN ISO 376 standard, and the experimental tests were\ncarried out to validate the sensor.

Developing of\nsuch automatic solutions remains challenging mainly owing to complex organ\ninteractions and blurry boundaries in CT images. To address these issues, we\nfocus on effective spatial context modeling and explicit edge segmentation\npriors. Accordingly, we propose a 3D network with four main components trained\nend-to-end including shared encoder, edge detector, decoder with edge\nskip-connections (ESCs) and recurrent feature propagation head (RFP-Head). To\ncapture wide-range spatial dependencies, the RFP-Head propagates and harvests\nlocal features through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) formulated with recurrent\nconnections in an efficient slice-wise manner, with regard to spatial\narrangement of image units. To leverage edge information, the edge detector\nlearns edge prior knowledge specifically tuned for semantic segmentation by\nexploiting intermediate features from the encoder with the edge supervision.\nThe ESCs then aggregate the edge knowledge with multi-level decoder features to\nlearn a hierarchy of discriminative features explicitly modeling\ncomplementarity between organs' interiors and edges for segmentation. We\nconduct extensive experiments on two challenging abdominal CT datasets with\neight annotated organs.

A quasilinear model is developed to study the KE\nexchanges between a two-dimensional geostrophically-balanced front undergoing\nstrain-induced semigeostrophic frontogenesis and internal wave (IW) vertical\nmodes. The quasilinear model is solved numerically for variable imposed strain\nmagnitudes, initial IW vertical modes, and for both minimum frequency\n(near-inertial, NI) and high-frequency IWs. The front-IW KE exchanges are\nquantified separately during two frontogenetic stages -- an exponential\nsharpening stage that is characterized by a low Rossby number and is driven by\nthe imposed geostrophic strain, followed by a superexponential sharpening stage\nthat is characterized by an order-one Rossby number and is driven by the\nconvergence of the ageostrophic secondary circulation. It is demonstrated that\nhigh-frequency IWs quickly escape the frontal zone and are very efficient at\nextracting KE from the imposed geostrophic strain field through the deformation\nshear production (DSP) mechanism. Part of the extracted KE is then converted to\nwave potential energy. Minimum frequency IWs remain locked to the frontal zone\nand therefore exchange energy with the ageostrophic frontal circulation. During\nthe exponential stage, IWs extract KE from the geostrophic strain through DSP\nand transfer it to the frontal secondary circulation via the ageostrophic shear\nproduction (AGSP) mechanism. During the superexponential stage a newly\nidentified mechanism, convergence production (CP), which is directly linked to\nthe convergent secondary circulation, plays an important role in the NIW KE\nbudget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 09:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 20:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Despite delivering encouraging results,\nthese approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global\nrelation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the\ninherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel\nformulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence\nreconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of\neach vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes\nlong-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular\nlocally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each\nsub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we\npropose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient\nmaps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two\nbranches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original\nor gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain\ncomprehensive feature representations for reconstruction. Evaluations are\nconducted on a number of light field datasets, including real-world scenes and\nsynthetic data. The proposed method achieves superior performance comparing\nwith other state-of-the-art schemes.

The approach\nnaturally handles forcing terms with space-time colour; it allows inexpensive\nparametric investigation of sensor/actuator placement in scenarios where\ndisturbances/targets are low rank; it is directly applicable to complex flows\ndisturbed by high-rank forcing; it has lower cost in comparison to standard\nmethods; it can be used in scenarios where an adjoint solver is not available;\nor it can be based exclusively on experimental data. The method is particularly\nwell-suited for the control of amplifier flows, for which optimal control\napproaches are typically robust. Validation of the approach is performed using\nthe linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation. Flow over a backward-facing step\nperturbed by high-rank forcing is then considered. Sensor and actuator\nplacement are investigated for this case, and we show that while the flow\nresponse downstream of the step is dominated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism,\nit has a complex, high-rank receptivity to incoming upstream perturbations,\nrequiring multiple sensors for control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 14:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Graph representation learning\nmethods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to\nenable the use of different classification algorithms.

Furthermore, we\nfurnish accuracy results up to 98% at lower thicknesses, which is a significant\nimprovement over existing SE-based analysis, thereby making our solution a\nviable option for thickness estimation of ultrathin films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 19:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 23:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-10"}
