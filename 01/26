In particular, non-calcified plaques pose a great challenge, as\nthey are harder to detect and more likely to rupture than calcified plaques.\nWhile current deep learning techniques allow precise segmentation of real-life\nimages, the performance in medical images is still low. This is caused mostly\nby blurriness and ambiguous voxel intensities of unrelated parts that fall on\nthe same value range. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for\nsegmenting calcified and non-calcified plaques in CCTA-CPR scans of coronary\narteries. The input slices are masked so only the voxels within the wall vessel\nare considered for segmentation, thus, reducing ambiguity. This mask can be\nautomatically generated via a deep learning-based vessel detector, that\nprovides not only the contour of the outer artery wall, but also the inner\ncontour. For evaluation, we utilized a dataset in which each voxel is carefully\nannotated as one of five classes: background, lumen, artery wall, calcified\nplaque, or non-calcified plaque. We also provide an exhaustive evaluation by\napplying different types of masks, in order to validate the potential of vessel\nmasking for plaque segmentation. Our methodology results in a prominent boost\nin segmentation performance, in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation,\nachieving accurate plaque shapes even for the challenging non-calcified\nplaques. Furthermore, when using highly accurate masks, difficult cases such as\nstenosis become segmentable.

We show that the proposed method is better than the state-of-the-art,\nespecially, when we consider the scenario where title-input is missing at\ninference time and for cross-dataset evaluation, our method outperforms\nprevious approaches by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 16:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

To better understand the formation of high-mass stars, it is\nfundamental to investigate how matter accretes onto young massive stars, how it\nis ejected, and how all this differs from the low-mass case.

Aims. We study the\ninterplay between infall and outflow in G31.41+0.31 by investigating at a\nspatial resolution of a few 100 au their properties and their possible impact\non the core. Methods. We carried out molecular line observations of typical\nhigh-density tracers, such as CH3CN or H2CO, and shock and outflow tracers,\nsuch as SiO, with ALMA at 1.4 mm that achieved an angular resolution of 0.09\"\n(340 au). Results. The observations have revealed inverse P-Cygni profiles in\nCH3CN and H2CO toward the four sources embedded in the Main core, suggesting\nthat all of them are undergoing collapse. The infall rates, estimated from the\nred-shifted absorption are on the order of 1E-2 Msun/yr. The individual infall\nrates imply that the accretion timescale of the Main core is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than its rotation timescale. This confirms that rotating\ntoroids such as the G31 Main core are non-equilibrium, transient collapsing\nstructures that need to be constantly replenished with fresh material from a\nlarge-scale reservoir. For sources B, C, and D, the infall could be\naccelerating inside the sources, while for source A, the presence of a second\nemission component complicates the interpretation.

Energy conservation is observed when averaging\nis done on the slow time scale relevant to parametric amplification,evidenced\nby a constant of the motion in the amplitude equation.

Digital circuits, despite having been studied for nearly a century\nand used at scale for about half that time, have until recently evaded a fully\ncompositional theoretical understanding. The sticking point has been the need\nto avoid feedback loops that bypass memory elements, the so called\n`combinational feedback' problem. This requires examining the internal\nstructure of a circuit, defeating compositionality. Recent work remedied this\ntheoretical shortcoming by showing how digital circuits can be presented\ncompositionally as morphisms in a freely generated Cartesian traced (dataflow)\ncategory. The focus was to support a better syntactical understanding of\ndigital circuits, culminating in the formulation of novel operational semantics\nfor digital circuits using an equational theory. The goals of this paper are\ntwofold. First we formalise the semantics of digital circuits by interpreting\nthem as functions on streams with certain properties. Second we refine the\nprevious equational theory so that it is in perfect agreement with the semantic\nmodel. To support this result we introduce two key equations: the first can\neliminate non-delay-guarded feedback via finite unfoldings, and the second can\ntranslate between circuits with the same behaviour syntactically by reducing\nthe problem to checking a finite number of closed circuits. While these are\nenough to establish a correspondence between the denotational and the\nequational frameworks, we also show how simpler equations can be derived for\nmore intuitive reasoning. The most important consequence of this is that we can\nnow give a recipe that ensures a circuit always produces observable output,\nthus using the denotational model to inform and improve the operational\nsemantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 16:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 15:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 15:24:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 14:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 09:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In the\nmathematical finance community, it has therefore emerged a new paradigm, named\nrough volatility modeling, that represents the volatility dynamics of financial\nassets as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent very small, which\nindeed produces rough paths. At the same time, prices' time series have been\nshown to be multiscaling, characterized by different Hurst scaling exponents.\nThis paper assesses the interplay, if present, between price multiscaling and\nvolatility roughness, defined as the (low) Hurst exponent of the volatility\nprocess. In particular, we perform extensive simulation experiments by using\none of the leading rough volatility models present in the literature, the rough\nBergomi model. A real data analysis is also carried out in order to test if the\nrough volatility model reproduces the same relationship. We find that the model\nis able to reproduce multiscaling features of the prices' time series when a\nlow value of the Hurst exponent is used but it fails to reproduce what the real\ndata say. Indeed, we find that the dependency between prices' multiscaling and\nthe Hurst exponent of the volatility process is diametrically opposite to what\nwe find in real data, namely a negative interplay between the two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 17:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Image generation\nbased on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a promising study. However,\nsince convolutions are limited by spatial-agnostic and channel-specific,\nfeatures extracted by traditional GANs based on convolution are constrained.\nTherefore, GANs are unable to capture any more details per image. On the other\nhand, straightforwardly stacking of convolutions causes too many parameters and\nlayers in GANs, which will lead to a high risk of overfitting. To overcome the\naforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a new GANs called\nInvolution Generative Adversarial Networks (GIU-GANs). GIU-GANs leverages a\nbrand new module called the Global Information Utilization (GIU) module, which\nintegrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and involution to focus on\nglobal information by channel attention mechanism, leading to a higher quality\nof generated images. Meanwhile, Batch Normalization(BN) inevitably ignores the\nrepresentation differences among noise sampled by the generator, and thus\ndegrade the generated image quality. Thus we introduce Representative Batch\nNormalization(RBN) to the GANs architecture for this issue.

These two schemes make use of multiplication of large\npolynomials over binary rings, and due to the polynomial size (from 10,000 to\n60,000 bits), this operation is one of the costliest during key generation,\nencapsulation, or decapsulation mechanisms.

This instruction deals with up to four\npolynomial (of degree up to 63) multiplications, the four results being stored\nin one single 512-bit word. This allows to divide by roughly 3 the retired\ninstruction number of the operation in comparison with the AVX2 instruction set\nimplementations, while the speedup is up to 39% in terms of processor clock\ncycles.

In that proposal, is was assumed that the scattering is perfectly\nelastic, i.e. that the center-of-mass kinetic energy of the soliton is lower\nthan the chemical potential of the soliton. Here we relax this assumption.\nAlso, we introduce an interferometric scheme, which uses interference of\nsoltions, that can be used to detect the degree of coherence between the\nreflected and transmitted part of the soliton. Using exact diagonalization, we\nnumerically simulate a complete interferometric cycle for a soliton consisting\nof six atoms.

In\norder to allow these autonomous flights, drones need to know their location\nconstantly. Then, based on the current position and the final destination,\nnavigation commands will be generated and drones will be guided to their\ndestination. Localization can be easily carried out in outdoor environments\nusing GPS signals and drone inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, such an\napproach is not feasible in indoor environments or GPS-denied areas. In this\npaper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called PILOT (High-Precision\nIndoor Localization for Autonomous Drones) that is specifically designed for\nindoor environments. PILOT relies on ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate\nthe target drone's location. In order to have a precise final estimation of the\ndrone's location, PILOT deploys a three-stage localization scheme. The first\ntwo stages provide robustness against the multi-path fading effect of indoor\nenvironments and mitigate the ranging error. Then, in the third stage, PILOT\ndeploys a simple yet effective technique to reduce the localization error\ninduced by the relative geometry between transmitters and receivers and\nsignificantly reduces the height estimation error. The performance of PILOT was\nassessed under different scenarios and the results indicate that PILOT achieves\ncentimeter-level accuracy for three-dimensional localization of drones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 17:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Intensity interferometers do not rely on phase coherence of\nthe optical elements and thus function without high grade optics and light\ncombining delay lines. However, the coherence time of starlight observed with\nrealistic optical filter bandwidths (> 0.1 nm) is usually much smaller than the\ntime resolution of the detection system (> 10 ps), resulting in a greatly\nreduced correlation signal. Reaching high signal to noise in a reasonably short\nmeasurement time can be achieved in different ways: either by increasing the\ntime resolution, which increases the correlation signal height, or by\nincreasing the photon rate, which decreases statistical uncertainties of the\nmeasurement. We present laboratory measurements employing both approaches and\ndirectly compare them in terms of signal to noise ratio.

This paper presents a comprehensive\ncomparison between the results of three different approaches to topology\noptimization under uncertain loading, considering stress constraints: 1) the\nrobust formulation, which requires only the mean and standard deviation of\nstresses at each element; 2) the reliability-based formulation, which imposes a\nreliability constraint on computed stresses; 3) the non-probabilistic\nformulation, which considers a worst-case scenario for the stresses caused by\nuncertain loads. The information required by each method, regarding the\nuncertain loads, and the uncertainty propagation approach used in each case is\nquite different. The robust formulation requires only mean and standard\ndeviation of uncertain loads; stresses are computed via a first-order\nperturbation approach. The reliability-based formulation requires full\nprobability distributions of random loads, reliability constraints are computed\nvia a first-order performance measure approach. The non-probabilistic\nformulation is applicable for bounded uncertain loads; only lower and upper\nbounds are used, and worst-case stresses are computed via a nested optimization\nwith anti-optimization. The three approaches are quite different in the\nhandling of uncertainties; however, the basic topology optimization framework\nis the same: the traditional density approach is employed for material\nparameterization, while the augmented Lagrangian method is employed to solve\nthe resulting problem, in order to handle the large number of stress\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 18:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

This complexity can hinder the ability to explain\nrecommendations to end users, which is particularly important for\nrecommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure\nrecommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction,\nexplainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and\nforgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty.\n  In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the\ncontext of MRSs.

We\npresent a new clustering-based technique that enables the detection of these\nweak IGM absorbers by statistically averaging over all spectral pixels, here\napplied to the C IV forest. We simulate the z=4.5 IGM with different models of\ninhomogeneous metal distributions and investigate its two-point correlation\nfunction (2PCF) using mock skewers of the C IV forest.

Basic Quantum Algorithms\nrevisits the earliest quantum algorithms. The journey began in 1985 with\nDeutsch attempting to evaluate a function at two domain points simultaneously.\nThen, in 1992, Deutsch and Jozsa created a quantum algorithm that determines\nwhether a Boolean function is constant or balanced. The following year,\nBernstein and Vazirani realized that the same algorithm could be used to\nidentify a specific Boolean function within a set of linear Boolean functions.\nIn 1994, Simon introduced a novel quantum algorithm that determined whether a\nfunction was one-to-one or two-to-one exponentially faster than any classical\nalgorithm for the same problem.

We unveil analytically and confirm numerically the\ncritical thresholds for the existence of such branches and explore the\nbifurcations (such as saddle-node ones) that delimit their existence, as well\nas transcritical ones that lead to their potential exchange of stability. We\nfind that out of the four relevant branches, only one, the upper symmetric\nbranch, corresponds to a spectrally and dynamically robust solution.

Current active-learning\nSATD recognition tool involves manual inspection of 24% of the test comments on\naverage to reach 90% of the recall. Among all the test comments, about 5% are\nSATDs. The human experts are then required to read almost a quintuple of the\nSATD comments which indicates the inefficiency of the tool. Plus, human experts\nare still prone to error: 95% of the false-positive labels from previous work\nwere actually true positives.\n  To solve the above problems, we propose DebtFree, a two-mode framework based\non unsupervised learning for identifying SATDs. In mode1, when the existing\ntraining data is unlabeled, DebtFree starts with an unsupervised learner to\nautomatically pseudo-label the programming comments in the training data. In\ncontrast, in mode2 where labels are available with the corresponding training\ndata, DebtFree starts with a pre-processor that identifies the highly prone\nSATDs from the test dataset. Then, our machine learning model is employed to\nassist human experts in manually identifying the remaining SATDs. Our\nexperiments on 10 software projects show that both models yield a statistically\nsignificant improvement in effectiveness over the state-of-the-art automated\nand semi-automated models. Specifically, DebtFree can reduce the labeling\neffort by 99% in mode1 (unlabeled training data), and up to 63% in mode2\n(labeled training data) while improving the current active learner's F1\nrelatively to almost 100%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 19:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Methods: A patient cohort of 17 males were imaged\nafter intravenous administration of a mean FCH activity of 244.3 MBq. The\nresulting PET/CT images were processed in order to generate individualized\ninput source and geometry files for dose computation with the MC tool GATE. The\nresulting dose estimates were studied and compared to the MIRD method with two\ndifferent computational phantoms. Mass correction of the S-factors was applied\nwhen possible. Potential sources of uncertainty were closely examined: the\neffect of partial body images, urinary bladder emptying, and biokinetic\nmodeling.\n  Results: Large differences in doses between our methodology and the MIRD\nmethod were found, generally in the range of $\\pm$25%, and up to $\\pm$120% for\nsome cases. The mass scaling showed improvements, especially for non-walled and\nhigh-uptake tissues. Simulations of the urinary bladder emptying showed\nnegligible effects on doses to other organs, with the exception of the\nprostate. Dosimetry based on partial PET/CT images (excluding the legs)\nresulted in an over-estimation of mean doses to bone, skin, and remaining\ntissues, and minor differences in other organs/tissues. Estimated uncertainties\nassociated with the biokinetics of FCH introduce variations of cumulated\nactivities in the range of $\\pm$10% in the high-uptake organs.\n  Conclusions: The MC methodology allows for a higher degree of dosimetry\nindividualization than the MIRD methodology, which in some cases leads to\nimportant differences in dose values. Dosimetry of FCH-PET based on a single\npartial PET study seems viable due to the particular biokinetics of FCH, even\nthough some correction factors may need to be applied to estimate mean\nskin/bone doses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 19:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

The proposed data augmentation procedure facilitates\nsampling latent variables from (truncated) univariate normal distributions, and\navoids numerical computation of the inverse of the structured covariance\nmatrix. The Bayesian multivariate (linear transformation) model is applied to\ntwo-way nested interval-censored event times to analyze differences in adverse\nevents between three groups of patients, who were randomly allocated to\ntreatment with different stents (BIO-RESORT). The parameters of the structured\ncovariance matrix represent unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects and\nare examined to detect differential treatment effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Fluids, vol. 31, 2019, p. 125102) proposed a new turbulence\nsimulation method which shows better performance than other classic turbulence\nmodels. It is composed of a small-eddy-dissipation mixing length (SED-ML) model\nfor calculating the reference solution and a parameter extension method for\ncorrecting the solution. The mechanism of this method is more deeply analyzed\nin this study to find out how to develop a turbulence model with a high\naccuracy and a low computational cost. The turbulent channel flows with\nRe_tau=821 and 2003 and decaying homogenous and isotropic turbulence are\nsimulated to demonstrate how the new turbulence simulation method works. The\nsmall-eddy-dissipation (SED) mechanism for developing turbulence models has\nbeen proposed through our analysis. According to this mechanism, the model\nsolution is an asymptotic approximation of the exact solution of the\nNavier-Stokes equations. The modeling term introduces an artificial dissipation\nwhich dissipates small eddies. The purpose of turbulence modeling is to\ndissipate more small eddies without changing the statistical solution\nqualitatively. We expect more small eddies can be dissipated where the\nturbulence is stronger. This mechanism is different from RANS which\napproximates the Reynolds stresses and LES which approximates the\nsub-grid-scale (SGS) motions, while it interprets the physics of turbulence\nmodeling more precisely. A modified mixing length with two damping functions is\ndeveloped to identify the characteristic length of turbulence, leading to the\nSED-ML model. The simulation accuracy can be further improved using a linear\nextension. Our numerical results show that the SED-ML model is in accordance\nwith the SED mechanism. This might explain why the new method is more accurate\nthan RANS while it requires a lower computational cost than LES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

In this\nwork, we aim to design a DFRC system under the practical assumption of partial\nCSIT. To achieve this, the proposed DFRC marries the capabilities of a\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access\n(RSMA). RSMA is a powerful downlink communication scheme based on linearly\nprecoded Rate-Splitting (RS) that partially decodes multi-user interference\n(MUI) and partially treats it as noise and is inherently robust to partial\nCSIT. Using RSMA, the DFRC precoders are optimized in the presence of partial\nCSIT to simultaneously maximize the Average Weighted Sum-Rate (AWSR) under\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) constraints and minimize the DFRC beampattern Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) against an ideal MIMO radar beampattern. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the RSMA-based DFRC largely outperforms DFRCs based on other\ncommonly used strategies such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and\nNon-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). Specifically, the common stream unique\nin the RSMA-based DFRC allows for flexible rate partitioning to guarantee user\nrate fairness with partial CSIT while also being the main contributor to\ngenerating a directional beampattern for effective radar sensing. The practical\nperformance of the DFRC is then further assessed through Link-Level simulations\n(LLS) to take into account the effects of coding and modulation in the finite\nlength regime as well as the channel aging due to mobility and latency, where\nthe superiority of RSMA is again corroborated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 20:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

A key feature of the filter\nlies in that it explicitly addresses the nonstationary surface-foot contact\npoint and the hybrid robot behaviors. Another key feature is that, in the\nabsence of IMU biases, the filter satisfies the attractive group affine and\ninvariant observation conditions, and is thus provably convergent for the\ndeterministic continuous phases. The observability analysis is performed to\nreveal the effects of DRS movement on the state observability, and the\nconvergence property of the hybrid, deterministic filter system is examined for\nthe observable state variables.

The\nconfigurability and flexibility of an RIS deployed in an Internet-of-Things\n(IoT)-based network can enable network designers to devise stand-alone or\ncooperative configurations that have considerable advantages over conventional\nnetworks.

In DNN_R-CRIS model, the potential of RIS\ndeployment as an IoT-based relay element in a next-generation cooperative\nnetwork is investigated using deep learning (DL) techniques for RIS phase\noptimization.

As a multi-modality task, it is challenging since it requires not\nonly visual and textual understanding, but also the ability to align\ncross-modality representations. Previous approaches extensively employ\nentity-level alignments, such as the correlations between the visual regions\nand their semantic labels, or the interactions across question words and object\nfeatures. These attempts aim to improve the cross-modality representations,\nwhile ignoring their internal relations. Instead, we propose to apply\nstructured alignments, which work with graph representation of visual and\ntextual content, aiming to capture the deep connections between the visual and\ntextual modalities. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to represent and integrate\ngraphs for structured alignments. In this work, we attempt to solve this issue\nby first converting different modality entities into sequential nodes and the\nadjacency graph, then incorporating them for structured alignments. As\ndemonstrated in our experimental results, such a structured alignment improves\nreasoning performance. In addition, our model also exhibits better\ninterpretability for each generated answer.

Moreover, reasoning in visual\nquestion answering requires the model to understand both image and question,\nand align them in the same space, rather than simply memorize statistics about\nthe question-answer pairs. Thus, it is essential to find component connections\nbetween different modalities and within each modality to achieve better\nattention. Previous works learned attention weights directly on the features.\nHowever, the improvement is limited since these two modality features are in\ntwo domains: image features are highly diverse, lacking structure and\ngrammatical rules as language, and natural language features have a higher\nprobability of missing detailed information. To better learn the attention\nbetween visual and text, we focus on how to construct input stratification and\nembed structural information to improve the alignment between different level\ncomponents. We propose Multi-Granularity Alignment architecture for Visual\nQuestion Answering task (MGA-VQA), which learns intra- and inter-modality\ncorrelations by multi-granularity alignment, and outputs the final result by\nthe decision fusion module. In contrast to previous works, our model splits\nalignment into different levels to achieve learning better correlations without\nneeding additional data and annotations. The experiments on the VQA-v2 and GQA\ndatasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms non-pretrained\nstate-of-the-art methods on both datasets without extra pretraining data and\nannotations.

To\novercome this limitation, we propose employing a semi-supervised method, i.e.,\nvirtual adversarial training (VAT), to leverage and learn useful information\nunderlying in unlabeled data for better classification of breast masses.\nAccordingly, our VAT-based models have two types of losses, namely supervised\nand virtual adversarial losses.

Motivated by the\nlong-standing empirical work on causality in econometrics, social sciences, and\nbiomedical sciences, in this paper we lay out the conditions for appropriate\napplication of causal fairness under the \"potential outcomes framework.\" We\nhighlight key aspects of causal inference that are often ignored in the causal\nfairness literature. In particular, we discuss the importance of specifying the\nnature and timing of interventions on social categories such as race or gender.\nPrecisely, instead of postulating an intervention on immutable attributes, we\npropose a shift in focus to their perceptions and discuss the implications for\nfairness evaluation. We argue that such conceptualization of the intervention\nis key in evaluating the validity of causal assumptions and conducting sound\ncausal analysis including avoiding post-treatment bias. Subsequently, we\nillustrate how causality can address the limitations of existing fairness\nmetrics, including those that depend upon statistical correlations.\nSpecifically, we introduce causal variants of common statistical notions of\nfairness, and we make a novel observation that under the causal framework there\nis no fundamental disagreement between different notions of fairness. Finally,\nwe conduct extensive experiments where we demonstrate our approach for\nevaluating and mitigating unfairness, specially when post-treatment variables\nare present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 17:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

To fly completely or partially on their own, drones need access\nto location services to get navigation commands. While using the Global\nPositioning System (GPS) is an obvious choice, GPS is not always available, can\nbe spoofed or jammed, and is highly error-prone for indoor and underground\nenvironments. The ranging method using beacons is one of the popular methods\nfor localization, specially for indoor environments. In general, localization\nerror in this class is due to two factors: the ranging error and the error\ninduced by the relative geometry between the beacons and the target object to\nlocalize. This paper proposes OPTILOD (Optimal Beacon Placement for\nHigh-Accuracy Indoor Localization of Drones), an optimization algorithm for the\noptimal placement of beacons deployed in three-dimensional indoor environments.\nOPTILOD leverages advances in Evolutionary Algorithms to compute the minimum\nnumber of beacons and their optimal placement to minimize the localization\nerror. These problems belong to the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) class and\nare both considered NP-Hard. Despite that, OPTILOD can provide multiple optimal\nbeacon configurations that minimize the localization error and the number of\ndeployed beacons concurrently and time efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

The present\nstudy experimentally explores the nature of the pairing condensate in a doped\nspin-liquid candidate material and under varying pressure, which changes the\nelectron-electron Coulombic interactions across the Mott critical value in the\nsystem. The transport measurements reveal that the superconductivity at low\npressures is a BEC-like condensate from a non-Fermi liquid and crosses over to\na BCS-like condensate from a Fermi liquid at high pressures. The Nernst-effect\nmeasurements distinctively illustrate the two regimes of the pairing in terms\nof its robustness to the magnetic field. The present Mott tuning of the BEC-BCS\ncrossover can be compared to the Feshbach tuning of the BEC-BCS crossover of\nfermionic cold atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 01:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

However, current\ntransformer-based models suffer from several disadvantages: (1) existing\nmethods fail to capture the important features of the images due to the naive\ntokenization scheme; (2) the models suffer from information loss because they\nonly consider single-scale feature representations; and (3) the segmentation\nlabel maps generated by the models are not accurate enough without considering\nrich semantic contexts and anatomical textures. In this work, we present\nCASTformer, a novel type of adversarial transformers, for 2D medical image\nsegmentation. First, we take advantage of the pyramid structure to construct\nmulti-scale representations and handle multi-scale variations. We then design a\nnovel class-aware transformer module to better learn the discriminative regions\nof objects with semantic structures. Lastly, we utilize an adversarial training\nstrategy that boosts segmentation accuracy and correspondingly allows a\ntransformer-based discriminator to capture high-level semantically correlated\ncontents and low-level anatomical features. Our experiments demonstrate that\nCASTformer dramatically outperforms previous state-of-the-art transformer-based\napproaches on three benchmarks, obtaining 2.54%-5.88% absolute improvements in\nDice over previous models. Further qualitative experiments provide a more\ndetailed picture of the model's inner workings, shed light on the challenges in\nimproved transparency, and demonstrate that transfer learning can greatly\nimprove performance and reduce the size of medical image datasets in training,\nmaking CASTformer a strong starting point for downstream medical image analysis\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 03:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 02:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 16:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 19:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 17:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

Examples range from our ability to walk or\nswim, to setting boundaries of speed and fuel efficiency of moving vehicles. In\nmagnetic systems, the displacement of chiral domain walls (DW) and skyrmions\n(SK) by Spin Orbit Torques (SOT), is also prone to friction. Chiral damping,\nthe dissipative counterpart of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction (DMI),\nplays a central role in these dynamics. Despite experimental observation, and\nnumerous theoretical studies confirming its existence, the influence of chiral\ndamping on DW and SK dynamics has remained elusive due to the difficulty of\ndiscriminating from DMI. Here we unveil the effect that chiral damping has on\nthe flow motion of DWs and SKs driven by current and magnetic field. We use a\nstatic in-plane field to lift the chiral degeneracy. As the in-plane field is\nincreased, the chiral asymmetry changes sign. When considered separately,\nneither DMI nor chiral damping can explain the sign reversal of the asymmetry,\nwhich we prove to be the result of their competing effects.

Over the last decade, a\nnumber of anti-phishing techniques have been proposed to detect and mitigate\nthese attacks. However, they are still inefficient and inaccurate. Thus, there\nis a great need for efficient and accurate detection techniques to cope with\nthese attacks. In this paper, we proposed a phishing attack detection technique\nbased on machine learning. We collected and analyzed more than 4000 phishing\nemails targeting the email service of the University of North Dakota. We\nmodeled these attacks by selecting 10 relevant features and building a large\ndataset. This dataset was used to train, validate, and test the machine\nlearning algorithms. For performance evaluation, four metrics have been used,\nnamely probability of detection, probability of miss-detection, probability of\nfalse alarm, and accuracy. The experimental results show that better detection\ncan be achieved using an artificial neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 05:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

This paper develops a novel image\ninpainting approach that enables users to customize the inpainting result by\ntheir own preference or memory. Specifically, our approach is composed of two\nstages that utilize the prior of neural network and user's guidance to jointly\ninpaint corrupted images. In the first stage, an autoencoder based on a novel\nexternal spatial attention mechanism is deployed to produce reconstructed\nfeatures of the corrupted image and a coarse inpainting result that provides\nsemantic mask as the medium for user interaction. In the second stage, a\nsemantic decoder that takes the reconstructed features as prior is adopted to\nsynthesize a fine inpainting result guided by user's customized semantic mask,\nso that the final inpainting result will share the same content with user's\nguidance while the textures and colors reconstructed in the first stage are\npreserved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in\nterms of inpainting quality and controllability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 05:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Hence they tend to harness high-gain beamforming. Therefore a novel\nhybrid 3D beamformer relying on sophisticated sensor-based beam training and\nchannel estimation is proposed for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)\naided THz MIMO systems. A so-called array-of-subarray based THz BS architecture\nis adopted and the corresponding sub-RIS structure is proposed. The BS, RIS and\nreceiver antenna arrays of the users are all uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The\nUltra-wideband (UWB) sensors are integrated into the RIS and the user location\ninformation obtained by the UWB sensors is exploited for channel estimation and\nbeamforming. Furthermore, the novel concept of a Precise Beamforming Algorithm\n(PBA) is proposed, which further improves the beam-forming accuracy by\ncircumventing the performance limitations imposed by positioning errors.\nMoreover, the conditions of maintaining the orthogonality of the RIS-aided THz\nchannel are derived in support of spatial multiplexing.

Unfortunately, RWM comes with an inherent\ncomputational barrier: it requires maintaining and sampling from a distribution\nover all possible actions. In typical settings of interest the action space is\nexponentially large, seemingly rendering RWM useless in practice.\n  In this work, we refute this notion for a broad variety of \\emph{structured}\ngames, showing it is possible to efficiently (approximately) sample the action\nspace in RWM in \\emph{polylogarithmic} time. This gives the first efficient\nno-regret algorithms for problems such as the \\emph{(discrete) Colonel Blotto\ngame}, \\emph{matroid congestion}, \\emph{matroid security}, and basic\n\\emph{dueling games}. As an immediate corollary, we give a polylogarithmic time\nmeta-algorithm to compute approximate Nash Equilibria for these games that is\nexponentially faster than prior methods in several important settings.

It has been shown that standard confidence\nintervals for test error using estimates from CV may have coverage below\nnominal levels. This phenomenon occurs because each sample is used in both the\ntraining and testing procedures during CV and as a result, the CV estimates of\nthe errors become correlated. Without accounting for this correlation, the\nestimate of the variance is smaller than it should be. One way to mitigate this\nissue is by estimating the mean squared error of the prediction error instead\nusing nested CV. This approach has been shown to achieve superior coverage\ncompared to intervals derived from standard CV. In this work, we generalize the\nnested CV idea to the Cox proportional hazards model and explore various\nchoices of test error for this setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 06:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

It is important in\nmany practical scenarios and has attracted extensive attention from both\ncomputer vision and robotics communities. However, most existing works only use\nRGB images but neglect the 3D semantic information of the scene. To this end,\nwe develop a novel self-supervised training framework to encode the voxel-level\n3D semantic reconstruction into a 3D semantic representation. Specifically, a\nregion query task is designed as the pretext task, which predicts the presence\nor absence of objects of a particular class in a specific 3D region. Then, we\nconstruct an LSTM-based navigation model and train it with the proposed 3D\nsemantic representations and BERT language features on vision-language pairs.\nExperiments show that the proposed approach achieves success rates of 68% and\n66% on the validation unseen and test unseen splits of the R2R dataset\nrespectively, which are superior to most of RGB-based methods utilizing\nvision-language transformers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 07:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

We propose in this paper a similar\ntwisted bilayer system but defined on the square lattice with $\\pi$-flux per\nplaquette, and study its spectrum using the BM Hamiltonian with a mass term\nwhich is originated from the staggered potential. The basic difference between\nthe TBG and the present model is simply rotational symmetry, $C_3$ vs $C_4$, as\nwell as a mass term. Nevertheless, the feature of the flat bands is quite\ndifferent: Those of the TBG appear at magic angles only, while the present\nmodel shows many flat bands, which are reminiscent of Landau levels, quite\nstably at any angles even in the absence of a magnetic field other than\n$\\pi$-flux which keeps time reversal (TR) symmetry. Moreover, flat bands emerge\nin the mass gap of the Dirac spectrum, and each state composing these flat\nbands is well-localized at the position forming the moir\\'e lattice. It turns\nout that the moir\\'e potential serves as a periodic magnetic field, which can\ngive energies smaller that the gap around moir\\'e lattice positions. We derive\na local Hamiltonian valid around the moir\\'e lattice sites and show that it\nindeed reproduces the energies of the flat bands within the mass gap. Since\nthese mid-gap states are localized at the moir\\'e lattice, they form degenerate\nlevels, which may be referred to as moir\\'e Landau levels, although the\nmechanism of degeneracies are different from the conventional Landau levels.\nInterestingly, doubled fermions of the BH Hamiltonian associated with two\nlayers have opposite charges when they couple with the effective moir\\'e\nmagnetic filed, which concern TR symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 07:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 07:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 22:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

We\nfirst analyze the relationship between the AI task's performance and the\nsemantic information. Then, to optimize the AI task's perfomance under resource\nconstraints, a bandwidth and power allocation problem is formulated. The\nproblem is first separated into two subproblems due to the non-convexity. The\nfirst subproblem is a compression ratio optimization problem with a given\nresource allocation scheme, which is solved by a enumeration algorithm. The\nsecond subproblem is to find the optimal resource allocation scheme, which is\ntransformed into a convex problem by successive convex approximation method,\nand solved by a convex optimization method.

In this\nintroductory work, we focus on beam errors arising from physically offset\nand/or broken antennas within a station. We use the public code OSKAR to\ngenerate an \"ideal\" SKA beam formed from 256 antennas regularly-spaced in a\n35-m circle, as well as a large database of \"perturbed\" beams sampling\ndistributions of broken/offset antennas. We decompose the beam errors (\"ideal\"\nminus \"perturbed\") using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA\n(KPCA). Using 20 components, we find that PCA/KPCA can reduce the residual of\nthe beam in our datasets by 60-90% compared with the assumption of an ideal\nbeam. Using a simulated observation of the cosmic signal plus foregrounds, we\nfind that assuming the ideal beam can result in 1% error in the EoR window and\n10% in the wedge of the 2D power spectrum. When PCA/KPCA is used to\ncharacterize the beam uncertainties, the error in the power spectrum shrinks to\nbelow 0.01% in the EoR window and <1% in the wedge.

To\ndemystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely\nsimple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift\noperation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The\nonly operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between\nneighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new\nbackbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are\nsubstituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in\nseveral mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation.\nThe performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin\nTransformer.

Remarkably, the threshold thermal phonon number for\npreserving entanglement in our simulations has been observed to be up to\n\\emph{three} orders of magnitude stronger than that in the DM-unbreaking\nregime. The application of the DM-breaking mechanism to optomechanical networks\ncan make noise-tolerant entanglement networks feasible.

A great advantage of the EKI's ensemble approach is that\nderivatives are not required in its implementation. But theoretically speaking,\nEKI's ensemble size needs to surpass the dimension of the problem. This is\nbecause of EKI's \"subspace property\", i.e., that the EKI solution is a linear\ncombination of the initial ensemble it starts off with. We show that the\nensemble can break out of this initial subspace when \"localization\" is applied.\nIn essence, localization enforces an assumed correlation structure onto the\nproblem, and is heavily used in ensemble Kalman filtering and data\nassimilation. We describe and analyze how to apply localization to the EKI, and\nhow localization helps the EKI ensemble break out of the initial subspace.\nSpecifically, we show that the localized EKI (LEKI) ensemble will collapse to a\nsingle point (as intended) and that the LEKI ensemble mean will converge to the\nglobal optimum at a sublinear rate.

Particularly, the quality of IoE services\ndelivery must be maintained by analyzing contextual metrics of IoE such as\npeople, data, process, and things. However, the challenges incorporate when the\nAI model conceives a lake of interpretation and intuition to the network\nservice provider. Therefore, this paper provides an explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) framework for quality-aware IoE service delivery that\nenables both intelligence and interpretation. First, a problem of quality-aware\nIoE service delivery is formulated by taking into account network dynamics and\ncontextual metrics of IoE, where the objective is to maximize the channel\nquality index (CQI) of each IoE service user. Second, a regression problem is\ndevised to solve the formulated problem, where explainable coefficients of the\ncontextual matrices are estimated by Shapley value interpretation. Third, the\nXAI-enabled quality-aware IoE service delivery algorithm is implemented by\nemploying ensemble-based regression models for ensuring the interpretation of\ncontextual relationships among the matrices to reconfigure network parameters.\nFinally, the experiment results show that the uplink improvement rate becomes\n42.43% and 16.32% for the AdaBoost and Extra Trees, respectively, while the\ndownlink improvement rate reaches up to 28.57% and 14.29%. However, the\nAdaBoost-based approach cannot maintain the CQI of IoE service users.\nTherefore, the proposed Extra Trees-based regression model shows significant\nperformance gain for mitigating the trade-off between accuracy and\ninterpretability than other baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

To mitigate this issue, we propose a simple\nand effective scheme to introduce the spatial information from LiDAR signals to\nthe monocular 3D detectors, without introducing any extra cost in the inference\nphase. In particular, we first project the LiDAR signals into the image plane\nand align them with the RGB images. After that, we use the resulting data to\ntrain a 3D detector (LiDAR Net) with the same architecture as the baseline\nmodel. Finally, this LiDAR Net can serve as the teacher to transfer the learned\nknowledge to the baseline model. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod can significantly boost the performance of the baseline model and ranks\nthe $1^{st}$ place among all monocular-based methods on the KITTI benchmark.\nBesides, extensive ablation studies are conducted, which further prove the\neffectiveness of each part of our designs and illustrate what the baseline\nmodel has learned from the LiDAR Net.

In this paper, we propose PARS:\nPseudo-Label Aware Robust Sample Selection, a hybrid approach that combines the\nbest from all three worlds in a joint-training framework to achieve robustness\nto noisy labels.

Although users can rely on a secure peer-to-peer (P2P)\nchannel for file sharing, this introduces potential delay on the data transfer\nand requires the sender to remain active and connected while the transfer\nprocess occurs. Instead of using the P2P channel for the entire file, users can\nupload information about the file on a common CSP and share only the essential\ninformation that enables the receiver to download and recover the original\nfile. This paper introduces Bifrost, an innovative file sharing system inspired\nby recent results on dual deduplication. Bifrost achieves the desired\nfunctionality and simultaneously guarantees that (1) the CSP can efficiently\ncompress outsourced data; (2) the secure P2P channel is used only to transmit\nshort, but crucial information; (3) users can check for data integrity, i.e.,\ndetect if the CSP alters the outsourced data; and (4) only the sender (data\nowner) and the intended receiver can access the file after sharing, i.e., the\ncloud or no malicious adversary can infer useful information about the shared\nfile. We analyze compression and bandwidth performance using a proof-of-concept\nimplementation. Our experiments show that secure file sharing can be achieved\nby sending only 650 bits on the P2P channel, irrespective of file size, while\nthe CSP that aids the sharing can enjoy a compression rate of 86.9 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 09:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

The biased learned models\nusually replicate historical discrimination in society and typically negatively\naffect the less represented identities. Robots are equipped with these models\nthat allow them to operate, performing tasks more complex every day. The\nlearning process consists of different stages depending on human judgments.\nMoreover, the resulting learned models for robot decisions rely on recorded\nlabeled data or demonstrations. Therefore, the robot learning process is\nsusceptible to bias linked to human behavior in society. This imposes a\npotential danger, especially when robots operate around humans and the learning\nprocess can reflect the social unfairness present today. Different feminist\nproposals study social inequality and provide essential perspectives towards\nremoving bias in various fields. What is more, feminism allowed and still\nallows to reconfigure numerous social dynamics and stereotypes advocating for\nequality across people through their diversity. Consequently, we provide a\nfeminist perspective on the robot learning process in this work.

The reconstruction of the temperature field\nfrom limited observation plays a crucial role in thermal management for\nelectronic equipment. Deep learning has been employed in physical field\nreconstruction, whereas the accurate estimation for the regions with large\ngradients is still diffcult. To solve the problem, this work proposes a novel\ndeep learning method based on patchwise training to reconstruct the temperature\nfield of electronic equipment accurately from limited observation. Firstly, the\ntemperature field reconstruction (TFR) problem of the electronic equipment is\nmodeled mathematically and transformed as an image-to-image regression task.\nThen a patchwise training and inference framework consisting of an adaptive\nUNet and a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) is developed to establish the\nmapping from the observation to the temperature field. The adaptive UNet is\nutilized to reconstruct the whole temperature field while the MLP is designed\nto predict the patches with large temperature gradients. Experiments employing\nfinite element simulation data are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the\nproposed method. Furthermore, the generalization is evaluated by investigating\ncases under different heat source layouts, different power intensities, and\ndifferent observation point locations. The maximum absolute errors of the\nreconstructed temperature field are less than 1K under the patchwise training\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 10:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

However, practical applications require results to be accurate even\nunder complex environment with head movement and unstable illumination.\nTherefore, improving the performance of rPPG in complex environment has become\na key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel video embedding method that\nembeds each facial video sequence into a feature map referred to as Multi-scale\nAdaptive Spatial and Temporal Map with Overlap (MAST_Mop), which contains not\nonly vital information but also surrounding information as reference, which\nacts as the mirror to figure out the homogeneous perturbations imposed on\nforeground and background simultaneously, such as illumination instability.\nCorrespondingly, we propose a two-stream Transformer model to map the MAST_Mop\ninto heart rate (HR), where one stream follows the pulse signal in the facial\narea while the other figures out the perturbation signal from the surrounding\nregion such that the difference of the two channels leads to adaptive noise\ncancellation. Our approach significantly outperforms all current\nstate-of-the-art methods on two public datasets MAHNOB-HCI and VIPL-HR.

SpecFuzzer uses: (i) a\nfuzzer as a generator of candidate assertions derived from a grammar that is\nautomatically obtained from the class definition; (ii) a dynamic invariant\ndetector -- Daikon -- to filter out assertions invalidated by a test suite; and\n(iii) a mutation-based mechanism to cluster and rank assertions, so that\nsimilar constraints are grouped and then the stronger prioritized.\nGrammar-based fuzzing enables SpecFuzzer to be straightforwardly adapted to\nsupport different specification languages, by manipulating the fuzzing grammar,\ne.g., to include additional operators.\n  We evaluate our technique on a benchmark of 43 Java methods employed in the\nevaluation of the state-of-the-art techniques GAssert and EvoSpex.

The\ncyclic parameter, which plays the role of a synthetic dimension, is invoked as\na modulation of the hopping strengths. A rigorous analysis of different phase\ndiagrams has shown multiple Floquet topological phase transitions among the\nhigh Chern number phases.

Instead of applying\nperturbation theory, the whole analysis is done by Floquet replica technique.\nThis gives a freedom to study high as well as low-frequency effects on the\nsystem by considering less or more number of photon sectors.

Though\nthe masses of these SMBHs are a minor perturbation on the larger scale and\nindividual galaxy scale dark matter components in the cluster, they can impact\nstatistical lensing properties and individual lensed image configurations.\nProbing for these potentially observable signatures, we find that SMBHs imprint\ndetectable signatures in rare, higher-order strong lensing image configurations\nalthough they do not manifest any statistically significant detectable evidence\nin either the magnification distribution or the integrated shear profile.\nInvestigating specific lensed image geometries, we report that a massive, near\npoint-like, potential of an SMBH causes the following detectable effects: (i)\nimage splitting leading to the generation of extra images; (ii) positional and\nmagnification asymmetries in multiply imaged systems; and (iii) the apparent\ndisappearance of a lensed counter-image.

These states can represent local\nperturbations of nodes in power systems with loads, which introduces\nconstraints into the system.

Additionally, these\nstates should represent perturbations of individual variables in the power\ngrid, such as a perturbation of the voltage at a load. These initial states\nenable the calculation of probabilistic stability measures of power systems\nwith loads, which was not yet possible, but is important as these measures have\nbecome a crucial tool in studying power systems. To verify that these\nperturbations are network local, i.e. that the initial perturbation only\ntargets a single node in the power grid, a new measure, the spreadability,\nrelated to the closeness centrality, is presented. The spreadability is\nevaluated for an ensemble of typical power grids. The ensemble depicts a set of\nfuture power grids where consumers, as well as producers, are connected to the\ngrid via inverters.

We find that the degree of the nodes is a better predictor than the\ntopological classes for our ensemble.

The task planning\nunit assigns tasks to each robot simultaneously through a single coalesced BT.\nIf any robot falls into a fault while performing its assigned task, another BT\nembedded in the robot is executed; the robot enters the recovery mode in order\nto overcome the fault. To perform this function, the action in the BT\ncorresponding to the task is defined as a variable, which is shared with the\nDDS so that any action can be exchanged between the task planning unit and\nrobots. To show the feasibility of our framework in a real-world application,\nthree mobile robots were experimentally coordinated for them to travel\nalternately to four goal positions by the proposed single task planning unit\nvia a DDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 04:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

The target\nvolume, segmented in several layers orthogonally to the beam direction, is\nirradiated by thousands of pencil beams which must be steered and held to the\nprescribed positions until the prescribed number of particles has been\ndelivered.

To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node\npairs by making full use of node pairs exhibiting strong consistency, which are\neasy to be discovered in the early stage of gradual matching. Specifically,\nGrad-Align first generates node embeddings of the two networks based on graph\nneural networks along with our layer-wise reconstruction loss, a loss built\nupon capturing the first-order and higher-order neighborhood structures. Then,\nnodes are gradually aligned by computing dual-perception similarity measures\nincluding the multi-layer embedding similarity as well as the Tversky\nsimilarity, an asymmetric set similarity using the Tversky index applicable to\nnetworks with different scales.

Plant sciences had a\nhigher prevalence of protocols more likely to counter generalised systematic\nerrors (the most likely cause of false positives) and random error than\nnon-replicated protocols, without suffering from serious flaws found with\nrandom-Institutes protocols. It is suggested that a triple-result\n(organised-reproduction) protocol, with Institute consortia, is likely to solve\nmost problems connected with the replicability crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 14:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Whereas various network variants with overall\npromising results in the field of medical image segmentation have been\nsuccessfully developed over the last years, almost all of them struggle with\nthe challenge of accurately segmenting hepatic lesions in magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI). This led to the idea of combining elements of convolutional and\ntransformer-based architectures to overcome the existing limitations. This work\npresents a hybrid network called SWTR-Unet, consisting of a pretrained ResNet,\ntransformer blocks as well as a common Unet-style decoder path. This network\nwas primarily applied to single-modality non-contrast-enhanced liver MRI and\nadditionally to the publicly available computed tomography (CT) data of the\nliver tumor segmentation (LiTS) challenge to verify the applicability on other\nmodalities. For a broader evaluation, multiple state-of-the-art networks were\nimplemented and applied, ensuring a direct comparability. Furthermore,\ncorrelation analysis and an ablation study were carried out, to investigate\nvarious influencing factors on the segmentation accuracy of the presented\nmethod. With Dice scores of averaged 98+-2% for liver and 81+-28% lesion\nsegmentation on the MRI dataset and 97+-2% and 79+-25%, respectively on the CT\ndataset, the proposed SWTR-Unet proved to be a precise approach for liver and\nhepatic lesion segmentation with state-of-the-art results for MRI and competing\naccuracy in CT imaging. The achieved segmentation accuracy was found to be on\npar with manually performed expert segmentations as indicated by inter-observer\nvariabilities for liver lesion segmentation.

This problem is dramatically\ndifferent from traditional action classification, where models are typically\noptimized on videos that span only a few seconds and that are manually trimmed\nto contain simple atomic actions. While step annotations could enable the\ntraining of models to recognize the individual steps of procedural activities,\nexisting large-scale datasets in this area do not include such segment labels\ndue to the prohibitive cost of manually annotating temporal boundaries in long\nvideos. To address this issue, we propose to automatically identify steps in\ninstructional videos by leveraging the distant supervision of a textual\nknowledge base (wikiHow) that includes detailed descriptions of the steps\nneeded for the execution of a wide variety of complex activities.

The demand for those products increases exponentially as the number of\ninfected grows, outpacing any growth that local production facilities can\nachieve (Ranney et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020). Disruptions in the global\nsupply chain by closing factories or scaled-down transport routes can further\nincrease resource scarcity (McMahon et al., 2020). During the first phase of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a reflex of `our people first' in many\nregions, countries, and continents (Baldwin and Evenett, 2020). In this paper,\nhowever, we show that a cooperative sharing mechanism can substantially improve\nthe ability to face epidemics. We present a stylized model in which communities\nshare their resources such that each can receive resources whenever a local\nepidemic flares up. This can potentially prevent local resource exhaustion and\nreduce the total number of infected cases. We also show that the success of\nsharing resources heavily depends on having a sufficiently long delay between\nthe onset of epidemics in different communities. This means that a global\nsharing mechanism should be paired with measures to slow down the spread of\ninfections from one community to the other. Our work is a first step towards\ndesigning a resilient global supply chain mechanism that can deal with future\npandemics by design, rather than being subjected to the coincidental and\nunequal distribution of opportunities per community at present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 15:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 17:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

An extensive experimental\ndataset has been collected from more than 80 MAM articles containing MAM\nprocessing conditions, materials, meltpool dimensions, meltpool modes and flaw\ntypes. We introduced physics-aware MAM featurization, versatile ML models, and\nevaluation metrics to create a comprehensive learning framework for meltpool\ndefect and geometry prediction. This benchmark can serve as a basis for melt\npool control and process optimization. In addition, data-driven explicit models\nhave been identified to estimate meltpool geometry from process parameters and\nmaterial properties which outperform Rosenthal estimation for meltpool geometry\nwhile maintaining interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 04:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

The core of cross-modal retrieval is how to measure the\nsimilarity between different types of data. Many approaches have been developed\nto solve the problem. As one of the mainstream, approaches based on subspace\nlearning pay attention to learning a common subspace where the similarity among\nmulti-modal data can be measured directly. However, many of the existing\napproaches only focus on learning a latent subspace. They ignore the full use\nof discriminative information so that the semantically structural information\nis not well preserved. Therefore satisfactory results can not be achieved as\nexpected. We in this paper propose a discriminative supervised subspace\nlearning for cross-modal retrieval(DS2L), to make full use of discriminative\ninformation and better preserve the semantically structural information.\nSpecifically, we first construct a shared semantic graph to preserve the\nsemantic structure within each modality. Subsequently, the Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criterion(HSIC) is introduced to preserve the consistence between\nfeature-similarity and semantic-similarity of samples. Thirdly, we introduce a\nsimilarity preservation term, thus our model can compensate for the\nshortcomings of insufficient use of discriminative data and better preserve the\nsemantically structural information within each modality. The experimental\nresults obtained on three well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method against the compared\nclassic subspace learning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 14:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

Here, we\npresent a method to suppress the angular drift and pointing noise only with the\nthermal management of the AOM crystal. We analyze the dependence of the angular\ndrift on the refractive index variation, and find that the angular drift is\nvery sensitivity to the temperature gradient which could induce the refractive\nindex gradient inside the AOM crystal. It reminds us such angular drift could\nbe significantly suppressed by carefully overlapping the zero temperature\ngradient area with the position of the acousto-optic interaction zone.

In the paper, the\noctonions are capable of surveying the electromagnetic and gravitational fields\nwithin material media, including the octonion field strength, field source,\nangular momentum, torque, and force. Further, the octonion field strength and\nangular momentum can be combined together to become the octonion composite\nfield strength, deducing the octonion composite torque and force and others.\nWhen the octonion composite force is equal to zero under certain circumstances,\nit is able to achieve eight equations independent of each other, including the\nforce equilibrium equation, fluid continuity equation, and current continuity\nequation and so on. The above reveals that the material media and octonion\nfield strength can make a contribution to the eight equilibrium and continuity\nequations. And it is beneficial to deepen the understanding of equilibrium and\ncontinuity equations within material media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

In conventional video coding solutions, the motion compensation of\nblocks from already decoded reference pictures stands out as the principal tool\nused to predict the current frame. Especially, the bi-prediction, in which a\nblock is obtained by averaging two different motion-compensated prediction\nblocks, significantly improves the final temporal prediction accuracy. In this\ncontext, we introduce a simple neural network that further improves the\nblending operation. A complexity balance, both in terms of network size and\nencoder mode selection, is carried out. Extensive tests on top of the recently\nstandardized VVC codec are performed and show a BD-rate improvement of -1.4% in\nrandom access configuration for a network size of fewer than 10k parameters. We\nalso propose a simple CPU-based implementation and direct network quantization\nto assess the complexity/gains tradeoff in a conventional codec framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

As the world strives to get an effective medication to control the\ndisease, appropriate intervention measures, for now, remains one of the\neffective methods to reduce the spread of the disease. Optimal control\nstrategies have proven to be an effective method in curtailing the spread of\ninfectious diseases. In this paper, a model has been formulated to study\ntransmission dynamics of the disease. Basic properties of the model such as the\nbasic reproduction number, equilibrium points and stability of the equilibrium\npoints have been determined. Sensitivity analysis was carried on to determine\nthe impact of the model parameters on the basic reproduction number. We also\nintroduced a compartment for the deceased and examined the behaviour of\nCOVID-19 related deaths. The numerical simulation prediction is consistent with\nreal data from Ghana for the period March 2020 to March 2021. The simulation\nrevealed the disease had less impact on the population during the first seven\nmonths of the outbreak. To help contain the spread of the disease, time\ndependent optimal controls were incorporated into the model and Pontryagin\nmaximum principle was used to characterize vital conditions of the optimal\ncontrol model. Numerical simulations of the optimal control model showed that,\ncombination of optimal preventive strategies such as nose mask and vaccination\nare effective to significantly decrease the number of COVID-19 cases in\ndifferent compartments of the model. Vaccination decreases the susceptibility\nto the disease whereas mask usage preserved the susceptible population from\nextinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 18:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}
