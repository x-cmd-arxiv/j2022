Transformer shows great potential to model the\ncorrelation of important joints.

Focus on\nthis problem, A novel spatio-temporal tuples Transformer (STTFormer) method is\nproposed. The skeleton sequence is divided into several parts, and several\nconsecutive frames contained in each part are encoded. And then a\nspatio-temporal tuples self-attention module is proposed to capture the\nrelationship of different joints in consecutive frames. In addition, a feature\naggregation module is introduced between non-adjacent frames to enhance the\nability to distinguish similar actions.

Despite its\nhigh-density, non-volatility, near-zero leakage power, and immunity to\nradiation as the major advantages, STT-MRAM-based cache suffers from high error\nrates mainly due to retention failure, read disturbance, and write failure.\nExisting studies are limited to estimating the rate of only one or two of these\nerror types for STT-MRAM cache.

In this paper, we\npropose a system-level framework for reliability exploration and\ncharacterization of errors behavior in STT-MRAM caches. To this end, we\nformulate the cache vulnerability considering the inter-correlation of the\nerror types including all three errors as well as the dependency of error rates\nto workloads behavior and Process Variations (PVs). Our analysis reveals that\nSTT-MRAM cache vulnerability is highly workload-dependent and varies by orders\nof magnitude in different cache access patterns. Our analytical study also\nshows that this vulnerability divergence significantly increases by process\nvariations in STT-MRAM cells. To evaluate the framework, we implement the error\ntypes in the gem5 full-system simulator, and the experimental results show that\nthe total error rate in a shared LLC varies by 32.0x for different workloads. A\nfurther 6.5x vulnerability variation is observed when considering PVs in the\nSTT-MRAM cells.

This paper considers the implementation of a CG\non embedded processors that have limited computing resources and must execute\nmultiple control and diagnostics functions; consequently, the time available\nfor CG computations is limited and may vary over time. To address this issue, a\nrobust to early termination command governor is developed which embeds the\nsolution of a CG problem into the internal states of a virtual continuous-time\ndynamical system which runs in parallel to the process. This virtual system is\nbuilt so that its trajectory converges to the optimal solution (with a tunable\nconvergence rate), and provides a sub-optimal but feasible solution whenever\nits evolution is terminated. This allows the designer to implement a CG\nstrategy with a small sampling period (and consequently with a minimum\ndegradation in its performance), while maintaining its constraint-handling\ncapabilities.

This presents an obstacle for implementing them on low-end devices\nwhich may not have dedicated floating-point units (FPUs). As a result,\nresearchers in tinyML have considered machine learning algorithms that can\ntrain and run a deep neural network (DNN) on a low-end device using integer\noperations only. In this paper we propose PocketNN, a light and self-contained\nproof-of-concept framework in pure C++ for the training and inference of DNNs\nusing only integers. Unlike other approaches, PocketNN directly operates on\nintegers without requiring any explicit quantization algorithms or customized\nfixed-point formats. This was made possible by pocket activations, which are a\nfamily of activation functions devised for integer-only DNNs, and an emerging\nDNN training algorithm called direct feedback alignment (DFA). Unlike the\nstandard backpropagation (BP), DFA trains each layer independently, thus\navoiding integer overflow which is a key problem when using BP with\ninteger-only operations.

Common countermeasures to contain the epidemic spread include\nintroducing restrictions on human interactions or their mobility in general\nwhich are often associated with an economic and social cost. In this paper, we\npresent a targeted model of optimal social distancing on metapopulation\nnetworks, named ESIR model, which can effectively reduce the disease spreading\nand at the same time minimize the impact on human mobility and related costs.\nThe proposed model is grounded in a nonlinear random walk process that\nconsiders the finite carrying capacity of the network's metanodes, the physical\npatches where individuals interact within mobility networks.

We here present a general purpose code,\nnamed nProFit, that allows fitting of the surface brightness profiles of\nextragalactic star clusters to theoretical star clusters, defined by dynamical\nmodels of King (1966) and Wilson (1975). In addition, we also incorporated\ntheoretical models that result in power-law surface brightness profiles\nrepresented by Elson et al. 1987. The code returns the basic size parameters\nsuch as core radius, half-light radius and tidal radius, as well as dynamically\nrelevant parameters, such as the volume and surface density profiles, velocity\ndispersion profile, total mass and the binding energy for a user-fixed\nmass-to-light ratio. The usefulness of the code in the dynamical study of\nextragalactic clusters has been already illustrated in Cuevas-Otahola et al.\n2020. The code, which is python-based at the user end, but makes calls to\nadvanced routines in Pyraf and Fortran, is now available for public use. We\nprovide example scripts and mock clusters in the installation package as guide\nto users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 19:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

Here, we study effects caused by such a coupling between a thin layer\nof an $s$-wave superconductor and a TI nanowire. We show that there is a\ndistinct phenomenology arising from the metallization of states in the TI\nnanowire by the superconductor. In the strong coupling limit, required to\ninduce a large superconducting pairing potential, we find that metallization\nresults in a shift of the TI nanowire subbands ($\\sim 20$ meV) as well as it\nleads to a small reduction in the size of the subband gap opened by a magnetic\nfield applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Surprisingly, we find that\nmetallization effects in TI nanowires can also be beneficial. Most notably,\ncoupling to the superconductor induces a potential in the portion of the TI\nnanowire close to the interface with the superconductor, this breaks inversion\nsymmetry and at finite momentum lifts the spin degeneracy of states within a\nsubband. As such coupling to a superconductor can create or enhance the subband\nsplitting that is key to achieving topological superconductivity. This is in\nstark contrast to semiconductors, where it has been shown that metallization\neffects always reduce the equivalent subband-splitting caused by spin-orbit\ncoupling. We also find that in certain geometries metallization effects can\nreduce the critical magnetic required to enter the topological phase. We\nconclude that, unlike in semiconductors, the metallization effects that occur\nin TI nanowires can be relatively easily mitigated, for instance by modifying\nthe geometry of the attached superconductor or by compensation of the TI\nmaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 03:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In recent years, machine learning has been successful in\nextracting complex patterns from high-resolution spatio-temporal data, leading\nto improved parameterization models, and ultimately better coarse grid\nprediction.

The success of the inversion relies heavily on having prior\nknowledge of the salt, and using advanced acquisition technology with long\noffsets and low frequencies. Salt bodies are often constructed by recursively\npicking the top and bottom of the salt from seismic images corresponding to\ntomography models, combined with flooding techniques. The process is\ntime-consuming and highly prone to error, especially in picking the bottom of\nthe salt (BoS). Many studies suggest performing FWI with long offsets and low\nfrequencies after constructing the salt bodies to correct the miss-interpreted\nboundaries. Here, we focus on detecting the BoS automatically by utilizing deep\nlearning tools. We specifically generate many random 1D models, containing or\nfree of salt bodies, and calculate the corresponding shot gathers. We then\napply FWI starting with salt flooded versions of those models, and the results\nof the FWI become inputs to the neural network, whereas the corresponding true\n1D models are the output.

In particular, these results hold for complete Riemannian manifolds\nwith nonnegative Ricci curvature. Moreover, by assuming that the measure is\ndoubling, we extend the result on the existence of the entropy dimension to\nself-conformal measures on complete Riemannian manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 07:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

As a first step toward a solution, a time-dependent model is\nconsidered using a superposition of Gaussian wave packets, to describe the\nrelative motion between two colliding nuclei, which may be simplified to a\nproblem for one particle in one dimension. In this article, how the model\ndescribes the potential-barrier transmission is investigated by paying\nattention to the time evolution of the phase space distribution, which in\nparticular reveals that the behavior of the free propagation of the incoming\nstate is not trivial, depending on the number of superposed wave packets.\nPassage over the barrier can occur due to the high-momentum components in the\nincoming state corresponding to energies above the barrier height, which is,\nhowever, of classical nature and needs to be distinguished from the true\nquantum tunneling. Although a transmitted wave packet in some case may end up\nwith an energy lower than the barrier, a difficulty is noticed in guaranteeing\nthe energy conservation when the energies of different exit channels, e.g. of\ntransmission and reflection, are individually measured.

The\ninflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local\nattention are perhaps the main bottlenecks. In this work, we present a\nmulti-axis MLP based architecture called MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient\nand flexible general-purpose vision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM\nuses a UNet-shaped hierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions\nenabled by spatially-gated MLPs.

The activator-inhibitor (AI) mechanism, derived from\nreaction-diffusion (RD) models, has been widely believed to be the elementary\nmechanism for biological pattern formation. This mechanism generally requires\nactivators to be self-enhanced and diffuse more slowly than inhibitors. Here,\nwe identify the instability sources of biological systems and derive the\nself-organization conditions through solving eigenvalues (dispersion relation)\nof the generalized RD model for two chemicals. We show that both the single AI\nmechanisms with long-range inhibition and activation are enough to\nself-organize into fully-expressed domains without the involvement of the\ninhibitor-inhibitor (II) mechanism, through singly enhancing the difference in\nself-proliferation rates of activators and inhibitors or weakening the coupling\ndegree between them. When cross diffusion involves, both the self-enhancement\nand the difference in diffusion coefficients of chemicals are no longer\nnecessary for self-organization, and the patterning mechanism can be extended\nto semi-inhibitor and II mechanisms. However, we show that the single\nactivator-activator (AA) mechanism is generally unable to self-organize, even\nif biological domain growth is additionally involved. Moreover, adding an II\nsystem after an AI one can produce discrete and bi-stable patterns. We also\nobserve that a higher dimensional space can solely alter the patterning\nprinciples derived from a lower dimensional space, which may be due to the\ninstability driven by the higher degree of spatial freedom. Such results\nprovide new insights into biological pattern formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 12:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2022 02:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

Dealing with emotional variations\nis very difficult because emotions alter the voice characteristics of a person;\nthus, the acoustic features differ from those used to train models in a neutral\nenvironment. Therefore, speaker recognition models trained on neutral speech\nfail to correctly identify speakers under emotional stress. Although\nconsiderable advancements in speaker identification have been made using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), CNNs cannot exploit the spatial\nassociation between low-level features. Inspired by the recent introduction of\ncapsule networks (CapsNets), which are based on deep learning to overcome the\ninadequacy of CNNs in preserving the pose relationship between low-level\nfeatures with their pooling technique, this study investigates the performance\nof using CapsNets in identifying speakers from emotional speech recordings.

More precisely, it is first shown that a deception attack in the\ncase of combinational state-based event-triggered mechanism can result in a\nnon-triggering misbehavior, in the sense that the compromised agent does not\ntrigger any event and consequently results in partial feedback disconnectivity\nby preventing information from reaching the local neighbors of the compromised\nagent.

By employing It\\^o\ncalculus it is shown that if mutation rates in asexually reproducing organisms\nare subject to random perturbations that can vary over time several\nimplications follow. For instance, an extra Brownian motion term appears\ninfluencing nucleotide variability; the greater the variability of the random\nperturbations on the mutation rates the stronger the impact of the Brownian\nmotion term. Reducing the influence of the random perturbations, to limit\nfitness decreasing and deleterious mutations, will likely imply divesting\nresources to genomic repair systems. The stable mutation rates seen in many\norganisms could thus be an evolved strategy to reduce the influence of the\nBrownian motion term. Furthermore, if change to genomic GC content, i.e. the GC\ncontent of variable sites or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is just as\nlikely to increase as to decrease, something that resembles knockout of repair\nenzymes and removal of selective pressures seen in evolutionary laboratory\nexperiments, the species genome will likely decay unless infinite resources are\navailable.

In this paper, we formulate the image recognition problem as\na sequential coarse-to-fine feature learning process, mimicking the human\nvisual system. Specifically, the proposed Glance and Focus Network (GFNet)\nfirst extracts a quick global representation of the input image at a low\nresolution scale, and then strategically attends to a series of salient (small)\nregions to learn finer features.

We show that the\noblateness of ellipses and the magnitude of contact rotation significantly\naffect the shape of created vascular patterns and elongation of branches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 14:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In this regard, initially, a side-lit shoebox\nmodel with variable parameters was modeled parametrically, and five common\nsolar shading models with their variables were applied to the space. For each\nsolar shadings and the state without shading, metrics related to daylight and\nglare, view, and initial costs were simulated. The database generated in this\nresearch includes 87912 alternatives and six calculated metrics introduced to\noptimized machine learning models, including neural network, random Forrest,\nsupport vector regression, and k nearest neighbor.

The mouse\nis a widely used model for a number of diseases, induced by genetic\nmodification or surgical intervention. When performing experiments in mice, in\nvivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate heart anatomy and\nfunction at multiple levels. Volumetric measurements of ventricle size at each\nphase of the heart cycle (obtained with cine MRI) can be used as a sensitive\nmeasure for heart failure. Cine MRI is applied here to genetic models of heart\ndisease, including stress tests with pharmacological manipulation. As the long\nduration of the acquisition for functional assessment is a critical limitation,\na new method to make cine MRI twelve times faster is presented and validated,\nmaintaining standard accuracy. The method utilises a combination of compressed\nsensing and parallel imaging with a radial acquisition of k-space. Eddy-current\ninduced artifacts, present when acquiring radially, are corrected\nretrospectively with a novel scheme. Tissue viability can be measured with late\ngadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, where a contrast agent is utilised. After\ninjection, the agent rapidly washes out of healthy tissue, though has a slower\nkinetic in infarcted regions. A novel method to perform LGE efficiently is\npresented and validated against histology. This method is applied to the\nevaluation of a new treatment for infarction. Finally, a novel method to\nperform a multi-modal assessment of the mouse heart within a single exam is\npresented.

It is revealed that\ndifferent from the far-field channel spatial correlation which only depends on\nthe power angular spectrum (PAS), the near-field spatial correlation depends on\nthe scattered power distribution not just characterized by their arriving\nangles, but also by the scatterers' distances, which is termed as power\nlocation spectrum (PLS).

Using such an algorithm of Dinur et al.\n(Crypto 2018), we get LPHS with near-optimal error of $\\delta=\\tilde O(1/d^2)$.\nThis gives an unusual example for the usefulness of group-based cryptography in\na post-quantum world. We extend the positive result to non-cyclic and\nworst-case variants of LPHS.\n  * Multidimensional LPHS: We obtain positive and negative results for a\nmultidimensional extension of LPHS, making progress towards an optimal\n2-dimensional LPHS.\n  * Applications: We demonstrate the usefulness of LPHS by presenting\ncryptographic and algorithmic applications. In particular, we apply\nmultidimensional LPHS to obtain an efficient \"packed\" implementation of\nhomomorphic secret sharing and a sublinear-time implementation of\nlocation-sensitive encryption whose decryption requires a significantly\noverlapping view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2022 15:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

The current work aims\nto understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN)\nmethod: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling\nand preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN\nprediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation\n(BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares\ndifferent sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte\nCarlo method, manifold sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN),\nand newly-proposed multi-scale sampling. Our results reveal that the DNN\ntrained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited\nconfigurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is\ninevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and\ncycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture\nsmall-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A\nthree-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame\nsimulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and\nbeing stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily\nimplemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors,\nincluding (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely\npropagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure,\nand (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames. The results demonstrate the\nsatisfying accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained DNN.

The main advantage of\nactive learning is its potential to reduce the amount of labeled data needed to\nlearn high-performing models. A vital aspect of an effective active learning\nalgorithm is the determination of when to stop obtaining additional labeled\ndata. Several leading state-of-the-art stopping methods use a stop set to help\nmake this decision. However, there has been relatively less attention given to\nthe choice of stop set than to the stopping algorithms that are applied on the\nstop set. Different choices of stop sets can lead to significant differences in\nstopping method performance. We investigate the impact of different stop set\nchoices on different stopping methods. This paper shows the choice of the stop\nset can have a significant impact on the performance of stopping methods and\nthe impact is different for stability-based methods from that on\nconfidence-based methods. Furthermore, the unbiased representative stop sets\nsuggested by original authors of methods work better than the systematically\nbiased stop sets used in recently published work, and stopping methods based on\nstabilizing predictions have stronger performance than confidence-based\nstopping methods when unbiased representative stop sets are used. We provide\nthe largest quantity of experimental results on the impact of stop sets to\ndate. The findings are important for helping to illuminate the impact of this\nimportant aspect of stopping methods that has been under-considered in recently\npublished work and that can have a large practical impact on the performance of\nstopping methods for important semantic computing applications such as\ntechnology assisted review and text classification more broadly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 18:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 05:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

First, the initial graph is constructed from\nhistorical prescription data.

To discover patterns,\nexisting methods often convert time series data into another form, such as\nnominal/symbolic format, to reduce dimensionality, which inevitably deviates\nthe data values. Moreover, existing methods mainly neglect the order\nrelationships between time series values. To tackle these issues, inspired by\norder-preserving matching, this paper proposes an Order-Preserving sequential\nPattern (OPP) mining method, which represents patterns based on the order\nrelationships of the time series data. An inherent advantage of such\nrepresentation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by the\nrelative order of the values underneath the time series data. To obtain\nfrequent trends in time series, we propose the OPP-Miner algorithm to mine\npatterns with the same trend (sub-sequences with the same relative order).\nOPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate the\nsupport and uses pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. To\ncompress the result set, we also study finding the maximal OPPs.
