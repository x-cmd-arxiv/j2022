The distances of the individual clusters and their physical\nconnection were poorly known up to now, with strongly discrepant results\nreported in the literature. Aims: We want to determine reliable distances of\nthe young stellar clusters in the central Carina Nebula region (in particular,\nTr 14, 15, and 16) and the prominent clusters NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 in the\nnorthwestern periphery of the CNC. Methods: We analyzed the parallaxes in Gaia\nEDR3 for a comprehensive sample of 237 spectroscopically identified OB stars,\nas well as for 9562 X-ray-selected young stars throughout the complex. We also\nperformed an astrometric analysis to identify members of the young cluster vdBH\n99, which is located in the foreground of the northwestern part of the Carina\nNebula. Results: We find that the distances of the investigated clusters in the\nCNC are equal within <= 2%, and yield very consistent most likely mean distance\nvalues of 2.36(+0.05 -0.05) kpc for the OB star sample and 2.34(+0.05 -0.06)\nkpc for the sample of X-ray-selected young stars. Conclusions: Our results show\nthat the clusters in the CNC constitute a coherent star-forming region, in\nparticular with regard to NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 at the northwestern periphery,\nwhich are (within <= 2%) at the same distance as the central Carina Nebula.

However, not everything that we gaze upon, is\nsomething we want to interact with; this is known as the Midas Touch problem\nfor gaze interfaces. To overcome the Midas Touch problem, present interfaces\ntend not to rely on natural gaze cues, but rather use dwell time or gaze\ngestures. Here we present an entirely data-driven approach to decode human\nintention for object manipulation tasks based solely on natural gaze cues. We\nrun data collection experiments where 16 participants are given manipulation\nand inspection tasks to be performed on various objects on a table in front of\nthem. The subjects' eye movements are recorded using wearable eye-trackers\nallowing the participants to freely move their head and gaze upon the scene.

We model the task as a time series classification problem and\ndesign a bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network architecture to\ndecode intentions. Our results show that we can decode human intention of\nmotion purely from natural gaze cues and object relative position, with\n$91.9\\%$ accuracy.

When in binaries,\nthese stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave events. Knowledge\nof stellar masses is a prerequisite to understanding evolution and feedback of\nlow-metallicity massive stars. Using abundant spectroscopic and photometric\nmeasurements of an outstandingly bright eclipsing binary, we compare its\ndynamic, spectroscopic, and evolutionary mass estimates and develop a binary\nevolution scenario. We comprehensively studied the eclipsing binary system, AzV\n476, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The light curve and radial velocities were\nanalyzed to obtain the orbital parameters. The photometric and spectroscopic\ndata in the UV and optical were analyzed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model\natmospheres. The obtained results are interpreted using binary-evolution\ntracks. AzV 476 consists of an O4IV-III((f))p primary and an O9.5:Vn secondary.\nBoth components have similar current masses (~20 M$_{\\odot}$) obtained from\nboth the orbital and spectroscopic analysis. The wind mass-loss rate of\nlog($\\dot{M}$/(M$_{\\odot}$/yr))=-6.2 of the primary is a factor of ten higher\nthan a recent empirical prescription for single O stars in the SMC. Only\nclose-binary evolution with mass transfer can reproduce the current stellar and\norbital parameters. The binary evolutionary model reveals that the primary has\nlost about half of its initial mass and is already core helium burning. Our\ncomprehensive analysis of AzV 476 yields a consistent set of parameters and\nsuggests previous case B mass transfer. The derived stellar masses agree within\ntheir uncertainties. The moderate masses of AzV 476 underline the scarcity of\nbright massive stars in the SMC.

Compared\nwith the first-place model on the CCD dataset, the parameters and the\ncomputation amount of LSNet is greatly reduced by 90.35\\% and 91.34\\%\nrespectively, with only a 1.5\\% drops in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The\nmain interest is, whether or not the strengths of the bottomonium-nuclear\nmatter and charmonium-nuclear matter interactions are similar or very\ndifferent, in the range of a few tens of MeV at the nuclear matter saturation\ndensity. This is because, each ($\\Upsilon,J/\\Psi$) and ($\\eta_c,\\eta_b$) meson\ngroup is usually assumed to have very similar properties based on the heavy\ncharm and bottom quark masses. The estimate for the $\\Upsilon$ is made using an\nSU(5) effective Lagrangian density, by studying the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$\nmeson loop contributions for the self-energy in free space and in nuclear\nmedium. As a result, only the $BB$ meson loop contribution is included as our\nminimal prediction. As for the $\\eta_b$, is included only the $BB^*$ meson loop\ncontribution in the self-energy, to be consistent with the minimal prediction\nfor the $\\Upsilon$. The in-medium masses of the $B$ and $B^{*}$ mesons\nappearing in the self-energy loops are calculated by the quark-meson coupling\nmodel. Form factors are used to regularize the loop integrals with a wide range\nof the cutoff mass values. The results suggest that both $\\Upsilon$ and\n$\\eta_b$ should form bound states with a variety of nuclei considered in this\nstudy, for which the $\\Upsilon$-nucleus and $\\eta_b$-nucleus bound state\nenergies are calculated.

Here, we adopt an ODoS filter by merging the orientation\ninformation and magnitude information to highlight structure features for\nfissure enhancement, which can effectively distinguish between pulmonary\nfissures and clutters. Motivated by the fact that pulmonary fissures appear as\nlinear structures in 2D space and planar structures in 3D space in orientation\nfield, an orientation curvature criterion and an orientation partition scheme\nare fused to separate fissure patches and other structures in different\norientation partition, which can suppress parts of clutters.

For interacting electrons, given that the internal part of the\nHamiltonian ($\\hat H_{int}$), containing the kinetic energy and Couloumb\ninteraction of electrons, has a fixed form, the theorem states that when the\nelectrons are subject to an external electrostatic field, the ground-state\ndensity can inversely determine the field, and thus the full Hamiltonian\ncompletely. For a general quantum system, a HK-type Hamiltonian in the form of\n$\\hat H_{hk}\\{g_i\\}=\\hat H_{int}+\\sum_i g_i \\hat O_i$ can always be defined, by\ngrouping those terms with fixed or preknown coefficients into $\\hat H_{int}$,\nand factorizing the remaining as superposition of a set of Hermitian operators\n$\\{\\hat O_i\\}$.

However, in\nreal life situations neither of them is a good fit for the fair distribution of\nresources as the society is neither devoid of solidarity nor it can be\nindifferent to rewarding the relatively more productive players.

To balance the security and\nefficiency issues, three new efforts are done by appropriately integrating\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive\nargument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) primitives with the CNN testing. First, a CNN\nmodel to be tested is strategically partitioned into a private part kept\nlocally by the model developer, and a public part outsourced to an outside\nserver. Then, the private part runs over HE-protected test data sent by a\ntester and transmits its outputs to the public part for accomplishing\nsubsequent computations of the CNN testing.

Although recent studies have established a powerful framework to search\nfor and classify topological phases based on symmetry indicators, there exists\na large class of fragile topology beyond the description. The Euler class\ncharacterizing the topology of two-dimensional real wave functions is an\narchetypal fragile topology underlying some important properties, such as\nnon-Abelian braiding of crossing nodes and higher-order topology. However, as a\nminimum model of fragile topology, the two-dimensional topological Euler\ninsulator consisting of three bands remains a significant challenge to be\nimplemented in experiments.

To prevent model stealing, existing\ndefenses focus on detecting malicious queries, truncating, or distorting\noutputs, thus necessarily introducing a tradeoff between robustness and model\nutility for legitimate users. Instead, we propose to impede model extraction by\nrequiring users to complete a proof-of-work before they can read the model's\npredictions.

However, inner products exhibit many good properties\ncompared with metric functions, such as avoiding vanishing and exploding\ngradients. As a result, inner product is widely used in many recommendation\nsystems, which makes efficient Maximum Inner Product Search a key for speeding\nup many recommendation systems.\n  Graph based methods for NNS problem show the superiorities compared with\nother class methods.

Infinite-duration games are usually studied over edge-colored\ngraphs, with winning conditions that are defined in terms of sequences of\ncolors. In this paper, we investigate a restricted class of finite-memory\nstrategies called chromatic finite-memory strategies. While general\nfinite-memory strategies operate with sequences of edges of a game graph,\nchromatic finite-memory strategies observe only colors of these edges.\n  Recent results in this area show that studying finite-memory determinacy is\nmore tractable when we restrict ourselves to chromatic strategies. On the other\nhand, as was shown by Le Roux (CiE 2020), determinacy in general finite-memory\nstrategies implies determinacy in chromatic finite-memory strategies.\nUnfortunately, this result is quite inefficient in terms of the state\ncomplexity: to replace a winning strategy with few states of general memory, we\nmight need much more states of chromatic memory. The goal of the present paper\nis to find out the exact state complexity of this transformation.\n  For every winning condition and for every game graph with $n$ nodes we show\nthe following: if this game graph has a winning strategy with $q$ states of\ngeneral memory, then it also has a winning strategy with $(q + 1)^n$ states of\nchromatic memory. We also show that this bound is almost tight.

Wireless energy transfer,\ni.e., the transmission of electromagnetic energy without physical connectors,\ndemands reliable and stable solutions for charging high-power systems like\nelectric vehicles with no effect on people, animals, plants, etc. Here we\ntackle this challenging problem and suggest a novel approach of using\nmetamaterials with extreme parameters to enable targeted and protected wireless\nenergy transfer. We design and experimentally implement epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)\nand epsilon-and-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) metamaterials that provide an energy\ntransmission if and only if both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped\nwith these metamaterials. The fact of absence of materials with such extreme\nparameters protects the system against surrounding objects, which cause neither\nnoticeable change in the system operation nor experience any detrimental\neffect. The system behind the proposed approach can be realised in virtually\nany frequency band by appropriate scaling and suitable choice of material.

Since there is a natural scarcity of parallel datasets,\nrecent works mainly focus on solving the problem in an unsupervised manner.\nHowever, previous gradient-based works generally suffer from the deficiencies\nas follows, namely: (1) Content migration. Previous approaches lack explicit\nmodeling of content invariance and are thus susceptible to content shift\nbetween the original sentence and the transferred one. (2) Style\nmisclassification. A natural drawback of the gradient-guided approaches is that\nthe inference process is homogeneous with a line of adversarial attack, making\nlatent optimization easily becomes an attack to the classifier due to\nmisclassification. This leads to difficulties in achieving high transfer\naccuracy. To address the problems, we propose a novel gradient-guided model\nthrough a contrastive paradigm for text style transfer, to explicitly gather\nsimilar semantic sentences, and to design a siamese-structure based style\nclassifier for alleviating such two issues, respectively.
