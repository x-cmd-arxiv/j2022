This work\ncontributes to research efforts to detect and understand hateful content on the\nWeb by undertaking a multimodal analysis of Antisemitism and Islamophobia on\n4chan's /pol/ using OpenAI's CLIP. This large pre-trained model uses the\nContrastive Learning paradigm. We devise a methodology to identify a set of\nAntisemitic and Islamophobic hateful textual phrases using Google's Perspective\nAPI and manual annotations. Then, we use OpenAI's CLIP to identify images that\nare highly similar to our Antisemitic/Islamophobic textual phrases. By running\nour methodology on a dataset that includes 66M posts and 5.8M images shared on\n4chan's /pol/ for 18 months, we detect 173K posts containing 21K\nAntisemitic/Islamophobic images and 246K posts that include 420 hateful\nphrases. Among other things, we find that we can use OpenAI's CLIP model to\ndetect hateful content with an accuracy score of 0.81 (F1 score = 0.54). By\ncomparing CLIP with two baselines proposed by the literature, we find that CLIP\noutperforms them, in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score, in detecting\nAntisemitic/Islamophobic images. Also, we find that Antisemitic/Islamophobic\nimagery is shared in a similar number of posts on 4chan's /pol/ compared to\nAntisemitic/Islamophobic textual phrases, highlighting the need to design more\ntools for detecting hateful imagery. Finally, we make available (upon request)\na dataset of 246K posts containing 420 Antisemitic/Islamophobic phrases and 21K\nlikely Antisemitic/Islamophobic images (automatically detected by CLIP) that\ncan assist researchers in further understanding Antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 18:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 01:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Information of the stellar feedback inheres\nin the emission we observe, however inferring the physical properties from\nphotometric and spectroscopic measurements is difficult, because stellar\nfeedback is a highly complex and non-linear process, so that the observational\ndata are highly degenerate. On this account, we introduce a novel method that\ncouples a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) with the\nWARPFIELD-emission predictor (WARPFIELD-EMP) to estimate the physical\nproperties of star-forming regions from spectral observations. We present a\ncINN that predicts the posterior distribution of seven physical parameters\n(cloud mass, star formation efficiency, cloud density, cloud age which means\nage of the first generation stars, age of the youngest cluster, the number of\nclusters, and the evolutionary phase of the cloud) from the luminosity of 12\noptical emission lines, and test our network with synthetic models that are not\nused during training. Our network is a powerful and time-efficient tool that\ncan accurately predict each parameter, although degeneracy sometimes remains in\nthe posterior estimates of the number of clusters.

It is shown\nthat super-Eddington feedback efficiently prevents BH growth within a few Myr.\nThe super-Eddington accretion events remain relatively mild with typical rates\nof about 2-3 times the Eddington limit, because of the efficient regulation by\njets in that regime.

Generative modeling, for example, is a\nwidely accepted natural use case for quantum computers, and yet has lacked a\nconcrete approach for quantifying success of quantum models over classical\nones. In this work, we construct a simple and unambiguous approach to probe\npractical quantum advantage for generative modeling by measuring the\nalgorithm's generalization performance.

Additionally, our metrics can diagnose\ntrainability issues such as mode collapse and overfitting, as we illustrate\nwhen comparing GANs to quantum-inspired models built out of tensor networks.\nOur simulation results show that our quantum-inspired models have up to a $68\n\\times$ enhancement in generating unseen unique and valid samples compared to\nGANs, and a ratio of 61:2 for generating samples with better quality than those\nobserved in the training set.

We tackle this -- generally undecidable -- problem by computing\nunder-approximations on these total expected rewards. This is done by\nabstracting finite unfoldings of the infinite belief MDP of the POMDP. The key\nissue is to find a suitable under-approximation of the value function. We\nprovide two techniques: a simple (cut-off) technique that uses a good policy on\nthe POMDP, and a more advanced technique (belief clipping) that uses minimal\nshifts of probabilities between beliefs. We use mixed-integer linear\nprogramming (MILP) to find such minimal probability shifts and experimentally\nshow that our techniques scale quite well while providing tight lower bounds on\nthe expected total reward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 16:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

Our work investigates \"two-sided\" manipulation\nof the deferred acceptance algorithm where the misreporting agent and the\nmanipulator (or beneficiary) are on different sides. Specifically, we\ngeneralize the recently proposed accomplice manipulation model (where a man\nmisreports on behalf of a woman) along two complementary dimensions: (a) the\ntwo for one model, with a pair of misreporting agents (man and woman) and a\nsingle beneficiary (the misreporting woman), and (b) the one for all model,\nwith one misreporting agent (man) and a coalition of beneficiaries (all women).\n  Our main contribution is to develop polynomial-time algorithms for finding an\noptimal manipulation in both settings. We obtain these results despite the fact\nthat an optimal one for all strategy fails to be inconspicuous, while it is\nunclear whether an optimal two for one strategy satisfies the inconspicuousness\nproperty. We also study the conditions under which stability of the resulting\nmatching is preserved. Experimentally, we show that two-sided manipulations are\nmore frequently available and offer better quality matches than their one-sided\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 16:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate how contrastive learning benefits the general\nsupervised medical segmentation tasks. To this end, patch-dragsaw contrastive\nregularization (PDCR) is proposed to perform patch-level tugging and repulsing\nwith the extent controlled by a continuous affinity score. And a new structure\ndubbed uncertainty-aware feature selection block (UAFS) is designed to perform\nthe feature selection process, which can handle the learning target shift\ncaused by minority features with high uncertainty.

The primaries of these binaries and the secondary of KIC 8097825 have\nspots. Adding spotted DEBs of literature, we compare the starspots on binaries\nwith those on the single stars. The spot sizes of starspots on 65% binaries are\nsmaller than the median of those on single stars. The lifetimes of starspots on\nbinaries are consistent with those on single stars when the rotation periods\nare larger than 3 days. SDRs for half of the binaries are consistent with those\nof single star systems, while another half are smaller. The relative lifetime\npositively correlates with the RMS and SDR but negatively correlates with the\nrotation period. These relations are similar to those of spots on the single\nstar systems. Binaries with luminosity ratios close to the unit tend to have\nmore double dips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 17:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

CBXFEL optical cavities\ncomprise Bragg-reflecting flat crystal mirrors, which ensure x-rays circulation\non a closed orbit, and x-ray refractive lenses, which stabilize the orbit and\nrefocus the x-rays back on the electrons in the undulator. Depending on the\ncavity design, there are tens of degrees of freedom of the optical elements,\nwhich can never be perfectly aligned. Here, we study signatures of misalignment\nof the optical components and of the undulator source with the purposes of\nunderstanding the effects of misalignment on x-ray beam dynamics, understanding\nmisalignment tolerances, and developing cavity alignment procedures. Betatron\noscillations of the x-ray beam trajectory (both symmetric and asymmetric) are\none of the characteristic signatures of cavity misalignment. The oscillation\nperiod is in the general case a non-integer number of round-trip passes of\nx-rays in the cavity. This period (unlike the amplitude and offset of the\noscillations) is independent of the type of misalignment and is defined by\ncavity parameters. The studies are performed on an example of a four-crystal\nrectangular cavity using analytical and numerical wave optics as well as\nray-tracing techniques. Both confocal and generic stable cavity types are\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 18:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 17:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

As a result,\nphysicists have increasingly turned to model-independent strategies as tools in\nsearching for a wide range of possible BSM effects. In this paper, we describe\nthe Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM-EFT) and analyse it in the\ncontext of the philosophical discussions about models, theories, and\n(bottom-up) effective field theories. We find that while the SM-EFT is a\nquantum field theory, assisting experimentalists in searching for deviations\nfrom the SM, in its general form it lacks some of the characteristic features\nof models. Those features only come into play if put in by hand or prompted by\nempirical evidence for deviations. Employing different philosophical approaches\nto models, we argue that the case study suggests not to take a view on models\nthat is overly permissive because it blurs the lines between the different\nstages of the SM-EFT research strategies and glosses over particle physicists'\nmotivations for undertaking this bottom-up approach in the first place.

However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) direct links are prone to\nbe blocked by surrounding vehicles. Emerging metasurface technologies enable\nthe control of the electromagnetic wave reflection towards the desired\ndirection, enriching the channel scattering to boost communication performance.\nReconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and mostly the pre-configured\ncounterpart intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), are a promising low-cost\nrelaying system for 6G. This paper proposes using conformal metasurfaces\n(either C-RIS or C-IRS) deployed on vehicles' body to mitigate the blockage\nimpact in a highway multi-lane scenario. In particular, conformal metasurfaces\ncreate artificial reflections to mitigate blockage by compensating for the\nnon-flat shape of the vehicle's body, such as the lateral doors, with proper\nphase patterns. We analytically derive the phase pattern to apply to a\ncylindrical C-RIS/C-IRS approximating the shape of the car body, as a function\nof both incidence and reflection angles, considering cylindrical RIS/IRS as a\ngeneralization of conventional planar ones.

The planning problem has been formalized as one of\noptimal control, the objective being to minimize the total costs of abatement\nand damages over a time horizon. Studying climate policy as a control problem\npresumes that a planner knows enough to make optimization feasible, but\nphysical and economic uncertainties abound. Earlier, Manski, Sanstad, and\nDeCanio proposed and studied use of the minimax-regret (MMR) decision criterion\nto account for deep uncertainty in climate modeling.

However, for non-linear models and especially\ngeneralized linear models, the estimated coefficients cannot be interpreted as\na direct feature effect on the predicted outcome. Hence, marginal effects are\ntypically used as approximations for feature effects, either in the shape of\nderivatives of the prediction function or forward differences in prediction due\nto a change in a feature value. While marginal effects are commonly used in\nmany scientific fields, they have not yet been adopted as a model-agnostic\ninterpretation method for machine learning models. This may stem from their\ninflexibility as a univariate feature effect and their inability to deal with\nthe non-linearities found in black box models. We introduce a new class of\nmarginal effects termed forward marginal effects. We argue to abandon\nderivatives in favor of better-interpretable forward differences. Furthermore,\nwe generalize marginal effects based on forward differences to multivariate\nchanges in feature values. To account for the non-linearity of prediction\nfunctions, we introduce a non-linearity measure for marginal effects.

The mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 planets is\ncharacterized by two features: the two inner planets are large, and the masses\nof the four planets in the outer orbit increase with orbital distance. The\norigin of these features cannot be explained by previous formation models. We\ninvestigate whether the mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 system can be\nreproduced by a planet formation model using N-body simulations. We used a gas\ndisk evolution model around a low-mass star constructed by considering disk\nwinds and followed the growth and orbital migration from planetary embryos with\nthe isolation mass, which increases with orbital distance. As a result, we find\nthat from the initial phase, planets in inner orbits undergo rapid orbital\nmigration, and the coalescence growth near the inner disk edge is enhanced.\nThis allows the inner planets to grow larger. Meanwhile, compared with the\ninner planets, planets in outer orbits migrate more slowly and do not\nfrequently collide with neighboring planets. Therefore, the trend of increasing\nmass toward the outer orbit, called reversed mass ranking, is maintained. The\nfinal mass distribution approximately agrees with the two features of the mass\ndistribution in the TRAPPIST-1 system. We discover that the mass distribution\nin the TRAPPIST-1 system can be reproduced when embryos experience rapid\nmigration and become trapped near the disk inner edge, and then more massive\nembryos undergo slower migration. This migration transition can be achieved\nnaturally in a disk evolution model with disk winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 18:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Recent theoretical work by our\ngroup has used a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation to suggest that\nextremely massive (M* > 10^11.4 MSun) discs form primarily via minor mergers\nbetween spheroids and gas-rich satellites, which create new rotational stellar\ncomponents and leave discs as remnants. Here, we use UV-optical and HI data of\nmassive galaxies, from the SDSS, GALEX, DECaLS and ALFALFA surveys, to test\nthese theoretical predictions. Observed massive discs account for ~13% of\nmassive galaxies, in good agreement with theory (~11%). ~64% of the observed\nmassive discs exhibit tidal features, which are likely to indicate recent minor\nmergers, in the deep DECaLS images (compared to ~60% in their simulated\ncounterparts). The incidence of these features is at least four times higher\nthan in low-mass discs, suggesting that, as predicted, minor mergers play a\nsignificant (and outsized) role in the formation of these systems. The\nempirical star-formation rates agree well with theoretical predictions and, for\na small galaxy sample with HI detections, the HI masses and fractions are\nconsistent with the range predicted by the simulation. The good agreement\nbetween theory and observations indicates that extremely massive discs are\nindeed remnants of recent minor mergers between spheroids and gas-rich\nsatellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Given the practical importance of this question and the growing\ninterest on the VRPSD under optimal restocking, we study the VRPSD under a\nrecourse policy known as the switch policy. The switch policy is a canonical\nreoptimization policy that permits only pairs of successive customers to be\nreordered. We consider this policy jointly with optimal preventive restocking\nand introduce a branch-cut-and-price algorithm to compute optimal a priori\nrouting plans. This algorithm features pricing routines where value functions\nrepresent the expected cost-to-go along planned routes for all possible states\nand reordering decisions. To ensure pricing tractability, we adopt a strategy\nthat combines elementary pricing with completion bounds of varying complexity,\nand solve the pricing problem without relying on dominance rules. Our numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for solving\ninstances with up to 50 customers. Notably, they also give us new insights into\nthe value of reoptimization. The switch policy enables significant cost savings\nover optimal restocking when the planned routes come from an algorithm built on\na deterministic approximation of the data, an important scenario given the\ndifficulty of finding optimal VRPSD solutions.

Specifically, we propose the triplet contrast loss (TCL), a novel\nloss designed for KD. During the KD process, the TCL loss transfers the local\nstructure, exploits the higher order information, and mitigates the\nmisalignment of the heterogeneous output of teacher and student networks.\nCompared with other losses for KD, the proposed TCL loss selectively transfers\nthe local discriminative features from teacher to student, making it effective\nin the ReID. Besides the TCL loss, we adopt mutual learning to regularize both\nthe teacher and student networks training. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method on the MARS, DukeMTMC-VideoReID and VeRi-776\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 21:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The literature\nadmits that the structure of the problem somehow imposes such an approach. The\nproblem can be modeled as an integer linear lexicographic program.

As other types of fast\nsweeping schemes, fixed-point fast sweeping methods use the Gauss-Seidel\niterations and alternating sweeping strategy to cover characteristics of\nhyperbolic PDEs in a certain direction simultaneously in each sweeping order.\nThe resulting iterative schemes have fast convergence rate to steady state\nsolutions. Moreover, an advantage of fixed-point fast sweeping methods over\nother types of fast sweeping methods is that they are explicit and do not\ninvolve inverse operation of any nonlinear local system. Hence they are robust\nand flexible, and have been combined with high order accurate weighted\nessentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs in\nthe literature. For multidimensional nonlinear problems, high order fixed-point\nfast sweeping WENO methods still require quite large amount of computational\ncosts. In this technical note, we apply sparse-grid techniques, an effective\napproximation tool for multidimensional problems, to fixed-point fast sweeping\nWENO method for reducing its computational costs.

Such a phenomenon is of high interest to overcome the\nsuperparamagnetic limit of iron oxide NPs which hampers potential applications.\nIn this manuscript, we report on the design of NPs with an onion-like structure\nwhich have been scarcely reported yet.

In the uplink of multi-user orthogonal frequency division\nmultiple access (OFDMA) systems, synchronization errors such as carrier\nfrequency offsets (CFOs) can significantly degrade the channel estimation\nperformance. This becomes more critical in RIS-aided communications, as even a\nsmall channel estimation error leads to a significant performance loss.\nMotivated by this, we propose a joint CFO and channel estimation method for\nRIS-aided multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our\nproposed pilot structure allows accurate estimation of the CFOs without\nmulti-user interference (MUI), using the same pilot resources for both CFO\nestimation and channel estimation.

The nodes in the array share their\nfrequencies and phases with their neighboring nodes to align these parameters\nacross the array. Our signal model includes the frequency drifts and phase\njitters of the local oscillators as well as the frequency and phase estimation\nerrors at the nodes and models them using practical statistics. A decentralized\nfrequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm is proposed which uses an\naverage consensus method in which each node in the array iteratively updates\nits frequency and phase by computing an average of the frequencies and phases\nof their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that upon convergence the\nDFPC algorithm can align the frequencies and phases of all the nodes up to a\nresidual phase error that is governed by the oscillators and the estimation\nerrors. To reduce this residual phase error and thus improve the\nsynchronization between the nodes, a Kalman filter based decentralized\nfrequency and phase consensus (KF-DFPC) algorithm is presented. The total\nresidual phase error at the convergence of the KF-DFPC and DFPC algorithms is\nderived theoretically. The synchronization performances of these algorithms are\ncompared to each other in light of this theoretical residual phase error by\nvarying the duration of the signals, connectivity of the nodes, the number of\nnodes in the array, and signal to noise ratio of the transmitted signals.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed KF-DFPC algorithm converges in\nfewer iterations than other algorithms including DFPC.

However, several studies have pointed out that existing GAN-based HSI\nclassification methods are heavily affected by the imbalanced training data\nproblem. The discriminator in GAN always contradicts itself and tries to\nassociate fake labels to the minority-class samples, and thus impair the\nclassification performance. Another critical issue is the mode collapse in\nGAN-based methods. The generator is only capable of producing samples within a\nnarrow scope of the data space, which severely hinders the advancement of\nGAN-based HSI classification methods. In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive\nDropBlock-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN) for HSI\nclassification. First, to solve the imbalanced training data problem, we adjust\nthe discriminator to be a single classifier, and it will not contradict itself.\nSecond, an adaptive DropBlock (AdapDrop) is proposed as a regularization method\nemployed in the generator and discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse\nissue. The AdapDrop generated drop masks with adaptive shapes instead of a\nfixed size region, and it alleviates the limitations of DropBlock in dealing\nwith ground objects with various shapes. Experimental results on three HSI\ndatasets demonstrated that the proposed ADGAN achieved superior performance\nover state-of-the-art GAN-based methods.

The problem of assessing differential VE by viral genetics can be\nformulated under a competing risks model where the endpoint is virologically\nconfirmed COVID-19 and the cause-of-failure is the infecting SARS-CoV-2\ngenotype. Strain-specific VE is defined as one minus the cause-specific hazard\nratio (vaccine/placebo).

The major challenge lies in that the target\nobjects can be densely packed in the query image, making it hard to recognize\nevery single one. To tackle the obstacle, we propose a novel learning block,\nequipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature enhancement module.\nConcretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a score\nmap by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score\nmaps regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across\nboth the exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable\nsimilarity map. We then enhance the query feature with the support features by\nemploying the developed point-wise similarities as the weighting coefficients.\nSuch a design encourages the model to inspect the query image by focusing more\non the regions akin to the support images, leading to much clearer boundaries\nbetween different objects.

Recent advances illustrate that how\nto effectively model these nonlinear variational information and learn\ninvariant representations is an open challenge in the community of computer\nvision and pattern recognition To this end, we try to design a new algorithm to\nhandle this problem. Firstly, the second-order statistic, i.e., covariance\nmatrix is applied to model the original image sets. Due to the space formed by\na set of nonsingular covariance matrices is a well-known Symmetric Positive\nDefinite (SPD) manifold, generalising the Euclidean collaborative\nrepresentation to the SPD manifold is not an easy task.

Another is to embed them into a Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS) by utilizing the Riemannian kernel function.

Compared with\nblack-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in\nblack-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is\nsuccessfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near\nthe attacked bounding-box.

Although there is an unprecedented growth\nin the adoption of mHealth systems, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nconcerns about data privacy risks due to security breaches are also increasing.\nWhilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including\nsecurity, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may\nexist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be\nparticularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at\nsystematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in\nmental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google\nPlay Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis\nof the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour,\nserver-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy\nevaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy,\ndescribing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal\nimportant data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure\ncryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in\nlogs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps'\ndevelopment do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability,\ndetectability and identifiability. Data sharing among third parties and\nadvertisers in the current apps' ecosystem aggravates this situation. Based on\nthe empirical findings of this study, we provide recommendations to be\nconsidered by different stakeholders of mHealth apps in general and apps\ndevelopers in particular.

The\nbenefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better\norganised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the\nrecent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success.\nOther works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and\nredefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements.

Inspired by recent advances in\nself-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based\nKnowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we\ndesign a two-layer contrastive learning scheme based on an\n\"exercise-to-exercise\" (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level\ncontrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of\nexercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative\nrepresentations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to\nobtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we\nexplored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks\nas the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of\nexercises and concepts respectively.

The ILD collected in this\nfield are often hypothesised to be the result of latent states (e.g. behaviour,\nemotions), and the promise of ILD lies in its ability to capture the dynamics\nof these states as they unfold in time. In particular, by collecting data for\nmultiple subjects, researchers can observe how such dynamics differ between\nsubjects. The Bayesian Multilevel Hidden Markov Model (mHMM) is a relatively\nnovel model that is suited to model the ILD of this kind while taking into\naccount heterogeneity between subjects. While the mHMM has been applied in a\nvariety of settings, large-scale studies that examine the required sample size\nfor this model are lacking. In this paper, we address this research gap by\nconducting a simulation study to evaluate the effect of changing (1) the number\nof subjects, (2) the number of occasions, and (3) the between subjects\nvariability on parameter estimates obtained by the mHMM. We frame this\nsimulation study in the context of sleep research, which consists of\nmultivariate continuous data that displays considerable overlap in the state\ndependent component distributions. In addition, we generate a set of baseline\nscenarios with more general data properties. Overall, the number of subjects\nhas the largest effect on model performance.

Researchers have proposed a number\nof desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring\nminimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. We consider a further\naspect to improve the usability of CEs: robustness to adverse perturbations,\nwhich may naturally happen due to unfortunate circumstances. Since CEs\ntypically prescribe a sparse form of intervention (i.e., only a subset of the\nfeatures should be changed), we study the effect of addressing robustness\nseparately for the features that are recommended to be changed and those that\nare not. Our definitions are workable in that they can be incorporated as\npenalty terms in the loss functions that are used for discovering CEs. To\nexperiment with robustness, we create and release code where five data sets\n(commonly used in the field of fair and explainable machine learning) have been\nenriched with feature-specific annotations that can be used to sample\nmeaningful perturbations. Our experiments show that CEs are often not robust\nand, if adverse perturbations take place (even if not worst-case), the\nintervention they prescribe may require a much larger cost than anticipated, or\neven become impossible. However, accounting for robustness in the search\nprocess, which can be done rather easily, allows discovering robust CEs\nsystematically. Robust CEs make additional intervention to contrast\nperturbations much less costly than non-robust CEs.

We investigate the radio-infrared\ncontinuum of LOFAR radio-detected quasars (RDQs) and LOFAR radio-undetected\nquasars (RUQs) in the $9.3\\:\\textrm{deg}^{2}$ NDWFS-Bo\\\"otes field; RUQs are\nquasars that are individually undetected at $\\geq5\\sigma$ by LOFAR.

The radio and ir photometry allow us to derive the median\nspectral energy distributions of RDQs and RUQs in four z-bins between\n$0<z<6.15$. The ir star-formation rate (SFR) is compared with two independent\nradio-based star-formation (SF) tracers using the far-ir radio correlation\n(FIRC) of SF galaxies. We find a good agreement between our radio and ir SFR\nmeasurements and the FIRC predictions. Moreover, we use the FIRC predictions to\nestablish the contribution due to SMBH accretion to the total radio-luminosity\n(RL). We show that SMBH accretion can account for $\\sim5-41\\%$ of the total RL\nin median RUQs, while for median RDQs the contribution is $\\sim50-84\\%$. This\nimplies that vigorous SF activity is coeval with SMBH growth in our median\nstacked quasars. Furthermore, we investigated the radio-loudness parameter,\n$R$. For quasars with $R\\geq-4.5$, the RL is consistent with being dominated by\nSMBH accretion, while for low RL quasars with $R<-4.5$ the relative\ncontribution of SF to the radio fluxes increases as the SMBH component becomes\nweaker. We also find signatures of negative AGN feedback in the brightest\nmedian RDQs at 150 MHz.

Indeed, more PPPs mean more debt being accumulated for future\ngenerations leading to a fiscal deficit crisis. The paper draws on how the SDR\nlevel taken today distributes societies on the Social Welfare Function (SWF).\nThis is done by answering two sub-questions: (i) What is the risk of PPPs debts\nbeing off-balance sheet? (ii) How do public policies, based on the envisaged\nSDR, position society within different ethical perspectives? The answers are\nobtained from a discussion of the different SDRs (applied in the UK for\nexamples) according to the merits of the pertinent ethical theories, namely\nlibertarian, egalitarian, utilitarian and Rawlsian. We find that public\npolicymakers can manipulate the SDR to make PPPs looking like a better option\nthan the traditional financing form. However, this antagonises the Value for\nMoney principle. We also point out that public policy is not harmonised with\nethical theories. We find that at present (in the UK), the SDR is somewhere\nbetween weighted utilitarian and Rawlsian societies in the trade-off curve.\nAlas, our study finds no evidence that the (UK) government is using a\nsophisticated system to keep pace with the accumulated off-balance sheet debts.\nThus, the exact prediction of the final state is hardly made because of the\nuncertainty factor. We conclude that our study hopefully provides a good\nanalytical framework for policymakers in order to draw on the merits of ethical\ntheories before initiating public policies like PPPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 14:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Therefore, a simpler and more adaptive approach is introduced\nto evaluate value function with the kernel-based model. Sparse representations\nare superior at handling interference, indicating that competitive sparse\nrepresentations should be learnable, non-prior, non-truncated and explicit when\ncompared with current sparse representation methods.

Prior work has shown that DPCP can\nprovably recover the correct subspace in the presence of outliers, as long as\nthe true dimension of the subspace is known. We show that DPCP can provably\nsolve RSR problems in the {\\it unknown} subspace dimension regime, as long as\northogonality constraints -- adopted in previous DPCP formulations -- are\nrelaxed and random initialization is used instead of spectral one.

By use of individual \"quantum trajectories\", the\nmethod allows for simulation of systems inaccessible to ensemble treatments.\nThis is shown by replicating resonance fluorescence, allowing us to\nconcurrently demonstrate the method's facilitation of calculating photon\nstatistics by the creation of discrete photon streams. To analyse these, we\nsolidify the theoretical basis for, and implement, a computational method of\ncalculating second-order coherence functions. A process by which to model\ninteracting two-atom systems to allow for computation with the quantum jump\nmethod is then developed. Using this, we demonstrate cooperative effects\nleading to greatly modified emission spectra, before investigating the\ndecoupling of states from dissipative and coherent interactions.

Our main contribution is a\nredesigned hybrid solver [Larios-C\\'ardenas and Gibou, J. Comput. Phys.

In particular, our routine features\ndouble predicting to harness curvature symmetry invariance in favor of\nprecision and stability. The core of this solver is a multilayer perceptron\ntrained on circular- and sinusoidal-interface samples. Its role is to quantify\nthe error in numerical curvature approximations and emit corrected estimates\nfor select grid vertices along the free boundary. These corrections arise in\nresponse to preprocessed context level-set, curvature, and gradient data. To\npromote neural capacity, we have adopted sample negative-curvature\nnormalization, reorientation, and reflection-based augmentation. In the same\nmanner, our system incorporates dimensionality reduction, well-balancedness,\nand regularization to minimize outlying effects. Our training approach is\nlikewise scalable across mesh sizes. For this purpose, we have introduced\ndimensionless parametrization and probabilistic subsampling during data\nproduction. Together, all these elements have improved the accuracy and\nefficiency of curvature calculations around under-resolved regions. In most\nexperiments, our strategy has outperformed the numerical baseline at twice the\nnumber of redistancing steps while requiring only a fraction of the cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 05:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 08:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 04:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

The\nmotivation of the study is to investigate how AI systems imbibe bias from data\nand produce unexplainable discriminatory outcomes and influence an individual's\narticulateness of system outcome due to the presence of racial bias features in\ndatasets. The design of the experiment involves studying the counterfactual\nimpact of racial bias features present in language datasets and its associated\neffect on the model outcome.
