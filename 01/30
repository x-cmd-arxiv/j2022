Their conversion consists of two stages: Sampling,\nwhich maps a continuous-time signal into discrete-time, and quantization, i.e.,\nrepresenting the continuous-amplitude quantities using a finite number of bits.\nADCs typically implement generic uniform conversion mappings that are ignorant\nof the task for which the signal is acquired, and can be costly when operating\nin high rates and fine resolutions. In this work we design task-oriented ADCs\nwhich learn from data how to map an analog signal into a digital representation\nsuch that the system task can be efficiently carried out. We propose a model\nfor sampling and quantization that facilitates the learning of non-uniform\nmappings from data. Based on this learnable ADC mapping, we present a mechanism\nfor optimizing a hybrid acquisition system comprised of analog combining,\ntunable ADCs with fixed rates, and digital processing, by jointly learning its\ncomponents end-to-end. Then, we show how one can exploit the representation of\nhybrid acquisition systems as deep network to optimize the sampling rate and\nquantization rate given the task by utilizing Bayesian meta-learning\ntechniques. We evaluate the proposed deep task-based ADC in two case studies:\nthe first considers symbol detection in multi-antenna digital receivers, where\nmultiple analog signals are simultaneously acquired in order to recover a set\nof discrete information symbols. The second application is the beamforming of\nanalog channel data acquired in ultrasound imaging. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance which is comparable\nto operating with high sampling rates and fine resolution quantization, while\noperating with reduced overall bit rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 19:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The measurements are consistent with the predicted muon\ndensities within these baseline interaction and composition models. The\nmeasured muon densities have also been compared to simulations using the\npost-LHC models EPOS-LHC and QGSJet-II.04. The result of this comparison is\nthat the post-LHC models together with any given composition model yield higher\nmuon densities than observed. This is in contrast to the observations above 1\nEeV where all model simulations yield for any mass composition lower muon\ndensities than the measured ones.

However, multiple tensor\noperations may lead to enormous increase in the tensor ranks (curse of ranks)\nof the target data, making calculation intractable.

Our bundle contains a constant function that lower bounds the\nempirical loss. This enables us to compute an automatic adaptive learning rate,\nthereby providing an accurate solution. In addition, our bundle includes linear\napproximations computed at the current iterate and other linear estimates of\nthe DNN parameters. The use of these additional approximations makes our method\nsignificantly more robust to its hyperparameters. Based on its desirable\nempirical properties, we term our method Bundle Optimisation for Robust and\nAccurate Training (BORAT). In order to operationalise BORAT, we design a novel\nalgorithm for optimising the bundle approximation efficiently at each\niteration. We establish the theoretical convergence of BORAT in both convex and\nnon-convex settings. Using standard publicly available data sets, we provide a\nthorough comparison of BORAT to other single hyperparameter optimisation\nalgorithms. Our experiments demonstrate BORAT matches the state-of-the-art\ngeneralisation performance for these methods and is the most robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 23:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Sparse regression approaches, such as Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), fostered the development of novel\ngoverning equation identification algorithms assuming the state variables are\nknown a priori and the governing equations lend themselves to sparse, linear\nexpansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables. In the context of the\nidentification of governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems, one faces\nthe problem of identifiability of model parameters when state measurements are\ncorrupted by noise. Measurement noise affects the stability of the recovery\nprocess yielding incorrect sparsity patterns and inaccurate estimation of\ncoefficients of the governing equations. In this work, we investigate and\ncompare the performance of several local and global smoothing techniques to a\npriori denoise the state measurements and numerically estimate the state\ntime-derivatives to improve the accuracy and robustness of two sparse\nregression methods to recover governing equations: Sequentially Thresholded\nLeast Squares (STLS) and Weighted Basis Pursuit Denoising (WBPDN) algorithms.\nWe empirically show that, in general, global methods, which use the entire\nmeasurement data set, outperform local methods, which employ a neighboring data\nsubset around a local point.

However,\nthere lacks empirical evidence on what affect trip-level sharing behavior in\nride-hailing. Using a novel dataset from all ride-hailing trips in Chicago in\n2019, we show that the willingness of riders to request a shared ride has\nmonotonically decreased from 27.0% to 12.8% throughout the year, while the trip\nvolume and mileage have remained statistically unchanged. We find that the\ndecline in sharing preference is due to an increased per-mile costs of shared\ntrips and shifting shorter trips to solo. Using ensemble machine learning\nmodels, we find that the travel impedance variables (trip cost, distance, and\nduration) collectively contribute to 95% and 91% of the predictive power in\ndetermining whether a trip is requested to share and whether it is successfully\nshared, respectively. Spatial and temporal attributes, sociodemographic, built\nenvironment, and transit supply variables do not entail predictive power at the\ntrip level in presence of these travel impedance variables. This implies that\npricing signals are most effective to encourage riders to share their rides.\nOur findings shed light on sharing behavior in ride-hailing trips and can help\ndevise strategies that increase shared ride-hailing, especially as the demand\nrecovers from pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 01:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Nevertheless, it often requires\nexpensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic\nkeypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint\npredictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in\ncomplex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel,\ncategory-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric,\ncategory-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The\ncanonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used\nto parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video.\nThe demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory tailored to a novel\nobject via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation\nhorizon is decomposed into longrange, collision-free motion and last-inch\nmanipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC)\nmethod leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows\nthe target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a\ndynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is\nautomatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention\nmechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by\nsolely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual\nprogramming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of\nchallenging industrial tasks in highprecision assembly, which involve learning\ncomplex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against\nuncertainty due to dynamics as well as generalization across object instances\nand scene configurations.

The ranking has been advocated to design an\nefficient performance predictor for NAS. The previous contrastive method solves\nthe ranking problem by comparing pairs of architectures and predicting their\nrelative performance. However, it only focuses on the rankings between two\ninvolved architectures and neglects the overall quality distributions of the\nsearch space, which may suffer generalization issues. A predictor, namely\nNeural Architecture Ranker (NAR) which concentrates on the global quality tier\nof specific architecture, is proposed to tackle such problems caused by the\nlocal perspective. The NAR explores the quality tiers of the search space\nglobally and classifies each individual to the tier they belong to according to\nits global ranking. Thus, the predictor gains the knowledge of the performance\ndistributions of the search space which helps to generalize its ranking ability\nto the datasets more easily. Meanwhile, the global quality distribution\nfacilitates the search phase by directly sampling candidates according to the\nstatistics of quality tiers, which is free of training a search algorithm,\ne.g., Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), thus it\nsimplifies the NAS pipeline and saves the computational overheads.

Then we observe that the\npower of the energy extraction via the magnetic reconnection grows with the\ntidal charge.

The most popular\nidentification strategy relies on so-called sequential ignorability (SI)\nassumption which requires that there is no unobserved confounder that lies in\nthe causal paths between the treatment and the outcome. Despite its popularity,\nsuch assumption is deemed to be too strong in many settings as it excludes the\nexistence of unobserved confounders. This limitation has inspired recent\nliterature to consider an alternative identification strategy based on an\ninstrumental variable (IV). This paper discusses the identification of causal\nmediation effects in a setting with a binary treatment and a binary\ninstrumental variable that is both assumed to be random. We show that while IV\nmethods allow for the possible existence of unobserved confounders, additional\nmonotonicity assumptions are required unless the strong constant effect is\nassumed.

Tackling\nthis phenomenon, we propose a new training procedure that identifies and\nenhances weak subnets (EWS) to improve robustness. Specifically, we develop a\nsearch algorithm to find particularly weak subnets and explicitly strengthen\nthem via knowledge distillation from the full network. We show that EWS greatly\nimproves both robustness against corrupted images as well as accuracy on clean\ndata. Being complementary to popular data augmentation methods, EWS\nconsistently improves robustness when combined with these approaches. To\nhighlight the flexibility of our approach, we combine EWS also with popular\nadversarial training methods resulting in improved adversarial robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 09:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 18:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of\ncapturing local features, are difficult to model explicit long-distance\ndependencies from global feature space. However, both local and global features\nare crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image\nsegmentation. In this paper, we present the further attempt to exploit\nTransformer in 3D CNN for 3D medical image volumetric segmentation and propose\na novel network named TransBTSV2 based on the encoder-decoder structure.\nDifferent from TransBTS, the proposed TransBTSV2 is not limited to brain tumor\nsegmentation (BTS) but focuses on general medical image segmentation, providing\na stronger and more efficient 3D baseline for volumetric segmentation of\nmedical images. As a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, TransBTSV2 can\nachieve accurate segmentation of medical images without any pre-training,\npossessing the strong inductive bias as CNNs and powerful global context\nmodeling ability as Transformer. With the proposed insight to redesign the\ninternal structure of Transformer block and the introduced Deformable\nBottleneck Module to capture shape-aware local details, a highly efficient\narchitecture is achieved with superior performance. Extensive experimental\nresults on four medical image datasets (BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, LiTS 2017 and\nKiTS 2019) demonstrate that TransBTSV2 achieves comparable or better results\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumor,\nliver tumor as well as kidney tumor.

The large host star separation ($a/R_\\star {\\sim} 17$), combined\nwith the system's young age, makes it unlikely that the planet has realigned\nits host star. The stellar obliquity measurement of TOI-1268 probes the\narchitecture of a young gas giant beyond the reach of tidal realignment\n($a/R_\\star {\\gtrsim} 10$) and reveals an aligned or slightly misaligned\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 14:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The\ncells of a cc are subject to four axioms involving a rank function that assigns\na rank (or a dimension) to each cell. Our framework focuses on classes of cc\nadmitting an inclusion-reversing duality map. We introduce a combinatorial\nnotion of cobordism that allows us to single out a category whose morphisms are\ncobordisms having a causal structure. Our aim is to offer an approach to look\nfor a combinatorial notion of quantum field theory having a built-in duality\noperation acting on the underlying space and not relying on any manifold\nstructure. The introduction includes links with fields in Theoretical and\nMathematical Physics related to Quantum Gravity and motivating our framework.\nWe start by introducing cc and the duality map on a class of cc with empty\nboundary called closed cc. We then focus on the problem of reconstructing a\ncertain class of cc from their cells of rank 2 and lower. Such cc are in\nparticular duals to simplicial complexes with no boundary and their\nreconstruction is realized using a discrete notion of connection. Our next main\nresult extends the duality map we defined on closed cc to a class of cc with\nboundary. An important by-product of the study of this extended duality map is\nthe combinatorial notion of cobordism used in this work. We also introduce a\ngeneral notion of subdivision of a cc via a map called reduction, as well as\nthe dual notion of reduction called collapse. These two types of map\ncharacterize the structure of certain cc called slices, using sequences of maps\ncalled slice sequences. Slices are the basic building blocs of our definition\nof causal cobordisms and the dual of a slice sequence defines the composition\nof cobordisms, providing us with a category whose morphisms are causal\ncobordisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 15:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 12:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Many new developments are deployed centred around this\ntechnology. One such advancement is 5G Vehicle to Everything communication.\nThis technology can be used for applications such as driverless delivery of\ngoods, immediate response to emergencies and improving traffic efficiency. The\nconcept of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is built around this system\nwhich is completely autonomous. This paper studies the Distributed Denial of\nService (DDoS) attack carried out over a 5G network and analyses security\nattacks, particularly the DDoS attack. The aim is to implement a machine\nlearning model capable of classifying different types of DDoS attacks and\npredicting the quality of 5G latency. The initial steps of implementation\ninvolved the synthetic addition of 5G parameters into the dataset.\nSubsequently, the data was label encoded, and minority classes were oversampled\nto match the other classes. Finally, the data was split as training and\ntesting, and machine learning models were applied. Although the paper resulted\nin a model that predicted DDoS attacks, the dataset acquired significantly\nlacked 5G related information. Furthermore, the 5G classification model needed\nmore modification. The research was based on largely quantitative research\nmethods in a simulated environment. Hence, the biggest limitation of this\nresearch has been the lack of resources for data collection and sole reliance\non online data sets. Ideally, a Vehicle to Everything (V2X) project would\ngreatly benefit from an autonomous 5G enabled vehicle connected to a mobile\nedge cloud. However, this project was conducted solely online on a single PC\nwhich further limits the outcomes. Although the model underperformed, this\npaper can be used as a framework for future research in Intelligent Transport\nSystem development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 05:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

The nonlinear interaction\nbetween amide I excitons and phonon deformations induced in the hydrogen-bonded\nlattice of peptide groups leads to self-trapping of the amide I energy, thereby\ncreating a localized quasiparticle (soliton) that persists at zero temperature.\nThe presence of thermal noise, however, could destabilize the protein soliton\nand dissipate its energy within a finite lifetime. In this work, we have\ncomputationally solved the system of stochastic differential equations that\ngovern the quantum dynamics of protein solitons at physiological temperature,\nT=310 K, for either a single isolated $\\alpha$-helix spine of hydrogen bonded\npeptide groups or the full protein $\\alpha$-helix comprised of three parallel\n$\\alpha$-helix spines.

Thus, macromolecular protein complexes, which are built up of\nprotein $\\alpha$-helices could harness soliton-assisted energy transport at\nphysiological temperature. Because the hydrolysis of a single adenosine\ntriphosphate molecule is able to initiate three amide I exciton quanta, it is\nfeasible that multiquantal protein solitons subserve a variety of specialized\nphysiological functions in living systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 13:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Despite numerous studies that have\nattempted ECG denoising, they naturally fail to restore the actual ECG signal\ncorrupted with such artifacts due to their simple and naive noise model. In\nthis study, we propose a novel approach for blind ECG restoration using\ncycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (Cycle-GANs) where the quality\nof the signal can be improved to a clinical level ECG regardless of the type\nand severity of the artifacts corrupting the signal. To further boost the\nrestoration performance, we propose 1D operational Cycle-GANs with the\ngenerative neuron model.
