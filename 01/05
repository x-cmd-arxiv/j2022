Here, incorporating the mature gain/loss techniques into the\nexperimentally realized spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in two-dimensional\noptical lattices, we investigate the corresponding non-Hermitian tight-binding\nmodel and evaluate the gain/loss effects on various properties of the system,\nrevealing the interplay of the non-Hermiticity and the spin-orbit coupling.\nUnder periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the topological\nphase diagram, which undergoes a non-Hermitian gapless interval instead of a\npoint that the Hermitian counterpart encounters for a topological phase\ntransition. We also unveil that the band inversion is just a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for a topological phase in two-level spin-orbit coupled\nnon-Hermitian systems. Because the nodal loops of the upper or lower two\ndressed bands of the Hermitian counterpart can be split into exceptional loops\nin this non-Hermitian model, a gauge-independent Wilson-loop method is\ndeveloped for numerically calculating the Chern number of multiple degenerate\ncomplex bands. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the conventional\nbulk-boundary correspondence does not break down with only on-site gain/loss\ndue to the lack of non-Hermitian skin effect, but the dissipation of chiral\nedge states depends on the boundary selection, which may be used in the control\nof edge-state dynamics. Given the technical accessibility of state-dependent\natom loss, this model could be realized in current cold-atom experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 16:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 12:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 09:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Their innermost regions are impervious to light propagation and\ngravitational waves mostly carry global aspects of stars, meaning that only\nindirect inferences of their interiors could be obtained. Here we assume a\nhypothetical future scenario in which an equation of state softening due to a\nphase transition is identified and estimate the observational accuracy to\ndifferentiate a sharp phase transition from a smoother one (associated with a\nmixed phase/state due to the unknown value of the surface tension of dense\nmatter) in a region of a hybrid star by means of some electromagnetic and\ngravitational wave observables. We show that different transition constructions\nlead to similar sequences of stellar configurations due to their shared\nthermodynamic properties. In the most optimistic case - a strong quark-hadron\ndensity jump phase transition - radius observations require fractional\nuncertainties smaller than $1\\%-2\\%$ to differentiate mixed states from sharp\nphase transitions. For tidal deformabilities, relative uncertainties should be\nsmaller than $5\\%-10\\%$. However, for masses around the onset of stable quark\ncores, relative tidal deformability differences associated with strong sharp\nphase transitions and mixed states could be much larger (up to around\n$20\\%-30\\%$). All the above suggests that 2.5- and 3rd generation gravitational\nwave detectors and near-term electromagnetic missions may be able to start\nassessing some particular aspects of phase transitions in neutron stars. In\naddition, it points to some limitations on the equation of state recovery using\ntypical neutron star observables and the impact of systematic uncertainties on\nmodellings of the equation of state of hybrid stars.

In this regard, the Euclidean\ndistance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved\nrobustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.\nUnfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex\nnature of NNs.

Owing to its commercial availability and remarkable physical and\nconductive properties, graphene has been widely investigated for DNA sequencing\nby several theoretical and experimental groups. Despite this progress,\nsequencing using graphene remains a major challenge. This is due to the\nhydrophobic nature of graphene, which causes DNA bases to stick to its surface\nvia strong {\\pi}-{\\pi} interactions, reducing translocation speed and\nincreasing error rates. To circumvent this challenge, the scientific community\nhas turned its attention to other 2D materials beyond graphene. One such\nmaterial is phosphorene. In this article, we performed first-principle\ncomputational studies using density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate the\nability of phosphorene to distinguish individual DNA bases using two detection\nprinciples, namely, nanopore and nanoribbon modalities. We observe that binding\nenergies of DNA bases are lower in phosphorene compared to graphene. The energy\ngap modulations due to interaction with DNA bases are very significant in\nphosphorene compared to graphene.

This is due to the practical concern of delivering\nenough power to successfully site and operate these machines, as well as\nconcerns over energy usage while running large simulations. Since accurate\npower measurements can be difficult to obtain, processor thermal design power\n(TDP) is a possible surrogate due to its simplicity and availability. However,\nTDP is not indicative of typical power usage while running simulations. Using\ncommodity and advance technology systems at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory (LLNL) and Sandia National Laboratory, we performed a series of\nexperiments to measure power and energy usage in running simulation codes.\nThese experiments indicate that large scale LLNL simulation codes are\nsignificantly more efficient than a simple processor TDP model might suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 18:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Recent evidence, however, shows that in the\nUnited States, remote workers are choosing to spend approximately one third of\ntheir remote work hours outside of the home at cafes, co-working spaces or the\nhomes of friends and family. Commutes to these \"third places\" could offset much\nof the reduction in congestion and carbon emissions from commuting that could\nbe expected from greater shares of remote work. To estimate the impact of third\nplaces on congestion and carbon emission from commuting, this study uses a\nnational survey of thousands of remote workers and large-scale mobile trace\ndata to predict current and future commuting patterns for the Chicago\nmetropolitan area. The study reveals that ignoring third places leads to an\nunderestimation of carbon emissions from commute-based travel demand by 470\ngigatons per year, or 24% of the total true emissions. Moreover, if workers'\nlatent desire for greater levels of remote work are realized in the future, the\nemissions benefits will be reduced further. The spatial analyses imply that\nthere is a decrease in visits to the city center and outskirts, but an increase\nin visits to near suburban areas. Implications of these results for urban\ntransportation and land use policy are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 18:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 19:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In\ngeneral, when one considers two co-dimensional thick brane-worlds, the warp\nfactor is constructed as a string-like defect. Considering a twofold-warp\nfactor constructed from two intersecting warp factors, an alternative bulk\nconfiguration is examined. With the brane localization thus driven by two\ncrossing scalar fields, the possible solvable models obtained from such a two\nco-dimensional setup are systematically discussed. The obtained solutions are\nclassified as five different models organized into two subsets for which some\nof their physical properties are evaluated.

Eventual singularities in the curvature are\nidentified, however, without affecting the physical appeal of the solutions\ndescribed in terms of the stress energy tensor patterns, which are shown to be\nfree of singularities for model $IV$, besides admitting straightforward\nreductions to $(4+1)$-dimensions. In particular, from the framework of models\n$III$ and $IV$, one is able to achieve brane-world solutions over two different\ngeometries of $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$ which, as demonstrated, can be reduced to\ntrivial and non-trivial extensions of the well-known $(4+1)$-dimensional\nbrane-worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 18:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

One of the biggest drawbacks of the\nsuffix array is that it is very difficult to maintain under text updates: even\na single character substitution can completely change the contents of the\nsuffix array. Thus, the suffix array of a dynamic text is modelled using suffix\narray queries, which return the value $SA[i]$ given any $i\\in[1..n]$.\n  Prior to this work, the fastest dynamic suffix array implementations were by\nAmir and Boneh.

The VCNN-e respects all the\ninvariance properties desired by constitutive models, faithfully reflects the\nregion of influence in physics, and is applicable to different spatial\nresolutions. By design, the model guarantees that the predicted tensor is\ninvariant to the frame translation and ordering (permutation) of the\nneighboring points. Furthermore, it is equivariant to the frame rotation, i.e.,\nthe output tensor co-rotates with the coordinate frame. We evaluate the VCNN-e\nby using it to emulate the Reynolds stress transport model for turbulent flows,\nwhich directly computes the Reynolds stress tensor to close the\nReynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. The evaluation is performed\nin two situations: (1) emulating the Reynolds stress model through synthetic\ndata generated from the Reynolds stress transport equations with closure\nmodels, and (2) predicting the Reynolds stress by learning from data generated\nfrom direct numerical simulations.

However, a general theory for spin\nphotocurrents in real materials which is applicable to systems with spin-orbit\ncoupling or noncollinear magnetism is absent. Here, we develop such a general\ntheory of second-order spin photocurrents. We find that the secondorder spin\nphotocurrents can be classified into Drude, Berry curvature dipole, shift,\ninjection, and rectification currents, which have different physical origins\nand symmetry properties. Surprisingly, our theory predicts a direct pure spin\nrectification current in an insulator induced by photons with energies lower\nthan the material band gap. This phenomenon is absent in the case of the charge\nphotocurrent. We find that the pure spin current of BiTeI induced by subgap\nlight is large enough to be observable in experiments. Moreover, the subgap\npure spin photocurrent is highly tunable with the polarization of light and the\nflowing direction of the spin photocurrent. This study lays the groundwork for\nthe study of nonlinear spin photocurrents in real materials and provides a\nroute to engineer light-controlled spin currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

The SpecSolve package\n[SIAM Rev., 63(3) (2021), pp. 489--524] computes spectral measures of general\n(self-adjoint) differential and integral operators by combining\nstate-of-the-art adaptive spectral methods with an efficient resolvent-based\nstrategy. The algorithm achieves arbitrarily high orders of convergence in\nterms of a smoothing parameter, allowing computation of both discrete and\ncontinuous spectral components. This article extends SpecSolve to two important\nclasses of operators: singular integro-differential operators and general\noperator pencils. Essential computational steps are performed with\noff-the-shelf spectral methods, including spectral methods on the real line,\nthe ultraspherical spectral method, Chebyshev and Fourier spectral methods, and\nthe ($hp$-adaptive and sparse) ultraspherical spectral element method.

Further, by constructing an effective field\ntheory in the continuum of photon modes we show how the photon field leads to a\nmany-body renormalization of the electron mass, which modifies the fermionic\nquasiparticle excitations of the Fermi liquid. In the last part, we show that\ntranslational symmetry for periodic materials in homogeneous magnetic fields\ncan be restored by embedding the problem into QED. This leads to a\ngeneralization of Bloch's theory for electron-photon systems, that we named as\nQED-Bloch theory, which can be applied for the description of periodic\nmaterials in homogeneous magnetic fields and strongly coupled to the quantized\ncavity field. As a first application we consider Landau levels coupled to a\ncavity and we show that quasiparticle excitations between Landau levels and\nphotons appear, called Landau polaritons. Further, for periodic materials in\nsuch setups, QED-Bloch theory predicts the emergence of novel fractal\npolaritonic energy spectra, which we name as fractal polaritons. The fractal\npolaritons are a polaritonic, QED analogue of the Hofstadter butterfly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 19:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

Therefore, understanding the physics behind\nthe opening and closing cycle of the EGJ provides a mechanistic insight into\nits function and can help identify the underlying conditions that cause its\ndegradation.

For robots\nassociated with bipedal locomotion, such as humanoid robots and assistive\nrobotic devices that aid humans in walking, designing controllers which can\nprovide this stability and safety can prevent damage to robots or prevent\ninjury related medical costs.

True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) produce truly\nrandom data by sampling a physical entropy source that typically requires\ncustom hardware and suffers from long latency. To enable high-bandwidth and\nlow-latency TRNGs on commodity devices, recent works propose TRNGs that use\nDRAM as an entropy source. Although prior works demonstrate promising\nDRAM-based TRNGs, integration of such mechanisms into real systems poses\nchallenges. We identify three challenges for using DRAM-based TRNGs in current\nsystems: (1) generating random numbers can degrade system performance by\nslowing down concurrently-running applications due to the interference between\nRNG and regular memory operations in the memory controller (i.e., RNG\ninterference), (2) this RNG interference can degrade system fairness by\nunfairly prioritizing applications that intensively use random numbers (i.e.,\nRNG applications), and (3) RNG applications can experience significant\nslowdowns due to the high RNG latency. We propose DR-STRaNGe, an end-to-end\nsystem design for DRAM-based TRNGs that (1) reduces the RNG interference by\nseparating RNG requests from regular requests in the memory controller, (2)\nimproves the system fairness with an RNG-aware memory request scheduler, and\n(3) hides the large TRNG latencies using a random number buffering mechanism\nwith a new DRAM idleness predictor that accurately identifies idle DRAM\nperiods.

The\nexploration is carried out using both conventional quantum field theory methods\nbased on symmetry arguments, and recently developed on-shell recursion\nrelations. We show that, in contrary to relativistic theories, enhancement of\nthe soft limit of scattering amplitudes in nonrelativistic theories is\ngenerally not a byproduct of symmetry alone, but requires additional low-energy\ndata. Sufficient conditions for enhanced scattering amplitudes can be derived\nby combining symmetries and dispersion relations of the scattered particles.\nThis has direct consequences for the infrared dynamics that different types of\nnonrelativistic Nambu-Goldstone bosons can exhibit. We then use a bottom-up\nsoft bootstrap approach to narrow down the landscape of nonrelativistic\neffective field theories that possess a consistent low-energy $S$-matrix. We\nrecover two exceptional theories of a complex Schr\\\"odinger-type scalar, namely\nthe $\\mathbb{C} P^1$ nonlinear sigma model and the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. Moreover, we use soft recursion to\nprove a no-go theorem ruling out the existence of other exceptional\nSchr\\\"odinger-type theories. We also prove that all exceptional theories of a\nsingle real scalar with a linear dispersion relation are necessarily\nLorentz-invariant. Soft recursion allows us to obtain some further general\nbounds on the landscape of nonrelativistic effective theories with enhanced\nsoft limits. Finally, we present a novel theory of a complex scalar with a\ntechnically natural quartic dispersion relation.

Therefore, to better understand\nthe current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the\npresence of attacks and faults, we perform a large-scale empirical study to\ninvestigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of attacks, simulated\nfaults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense) methods. In\nparticular, we study FL's performance on the image classification tasks and use\nDNNs as our model type. Furthermore, we perform our study on two generic image\ndatasets and one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also\ninvestigate the effect of the proportion of affected clients and the dataset\ndistribution factors on the robustness of FL. After a large-scale analysis with\n496 configurations, we find that most mutators on each user have a negligible\neffect on the final model in the generic datasets, and only one of them is\neffective in the medical dataset. Furthermore, we show that model poisoning\nattacks are more effective than data poisoning attacks. Moreover, choosing the\nmost robust FL aggregator depends on the attacks and datasets. Finally, we\nillustrate that a simple ensemble of aggregators achieves a more robust\nsolution than any single aggregator and is the best choice in 75% of the cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 02:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 20:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Most of these\nsolutions consider that the ground controller system (GCS) determines the path\nof a UAV before starting a particular mission at hand. Furthermore, these\nsolutions expect the occurrence of collisions based only on the GPS\nlocalization of UAVs as well as via object-detecting sensors placed on board\nUAVs. The sensors' sensitivity to environmental disturbances and the UAVs'\ninfluence on their accuracy impact negatively the efficiency of these\nsolutions. In this vein, this paper proposes a new energy and delay-aware\nphysical collision avoidance solution for UAVs. The solution is dubbed EDC-UAV.\nThe primary goal of EDC-UAV is to build inflight safe UAVs trajectories while\nminimizing the energy consumption and response time. We assume that each UAV is\nequipped with a global positioning system (GPS) sensor to identify its\nposition. Moreover, we take into account the margin error of the GPS to provide\nthe position of a given UAV. The location of each UAV is gathered by a cluster\nhead, which is the UAV that has either the highest autonomy or the greatest\ncomputational capacity. The cluster head runs the EDC-UAV algorithm to control\nthe rest of the UAVs, thus guaranteeing a collision-free mission and minimizing\nthe energy consumption to achieve different purposes. The proper operation of\nour solution is validated through simulations. The obtained results demonstrate\nthe efficiency of EDC-UAV in achieving its design goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 02:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

Previous efforts on 3D pre-training have\nfrequently relied on self-supervised approaches, which use either predictive or\ncontrastive learning on unlabeled data to build invariant 3D representations.\nHowever, because of the unavailability of large-scale supervision information,\nobtaining semantically invariant and discriminative representations from these\nlearning frameworks remains problematic. In this paper, we revisit an\ninnovative yet simple fully-supervised 3D network pre-training framework to\ntake advantage of semantic supervisions from large-scale 2D natural image\ndatasets. With a redesigned 3D network architecture, reformulated natural\nimages are used to address the problem of data scarcity and develop powerful 3D\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pre-trained models can effectively accelerate\nconvergence while also improving accuracy for a variety of 3D medical imaging\ntasks such as classification, segmentation and detection. In addition, as\ncompared to training from scratch, it can save up to 60% of annotation efforts.\nOn the NIH DeepLesion dataset, it likewise achieves state-of-the-art detection\nperformance, outperforming earlier self-supervised and fully-supervised\npre-training approaches, as well as methods that do training from scratch.

Under the proposed\ndecision-making framework, in this work, a representative urban driving\nscenario, i.e. the unsignalized intersection, is investigated. Once the vehicle\nenters the focused zone, it will interact with other CAVs and make\ncollaborative decisions. To evaluate the safety risk of surrounding vehicles\nand reduce the complexity of the decision-making algorithm, the driving risk\nassessment algorithm is designed with a Gaussian potential field approach. The\ndecision-making cost function is constructed by considering the driving safety\nand passing efficiency of CAVs.

We model the path recommendation as an optimal flow problem with\nuncertain demand information. To tackle the non-analytical formulation of\ntravel times due to left behind, we propose a simulation-based first-order\napproximation to transform the original problem into linear programming.\nUncertainties in demand are modeled with robust optimization to protect the\npath recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates.

A common approach for a\nfurther improvement of the kernel method would be adding an explicit\nregularization, which however leads to a complex optimization problem. In this\npaper, we propose an implicit regularization for the kernel method by using a\ndeep coefficient prior, which represents the kernel coefficient image in the\nPET forward model using a convolutional neural-network. To solve the\nmaximum-likelihood neural network-based reconstruction problem, we apply the\nprinciple of optimization transfer to derive a neural KEM algorithm.

The automatic extraction of such knowledge will support a set of\ndownstream tasks like API searching or indexing.

There are three major challenges for the accurate APIs\nrecognition and linking mentioned APIs from unstructured natural language\ndocuments to an entry in the API repository: (1) distinguishing API mentions\nfrom common words; (2) identifying API mentions without a fully qualified name;\nand (3) disambiguating API mentions with similar method names but in a\ndifferent library. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we propose an\nARCLIN tool, which can effectively distinguish and link APIs without using\nhuman annotations.

In this work, an innovative\nidea of transforming an EEG signal into the weight vector of an unsupervised\nneural network called the autoencoder is proposed for the first time to solve\nthat problem. Separate autoencoders are trained for the individual EEG data.\nThe weight vectors are then optimized for the individual EEG signals.

The possibility of dust entrainment in these winds may explain recent\nscattered light observations and constitutes a way of dust transport towards\nouter regions of the disk. We aim to study the dust dynamics in these winds and\nexplore the differences between photoevaporation and magnetically driven disk\nwinds in this regard. We quantify maximum entrainable grain sizes, the flow\nangle, and the general detectability. We used the FARGO3D code to perform\nglobal, 2.5D axisymmetric, nonideal MHD simulations including ohmic and\nambipolar diffusion. Dust was treated as a pressureless fluid. Synthetic\nobservations were created with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. We find a\nsignificant difference in the dust entrainment efficiency of warm, ionized\nwinds such as photoevaporation and magnetic winds including X-ray and extreme\nultraviolet (XEUV) heating compared to cold magnetic winds. The maximum\nentrainable grain size varies from $3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for\nionized winds to $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for cold magnetic winds. Dust grains in\ncold magnetic winds tend to flow along a shallower angle compared to the warm\nwinds. With increasing distance to the central star, the dust entrainment\nefficiency decreases. Larger values of the turbulent viscosity increase the\nmaximum grain size radius of possible dust entrainment. Our simulations\nindicate that diminishing dust content in the outer regions of the wind can be\nmainly attributed to the dust settling in the disk. In the synthetic images,\nthe dusty wind appears as a faint, conical emission region which is brighter\nfor a cold magnetic wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 06:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

Nonetheless, they suffer from various\nnoises due to the analog nature of the crossbars. To overcome such limitations,\nmost previous works train weight parameters with noise data obtained from a\ncrossbar. These methods are, however, ineffective because it is difficult to\ncollect noise data in large-volume manufacturing environment where each\ncrossbar has a large device/circuit level variation. Moreover, we argue that\nthere is still room for improvement even though these methods somewhat improve\naccuracy. This paper explores a new perspective on mitigating crossbar noise in\na more generalized way by manipulating input binary bit encoding rather than\ntraining the weight of networks with respect to noise data. We first\nmathematically show that the noise decreases as the number of binary bit\nencoding pulses increases when representing the same amount of information. In\naddition, we propose Gradient-based Bit Encoding Optimization (GBO) which\noptimizes a different number of pulses at each layer, based on our in-depth\nanalysis that each layer has a different level of noise sensitivity. The\nproposed heterogeneous layer-wise bit encoding scheme achieves high noise\nrobustness with low computational cost. Our experimental results on public\nbenchmark datasets show that GBO improves the classification accuracy by ~5-40%\nin severe noise scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 06:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability\ndue to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this\nchallenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable\nOne-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the\nbasic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead\nof other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a\ntrained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging\nto a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning\nnew tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with\nthe old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for\nnew-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing\nthe comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss\nto ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet.

Recent advances in mobile\ndevices and cloud computing techniques have made it possible to capture,\nprocess, and share high resolution, high frame rate (HFR) videos across the\nInternet nearly instantaneously. Being able to monitor and control the quality\nof these streamed videos can enable the delivery of more enjoyable content and\nperceptually optimized rate control. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to\ndevelop VQA models that can be deployed at enormous scales. While some recent\neffects have been applied to full-reference (FR) analysis of variable frame\nrate and HFR video quality, the development of no-reference (NR) VQA algorithms\ntargeting frame rate variations has been little studied. Here, we propose a\nfirst-of-a-kind blind VQA model for evaluating HFR videos, which we dub the\nFramerate-Aware Video Evaluator w/o Reference (FAVER). FAVER uses extended\nmodels of spatial natural scene statistics that encompass space-time\nwavelet-decomposed video signals, to conduct efficient frame rate sensitive\nquality prediction. Our extensive experiments on several HFR video quality\ndatasets show that FAVER outperforms other blind VQA algorithms at a reasonable\ncomputational cost.

In the present study, the diffusion of\nNPs in an unentangled polymer network for different NP radii and network\nstiffness is numerically investigated by single particle dissipative particle\ndynamics (DPD). It is found that, the deformation due to the junction deviation\ncontributes significantly to the the potential barrier $U$ for the NP to\novercome during hopping, and it is dominated over the strain energy induced by\nloop stretching for larger NPs and lower network rigidity. Analyses based on\nthe theory of continuum mechanics reveal that the relation between this\ndeformed energy and the junction deviation can be described by a non-linear\nspring. Taking into account both effects of the loop stretching and junction\ndeviation, a double-spring model is proposed to characterize the diffusivity of\nthe NPs in the ordered network.

Compared to the\nstandard near-memory methods (which require two full memory accesses per\noperation), we show that our method can achieve a full scale two-operand\ndigital CiM using just one memory access, leading to a 23.2% - 72.6% decrease\nin energy-delay product (EDP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 09:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 00:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

In this contribution, a geometric\nperspective on the exact electronic energy landscape is introduced. On the\nexact energy landscape, ground and excited states form stationary points\nconstrained to the surface of a hypersphere and the corresponding Hessian index\nincreases at each excitation level. The connectivity between exact stationary\npoints is investigated and the square-magnitude of the exact energy gradient is\nshown to be directly proportional to the Hamiltonian variance. The minimal\nbasis Hartree-Fock and Excited-State Mean-Field representations of singlet\nH$_2$ (STO-3G) are then used to explore how the exact energy landscape controls\nthe existence and properties of state-specific approximations. In particular,\napproximate excited states correspond to constrained stationary points on the\nexact energy landscape and their Hessian index also increases for higher\nenergies.

A crucial requisite for these studies is to have accurate\nsignal models with characteristic morphologies, which have been challenging for\nmany decades, and researchers are still endeavoring to incorporate important\nphysics. Therefore, morphology-independent methods have been developed for\nidentifying a signal and its reconstruction. The reconstructed signal allows us\nto test the agreement between the observed signal and the waveform posterior\nsamples from parameter estimation. These methods model observed signals using a\nnearly orthogonal wavelet basis in the frame of continuous wavelet\ntransformation. Here, we propose log-uniform scales to construct the wavelets,\nwhich are are highly redundant (nonorthogonal) compared to the conventional\noctave scales but more efficient for reconstructing the signals at high\nfrequencies. And we introduce a semi-model-dependent reconstruction method\nusing the posterior samples of the events, where we model the signal using\nGabor-Morlet wavelets with log-uniform scales. We demonstrate the ability to\ndetect deviation using a numerical simulation of an eccentric binary black hole\nmerger, where the signal in the data does not belong to the search template\nwaveform manifold. Finally, we apply this method to each binary black hole\nmerger event in GWTC-1. We have found that the signal produced by the GW150914\nevent has 96% agreement with the waveform posterior samples.

The quantum\nannealing is performed on the commercially available D-Wave machine. The QUBO\nproblem involves a full matrix even when the underlying network is sparse.\nHence, we develop and test a sparsified version of the original QUBO which\nincreases the available problem dimension for the quantum annealer.

But there are issues surrounding their\napplication to SE tasks. First, the majority of the pre-trained models focus on\npre-training only the encoder of the Transformer. For generation tasks that are\naddressed using models with the encoder-decoder architecture, however, there is\nno reason why the decoder should be left out during pre-training. Second, many\nexisting pre-trained models, including state-of-the-art models such as\nT5-learning, simply reuse the pre-training tasks designed for natural\nlanguages. Moreover, to learn the natural language description of source code\nneeded eventually for code-related tasks such as code summarization, existing\npre-training tasks require a bilingual corpus composed of source code and the\nassociated natural language description, which severely limits the amount of\ndata for pre-training. To this end, we propose SPT-Code, a sequence-to-sequence\npre-trained model for source code. In order to pre-train SPT-Code in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner and address the aforementioned weaknesses\nassociated with existing pre-training tasks, we introduce three pre-training\ntasks that are specifically designed to enable SPT-Code to learn knowledge of\nsource code, the corresponding code structure, as well as a natural language\ndescription of the code without relying on any bilingual corpus, and eventually\nexploit these three sources of information when it is applied to downstream\ntasks.

In particular, local motion estimation is conducted in the\ninner-layer, solving the problem of scale drift and inaccurate bias estimation\nin visual odometry by fusing the velocity of GNSS, pre-integration of Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) and camera measurement in a tightly-coupled way. The\nglobal localization is achieved in the outer-layer, where the local motion is\nfurther fused with GNSS position and course in a long-term period in a\nloosely-coupled way.

Recently, it has been proposed that\neternal and transient DTC can be present with an open Floquet setup in the\nthermodynamic limit and in the deep quantum regime with few qubits,\nrespectively. In this work, we consider the effects of spin damping and spin\ndephasing on the DTC order in spin-optomechanical and open cavity systems in\nwhich the spins can be all-to-all coupled. In the thermodynamic limit, it is\nshown that the existence of dephasing can destroy the coherence of the system\nand finally lead the system to its trivial steady state. Without dephasing,\neternal DTC is displayed in the weak damping regime, which may be destroyed by\nincreasing the all-to-all spin coupling or the spin damping. By contrast, the\nall-to-all coupling is constructive to the DTC in the moderate damping regime.\nWe also focus on a model which can be experimentally realized by a suspended\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membrane with a few spin color centers under\nmicrowave drive and Floquet magnetic field.

The\ncommunity has witnessed the flourish of semantic segmentation convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) exploiting multi-scale contextual information. Motivated\nby that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some\nsemantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining\nimpressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we\nsucceed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation\nViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and\nefficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the\nlocal window to query a larger area of context window at only a little\ncomputation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query\narea, we enable the large window attention to capture the contextual\ninformation at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid\npooling is adopted to collaborate with the large window attention, which\npresents a novel decoder named large window attention spatial pyramid pooling\n(LawinASPP) for semantic segmentation ViT. Our resulting ViT, Lawin\nTransformer, is composed of an efficient hierachical vision transformer (HVT)\nas encoder and a LawinASPP as decoder. The empirical results demonstrate that\nLawin Transformer offers an improved efficiency compared to the existing\nmethod. Lawin Transformer further sets new state-of-the-art performance on\nCityscapes (84.4\\% mIoU), ADE20K (56.2\\% mIoU) and COCO-Stuff datasets.

The limiting cases when\nthe free surface intersects the bottom boundary, belonging to the so-called\n\"physical\" and \"non-physical\" vacuum classes, are examined. Solutions expressed\nby power series in the spatial variable lead to a hierarchy of ordinary\ndifferential equations for the time-dependent series coefficients, which are\nshown to reveal basic differences between the two vacuum cases: for\nnon-physical vacuums, the equations of the hierarchy are recursive and linear\npast the first two pairs, while for physical vacuums the hierarchy is\nnon-recursive, fully coupled and nonlinear.

However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine\nLearning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs\ncould cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks\nhave demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks\na significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily\non creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and\ndistribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of\nthese attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their\nexecution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time\nadversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial\nexamples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new\nproblem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to\nsupport such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves\nour understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and\nprovides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we\nfirst conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.\nUniversal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,\nand can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because\nof their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific\ninput, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation\nunder time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline\nattack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the\nonline algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks\nunder time constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 14:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

The first major\ndifficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the\nstreaming data would change as the data arrives. The second major difficulty is\ncatastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when\nlearning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the\nlatent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the\nprediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and\nattempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive\nOnline Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use\nauto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent\nfeatures of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss\nof the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the\nexistence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model\nparameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the\nactivation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the\ncommon and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model\ncould learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget\nwhat we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the\noccurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion\nfeature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the\nextracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 14:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

However, this\nprocess has proved to be error-prone due to the extensiveness of modern browser\nspecifications and the interplay between new and existing Web platform\ncomponents. To tackle this problem, we developed WebSpec, the first formal\nsecurity framework for the analysis of browser security mechanisms, which\nenables both the automatic discovery of logical flaws and the development of\nmachine-checked security proofs. WebSpec, in particular, includes a\ncomprehensive semantic model of the browser in the Coq proof assistant, a\nformalization in this model of ten Web security invariants, and a toolchain\nturning the Coq model and the Web invariants into SMT-lib formulas to enable\nmodel checking with the Z3 theorem prover. If a violation is found, the\ntoolchain automatically generates executable tests corresponding to the\ndiscovered attack trace, which is validated across major browsers. We showcase\nthe effectiveness of WebSpec by discovering two new logical flaws caused by the\ninteraction of different browser mechanisms and by identifying three previously\ndiscovered logical flaws in the current Web platform, as well as five in old\nversions.

The obtained friction exhibits\nadiabatic contributions at and below the vibrational time scales, but also much\nslower non-adiabatic contributions, reflecting homogeneous and inhomogeneous\nline broadening mechanisms, respectively. Compared to the gas phase, hydration\nsoftens both stretch and bend potentials, which by itself would lead to a\nred-shift of the corresponding vibrational bands. In contrast, non-adiabatic\nfriction contributions cause a spectral blue shift. For the stretch mode, the\npotential effect dominates and thus a significant red shift when going from gas\nto the liquid phase results. For the bend mode, potential and non-adiabatic\nfriction effects are of comparable magnitude, so that a slight blue shift\nresults, in agreement with well-known but puzzling experimental findings. The\nobserved line broadening is shown to be roughly equally caused by adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic friction contributions for both, the stretch and bend modes in\nliquid water.

Such a target could represent a single reactive molecule, an\nintracellular compartment or a whole cell. Recently, a probabilistic framework\nfor studying diffusion-mediated surface reactions has been developed that\nconsiders the joint probability density or propagator for the particle position\nand the so-called boundary local time. The latter characterizes the amount of\ntime that a Brownian particle spends in the neighborhood of a point on a\ntotally reflecting boundary. The effects of surface reactions are then\nincorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.\nIn this paper we generalize the theory of diffusion-mediated surface reactions\nto cases where the whole interior target domain $\\calU$ acts as a partial\nabsorber rather than the target boundary $\\partial \\calU$. Now the particle can\nfreely enter and exit $\\calU$, and is only able to react (be absorbed) within\n$\\calU$. The appropriate Brownian functional is then the occupation time\n(accumulated time that the particle spends within $\\calU$) rather than the\nboundary local time. We show that both cases can be considered within a unified\nframework by using a Feynman-Kac formula to derive a boundary value problem\n(BVP) for the propagator of the corresponding Brownian functional, and\nintroducing an associated stopping condition. We illustrate the theory by\ncalculating the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a spherical target $\\calU$\nlocated at the center of a spherical domain $\\Omega$. This is achieved by\nsolving the propagator BVP directly, rather than using spectral methods. We\nfind that if the first moment of the stopping time density is infinite, then\nthe MFPT is also infinite, that is, the spherical target is not sufficiently\nabsorbing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 15:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

This task makes use of Spleeter, an\naudio source separation model, to separate a song's drums from the rest of its\nsignal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension\nnegatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the\nother hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and\nrecurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some\ncases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We\nfound that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a\nbeat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples).

Several methods were suggested for this scenario based on\nobservational data, i.e.~data where the intervention was not applied randomly,\nfor both continuous and binary outcome variables.

In this paper, we propose a novel E2E Network Slicing\nOrchestration System (NSOS) and a Dynamic Auto- Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for\nit. Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture\nthat incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the\nmobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a\nscalable orchestration of federated network slices.

The proposed DASA includes both proactive and\nreactive resource provisioning techniques). The proposed resource dimensioning\nheuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which\nconsists of an open network of G/G/m queues.

Since MTC devices are mostly disconnected from Base\nStation (BS) for power saving, random access procedure is required for devices\nto transmit data. If many devices try random access simultaneously, preamble\ncollision problem occurs, thus causing latency increase. In an environment\nwhere delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant devices coexist, the contention-based\nrandom access procedure cannot satisfy latency requirements of delay-sensitive\ndevices. Therefore, we propose RAPID, a novel random access procedure, which is\ncompleted through two message exchanges for the delay-sensitive devices.

When UEs, performing RAPID and contention-based\nrandom access, coexist, it is important to determine a value which is the\nnumber of preambles for RAPID to reduce random access load.

Specifically, the ISAC system combines\ncommunication and radar operations and performs, detecting and communicating\nsimultaneously with multiple targets and users. The IRS dynamically controls\nthe amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to\nreconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate\nof the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC)\nmatrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase\nshift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the\ndesired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate\ncoupling, and thus we decompose it into two separate subproblems. First, a\nclosed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar\nwaveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the\nsubproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the\ncommunication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS\nphase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold\noptimization (MO). Also, we derive a closed-form solution for the formulated\nproblem, effectively decreasing computational complexity. Furthermore, a\ntrade-off factor is introduced to balance the performance of communication and\nsensing. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and\ndemonstrate that the IRS can improve the performance of the ISAC system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2022 06:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}
