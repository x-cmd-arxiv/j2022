The clustering\nproperty is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of\nlatent events is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event\ngenerates a set of observed data points according to another Poisson process.\nThis construction is similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the\nDirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events\n(i.e. clusters) is a random variable, but the point process formulation makes\nthe NSP especially well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data.

Previous optimisation-based motion planning approaches that use\ndistance fields have suffered from the high computational cost required to\nupdate the environment representation. We demonstrate that GPU-accelerated\npredicted composite distance fields significantly reduce the computation time\ncompared to calculating distance fields from scratch. We integrate this\ntechnique with a complete motion planning and perception framework that\naccounts for the predicted motion of humans in dynamic environments, enabling\nreactive and pre-emptive motion planning that incorporates predicted motions.\nTo achieve this, we propose and implement a novel human trajectory prediction\nmethod that combines intention recognition with trajectory optimisation-based\nmotion planning. We validate our resultant framework on a real-world Toyota\nHuman Support Robot (HSR) using live RGB-D sensor data from the onboard camera.\nIn addition to providing analysis on a publicly available dataset, we release\nthe Oxford Indoor Human Motion (Oxford-IHM) dataset and demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance in human trajectory prediction.

We\nreconcile these paradigms - fragmented across linguistics, psychology and\ncomputer science - by introducing FEature-Rich MUltiplex LEXical (FERMULEX)\nnetworks. This novel framework merges structural similarities in networks and\nvector features of words, which can be combined or explored independently.\nSimilarities model heterogenous word associations across\nsemantic/syntactic/phonological aspects of knowledge. Words are enriched with\nmulti-dimensional feature embeddings including frequency, age of acquisition,\nlength and polysemy. These aspects enable unprecedented explorations of\ncognitive knowledge. Through CHILDES data, we use FERMULEX networks to model\nnormative language acquisition by 1000 toddlers between 18 and 30 months.\nSimilarities and embeddings capture word homophily via conformity, which\nmeasures assortative mixing via distance and features. Conformity unearths a\nlanguage kernel of frequent/polysemous/short nouns and verbs key for basic\nsentence production, supporting recent evidence of children's syntactic\nconstructs emerging at 30 months. This kernel is invisible to network\ncore-detection and feature-only clustering: It emerges from the dual\nvector/network nature of words. Our quantitative analysis reveals two key\nstrategies in early word learning. Modelling word acquisition as random walks\non FERMULEX topology, we highlight non-uniform filling of communicative\ndevelopmental inventories (CDIs). Conformity-based walkers lead to accurate\n(75%), precise (55%) and partially well-recalled (34%) predictions of early\nword learning in CDIs, providing quantitative support to previous empirical\nfindings and developmental theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 16:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

For low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),\nin particular, low-ionisation nuclear emission line regions (LINERs), the rate\nof outflows and their properties are largely unknown. The main goal of this\nwork is to create the largest, up-to-date atlas of ionised gas outflow\ncandidates in a sample of 70 nearby LINERs. We use narrow-band, imaging data to\nanalyse the morphological properties of the ionised gas nuclear emission of\nthese galaxies and to identify signatures of extended emission with distinctive\noutflow-like morphologies. We obtained new imaging data from ALFOSC/NOT for 32\nLINERs. We complemented it with HST archival data for 6 objects and with\nresults from the literature for other 32 targets. We additionally obtained soft\nX-ray data from Chandra archive to compare with the ionised gas. The\ndistribution of the ionised gas in these LINER shows that $\\sim$32% have\nbubble-like emission, $\\sim$28% show a 'Core-halo', unresolved emission, and\n$\\sim$21% have a disky-like distribution.

Our results suggest that the\nincidence of outflows in LINERs may vary from 41% up to 56%, based on both the\nHalpha morphology and the kinematical information from the literature. The\nionised gas is co-spatial with the soft X-ray emission for the majority of\ncases ($\\sim$60%), so that they may have a common origin.

Koopman operator theory allows one to analyze nonlinear systems\nthrough the lens of linear systems and nonlinear control systems through the\nlens of bilinear control systems. The key idea of these methods lies in the\ntransformation of the coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman\nobservables, which are coordinates that allow the representation of the\noriginal system (control system) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear\ncontrol) system. However, for nonlinear control systems, the bilinear control\nmodel obtained by applying Koopman operator based learning methods is not\nnecessarily stabilizable. Simultaneous identification of stabilizable lifted\nbilinear control systems as well as the associated Koopman observables is still\nan open problem. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct these\nstabilizable bilinear models and identify its associated observables from data\nby simultaneously learning a bilinear Koopman embedding for the underlying\nunknown control affine nonlinear system as well as a Control Lyapunov Function\n(CLF) for the Koopman based bilinear model using a learner and falsifier. Our\nproposed approach thereby provides provable guarantees of asymptotic stability\nfor the Koopman based representation of the unknown control affine nonlinear\ncontrol system as a bilinear system.

In this problem, jobs arrive over a list and upon an arrival, the\nalgorithm needs to assign the job to a machine. The goal is to minimize the\nmakespan, that is, the maximum machine load. In this paper, we consider the\nvariant with an additional cardinality constraint: The algorithm may assign at\nmost $k$ jobs to each machine where $k$ is part of the input. While the offline\n(strongly NP-hard) variant of cardinality constrained scheduling is well\nunderstood and an EPTAS exists here, no non-trivial results are known for the\nonline variant. We fill this gap by making a comprehensive study of various\ndifferent online models. First, we show that there is a constant competitive\nalgorithm for the problem and further, present a lower bound of $2$ on the\ncompetitive ratio of any online algorithm. Motivated by the lower bound, we\nconsider a semi-online variant where upon arrival of a job of size $p$, we are\nallowed to migrate jobs of total size at most a constant times $p$. This\nconstant is called the migration factor of the algorithm. Algorithms with small\nmigration factors are a common approach to bridge the performance of online\nalgorithms and offline algorithms. One can obtain algorithms with a constant\nmigration factor by rounding the size of each incoming job and then applying an\nordinal algorithm to the resulting rounded instance. With this in mind, we also\nconsider the framework of ordinal algorithms and characterize the competitive\nratio that can be achieved using the aforementioned approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of\noverparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained\nrandom features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust\ngeneralization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 18:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

In reality,\nthe environment causes the qubit to enter into a mixed state where the original\nis no longer recoverable. A promising solution to this problem bases the\ncomputational states on the low lying energy excitations within topological\nmaterials. The existence of these states is protected by a global parameter\nwithin the Hamiltonian which prevents the computational states from coupling\nlocally and decohering. In this paper, the qubit is based on nonlocal,\ntopological Majorana fermions (MF), and the gate operations are generated by\nswapping or braiding the positions of said MF. The algorithmic calculation for\nsuch gate operations is well known, but, the opposite gates-to-braid\ncalculation is currently underdeveloped. Additionally, because one may choose\nfrom a number of different possible qubit definitions, the resultant gate\noperations from calculation to calculation appear different. Here, the\ncalculations for the two- and four-MF cases are recapitulated for the sake of\nlogical flow. This set of gates serves as the foundation for the understanding\nand construction of the six-MF cases. Using these, a full characterization of\nthe system is made by completely generalizing the list of gates and\ntransformations between possible qubit definitions. A complete description of\nthis system is desirable and will hopefully serve future iterations of\ntopological qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

The uniqueness of the first three\ncumulants then fixes their all-order evolution to be DGLAP, up to corrections\ninvolving powers of $\\Delta$, that are numerically suppressed by an effective\norder in the perturbative expansion for phenomenological track functions.\nHowever, at the fourth cumulant and beyond there is non-trivial RG mixing into\nproducts of cumulants such as $\\kappa(4)$ into $\\kappa(2)^2$. We analytically\ncompute the evolution equations up to the sixth moment at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$, and study the associated RG flows. These results\nallow for the study of up to six-point correlations in energy flow using\ntracks, paving the way for precision jet substructure at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Infalling dark matter that scatters within stars could lead to a\nrange of observational signatures, including stellar heating, black hole\nformation, and modified heat transport. To make robust predictions for such\nphenomena, it is necessary to calculate the scattering rate for dark matter\ninside the star. As we show in this paper, for small enough momentum transfers,\nthis requires taking into account collective effects within the dense stellar\nmedium. These effects have been neglected in many previous treatments; we\ndemonstrate how to incorporate them systematically, and show that they can\nparametrically enhance or suppress dark matter scattering rates depending on\nhow dark matter couples to the Standard Model. We show that, as a result,\ncollective effects can significantly modify the potential discovery or\nexclusion reach for observations of compact objects such as white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. While the effects are more pronounced for dark matter coupling\nthrough a light mediator, we show that even for dark matter coupling via a\nheavy mediator, scattering rates can differ by orders of magnitude from their\nnaive values for dark matter masses <~ 100 MeV. We also illustrate how\ncollective effects can be important for dark matter scattering in more dilute\nmedia, such as the Solar core.

One\nimportant example is a first-order phase transition in a spectator sector which\ncouples to the inflaton.

In this work, we show that this feature is generic for\na source in an era of accelerated expansion. We also demonstrate that the shape\nof the GW signal contains information about the evolution of the early universe\nfollowing the phase transition. In particular, the slope of the infrared part\nof the GW spectrum is sensitive to the evolution of the Hubble parameter when\nthe GW modes reenter the horizon after inflation. The slope of the profile of\nthe intermediate oscillatory part and the ultraviolet part of the GW spectrum\ndepend on the evolution of the Hubble parameter when the modes exit horizon\nduring the inflation and when they reenter the horizon during the reheating.\nThe ultraviolet spectrum also depends on the details of the dynamics of the\nphase transition. We consider the GW signal in several models of evolution\nduring and after inflation, and compare them with the minimal scenario of\nquasi-de Sitter inflation followed by radiation domination after a fast\nreheating, and demonstrate that the shape of the GW can be used to distinguish\nthem.

The\nmachine learning models further help make robust allocation decisions regarding\nstochastic variations and simplify robust optimization to a conventional\nconstrained optimization. When resources are insufficient to accommodate all\napplication requirements, our framework supports executing some of the\napplications with minimal degradation (graceful degradation) of E2E QoE.

It is maintained that the properties on which this approach was\noriginally built, the main one being subcompositional coherence, are not\nrequired to be satisfied exactly -- quasi-coherence is sufficient, that is near\nenough to being coherent for all practical purposes. This opens up the field to\nusing simpler data transformations, such as power transformations, that permit\nzero values in the data. The additional property of exact isometry, which was\nsubsequently introduced and not in Aitchison's original conception, imposed the\nuse of isometric logratio transformations, but these are complicated and\nproblematic to interpret, involving ratios of geometric means. If this property\nis regarded as important in certain analytical contexts, for example\nunsupervised learning, it can be relaxed by showing that regular pairwise\nlogratios, as well as the alternative quasi-coherent transformations, can also\nbe quasi-isometric, meaning they are close enough to exact isometry for all\npractical purposes. It is concluded that the isometric and related logratio\ntransformations such as pivot logratios are not a prerequisite for good\npractice, although many authors insist on their obligatory use.

This solution is characterized by the mass\n$M$, radius $R$, and an energy density that varies quadratically with the\nradial coordinate $r$. Recently, Jiang and Yagi proposed a modification of this\nsolution, the so-called modified Tolman VII (MTVII) solution, by introducing an\nadditional quartic term to the energy density radial profile. The MTVII\nsolution is an approximate solution to Einstein's equation, which includes a\nnew parameter $\\alpha$ that allows the solution to have a better agreement with\nthe energy density profiles for realistic NSs.

Mastrolilli achieved\nthis goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\\Gamma$) where $\\Gamma$ is a Boolean\nconstraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] advanced these results\nto several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs\narising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are\nsubgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of\nCSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most\nimportant types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been\nconsidered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation\nmodulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] to systems of linear equations\nover $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\\Gamma$ is an affine constraint\nlanguage then IMP($\\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input\npolynomial has bounded degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 21:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

Precoding in Massive MIMO\ntransmission requires accurate downlink channel state information (CSI). Many\nrecent works have effectively applied deep learning (DL) to jointly train\nUE-side compression networks for delay domain CSI and a BS-side decoding\nscheme. Vitally, these works assume that the full delay domain CSI is available\nat the UE, but in reality, the UE must estimate the delay domain based on a\nlimited number of frequency domain pilots. In this work, we propose a linear\npilot-to-delay (P2D) estimator that transforms sparse frequency pilots to the\ntruncated delay CSI. We show that the P2D estimator is accurate under frequency\ndownsampling, and we demonstrate that the P2D estimate can be effectively\nutilized with existing autoencoder-based CSI estimation networks.

We gathered four different testing sets to assess the accuracy,\nprecision, and limits of our model. We also trained a model using chemical\nabundances alone.

We studied several alphabets for\ncompressing texts -- letters, n-grams of letters, syllables, words, and\nphrases. If only sufficiently short texts are retained, an alphabet of letters\nor two-grams of letters is optimal. For the majority of Project Gutenberg\ntexts, the best alphabet (the one that minimizes the full code length) is given\nby syllables or words, depending on the representation of the codebook. Letter\n3 and 4-grams, having on average comparable length to syllables/words, perform\nnoticeably worse than syllables or words.

However, the neglected topological\ninformation is shown to be valuable for link prediction tasks. In this paper,\nwe propose Structure Enhanced Graph neural network (SEG) for link prediction.\nSEG introduces the path labeling method to capture surrounding topological\ninformation of target nodes and then incorporates the structure into an\nordinary GNN model. By jointly training the structure encoder and deep GNN\nmodel, SEG fuses topological structures and node features to take full\nadvantage of graph information.

To\nestimate the energy budget for heating, we perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations\nof AGN jet injections in a Perseus-like cluster and quantify the amount of\nenergy stored in the forms of weak shocks and waves. We find that, for a single\njet injection with typical parameters in cool-core clusters, $\\sim9\\%$ of the\ntotal jet energy is stored in compressional waves (including both shocks and\nwaves).

Most methods\npresented in human activity recognition are supervised, where there are labeled\ninputs to train the system. In reality, it is difficult to label activities\ndata because of its huge volume and the variety of human activities. This paper\nproposes an unsupervised framework to perform human activity discovery in 3D\nskeleton sequences. First, an approach for data pre-processing is presented. In\nthis stage, important frames are selected based on kinetic energy. Next, the\ndisplacement of joints, statistical displacements, angles, and orientation\nfeatures are extracted to represent the activities information. Since not all\nextracted features have useful information, the dimension of features is\nreduced using PCA. Most methods proposed for human activity discovery are not\nfully unsupervised. They use pre-segmented videos before categorizing\nactivities. To deal with this, we have used a sliding time window to segment\nthe time series of activities with some overlapping. Then, activities are\ndiscovered by our proposed Hybrid Particle swarm optimization (PSO) with\nGaussian Mutation and K-means (HPGMK) algorithm to provide diverse solutions.\nPSO is used due to its straightforward idea and powerful global search\ncapability which can identify the ideal solution in a few iterations. Finally,\nk-means is applied to the outcome centroids from each iteration of the PSO to\novercome the slow convergence rate of PSO. The experiment results on five\ndatasets show that the proposed framework has superior performance in\ndiscovering activities compared to the other state-of-the-art methods and has\nincreased accuracy of at least 4% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 06:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 04:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2022 02:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 09:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The\nformer maps the input vector into an infinite dimensional feature space via a\nradial basis function (RBF) kernel, ensuring absence of local minima on its\ntraining loss surface.

Compared to traditional deep neural networks, K-StoNet possesses a\ntheoretical guarantee to asymptotically converge to the global optimum and\nenables the prediction uncertainty easily assessed.

We hypothesized that PeRFs would reduce trust in\nthe robot and the robot's Likeability and Willingness to Use (LWtU) more than\nfailures that are not personal to participants. To achieve PeR in human-robot\ninteraction, we utilized three different manipulation mechanisms: A) damage to\nproperty, B) financial loss, and C) first-person versus third-person failure\nscenarios. In total, 132 participants engaged with a robot in person during a\ncollaborative task of laundry sorting.

Using a quantitative individual-based\nmethod based on the stochastic process, we identify that enhancing the inherent\nself-proliferation advantage of cooperators relative to defectors is a more\neffective channel to promote the evolution of cooperation in range expansion\nthan weakening the benefit acquisition of defectors from cooperators. With this\nself-proliferation advantage, cooperators can rapidly colonize virgin space and\nestablish spatial segregation more readily, which acts like a protective shield\nto further promote the evolution of cooperation in return. We also show that\nlower cell density and migration rate have a positive effect on the competition\nof cooperators with defectors. Biological evolution is based on competition\nbetween individuals and should therefore favor selfish behaviors.

Based on a hybrid phase-field model for mixed-mode fracture,\nseparate phase-field variables are introduced for tensile (mode I) and shear\n(mode II) fracture. The resulting three-field problem features separate length\nscale parameters for mode I and mode II cracks. In contrast to the classic\ntwo-field mixed-mode approaches it can thus account for different tensile and\nshear strength of rock. The two phase-field equations are implicitly coupled\nthrough the degradation of the material in the elastic equation, and the three\nfields are solved using a staggered iteration scheme. For its validation, the\nthree-field model is calibrated for two types of rock, Solnhofen Limestone and\nPfraundorfer Dolostone.

Many well-known bright stars have been observed by the ongoing\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space mission. For several of\nthem, these new data reveal previously unobserved variability, such as tidally\nperturbed pulsations in close binary stars. Aims. Using newly detected\ngravity-mode (g-mode) pulsations in V456 Cyg, we aim to determine the global\nstellar properties of this short-period eclipsing binary and evaluate the\ninteraction between these pulsations and the tides. Methods. We model the\nbinary orbit and determine the physical properties of the component stars using\nthe TESS photometry and published spectroscopy. We then measure the pulsation\nfrequencies from the residuals of the light curve fit using iterative\nprewhitening, and analyse them to determine the global asteroseismic stellar\nparameters. We evaluate the pulsation parameters as a function of the orbital\nphase. Results. We find that the pulsations belong to the secondary component\nof V456 Cyg and that this star likely has a uniform radial rotation profile,\nsynchronous ($\\nu_{\\rm rot} = 1.113(14) \\rm d^{-1}$) with the binary orbit\n($\\nu_{\\rm orb} = 1.122091(8) \\rm d^{-1}$).

Tumor analysis is challenging because of tumor\nmorphology like size, location, texture, and heteromorphic appearance in the\nmedical images. In this regard, a novel two-phase deep learning-based framework\nis proposed to detect and categorize brain tumors in magnetic resonance images\n(MRIs). In the first phase, a novel deep boosted features and ensemble\nclassifiers (DBF-EC) scheme is proposed to detect tumor MRI images from healthy\nindividuals effectively. The deep boosted feature space is achieved through the\ncustomized and well-performing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and\nconsequently, fed into the ensemble of machine learning (ML) classifiers.

The underlying capital market features a mean-reverting\nprocess for equity returns, and the primary question of interest is how\nmean-reversion effects the optimal strategy and the resulting portfolio value\nat the horizon. In particular, we are interested in knowing under which\nassumptions and on which horizons, the risk-reward trade-off is so favourable\nthat the value of the portfolio is effectively bounded from below on the\nhorizon. In this case, we might think of the portfolio as providing a\nstochastic excess return on top of a \"guarantee\" (the lower bound).\n  Deriving optimal strategies is a well-known discipline in mathematical\nfinance. The modern approach is to derive and solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(HJB) differential equation characterizing the strategy leading to highest\nexpected utility, for given utility function. However, for two reasons we\napproach the problem differently in this work. First, we wish to find the\noptimal strategy depending on time only, i.e., we do not allow for dependencies\non capital market state variables, nor the value of the portfolio itself. This\nconstraint characterizes the strategic allocation of long-term investors.\nSecond, to gain insights on the role of mean-reversion, we wish to identify the\nentire family of extremal strategies, not only the optimal strategies.

Proposed governing factors are\ntemperature-dependent differences in the bulk energy, biaxial strain induced\nthrough point defects, and surface properties. In this work, we investigate the\nthermodynamic stability of the 3C, 2H, 4H, and 6H polytypes with density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations. The small differences of the bulk\nenergies between the polytypes can lead to intricate changes in their energetic\nordering depending on the computational method. Therefore, we employ and\ncompare various DFT-codes: VASP, CP2K, and FHI-aims; exchange-correlation\nfunctionals: LDA, PBE, PBEsol, PW91, HSE06, SCAN, and RTPSS; and nine different\nvan der Waals (vdW) corrections. At $T=0$~K, 4H-SiC is marginally more stable\nthan 3C-SiC, and the stability further increases with temperature by including\nentropic effects from lattice vibrations. Neither the most advanced vdW\ncorrections nor strain on the lattice have a significant effect on the relative\npolytype stability. We further investigate the energies of the (0001) polytype\nsurfaces that are commonly exposed during epitaxial growth. For Si-terminated\nsurfaces, we find 3C-SiC to be significantly more stable than 4H-SiC. We\nconclude that the difference in surface energy is likely the driving force for\n3C-nucleation, whereas the difference in the bulk thermodynamic stability\nslightly favors the 4H and 6H polytypes. In order to describe the polytype\nstability during crystal growth correctly, it is thus crucial to take into\naccount both of these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 10:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 14:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

To explore their\nproperty is of interest. This paper presents detailed pressure-based finite\nvolume simulation of argon arc. In the modeling, the whole cathode region is\ncoupled to electromagnetic calculations to promise the free change of current\ndensity at cathode surface. In numerical solutions, the upwind difference\nscheme is chosen to promise the transport property of convective terms, and the\nSIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm is used\nto solve thermal pressure. By simulations of the free-burning argon arc, the\nmodel shows good agreement with experiment. We observe an interesting\nphenomenon that argon arc concentrates intensively in the high-frequency\nalternating longitudinal magnetic field. Different from existing constricting\nmechanisms, here arc achieves to be pinched through a continuous transition\nbetween shrinking and expansion. The underlying mechanism is that via\ncollaborating with arc's motion inertia, the applied high-frequency alternating\nmagnetic field is able to effectively play a \"plasma trap\" role, which leads\nthe arc plasma to be imprisoned into a narrower space. This may provide a new\napproach to constrict arc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 10:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

The recent outbreak of botnets like Dark Nexus (derived from Qbot and\nMirai), Mukashi, LeetHozer, Hoaxcalls, etc. shows the alarming rate at which\nthis threat is converging. The botnets have attributes that make them an\nexcellent platform for malicious activities in IoT devices.

In\npractice, obtaining a smaller signature size relies on the interaction of two\nmain considerations: (i) the underlying protocol and its soundness error and\n(ii) the type of optimizations which are compatible with a given protocol. Over\nthe years, different variations were proposed to improve the Stern scheme such\nas the Veron scheme (with public key a noisy codeword rather than a syndrome),\nthe AGS scheme which is a 5-pass protocol with cheating probability\nasymptotically equal to 1/2 and more recently the FJR approach which permits to\ndecrease the cheating probability to 1/N but induces a performance overhead.\nOverall the length of the signature depends on a trade-off between: the scheme\nin itself, the possible optimizations and the cost of the implementation.

In this paper we propose three new\nschemes and different trade-offs, which are all interesting in themselves,\nsince depending on potential future optimizations a scheme may eventually\nbecome more efficient than another.

A barrier to the use of FAPbI3 in commercial,\nstable devices is its unwanted black-to-yellow (non-perovskite to perovskite,\ncommonly known as delta-to-alpha) phase transition at around 300 K. The\nintrinsic mechanisms of such phase transition are far from clear, being the\ndetailed structural description for the alpha-phase still missing. By combined\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, lattice dynamics analysis and DFT\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we assign the alpha-phase to the highly dynamic\ntetragonal phase, with the high-symmetry cubic structure emerging as a\ndynamically unstable maximum in the system potential energy landscape. We\ndemonstrate computationally that the diffraction-observed cubic structure is\nthe result of the averaging of different tetragonal distortions sampled in the\nexperimental detection time scale as a result of the enhanced FA dynamics,\ninstead of a static system of cubic symmetry. Further finite-temperature Gibbs\nfree energy calculations confirm that the delta-to-alpha transition should be\nconsidered as a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition in contrast to the previous\nhexagonal-to-cubic assignment. More importantly, the simulations indicate that\nthe driving force of the process is the vibrational entropy difference rather\nthan the rotational entropy as previously proposed. These results point out the\ndynamical nature of the alpha-phase, the importance of the overlooked\ntetragonal structure, and the key role of the vibrational entropy in\nperovskite-related phase transitions, the harnessing of which is critical for\nsuccessful uptake of ABX3 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in commercial\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 12:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

Since the randomness of the PSP\nis relevant for neural computation and learning, characterizing the statistics\nof the PSP is critical. However, the statistical characterization of the\nsynaptic reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible\nbi-molecular reaction of NTs with receptors renders the system nonlinear.\nConsequently, there is currently no model available which characterizes the\nimpact of the statistics of postsynaptic receptor activation on the PSP.

To this end, we\nreview and compare a toolbox of global and local characterization methods in\norder to investigate different types of transitions between ergodic, localized\nand multifractal states. We report energy-dependent transitions from ergodic to\nmultifractal states for pairing terms with $\\alpha<1$ and energy-dependent\ntransitions from ergodic to localized states with an intermediate multifractal\nregion for $\\alpha>1$. The size of the intermediate multifractal region depends\nnot only on the value of the superconducting pairing term $\\Delta$, but also on\nthe energy band. The transitions are not described by a mobility edge, but\ninstead we report hybridization of bands with different types of localization\nproperties. This leads to coexisting multifractal regimes where fractal\ndimensions follow different distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 19:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

The standard\napproach to quantum control bases on the use of an external field to manipulate\nthe system. Some technological difficulties appear when controlling a quantum\nsystem in this way, due to the complications of manipulating a system made of\nfew particles while maintaining the quantum correlations. As a consequence the\nsystems need to be kept at very low temperatures and the interactions have to\nbe performed very fast. The Quantum Control at the Boundary approach is\nradically different to the standard one. Instead of seeking the control of the\nquantum system by directly interacting with it through an external field, the\ncontrol is achieved by manipulating the boundary conditions of the system. The\nspectrum of a quantum system, for instance an electron moving in a box, depends\non the boundary conditions imposed on it. Hence, a modification of such\nboundary conditions modifies the state of the system allowing for its\nmanipulation and, eventually, its control. This kind of interaction is weaker,\nwhich makes one to expect that it may help maintaining the quantum\ncorrelations. For showing the viability of the Quantum Control at the Boundary\nmethod, a family of boundary control systems on Quantum Circuits (a\ngeneralization of quantum grahs) is introduced. Before being able to address\nthe problem of controllability, the problem of existence of solutions for the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with time-dependent boundary conditions is addressed.\nThe approximate controllability of the systems under study is proven using a\ncontrollability result by T.

The\nalgorithm to reconstruct high-speed frames from the measurement plays a vital\nrole in SCI. In this paper, we consider the promising reconstruction algorithm\nframework, namely plug-and-play (PnP), which is flexible to the encoding\nprocess comparing with other deep learning networks. One drawback of existing\nPnP algorithms is that they use a pre-trained denoising network as a plugged\nprior while the training data of the network might be different from the task\nin real applications. Towards this end, in this work, we propose the online PnP\nalgorithm which can adaptively update the network's parameters within the PnP\niteration; this makes the denoising network more applicable to the desired data\nin the SCI reconstruction. Furthermore, for color video imaging, RGB frames\nneed to be recovered from Bayer pattern or named demosaicing in the camera\npipeline. To address this challenge, we design a two-stage reconstruction\nframework to optimize these two coupled ill-posed problems and introduce a deep\ndemosaicing prior specifically for video demosaicing which does not have much\npast works instead of using single image demosaicing networks. Extensive\nresults on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our\nadaptive deep PnP algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 06:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

Humans use\ndiscrete language to communicate and learn from each other, while machines use\ncontinuous features (like vector, matrix, or tensor in deep neural networks) to\nrepresent cognitive patterns. Discrete symbols are low-dimensional, decoupled,\nand have strong reasoning ability, while continuous features are\nhigh-dimensional, coupled, and have incredible abstracting capabilities. In\nrecent years, deep learning has developed the idea of continuous representation\nto the extreme, using millions of parameters to achieve high accuracies.\nAlthough this is reasonable from the statistical perspective, it has other\nmajor problems like lacking interpretability, poor generalization, and is easy\nto be attacked. Since both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, a better\nchoice is to seek reconciliation. In this paper, we make an initial attempt\ntowards this direction. Specifically, we propose to combine symbolism and\nconnectionism principles by using neural networks to derive a discrete\nrepresentation. This process is highly similar to human language, which is a\nnatural combination of discrete symbols and neural systems, where the brain\nprocesses continuous signals and represents intelligence via discrete language.\nTo mimic this functionality, we denote our approach as machine language. By\ndesigning an interactive environment and task, we demonstrated that machines\ncould generate a spontaneous, flexible, and semantic language through\ncooperation. Moreover, through experiments we show that discrete language\nrepresentation has several advantages compared with continuous feature\nrepresentation, from the aspects of interpretability, generalization, and\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

The structure and emission of such shocks is regulated by\ncopious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock transition\nlayer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons\ninside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma\nconstituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma\ninstabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma\nmicroinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and\nsubject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a\nsystem is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately\nbecome dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative\ndrift between the ions and the pairs.

Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced transport equation for the\nparticles via pitch angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate\nthat it can couple the different species and lead to nonadiabatic compression\nvia a Joule-like heating.

Using iterative algorithms\nto reconstruct such enormous TOF sinograms becomes increasingly challenging due\nto the memory requirements and the computation time needed to evaluate the\nforward model for every data bin. This is especially true for more advanced\noptimization algorithms such as the SPDHG algorithm which allows for the use of\nnon-smooth priors using subsets with guaranteed convergence. SPDHG requires the\nstorage of additional sinograms in memory, which severely limits its\napplication to data sets from state-of-the-art TOF PET systems.\n  Motivated by the generally sparse nature of the TOF sinograms, we propose and\nanalyze a new listmode (LM) extension of the SPDHG algorithm for reconstruction\nof sparse data following a Poisson distribution.

Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood\nsimulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of\nflooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common\nplaces where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been\nprepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not.\nTherefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify\nplaces that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not\nyet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired\ntargets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process.\nThis research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors\nfrom LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are\ntrained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large\namounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by\nleveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used\nto generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied\nwith three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only\nautomatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the\nrule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human\nsupervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing\nthe detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a\nflood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood\nrisk levels. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide\na more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and\nresidential buildings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Our\nhigh-resolution phase-resolved spectroscopic analysis reveals no significant\nevolution of temperature despite the complex initial pulse shape. Yet the\ninferred surface hot spots shrink during the peak migration and outburst decay.\nWe suggest two possible origins for this evolution. For internal heating of the\nsurface, tectonic motion of the crust may be its underlying cause. The inferred\nspeed of this crustal motion is $\\lesssim100$~m~day$^{-1}$, constraining the\ndensity of the driving region to $\\rho\\sim10^{10}$~g~cm$^{-3}$, at a depth of\n$\\sim200$~m. Alternatively, the hot spots could be heated by particle\nbombardment from a twisted magnetosphere possessing flux tubes or ropes,\nsomewhat resembling solar coronal loops, that untwist and dissipate on the\n30-40~day timescale. The peak migration may then be due to a combination of\nfield-line footpoint motion (necessarily driven by crustal motion) and evolving\nsurface radiation beaming. These novel dataset paints a vivid picture of the\ndynamics associated with magnetar outbursts, yet it also highlights the need\nfor a more generic theoretical picture where magnetosphere and crust are\nconsidered in tandem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 15:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

To explain the origin of\noctatic symmetry we postulate strong particle clustering as a crucial\ningredient. We use Scaled Particle Theory to analyze four binary mixtures of\nhard right triangles and squares, three of them being extreme models for a\none-component fluid, where right triangles can exist as monomeric entities\ntogether with triangular dimers, square dimers or square tetramers. Phase\ndiagrams exhibit a rich phenomenology, with demixing and three-phase\ncoexistences. More important, under some circumstances the orientational\ndistribution function of triangles has equally high peaks at relative particle\nangles 0, $\\pi/2,$ and $\\pi$, signalling fourfold, tetratic order, but also\nsecondary peaks located at $\\pi/4$ and $3\\pi/4$, a feature of eightfold,\noctatic order. Also, we extend the binary mixture model to a quaternary mixture\nconsisting of four types of clusters: monomers, triangular and square dimers,\nand square tetramers. This mixture is analyzed using Scaled Particle Theory\nunder the restriction of fixed cluster fractions. Apart from the obvious\ntetratic phase promoted by tetramers, we found that, for certain cluster\ncompositions, the total orientational distribution function of monomers can\nexhibit quasi-eightfold (octatic) symmetry.

In the present work we use\nConvolution Neural Networks to analyze ECG and predict Atrial Fibrillation\nstarting from realistic datasets, i.e. considering fewer ECG than other studies\nand extending the maximal distance between ECG and AF diagnosis. We achieved\n75.5% (0.75) AUC firstly increasing our dataset size by a shifting technique\nand secondarily using the dilation parameter of the convolution neural network.\nIn addition we find that, contrarily to what is commonly used by clinicians\nreporting AF at the exam, the most informative leads for the task of predicting\nAF are D1 and avR. Similarly, we find that the most important frequencies to\ncheck are in the range of 5-20 Hz. Finally, we develop a net able to manage at\nthe same time the electrocardiographic signal together with the electronic\nhealth record, showing that integration between different sources of data is a\nprofitable path. In fact, the 2.8% gain of such net brings us to a 78.6% (std\n0.77) AUC. In future works we will deepen both the integration of sources and\nthe reason why we claim avR is the most informative lead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 10:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

In some machines these are isolated within a\ndedicated partition, whilst in others they are integral to all compute nodes -\noften with multiple GPUs per node - and provide the majority of a machine's\ncompute performance. In light of this trend, it is becoming essential that\ncodes deployed on HPC are updated to execute on accelerator hardware. In this\npaper we introduce a GPU implementation of the 3D blood flow simulation code\nHemeLB that has been developed using CUDA C++. We demonstrate how taking\nadvantage of NVIDIA GPU hardware can achieve significant performance\nimprovements compared to the equivalent CPU only code on which it has been\nbuilt whilst retaining the excellent strong scaling characteristics that have\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated by the CPU version. With HPC positioned on the\nbrink of the exascale era, we use HemeLB as a motivation to provide a\ndiscussion on some of the challenges that many users will face when deploying\ntheir own applications on upcoming exascale machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 20:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}
