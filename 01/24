Existing models for HAR\ngenerally have a high computational complexity, contain very large number of\ntrainable parameters, and require extensive computational resources.

Such diversity in body morphology is hypothesized\nas adaptations to locomotion cluttered terrestrial environments, but the mode\nof propulsion -- e.g., the use of body and/or limbs to interact with the\nsubstrate -- and potential body/limb coordination remain unstudied. Here, we\nuse biological experiments, a geometric theory of locomotion, and robophysical\nexperiments to comparatively and systematically investigate such dynamics in a\ndiverse sample of lizard morphologies. Locomotor field studies in short-limb,\nelongated lizards (Brachymeles) and laboratory studies of full-limbed lizards\n(Uma scoparia and Sceloporus olivaceus) and a limbless laterally undulating\norganism (Chionactis occipitalis) reveal that the body wave dynamics can be\ndescribed by a combination of traveling and standing waves; the ratio of the\namplitudes of these components is inversely related to limb length. We use\ngeometric theory to analyze and explain the wave dynamics and body-leg\ncoordination observations; the theory predicts that leg thrust modulates the\nbody weight distribution and self-propulsion generation mechanism, which in\nturn facilitates the choice of body waves. We test our hypothesis in biological\nexperiments by inducing the use of traveling wave in stereotyped lizards by\nmodulating the ground penetration resistance, as well as in controlled\nnon-biological experiments involving an undulating limbed robophysical model.\nOur models could be valuable in understanding functional constraints on the\nevolutionary process of elongation and limb reduction in lizards, as well as\nadvancing robot designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 16:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Recently, data-driven methods\nsuch as deep learning-based reconstruction have garnered a lot of attention in\napplications because they yield better performance when enough training data is\navailable. However, even these methods have their limitations when there is a\nscarcity of available training data.

The method is compared to two traditional\nestimation techniques that use wavelet decompositions; ordinary least squares\n(OLS) and Abry-Veitch bias correcting estimator (AV). As an application, the\nsuitability of the self-similarity estimate resulting from the the robust\napproach is illustrated as a predictive feature in the classification of\ndigitized mammogram images as cancerous or non-cancerous. The diagnostic\nemployed here is based on the properties of image backgrounds, which is\ntypically an unused modality in breast cancer screening. Classification results\nshow nearly 68% accuracy, varying slightly with the choice of wavelet basis,\nand the range of multiresolution levels used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Typically, the velocity\nmodel in its discrete form is represented on a rectangular grid, and we solve\nfor the elastic properties at these grid points. FWI is mostly solved employing\na local optimization method, where one obtains a velocity update by minimizing\nthe misfit between the observed and the calculated seismograms.

In an early stage, the second\nbubble always drifts out of the wake of the leading one. Then, depending on the\nratios of the buoyancy, viscous and capillary forces which define the Galilei\n($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, five distinct regimes specific to\nsuch conditions are identified, in which the two bubbles may rise independently\nor continue to interact and possibly collide in the end. In the former case,\nthey usually perform large-amplitude planar zigzags within the same plane or\nwithin two distinct planes, depending on the oblateness of the leading bubble.\nHowever, for large enough $Ga$ and low enough $Bo$, they follow nearly vertical\npaths with small-amplitude erratic horizontal deviations. Increasing $Bo$ makes\nthe wake-induced attraction toward the leading bubble stronger, forcing the two\nbubbles to realign vertically one or more times along their ascent.

For example, in social\nnetworks, each user maintains a local view of a social graph, such as a list of\nfriends and her profile. It is typical to collect these local views of social\ngraphs and conduct graph learning tasks. However, learning over graphs can\nraise privacy concerns as these local views often contain sensitive\ninformation.\n  In this paper, we seek to ensure private graph learning on a decentralized\nnetwork graph. Towards this objective, we propose {\\em Solitude}, a new\nprivacy-preserving learning framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs),\nwith formal privacy guarantees based on edge local differential privacy. The\ncrux of {\\em Solitude} is a set of new delicate mechanisms that can calibrate\nthe introduced noise in the decentralized graph collected from the users. The\nprinciple behind the calibration is the intrinsic properties shared by many\nreal-world graphs, such as sparsity.

This leads to their high\ntransmission through surface defects or potential barriers. Quantum corrals,\npreviously elaborated on metal surfaces, can act as nanometer-sized electronic\nresonators to trap Schr\\\"odinger electrons by quantum confinement. It is thus\nintriguing, concerning their peculiar nature, to put the Dirac electrons of TSS\nto the test in similar circumstances. Here, we report the behaviors of TSS in a\ntriangular quantum corral (TQC) fabricated by epitaxially growing Bi bilayer\nnanostructures on the surfaces of Bi2Te3 films. Unlike a circular corral, the\nTQC is supposed to be totally transparent for DFs. By mapping the electronic\nstructure of TSS inside TQCs through a low-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscope in the real space, both the trapping and de-trapping behaviors of\nthe TSS electrons are observed. The selection rules are found to be governed by\nthe geometry and spin texture of the constant energy contour of TSS upon the\nstrong hexagonal warping in Bi2Te3. Careful analysis of the quantum\ninterference patterns of quasi-bound states yields the corresponding wave\nvectors of trapped TSS, through which two trapping mechanisms favoring momenta\nin different directions are uncovered. Our work indicates the extended nature\nof TSS and elucidates the selection rules of the trapping of TSS in the\npresence of a complicated surface state structure, giving insights into the\neffective engineering of DFs in TIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 03:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers\n(ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can\nefficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small\nneighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global\ndependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency\nvia self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens\nlead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified\ntransFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of\nconvolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from\nthe typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block\nare equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and\ndeep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient\nand effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer\nblocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from\nimage to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any\nextra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nclassification.

This exponential\ngrowth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service\n(QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago.\nThe primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict\nboundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection\n(OSI) protocol stack. The initial decade focused on establishing the\ntheoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the\neffectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of\nsoftware defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its\nadded flexibility. Yet, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions\ndesigned in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first\npresent an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature. Next,\nwe briefly discuss how a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), low SWaP (Size,\nWeight, and Power) embedded SDR (e-SDR) was transformed into a standalone,\nfieldable transceiver. Thereafter, we provide the software design ethos that\nfocuses on efficiency and flexibility such that the optimization objectives and\ncross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly. To demonstrate our\nclaims, we provide results from extensive outdoor over-the-air experiments in\nvarious settings with up to 10-node network topologies. The results from the\nfield trials demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic routing\ncapability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature,\na COTS e-SDR has been leveraged to successfully design a cross-layer optimized\ntransceiver that is capable of forming an ad hoc network that provides high\nthroughput and high reliability in a ruggedized, weatherized, and fieldable\nform factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 04:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

To improve the accuracy of\nnumerical integration, the range of entry trajectory is selected as the\nindependent variable rather than time or energy. A dilation factor is employed\nto normalize the entry dynamics and integration interval of the performance\nindex so that the difficult free-final-time programming problem can be\nconverted to a fixed-final-range optimization problem. The bank angle rate with\nrespect to the range is introduced as the new control input in order to\ndecouple the control from the state and facilitate convexification of\nconstraints on the bank angle and its rate. The nonlinear bank angle rate\nconstraint is further relaxed into a linear one via inequality relaxation.\nMoreover, the nonconvex minimum-time performance index is convexified by\nregarding flight time as a state variable.

With local acceleration and diminishing regularization,\nwe establish the first result among policy gradient methods on certifying and\ncharacterizing the limiting policy, by showing, with a non-asymptotic\ncharacterization, that the last-iterate policy converges to the unique optimal\npolicy with the maximal entropy. We then extend all the aforementioned results\nto HPMD instantiated with a broad class of decomposable Bregman divergences,\ndemonstrating the generality of the these computational properties.

Also, we found an interesting dipper (TIC 317873721), \"close-in binary\ndipper,\" showing the complex variability of the line profile and the large\nradial velocity variation.

One promising approach is to\nfirst construct graphs approximating the spaces, called roadmaps, and then\napply multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) algorithms to derive a set of\nconflict-free paths. While conventional studies have utilized roadmap\nconstruction methods developed for single-agent planning, it remains largely\nunexplored how we can construct roadmaps that work effectively for multiple\nagents. To this end, we propose a novel concept of roadmaps called cooperative\ntimed roadmaps (CTRMs).

To construct CTRMs, we developed a machine-learning approach\nthat learns a generative model from a collection of relevant problem instances\nand plausible solutions and then uses the learned model to sample the vertices\nof CTRMs for new, previously unseen problem instances. Our empirical evaluation\nrevealed that the use of CTRMs significantly reduced the planning effort with\nacceptable overheads while maintaining a success rate and solution quality\ncomparable to conventional roadmap construction approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 05:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

To address this issue, this paper studies the beamforming\noptimization towards seamless sensing coverage for a basic bi-static ISAC\nsystem, while ensuring that the communication requirements of multiple users\nequipment (UEs) are satisfied. Towards this end, an optimization problem is\nformulated to maximize the worst-case sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a\nprescribed coverage region, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) requirement for each UE.

Therefore, the trained network can share similar\nrepresentations across various tasks, while also enabling independent\ntask-related representations. The above allows for some crucial outcomes.

Halos exhibit orbital\nmotions around filaments, which emerge as specific trajectories in a phase\nspace composed of halos' perpendicular distance and velocity component with\nrespect to filaments.

In view that NSs can be easily tidally disrupted by BHs with high\nprojected aligned-spins, we study an evolution channel to form NSBH binaries\nwith fast-spinning BHs, the properties of BH mass and spin, and their\nassociated tidal disruption probability. We find that if the NSs are born\nfirstly, the companion helium stars would be tidally spun up efficiently, and\nwould thus finally form fast-spinning BHs. If BHs do not receive significant\nnatal kicks at birth, these NSBH binaries that can merge within the Hubble time\nwould have BHs with the projected aligned-spins $\\chi_{z}\\gtrsim0.8$ and,\nhence, can certainly allow tidal disruption to happen. Even if significant BH\nkicks are considered for a small fraction of NSBH binaries, the projected\naligned-spins of BHs are $\\chi_z\\gtrsim0.2$. These systems can still be\ndisrupted events unless the NSs are very massive. Thus, NS-first-born NSBH\nmergers would be promising multi-messenger sources. We discuss various\npotential EM counterparts associated with these systems and their detectability\nin the upcoming fourth observation run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 09:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 06:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 15:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Reaching these\npopulations would require a scaled approach that combines mobility, low cost,\nspeed, accuracy, and privacy.

The model is applied to every time frame, and the\nshort time frame signals from the selected microphones are concatenated across\nthe frames to produce an output signal. As the personal devices are usually\nheld close to their owners, the output signal is expected to have higher\nsignal-to-noise and direct-to-reverberation ratios on average than the input\nsignals. Since PickNet utilizes only limited acoustic context at each time\nframe, the system using the proposed model works in real time and is robust to\nchanges in acoustic conditions.

We use\nhydrodynamical simulations to assess the impact of mechanical feedback on the\naccretion rate when the BH moves supersonically through a uniform medium. We\ncarry out 3D hydrodynamical simulations of outflows fueled by accretion that\ninteract with a uniform medium, probing scales similar to and larger than the\naccretor gravitational sphere of influence. In the simulations the accretor is\nat rest and the medium moves at supersonic speeds. The outflow power is assumed\nto be proportional to the accretion rate. The simulations are run for different\noutflow-medium motion angles and velocity ratios. The impact of different\ndegrees of outflow collimation, accretor size, and resolution is also\ninvestigated. In general, the accretion rate is significantly affected by\nmechanical feedback. The effect is small for outflows perpendicular to the\nmedium motion, and quickly grows for smaller angles. Moreover, the smaller the\nmedium-to-outflow velocity ratio is, the more accretion decreases. On the other\nhand, the impact of outflow collimation seems moderate. The effect is enhanced\nwhen the accretor size is reduced. For a population of BH with random outflow\norientations, the average accretion rate drops by (high-low resolution)\n~0.2-0.4 and ~0.1-0.2 for medium-to-outflow velocity ratios of 1/20 and 1/100,\nrespectively, when compared to the corresponding cases without outflow. Our\nresults strongly indicate that, on the considered scales, mechanical feedback\ncan easily reduce the energy available from supersonic accretion by a factor of\nseveral. This should be taken into account when studying the mechanical,\nthermal and non-thermal output of isolated BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 11:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:04:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

We employed a convection-diffusion GCR propagation model\nbased on the Fokker-Planck equation and applied it to solar wind and\ninterplanetary magnetic field properties at 1 au. Our analysis shows that the\nonly two effects that are relevant for a plausible overall explanation of the\nobservations are the enhanced convection effect caused by the increased\nvelocity of the HSS and the reduced diffusion effect caused by the enhanced\nmagnetic field and its fluctuations within the CIR and HSS structure. These two\neffects that we considered in the model are sufficient to explain not only the\nmain signatures of RFDs, but also the sometimes observed \"over-recovery\" and\nsecondary dips in RFD profiles. The explanation in terms of the\nconvection-diffusion GCR propagation hypothesis is tested by applying our model\nto the observations of a long-lived CIR that recurred over 27 rotations in\n2007-2008. Our analysis demonstrates a very good match of the model results and\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 11:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The softening follows three sequential\nregimes: Regime I shows a slow decrease of modulus with cooking time; Regime\nII, the glassy to rubbery transition region, is characterized by very fast,\nseveral orders of magnitude drop in modulus; and regime III, the rubbery\nregion, has an asymptotic modulus about four orders of magnitude lower than the\nraw pasta. We present experiments and theory to capture these regimes and\nrelate them to the heterogeneous microstructure changes associated with\nswelling. Interestingly, we observe a modulus drop of two orders of magnitude\nwithin the range of 'al dente' cooking duration, and we find the modulus to be\nextremely sensitive to the amount of salt added to the boiling water. While\nmost chefs can gauge the pasta by tasting its texture, our proposed experiment,\nwhich only requires a measurement with a ruler, can precisely provide an\noptimal cooking time finely tuned for various kinds of pasta shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 11:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

We\nstudied the in situ measurements of this long-lived CIR as well as the\ncorresponding depression in the cosmic ray (CR) count observed by SOHO/EPHIN\nthroughout different rotations. We performed a statistical analysis, as well as\nthe superposed epoch analysis, using relative values of the key parameters: the\ntotal magnetic field strength, B, the magnetic field fluctuations, dBrms,\nplasma flow speed, v, plasma density, n, plasma temperature, T , and the\nSOHO/EPHIN F-detector particle count, and CR count. We find that the mirrored\nCR count-time profile is correlated with that of the flow speed, ranging from\nmoderate to strong correlation, depending on the rotation. In addition, we find\nthat the CR count dip amplitude is correlated to the peak in the magnetic field\nand flow speed of the CIR. These results are in agreement with previous\nstatistical studies. Finally, using the superposed epoch analysis, we obtain a\ngeneric CIR example, which reflects the in situ properties of a typical CIR\nwell. Our results are better explained based on the combined\nconvection-diffusion approach of the CIR-related GCR modulation. Furthermore,\nqualitatively, our results do not differ from those based on different CHs\nsamples. This indicates that the change of the physical properties of the\nrecurring CIR from one rotation to another is not qualitatively different from\nthe change of the physical properties of CIRs originating from different CHs.\nFinally, the obtained generic CIR example, analyzed on the basis of superposed\nepoch analysis, can be used as a reference for testing future models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 12:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This paper develops\ncoherent and comprehensive methodologies and mathematical models to describe\nFourier optical signal processing in full quantum terms for any input quantum\nstate of light. We begin this paper by introducing a spatially two-dimensional\nquantum state of a photon, associated with its wavefront and expressible as a\ntwo-dimensional creation operator. Then, by breaking down the Fourier optical\nprocessing apparatus into its key components, we strive to acquire the quantum\nunitary transformation or the input/output quantum relation of the\ntwo-dimensional creation operators. Subsequently, we take advantage of the\nabove results to develop and obtain the quantum analogous of a few essential\nFourier optical apparatus, such as quantum convolution via a 4f-processing\nsystem and a quantum 4f-processing system with periodic pupils. Moreover, due\nto the importance and widespread use of optical pulse shaping in various\noptical communications and optical sciences fields, we also present an\nanalogous system in full quantum terms, namely quantum pulse shaping with an\n8f-processing system. Finally, we apply our results to two extreme examples of\nthe quantum state of light.

In this paper, we propose a novel AE detection framework based on\nthe very nature of AEs, i.e., their semantic information is inconsistent with\nthe discriminative features extracted by the target DNN model. To be specific,\nthe proposed solution, namely ContraNet, models such contradiction by first\ntaking both the input and the inference result to a generator to obtain a\nsynthetic output and then comparing it against the original input. For\nlegitimate inputs that are correctly inferred, the synthetic output tries to\nreconstruct the input. On the contrary, for AEs, instead of reconstructing the\ninput, the synthetic output would be created to conform to the wrong label\nwhenever possible. Consequently, by measuring the distance between the input\nand the synthetic output with metric learning, we can differentiate AEs from\nlegitimate inputs. We perform comprehensive evaluations under various AE attack\nscenarios, and experimental results show that ContraNet outperforms existing\nsolutions by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Moreover, our\nanalysis shows that successful AEs that can bypass ContraNet tend to have\nmuch-weakened adversarial semantics. We have also shown that ContraNet can be\neasily combined with adversarial training techniques to achieve further\nimproved AE defense capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

While there is a long thread of work\ntrying to minimize the kernel-resident driver by offloading functions to user\nmode, they face a fundamental tradeoff between security and performance: more\noffloading may reduce the kernel attack surface, yet increase the runtime ring\ncrossings between the helper process and the driver, and thus more performance\ncost.\n  This paper explores a new design called delegated virtualization, which\ncompletely separates the control plane (the kernel driver) from the data plane\n(the helper process) and thus eliminates the kernel driver from runtime\nintervention. The resulting user-level hypervisor, called DuVisor, can handle\nall VM operations without trapping into the kernel once the kernel driver has\ndone the initialization. DuVisor retrofits existing hardware virtualization\nsupport with a new delegated virtualization extension to directly handle VM\nexits, configure virtualization registers, manage the stage-2 page table and\nvirtual devices in user mode. We have implemented the hardware extension on an\nopen-source RISC-V CPU and built a Rust-based hypervisor atop the hardware.\nEvaluation on FireSim shows that DuVisor outperforms KVM by up to 47.96\\% in a\nvariety of real-world applications and significantly reduces the attack\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Hierarchical reinforcement learning methods aim to solve the first\nproblem, by providing shortcuts that skip over multiple time steps. To cope\nwith the breadth, it is desirable to restrict the agent's attention at each\nstep to a reasonable number of possible choices. The concept of affordances\n(Gibson, 1977) suggests that only certain actions are feasible in certain\nstates. In this work, we model \"affordances\" through an attention mechanism\nthat limits the available choices of temporally extended options. We present an\nonline, model-free algorithm to learn affordances that can be used to further\nlearn subgoal options. We investigate the role of hard versus soft attention in\ntraining data collection, abstract value learning in long-horizon tasks, and\nhandling a growing number of choices.

Local-scale analyses focus on specific nodes of the\nspatial network, while regional-scale analyses consider the whole network.\nSimilarly, species- and community-level analyses either account for single\nspecies or for the whole community. Furthermore, stability itself can be\ndefined in multiple ways, including resistance (the inverse of the relative\ndisplacement caused by a perturbation), initial resilience (the rate of return\nafter a perturbation), and invariability (the inverse of the relative amplitude\nof the population fluctuations). Here, we analyze the scale-dependence of these\nstability properties. More specifically, we ask how spatial scale (local vs\nregional) and ecological scale (species vs community) influence these stability\nproperties. We find that regional initial resilience is the weighted arithmetic\nmean of the local initial resiliences. The regional resistance is the harmonic\nmean of local resistances, which makes regional resistance particularly\nvulnerable to nodes with low stability, unlike regional initial resilience.\nAnalogous results hold for the relationship between community- and\nspecies-level initial resilience and resistance. Both resistance and initial\nresilience are ``scale-free'' properties: regional and community values are\nsimply the biomass-weighted means of the local and species values,\nrespectively. Thus, one can easily estimate both stability metrics of whole\nnetworks from partial sampling. In contrast, invariability generally is greater\nat the regional and community-level than at the local and species-level,\nrespectively. Hence, estimating the invariability of spatial or ecological\nnetworks from measurements at the local or species level is more complicated,\nrequiring an unbiased estimate of the network (i.e. region or community) size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 08:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

However, the performance gains\nachieved by IRSs critically depend on smartly tuned passive beamforming based\non the assumption that the accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge\nis available, which is practically impossible. Thus, in this paper, we\ninvestigate the impact of the CSI uncertainty on IRS-assisted cell-free\nnetworks. We adopt a stochastic programming method to cope with the CSI\nuncertainty by maximizing the expectation of the sum-rate, which guarantees\nrobust performance over the average. Accordingly, an average sum-rate\nmaximization problem is formulated, which is non-convex and arduous to obtain\nits optimal solution due to the coupled variables and the expectation operation\nwith respect to CSI uncertainties. As a compromising approach, we develop an\nefficient robust joint design algorithm with low-complexity. Particularly, the\noriginal problem is equivalently transformed into a tractable form, and then,\nthe locally optimal solution can be obtained by employing the block coordinate\ndescent method. We further prove that the CSI uncertainty impacts the design of\nthe active transmitting beamforming of APs, but surprisingly does not directly\nimpact the design of the passive reflecting beamforming of IRSs. It is worth\nnoting that the investigated scenario is flexible and general, and thus the\nproposed algorithm can act as a general framework to solve various sum-rate\nmaximization problems.

To investigate the\nstability of the oxygenated groups at specific diamond surfaces, we evaluated\nthrough fully atomistic reactive molecular mechanics (FARMM) simulations, using\nthe ReaxFF force field, the formation energies of CO, COC, and COH groups on\npristine and defective diamond surfaces (110), (111), and (311). According to\nour findings, the COH group has the lowest formation energy on a perfect (110)\nsurface, while the COC is favored on a defective surface. As for the (111)\nsurface, the COC group is the most stable for both pristine and defective\nsurfaces. Similarly, COC group is also the most stable one on the\ndefective/perfect (311) surface. In this way, our results suggest that if in a\ndiamond film the (110) surface is the major exposed facet, the most adsorbed\noxygen group could be either COH or COC, in which the COC would depend on the\nlevel of surface defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

We define the process to\nform a complex question from ground truth reasoning path, neural network agent\nmodels that can learn to solve the task, and evaluation metrics to check the\nperformance. We show that the problem can be challenging without introducing\nprior of the collaboration structure, unless experts are perfect and uniform.\nBased on this experience, we elaborate extensions needed to approach\ncollaboration tasks in real-world settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

For example, the CM can first determine\nwhether the input is human speech, then the ASV can determine whether this\nspeech matches the speaker's identity. The performance of such a tandem system\ncan be measured with a tandem detection cost function (t-DCF). However, ASV and\nCM systems are usually trained separately, using different metrics and data,\nwhich does not optimize their combined performance. In this work, we propose to\noptimize the tandem system directly by creating a differentiable version of\nt-DCF and employing techniques from reinforcement learning. The results\nindicate that these approaches offer better outcomes than finetuning, with our\nmethod providing a 20% relative improvement in the t-DCF in the ASVSpoof19\ndataset in a constrained setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Such models are usually driven by pairwise learning,\ninvolving a training set of layout patterns and their reference shape images\nafter fabrication. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to collect the\nreference shape images of all layout clips for model training and updating. To\naddress the problem, we propose a deep learning-based layout novelty detection\nscheme to identify novel (unseen) layout patterns, which cannot be well\npredicted by a pre-trained pre-simulation model. We devise a global-local\nnovelty scoring mechanism to assess the potential novelty of a layout by\nexploiting two subnetworks: an autoencoder and a pretrained pre-simulation\nmodel. The former characterizes the global structural dissimilarity between a\ngiven layout and training samples, whereas the latter extracts a latent code\nrepresenting the fabrication-induced local deformation. By integrating the\nglobal dissimilarity with the local deformation boosted by a self-attention\nmechanism, our model can accurately detect novelties without the ground-truth\ncircuit shapes of test samples. Based on the detected novelties, we further\npropose two active-learning strategies to sample a reduced amount of\nrepresentative layouts most worthy to be fabricated for acquiring their\nground-truth circuit shapes. Experimental results demonstrate i) our method's\neffectiveness in layout novelty detection, and ii) our active-learning\nstrategies' ability in selecting representative novel layouts for keeping a\nlearning-based pre-simulation model updated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Conventional cold-refresh model upgrades can only deploy new models\nafter the gallery is overall backfilled, taking weeks or even months for\nmassive data. In contrast, hot-refresh model upgrades deploy the new model\nimmediately and then gradually improve the retrieval accuracy by backfilling\nthe gallery on-the-fly. Compatible training has made it possible, however, the\nproblem of model regression with negative flips poses a great challenge to the\nstable improvement of user experience. We argue that it is mainly due to the\nfact that new-to-old positive query-gallery pairs may show less similarity than\nnew-to-new negative pairs. To solve the problem, we introduce a\nRegression-Alleviating Compatible Training (RACT) method to properly constrain\nthe feature compatibility while reducing negative flips. The core is to\nencourage the new-to-old positive pairs to be more similar than both the\nnew-to-old negative pairs and the new-to-new negative pairs. An efficient\nuncertainty-based backfilling strategy is further introduced to fasten accuracy\nimprovements.

For instance,\na state may collectively encode some features of the user that are known to the\nmechanism only, since the latter has access to data sources unaccessible to the\nbidders. We study the problem of computing how the mechanism should send\nsignals to bidders in order to maximize revenue. While this problem has already\nbeen addressed in the easier setting of second-price auctions, to the best of\nour knowledge, our work is the first to explore ad auctions with more than one\nslot. In this paper, we focus on public signaling and VCG mechanisms, under\nwhich bidders truthfully report their valuations.

The rest of the\npaper is devoted to settings in which such negative result can be circumvented.\nFirst, we prove that, with known valuations, the problem can indeed be solved\nin polynomial time when either the number of states d or the number of slots m\nis fixed. Moreover, in the same setting, we provide an FPTAS for the case in\nwhich bidders are single minded, but d and m can be arbitrary. Then, we switch\nto the random valuations setting, in which these are randomly drawn according\nto some probability distribution. In this case, we show that the problem admits\nan FPTAS, a PTAS, and a QPTAS, when, respectively, d is fixed, m is fixed, and\nbidders' valuations are bounded away from zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 15:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

But in the case of epilepsy detection, standard HD\ncomputing is not performing at the level of other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThis could be due to the inherent complexity of the seizures and their\nsignatures in different biosignals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), the\nhighly personalized nature, and the disbalance of seizure and non-seizure\ninstances. In the literature, different strategies for improved learning of HD\ncomputing have been proposed, such as iterative (multi-pass) learning,\nmulti-centroid learning and learning with sample weight (\"OnlineHD\").

This brings several benefits to GPM. Firstly, since GPM is trained\nby maximizing value, the plans generated from it can be regarded as intentional\naction sequences for reaching high value regions. GPM can therefore leverage\nits generated multi-step plans for temporally coordinated exploration towards\nhigh value regions, which is potentially more effective than a sequence of\nactions generated by perturbing each action at single step level, whose\nconsistent movement decays exponentially with the number of exploration steps.\nSecondly, starting from a crude initial plan generator, GPM can refine it to be\nadaptive to the task, which, in return, benefits future explorations.

The IP detector is an auxiliary\ndetector which assigns randomised and unique assessment sets as an early\nprocedure to reduce potential misconducts. The behavioural monitor scans for\nirregularities in assessment responses from the candidates, further reducing\nany misconduct attempts. This is highlighted through the proposal of the\nDenseLSTM using a deep learning approach. Additionally, a new PT Behavioural\nDatabase is presented and made publicly available.

Taking the\nShanghai pilot market as an example, this paper attempted to design a carbon\nemission purchasing strategy for enterprises, and establish a carbon emission\nprice prediction model to help them reduce the purchasing cost. To make\npredictions more precise, we built a hybrid deep learning model by embedding\nGeneralized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) into the Gate\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) model, and compared the performance with those of other\nmodels. Then, based on the Iceberg Order Theory and the predicted price, we\nproposed the purchasing strategy of carbon emission rights. As a result, the\nprediction errors of the GARCH-GRU model with a 5-day sliding time window were\nthe minimum values of all six models. And in the simulation, the purchasing\nstrategy based on the GARCH-GRU model was executed with the least cost as well.\nThe carbon emission purchasing strategy constructed by the hybrid deep learning\nmethod can accurately send out timing signals, and help enterprises reduce the\npurchasing cost of carbon emission permits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 03:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Statistical methods are used when\nneeded to treat complex particle and/or field configurations. In\nStueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron (SHP) electrodynamics, the classical trajectories\nare traced out dynamically, through the evolution of a 4D spacetime event\n$x^\\mu (\\tau)$ as $\\tau$ grows monotonically. Stueckelberg proposed to\nformalize the distinction between coordinate time $x^0 = ct$ (measured by\nlaboratory clocks) and chronology $\\tau$ (the temporal ordering of event\noccurrence) in order to describe antiparticles and resolve problems of\nirreversibility such as grandfather paradoxes. Consequently, in SHP theory, the\nelementary object is not a particle (a 4D curve in spacetime) but rather an\nevent (a single point along the dynamically evolving curve). Following standard\ndeterministic methods in classical relativistic field theory, one is led to\nMaxwell-like field equations that are \\hbox{$\\tau$-dependent} and sourced by a\ncurrent that represents a statistical ensemble of instantaneous events\ndistributed along the trajectory. The width $\\lambda$ of this distribution\ndefines a correlation time for the interactions and a mass spectrum for the\nphotons emitted by particles. As $\\lambda$ becomes very large, the photon mass\ngoes to zero and the field equations become $\\tau$-independent Maxwell's\nequations. Maxwell theory thus emerges as an equilibrium limit of SHP, in which\n$\\lambda$ is larger than any other relevant time scale. Thus, statistical\nmechanics is a fundamental ingredient in SHP electrodynamics, and its insights\nare required to give meaning to the concept of a particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

This\nprinciple can be applied to transaction processes, the dynamics of which can be\ninterpreted as the market tendency to minimize the information revealed about\nitself. More information involves higher costs (information is physical). The\nstarting point for our considerations is a description of the market derived\nfrom the assumption of minimum Fisher information for a strategy with a fixed\nfinancial risk. Strategies of this type that minimize Fisher information\noverlap with the well-known eigenstates of a the quantum harmonic oscillator.\nThe analytical extension of this field of strategy to the complex vector space\n(traditional for quantum mechanics) suggests the study of the interference of\nthe oscillator eigenstates in terms of their minimization of Fisher\ninformation. It is revealed that the minimum value of Fisher information of the\nsuperposition of the two strategies being the ground state and the second\nexcited state of the oscillator, has Fisher information less than the ground\nstate of the oscillator. Similarly, less information is obtained for the system\nof strategies (the oscillator eigenstates) randomized by the Gibbs\ndistribution. We distinguish two different views on the description of Fisher\ninformation. One of them, the classical, is based on the value of Fisher\ninformation. The second, we call it transactional, expresses Fisher information\nfrom the perspective of the constant risk of market strategies. The orders of\nthe market strategies derived from these two descriptions are different. From a\nmarket standpoint, minimizing Fisher information is equivalent to minimizing\nrisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 19:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}
