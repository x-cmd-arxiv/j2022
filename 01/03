Recent advances in the field of graph\nsignal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution\nmonitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the\nreconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.\nReconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help\nimprove the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with\ncorrelated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring\nsensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of\ngraph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air\npollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian\ninterpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal\nreconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared\non actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of\nthe methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the\ncomputational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority\nof methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the\ndifficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network\nwith a large number of low-cost sensors.

To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm\ncalled ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which\nis inspired by the fact that outliers are often the \"rare events\" that appear\nin the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the\nunderlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by\ncomputing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD\nthen uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per\ndimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each\ndata point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our\ncontributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method\ncalled ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform\nextensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD\noutperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and\nscalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed\nsupport) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 17:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2022 23:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 01:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

This is sub-optimal for natural images,\nas they often consist of heterogeneous visual patterns. Dynamic convolution\ntries to address this issue by using per-pixel convolution kernels, but this\ngreatly increases computational cost. In this work, we present Malleable\nConvolution (MalleConv), which performs spatial-varying processing with minimal\ncomputational overhead. MalleConv uses a smaller set of spatially-varying\nconvolution kernels, a compromise between static and per-pixel convolution\nkernels. These spatially-varying kernels are produced by an efficient predictor\nnetwork running on a downsampled input, making them much more efficient to\ncompute than per-pixel kernels produced by a full-resolution image, and also\nenlarging the network's receptive field compared with static kernels. These\nkernels are then jointly upsampled and applied to a full-resolution feature map\nthrough an efficient on-the-fly slicing operator with minimum memory overhead.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of MalleConv, we use it to build an efficient\ndenoising network we call MalleNet. MalleNet achieves high-quality results\nwithout very deep architectures, making it 8.9x faster than the best performing\ndenoising algorithms while achieving similar visual quality. We also show that\na single MalleConv layer added to a standard convolution-based backbone can\nsignificantly reduce the computational cost or boost image quality at a similar\ncost.

A\nself-propelling analytically-described dipolar vortex is chosen as a model wake\nflow, passing through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating saliva droplets. The\ndroplets' spatial location, velocity, diameter, and temperature are traced and\ncoupled to their local flow field.

The advanced wound care market is estimated to reach $22\nbillion by 2024. Wound care professionals provide proper diagnosis and\ntreatment with heavy reliance on images and image documentation. Segmentation\nof wound boundaries in images is a key component of the care and diagnosis\nprotocol since it is important to estimate the area of the wound and provide\nquantitative measurement for the treatment. Unfortunately, this process is very\ntime-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Recently automatic wound\nsegmentation methods based on deep learning have shown promising performance\nbut require large datasets for training and it is unclear which methods perform\nbetter. To address these issues, we propose the Foot Ulcer Segmentation\nchallenge (FUSeg) organized in conjunction with the 2021 International\nConference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention\n(MICCAI). We built a wound image dataset containing 1,210 foot ulcer images\ncollected over 2 years from 889 patients. It is pixel-wise annotated by wound\ncare experts and split into a training set with 1010 images and a testing set\nwith 200 images for evaluation. Teams around the world developed automated\nmethods to predict wound segmentations on the testing set of which annotations\nwere kept private. The predictions were evaluated and ranked based on the\naverage Dice coefficient. The FUSeg challenge remains an open challenge as a\nbenchmark for wound segmentation after the conference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 20:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In recent years, it has been suggested that machine-learning (ML)\nparameterizations based on high-resolution model output data could be superior\nto traditional parameterizations. Currently, both traditional and ML\nparameterizations of subgrid processes in the atmosphere are based on a\nsingle-column approach, which only use information from single atmospheric\ncolumns. However, single-column parameterizations might not be ideal since\ncertain atmospheric phenomena, such as organized convective systems, can cross\nmultiple grid boxes and involve slantwise circulations that are not purely\nvertical. Here we train neural networks (NNs) using non-local inputs spanning\nover 3$\\times$3 columns of inputs. We find that including the non-local inputs\nimproves the offline prediction of a range of subgrid processes. The\nimprovement is especially notable for subgrid momentum transport and for\natmospheric conditions associated with mid-latitude fronts and convective\ninstability. Using an interpretability method, we find that the NN improvements\npartly rely on using the horizontal wind divergence, and we further show that\nincluding the divergence or vertical velocity as a separate input substantially\nimproves offline performance. However, non-local winds continue to be useful\ninputs for parameterizating subgrid momentum transport even when the vertical\nvelocity is included as an input. Overall, our results imply that the use of\nnon-local variables and the vertical velocity as inputs could improve the\nperformance of ML parameterizations, and the use of these inputs should be\ntested in online simulations in future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 20:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 02:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

The corresponding sampling locations of the selected\nentities are regarded as the sensor deployment locations.

Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles\nsignificantly alter the suspension's thermal properties. The thermal\nconductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to\nbe greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity\nis found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed\nto model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable\nuniversal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.\nIn recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed\nto create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially\nfor modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning\nmethods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,\nwe have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently\nwith available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for\npredicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks\nare trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal\nconductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32\ndifferent particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The\nlarge amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to\ncoarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy\nexperimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer\nlearning-based models' results are compared with those from baseline models\nwhich are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It\nis found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit\nvalues of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2022 23:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

However, salient object detection remains a challenge for many\ncomputer models dealing with color and textured images. Herein, we propose a\nnovel and efficient strategy, through a simple model, almost without internal\nparameters, which generates a robust saliency map for a natural image. This\nstrategy consists of integrating color information into local textural patterns\nto characterize a color micro-texture. Most models in the literature that use\nthe color and texture features treat them separately. In our case, it is the\nsimple, yet powerful LTP (Local Ternary Patterns) texture descriptor applied to\nopposing color pairs of a color space that allows us to achieve this end. Each\ncolor micro-texture is represented by vector whose components are from a\nsuperpixel obtained by SLICO (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering with zero\nparameter) algorithm which is simple, fast and exhibits state-of-the-art\nboundary adherence. The degree of dissimilarity between each pair of color\nmicro-texture is computed by the FastMap method, a fast version of MDS\n(Multi-dimensional Scaling), that considers the color micro-textures\nnon-linearity while preserving their distances. These degrees of dissimilarity\ngive us an intermediate saliency map for each RGB, HSL, LUV and CMY color\nspaces. The final saliency map is their combination to take advantage of the\nstrength of each of them. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and F$_{\\beta}$\nmeasures of our saliency maps, on the complex ECSSD dataset show that our model\nis both simple and efficient, outperforming several state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 00:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

When light interacts with the temporal\nboundary, its spectral content can be redistributed due to the breaking of\ncontinuous time-translational symmetry of the medium where light resides. In\nthis work, we use this principle to demonstrate, at terahertz (THz)\nfrequencies, the resonance-enhanced spectral funneling of light coupled to a\nFabry-Perot resonator with a temporal boundary mirror. To produce a temporal\nboundary effect, we abruptly increase the reflectance of a mirror constituting\nthe Fabry-Perot resonator and, correspondingly, its quality factor in a\nstep-like manner. The abrupt increase in the mirror reflectance leads to a\ntrimming of the coupled THz pulse that causes the pulse to broaden in the\nspectral domain. Through this dynamic resonant process, the spectral contents\nof the input THz pulse are redistributed into the modal frequencies of the\nhigh-Q Fabry-Perot resonator formed after the temporal boundary. An energy\nconversion efficiency of up to 33% was recorded for funneling into the\nfundamental mode with a Fabry-Perot resonator exhibiting a sudden Q-factor\nchange from 4.8 to 48.

Specifically, MGSL-Net consists of\nthree main parts: a cross-modal inter-action module, a memory augmentation\nmodule, and a heterogeneous attention module. We first align the given\nvideo-query pair by a cross-modal graph convolutional network, and then utilize\na memory module to record the cross-modal shared semantic features in the\ndomain-specific persistent memory. During training, the memory slots are\ndynamically associated with both common and rare cases, alleviating the\nforgetting issue. In testing, the rare cases can thus be enhanced by retrieving\nthe stored memories, resulting in better generalization. At last, the\nheterogeneous attention module is utilized to integrate the enhanced\nmulti-modal features in both video and query domains.

Previous works typically\nsolve this task by learning frame-level video features and align them with the\ntextual information. A major limitation of these works is that they fail to\ndistinguish ambiguous video frames with subtle appearance differences due to\nframe-level feature extraction. Recently, a few methods adopt Faster R-CNN to\nextract detailed object features in each frame to differentiate the\nfine-grained appearance similarities. However, the object-level features\nextracted by Faster R-CNN suffer from missing motion analysis since the object\ndetection model lacks temporal modeling. To solve this issue, we propose a\nnovel Motion-Appearance Reasoning Network (MARN), which incorporates both\nmotion-aware and appearance-aware object features to better reason object\nrelations for modeling the activity among successive frames. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce two individual video encoders to embed the video into\ncorresponding motion-oriented and appearance-aspect object representations.\nThen, we develop separate motion and appearance branches to learn motion-guided\nand appearance-guided object relations, respectively. At last, both motion and\nappearance information from two branches are associated to generate more\nrepresentative features for final grounding. Extensive experiments on two\nchallenging datasets (Charades-STA and TACoS) show that our proposed MARN\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 02:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Using these two data\nsets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more\nrobust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the\nlabeled data set only. Beyond the 'standard' double robustness results (in\nterms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we\nfurther establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS\nestimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified,\nwithout requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an\nimprovement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so\nit is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our\nestimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the\nnuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the\nnuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel\nsmoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and\nestablish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform\nconvergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results\non both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over\ntheir supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 04:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 10:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

A fundamental goal of modeling such\nnonlinear processes is to estimate model parameters that reflect meaningful\naspects of change, including the parameters related to change and other\nparameters that shed light on substantive hypotheses. However, if the\nmeasurement occasion is unstructured, existing models cannot simultaneously\nestimate these two types of parameters. This article has three goals. First, we\nview the change over time as the area under the curve (AUC) of the\nrate-of-change versus time (r-t) graph. Second, using the instantaneous\nrate-of-change midway through a time interval to approximate the average\nrate-of-change during that interval, we propose a new specification to describe\nlongitudinal processes. In addition to obtaining the individual change-related\nparameters and other parameters related to specific research questions, the new\nspecification allows for unequally-space study waves and individual measurement\noccasions around each wave. Third, we derive the model-based interval-specific\nchange and change-from-baseline, two common measures to evaluate change over\ntime.

Secondly,\nCaFT considers the initial mask as pseudo labels to train a shallow convolution\nhead (Attention Filter, AtF) following backbone to directly extract the mask\nfrom tokens. Then, CaFT splits the image into parts, outputs masks respectively\nand merges them into one refined mask. Finally, a new AtF is trained on the\nrefined masks and used to predict the box of object.

This work\nrevisits slice-out-of-order (sOoO) cores as an energy efficient alternative for\nMLP exploitation. sOoO cores achieve energy efficiency by constructing and\nexecuting \\textit{slices} of MLP generating instructions out-of-order only with\nrespect to the rest of instructions; the slices and the remaining instructions,\nby themselves, execute in-order. However, we observe that existing sOoO cores\nmiss significant MLP opportunities due to their dependence-oblivious in-order\nslice execution, which causes dependent slices to frequently block MLP\ngeneration. To boost MLP generation, we introduce Freeway, a sOoO core based on\na new dependence-aware slice execution policy that tracks dependent slices and\nkeeps them from blocking subsequent independent slices and MLP extraction. The\nproposed core incurs minimal area and power overheads, yet approaches the MLP\nbenefits of fully OoO cores. Our evaluation shows that Freeway delivers 12%\nbetter performance than the state-of-the-art sOoO core and is within 7% of the\nMLP limits of full OoO execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 05:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market\ndemands can evolve over a product's lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this\npaper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that\nfirms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit\nproblem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents\ndiscrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are\nindependent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;\nthey can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work\ntowards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with\nWeighted Exploration (AWE) $\\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the\nwell-known $\\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies\nchanges in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and\nexploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus\nenabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient\nexploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes\nadvantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the\nemergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the\nscalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and\nthe size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in\nour models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly\nchange their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also\nengage in collusive behavior in many simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 05:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

However, these methods suffer from limited performance\nbecause of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in\ndownstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are\nbased on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent\nstudies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL)\nalgorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing\ngraph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework,\ntermed \\textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph\nkernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution\nfilters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden\ngraphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node\nembeddings using graph kernels.

Recently proposed attention\nmechanisms allow DOA estimators to focus on the sources-of-interest and\ndisregard interference and noise, i.e., they are signal-aware. The attention is\ntypically obtained by a deep neural network (DNN) from a short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) based representation of a single microphone signal.\nSubsequently, attention has been applied as binary or ratio weighting to\nSTFT-based microphone signal representations to reduce the impact of frequency\nbins dominated by noise, interference, or reverberation. The impact of\nattention on DOA estimators and different training strategies for attention and\nDOA DNNs are not yet studied in depth. In this paper, we evaluate systems\nconsisting of different DNNs and signal processing-based methods for DOA\nestimation when attention is applied.

The evaluation of the proposed and the baseline systems is\nperformed using data generated with simulated and measured room impulse\nresponses under various acoustic conditions, like reverberation times, noise,\nand source array distances. Overall, DOA estimation using attention in\ncombination with signal-processing methods exhibits a far lower computational\ncomplexity than a fully DNN-based system; however, it yields comparable\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 07:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer\nmodels with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts.\nNevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several\nconcerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to\nexcessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by\nirrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand,\nthe sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and\nmay limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues,\nwe propose a novel deformable self-attention module, where the positions of key\nand value pairs in self-attention are selected in a data-dependent way. This\nflexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant regions\nand capture more informative features. On this basis, we present Deformable\nAttention Transformer, a general backbone model with deformable attention for\nboth image classification and dense prediction tasks.

The dynamic multimodal\noptimization problems (DMMOPs) have both of these characteristics, which have\nbeen studied in the field of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence\nfor years, and attract more and more attention. Solving such problems requires\noptimization algorithms to simultaneously track multiple optima in the changing\nenvironments. So that the decision makers can pick out one optimal solution in\neach environment according to their experiences and preferences, or quickly\nturn to other solutions when the current one cannot work well. This is very\nhelpful for the decision makers, especially when facing changing environments.\nIn this competition, a test suit about DMMOPs is given, which models the\nreal-world applications.

Using idealized\ntwo-fluid simulations and exploring different acceleration sites and diffusion\ncoefficients, we obtain the CR energy density profile and luminosity to find\nthe best match for the $\\gamma$-ray observations.

Recent improvements in the atomic data\nallow a more complete model atom of Be to be constructed and the validity of\nthese claims to be reassessed using more up-to-date atomic physics. The main\ngoal of this study therefore is to refocus on the role of non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in the formation of Be II 313.04 and\n313.11 nm resonance lines in solar and stellar atmospheres. For this, we\nconstructed a model atom of Be using new atomic data that recently became\navailable. The model atom contains 98 levels and 383 radiative transitions of\nBe I and Be II and uses the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and\nhydrogen. This makes it the most complete model atom used to determine 1D NLTE\nsolar Be abundance and to study the role of NLTE effects in the formation of Be\nII 313 nm resonance lines. We find that deviations from LTE have a significant\ninfluence on the strength of the Be II 313 nm line in solar and stellar\natmospheres.

Moreover, there is a pronounced variation in 1D NLTE-LTE abundance\ncorrections with the effective temperature and metallicity. Therefore, contrary\nto our previous understanding, the obtained results indicate that NLTE effects\nplay an important role in Be line formation in stellar atmospheres and have to\nbe properly taken into account in Be abundance studies, especially in\nmetal-poor stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 09:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

However, while TRL assessments provide a systematic\nevaluation process resulting in meaningful metric, they are one dimensional:\nthey only answer the question if a technology can go into production.

However, many studies have shown that HAS suffers from many Quality\nof Experience (QoE)-related issues in the presence of competing players. This\nis mainly caused by the selfishness of the players resulting from the\ndecentralized intelligence given to the player. Another limitation is the\nbottleneck link that could happen at any time during the streaming session and\nanywhere in the network. These issues may result in wobbling bandwidth\nperception by the players and could lead to missing the deadline for chunk\ndownloads, which result in the most annoying issue consisting of rebuffering\nevents. In this paper, we leverage the SoftwareDefined Networking paradigm to\ntake advantage of the global view of the network and its powerful intelligence\nthat allows reacting to the network changing conditions. Ultimately, we aim at\npreventing the re-buffering events, resulting from deadline misses, and\nensuring high QoE for the accepted clients in the system. To this end, we use\nDeterministic Network Calculus (DNC) to guarantee a maximum delay for the\ndownload of the video chunks while maximizing the perceived video quality.\nSimulation results show that the proposed solution ensures high efficiency for\nthe accepted clients without any rebuffering events which result in high user\nQoE.

It is shown that the order of magnitude of the exclusive width\ndifference is enhanced relative to the 4D-like inclusive contributions of the\nfour-quark operators, that is qualitatively consistent with the realistic\nobservation of the $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$ mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 10:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 03:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

Radial physical\nproperties of gas (velocity, temperature, and density) is first analysed around\n415 galaxy cluster environments from IllustrisTNG simulation at z = 0\n(TNG300-1). Whereas hot plasma is virialised inside clusters (< R200), the\ndynamics of warm hot inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two\nregimes: accumulating and slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries and fast\ninfalling motions outside clusters (> 1.5R200). The azimuthal distribution of\ndark matter (DM), hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by\ndecomposing their 2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the\nazimuthal symmetries of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural\nproperties, such as their center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical\nshapes. Beyond cluster virialised regions, we find that WHIM gas follows the\nazimuthal distribution of DM thus tracing cosmic filament patterns.

Besides wave amplitude and frequency, spin-wave has its third\ncharacter: handedness, whose manipulation is certainly of interest. We propose\nin this Letter that the handedness of low energy spin-wave excitations can be\ncontrolled by tuning the net angular momentum {\\delta}s in a ferrimagnetic\n(FiM) domain wall, attributing to the inequivalent magnetic sublattices. The\nresults indicate that the spin-wave dispersion depends on both {\\delta}s and\nwave handedness. For a positive (negative) {\\delta}s, a gapless dispersion is\nobserved for the left-handed (righ-handed) spin waves, while a frequency gap\nappears for the right-handed (left-handed) spin waves. Thus a FiM wall could\nserve as a multifold filter of low energy spin-wave in which only spin waves\nwith particular handedness can propagate. Furthermore, the energy consumption\nloss for spin-wave excitation in the wall is much lower than that inside the\ndomain, while the group velocity is much faster too, demonstrating the\nadvantages of domain walls serving as spin waveguides. Moreover, the\ncurrent-induced spin-wave Doppler shift in the FiM wall is also revealed, and\ncan be controlled by {\\delta}s. This work unveils for the first time the\ninteresting spin-wave dynamics in FiM domain walls, benefiting future spin-wave\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 13:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 01:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The non linear simulation results show\nsimilar 1/1 EIC saturation phases with respect to the experimental\nobservations, reproducing the enhancement of the n/m = 1/1 resistive\ninterchange modes (RIC) amplitude and width as the EP $\\beta$ increases, the EP\nbeta threshold for the 1/1 EIC excitation, the further destabilization of the\n1/1 EIC as the population of the helically trapped EP increases and the\ntriggering of burst events. The frequency of the 1/1 EIC calculated during the\nburst event is 9.4 kHz and the 2/2 and 3/3 overtones are destabilized,\nconsistent with the frequency range and the complex mode structure measured in\nthe experiment. In addition, the simulation shows the inward propagation of the\n1/1 EIC due to the non linear destabilization of the 3/4 and 2/3 EPMs, leading\nto the partial overlapping between resonances during the burst event. Finally,\nthe analysis of the 1/1 EIC stabilization phase shows the excitation of the 1/1\nRIC as soon as the flattening induced by the 1/1 EIC in the pressure profile\nvanishes, leading to the retrieval of the pressure gradient at the plasma\nperiphery and the overcoming of the RIC stability limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 13:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to\nimage compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of\nspecific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor\nattack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a\ncompression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to\nimage compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions\nare input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of\neach image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature\ndifference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized.\nAs a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of\nbackdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against\nDNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different\nimage compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency\ntraining, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression\nalgorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness\nof the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed,\nthe attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the\nattack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%.\nThe compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images\nare compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments\nhave demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the\ngeneralization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the\ntraining process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 14:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Despite this, the Lyapunov equation is seldom\nconsidered a fundamental formalism for linear open quantum systems. In this\nwork we aim to change that. We establish the Lyapunov equation as a fundamental\nand efficient formalism for linear open quantum systems that can go beyond the\nlimitations of various standard quantum master equation descriptions, while\nremaining of much less complexity than general exact formalisms.

We find that the axion abundance decreases or increases\nsignificantly depending on the initial position, even for a tiny Peccei-Quinn\nbreaking that satisfies the experimental bound of the neutron electric dipole\nmeasurements. If the axion first starts to oscillate around a wrong vacuum and\nif it gets trapped there until the false vacuum disappears due to\nnon-perturbative QCD effects, its abundance increases significantly and is\nindependent of the decay constant $f_a$, as first pointed out in [JHEP 06\n(2016) 150]. Thus, the axion produced by the trapping mechanism can explain\ndark matter even when the decay constant is close to the lower limit due to\nstellar cooling arguments. On the other hand, if the axion starts to oscillate\nabout a potential minimum close to the low-energy vacuum, its abundance is\nsignificantly reduced because of the adiabatic suppression mechanism. This\nrelaxes the upper limit of the axion window to large values of $f_a$. We also\ndiscuss how the axionic isocurvature perturbation is affected by the\nPeccei-Quinn breaking term, and show that it can be suppressed in both regimes.\nIn particular, the isocurvature bound on the inflation scale is relaxed by many\norders of magnitudes for $f_a \\lesssim 10^{11}{\\rm GeV}$ compared to the\nconventional scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 14:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The initialization of the\nproposed model can be effectively determined by labeled data, which is\npractical. The model is decoupled into three small-scale sub-problems that can\nefficiently be optimized with a local convergence guarantee. The experimental\nresults on classification tasks show that the proposed method achieves optimal\nor sub-optimal classification accuracy at the lowest computational cost\ncompared to other related methods, and the weight change experiments show that\nour proposed strategy can distinguish view importance more accurately than\nother related strategies on multi-view datasets with low-quality views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 15:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

Prior work on using\nmachine learning in the context of mechanics has largely focused on predicting\nthe effective response and overall structure of stress fields. However, their\nability to predict peak stresses -- which are of critical importance to failure\n-- is unexplored, because the peak-stress clusters occupy a small spatial\nvolume relative to the entire domain, and hence requires computationally\nexpensive training. This work develops a deep-learning based Convolutional\nEncoder-Decoder method that focuses on predicting peak-stress clusters,\nspecifically on the size and other characteristics of the clusters in the\nframework of heterogeneous linear elasticity. This method is based on\nconvolutional filters that model local spatial relations between\nmicrostructures and stress fields using spatially weighted averaging\noperations. The model is first trained against linear elastic calculations of\nstress under applied macroscopic strain in synthetically-generated\nmicrostructures, which serves as the ground truth. The trained model is then\napplied to predict the stress field given a (synthetically-generated)\nmicrostructure and then to detect peak-stress clusters within the predicted\nstress field. The accuracy of the peak-stress predictions is analyzed using the\ncosine similarity metric and by comparing the geometric characteristics of the\npeak-stress clusters against the ground-truth calculations. It is observed that\nthe model is able to learn and predict the geometric details of the peak-stress\nclusters and, in particular, performed better for higher (normalized) values of\nthe peak stress as compared to lower values of the peak stress. These\ncomparisons showed that the proposed method is well-suited to predict the\ncharacteristics of peak-stress clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 15:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

First, we argue that separating\nbetween UAVs and UEs in terms of the assigned sub-carriers reduces the\ninterference impact on the users. This is materialized through a matching game.\nMoreover, in order to boost the partition, we propose a coalitional game that\nconsiders the outcome of the first one and enables users to change their\ncoalitions and enhance their QoS. Furthermore, a power optimization solution is\nintroduced, which is considered in the two games. Performance evaluations are\nconducted, and the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npropositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 10:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Service Function Chaining (SFC) plays a critical role in\ndelivering sophisticated service per slice and enables traffic traversal\nthrough a set of ordered Service Functions (SFs). In fully symmetric SFCs, the\nuplink and downlink traffic traverse the same SFs, while in asymmetric SFC, the\nreverse-path may not necessarily cross the same SFs in the reverse order.\nProposed approaches in the literature support either full symmetry or no\nsymmetry. In this paper, we discuss the partial symmetry concept, that enforces\nthe reverse path to traverse the SFs only when needed. Our contribution is\nthreefold. First, we propose a novel SFC framework with an abstraction layer\nthat can dynamically create partial or full symmetric SFCs across multiple\nadministrative and technological cloud/edge domains. According to the Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) and desired objectives specified at the network\nslice intent request, the abstraction layer would automatise different SFC\noperations, but specifically generating partial or full symmetric SFCs. Second,\nwe propose an algorithm to dynamically calculate the reverse path for an SFC by\nincluding only SFs requiring symmetry. Third, we implement a prototype\napplication to test the performance of the partial symmetry algorithm. The\nobtained results show the advantages of partial symmetry in reducing both the\nSFC delivery time and the load on VNFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 10:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}
