As a preparatory step, we first apply three corrections to the\nnominal LFI bandpass profiles including removal of a known systematic effect in\nthe ground measuring equipment at 61 GHz; smoothing of standing wave ripples;\nand edge regularization. The main net impact of these modifications is an\noverall shift in the 70 GHz bandpass of +0.6 GHz; we argue that any analysis of\nLFI data products, either from Planck or BeyondPlanck, should use these new\nbandpasses. In addition, we fit a single free bandpass parameter for each\nradiometer of the form $\\Delta_i = \\Delta_0 + \\delta_i$, where $\\Delta_0$\nrepresents an absolute frequency shift per frequency band and $\\delta_i$ is a\nrelative shift per detector. The absolute correction is only fitted at 30 GHz\nwith a full $\\chi^2$-based likelihood, resulting in a correction of\n$\\Delta_{30}=0.24\\pm0.03\\,$GHz. The relative corrections are fitted using a\nspurious map approach, fundamentally similar to the method pioneered by the\nWMAP team, but without introducing many additional degrees of freedom. All\nbandpass parameters are sampled using a standard Metropolis sampler within the\nmain BeyondPlanck Gibbs chain, and bandpass uncertainties are thus propagated\nto all other data products in the analysis. In total, we find that our bandpass\nmodel significantly reduces leakage effects. For beam leakage corrections, we\nadopt the official Planck LFI beam estimates without additional degrees of\nfreedom, and only marginalize over the underlying sky model. We note that this\nis the first time leakage from beam mismatch has been included for Planck LFI\nmaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In fact, fully controlled\nquantitative experiments have so far been limited to frequencies in the mHz\nregime. New experiments in gravity might also yield new physics, thereby\nopening avenues towards a theory that explains all of physics within one\ncoherent framework. Here we introduce a new, fully-characterized experiment at\nthree orders of magnitude higher frequencies. It allows experimenters to\nquantitatively determine the dynamic gravitational interaction between two\nparallel beams vibrating at 42 Hz in bending motion. The large amplitude\nvibration of the transmitter beam produces gravitationally-induced motion with\namplitudes up to 1E-11 m of the resonant detector beam. The reliable\nmeasurement with sub-pm displacement resolution is made possible by a set-up\nwhich combines acoustical, mechanical and electrical isolation, a\ntemperature-stable environment, heterodyne laser interferometry and lock-in\ndetection. The interaction is quantitatively modelled based on Newton's theory.\nOur initial results agree with the theory to within about three percent in\namplitude. Based on a power balance analysis, we determined the near-field\ngravitational energy flow from the transmitter to the detector to be 2.5 E-20\nJ/s, and to decay with distance as d-4.

Many gravitational-wave\nsignals, emitted by stellar-mass binary black holes and binary neutron stars,\nhave been detected, and many more are expected in the future. The observation\nof the gravitational-wave signals from these systems, and the characterization\nof their sources, heavily relies on the precise models for the emitted\ngravitational waveforms. In this thesis, I present an updated version of the\nwaveform models for spinning binary black holes within the effective-one-body\nformalism. The novelty of the waveform models presented in this work is the\ninclusion of beyond-quadupolar terms in the waveforms emitted by spinning\nbinary black holes. I first construct the model in the simplified case of black\nholes with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary, then\nI extend it to the case of generic spin orientations. The measurement of the\nsource properties of a binary system emitting gravitational waves requires to\ncompute $\\mathcal{O}(10^7-10^9)$ different waveforms. Since the waveform models\nmentioned before can require $\\mathcal{O}(1-10)$s to generate a single\nwaveform, they can be difficult to use in data-analysis studies. To overcome\nthis obstacle, I use the reduced-order-modeling technique to develop a faster\nversion of the waveform model for black holes with spins aligned to the orbital\nangular momentum of the binary. The waveform models developed in this thesis\nhave been used by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations for the inference of the\nsource parameters of the gravitational-wave signals detected during the second\nand third observing runs (O2 and O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Here, I\npresent a study on the source properties of the signals GW170729 and GW190412,\nfor which I have been directly involved in the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

It includes the\npossibility of taking several non-standard processes such as atomic diffusion\ninto account. Even if the effect of gravitational settling is considered a\nstandard ingredient in stellar modelling today, this is not the case for\nradiative accelerations. The specific treatment of atomic diffusion along with\nthe radiative accelerations has never been compared with other stellar\nevolution codes. Benchmarking these codes is important because improved\naccuracy is required in order to analyse data from present and future space\nmissions, such as the \\textit{Kepler}, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS), and PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) missions.\n  The aim of this paper is to compare MESA models including atomic diffusion\n(with radiative accelerations) with models computed with the\nMontreal/Montpellier stellar evolution code and with the Code d'Evolution\nStellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM). Additionally, we assess the impact\nof some MESA options related to atomic diffusion.\n  We calculated atomic diffusion, including radiative accelerations, following\nthe abundance profiles of 14 elements with MESA models. This was then compared\nwith 1.1 and 1.4~$M_{\\odot}$ models computed with the Montreal/Montpellier and\nCESTAM codes. Various tests of MESA options for atomic diffusion were also\ncarried out by varying only one of them at a time.\n  We find that the abundance profiles of the considered elements in the MESA\nmodels compare rather well with the models computed with the two other codes\nwhen atomic diffusion options are carefully set. We also show that some options\nin MESA are crucial for a proper treatment of atomic diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 16:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

The\naggregation framework is used to compute the day-ahead dispatch plans of\nmultiple and interconnected distribution grids operating at different voltage\nlevels. Specifically, the proposed framework optimizes the dispatch plan of an\nupstream medium voltage (MV) grid accounting for the flexibility offered by\ndownstream low voltage (LV) grids and the knowledge of the uncertainties of the\nstochastic resources. The framework considers grid, i.e., operational limits on\nthe nodal voltages, lines, and transformer capacity using a linearized grid\nmodel, and controllable resources' constraints. The dispatching problem is\nformulated as a stochastic-optimization scheme considering uncertainty on\nstochastic power generation and demands and the voltage imposed by the upstream\ngrid. The problem is solved by a distributed optimization method relying on the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that splits the main problem\ninto an aggregator problem (solved at the MV-grid level) and several local\nproblems (solved at the MV-connected-controllable-resources and LV-grid\nlevels). The use of distributed optimization enables a decentralized dispatch\ncomputation where the centralized aggregator is agnostic about the\nparameters/models of the participating resources and downstream grids.

Moreover, the distance\ncorrelation is adopted to enhance the independence between each pair of\nfactors. After representing each item with independent factors, an attention\nmechanism is designed to learn user intent to different factors of each item in\nthe session. The session embedding is then generated by aggregating the item\nembeddings with attention weights of each item's factors. To this end, our\nmodel takes user intents at the factor level into account to infer the user\npurpose in a session.

We then lift the\nrestrictions and show that the process still exists via the coloured Kac Moody\nalgebras. We formulate the GQE conjecture which predicts that every\nrepresentation in the category Oint of a Kac-Moody algebra can be deformed into\na representation of an associated GQE algebra. We give various evidences for\nthis conjecture and make a first step towards its resolution by proving that\nKac-Moody algebras without Serre relations can be deformed into GQE algebras\nwithout Serre relations. In case the conjecture holds, we establish an analog\nresult for coloured Kac-Moody algebras, we prove that the deformed\nrepresentation theories are parallel to the classical one, we explicit a\ndeformed Serre presentation for GQE algebras, we prove that the latter are the\nrepresentatives of a natural class of formal deformations of Kac-Moody algebras\nand are h-trivial in finite type. As an application, we explain in terms of\ninterpolation both classical and quantum Langlands dualities between\nrepresentations of Lie algebras, and we propose a new approach which aims at\nproving a conjecture of Frenkel-Hernandez. In general, we prove that\nrepresentations of two isogenic coloured Kac-Moody algebras can be interpolated\nby representations of a third one. Observing that standard quantum algebras\nsatisfy the GQE conjecture, we give a new proof of the previously mentioned\nclassical Langlands duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 17:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

We use\nfirst-order perturbation theory in the interlayer coupling of the bilayer\nsystem to obtain analytical expressions for the orbital Hall conductivity in\nthe linear response regime. We use two distinct descriptions of the orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) operator: The first one is the intra-atomic\napproximation that considers only the intrasite contribution to the OAM [Cysne\net al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 056601 (2021)]. The second one uses the\nBerry-phase formula of the orbital (valley) magnetic moment to describe the OAM\noperator [Bhowal and Vignale, Phys. Rev.

Our results\nsuggest that the two approaches agree qualitatively in describing the OHE in\nbilayers of 2H-TMDs, although they present some quantitative differences. We\nalso show that interlayer coupling plays an essential role in understanding the\nOHE in the unbiased bilayer of 2H-TMD.

A requirement of\ndeletion-compliance is strong privacy for the deletion requesters since no\noutside observer must be able to tell if deleted data was ever present in the\nfirst place. Naturally, many real world systems where information can flow\nacross users are automatically ruled out.\n  The main thesis of this paper is that deletion-compliance is a standalone\nnotion, distinct from privacy. We present an alternative definition that\nmeaningfully captures deletion-compliance without any privacy implications.\nThis allows broader class of data collectors to demonstrate compliance to\ndeletion requests and to be paired with various notions of privacy. Our new\ndefinition has several appealing properties:\n  - It is implied by the stronger definition of Garg et al. under natural\nconditions, and is equivalent when we add a privacy requirement.\n  - It is naturally composable with minimal assumptions.\n  - Its requirements are met by data structure implementations that do not\nreveal the order of operations, a concept known as history-independence.\n  Along the way, we discuss the many challenges that remain in providing a\nuniversal definition of compliance to the \"right to be forgotten.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 17:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In Paper I we derived the radial distribution and mass function\n(MF) of accreted subhaloes (scaled to the radius and mass of the host halo) and\nshowed they are essentially universal. This is not the case, however, for those\nof stripped subhaloes, which depend on halo mass and assembly history. In Paper\nII we derived these latter properties in the simplest case of purely accreting\nhaloes. Here we extend the study to ordinary haloes having suffered major\nmergers. After showing that all the properties of substructure are encoded in\nthe mean truncated-to-original subhalo mass ratio profile, we demonstrate that\nthe dependence of the subhalo MF on halo mass arises from their mass-dependent\nconcentration, while the shape of the subhalo radial distribution depends on\nthe time of the last major merger of the host halo. In this sense, the latter\nproperty is a better probe of halo formation time than the former.\nUnfortunately, this is not the case for the radial distribution of satellites\nas this profile is essentially disconnected from subhalo stripping and the\nproperties of accreted subhaloes are independent of the halo formation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 18:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Crisis information management (CIM) is characterised\nby the urgency to respond despite the uncertainty of the situation. Coupled\nwith high stakes, limited resources and a high cognitive load, crises are prone\nto induce biases in the data and the cognitive processes of analysts and\ndecision-makers. When biases remain undetected and untreated in CIM, they may\nlead to decisions based on biased information, increasing the risk of an\ninefficient response. Literature suggests that crisis response needs to address\nthe initial uncertainty and possible biases by adapting to new and better\ninformation as it becomes available. However, we know little about whether\nadaptive approaches mitigate the interplay of data and cognitive biases.\n  We investigated this question in an exploratory, three-stage experiment on\nepidemic response. Our participants were experienced practitioners in the\nfields of crisis decision-making and information analysis. We found that\nanalysts fail to successfully debias data, even when biases are detected, and\nthat this failure can be attributed to undervaluing debiasing efforts in favor\nof rapid results. This failure leads to the development of biased information\nproducts that are conveyed to decision-makers, who consequently make decisions\nbased on biased information. Confirmation bias reinforces the reliance on\nconclusions reached with biased data, leading to a vicious cycle, in which\nbiased assumptions remain uncorrected. We suggest mindful debiasing as a\npossible counter-strategy against these bias effects in CIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 18:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

We demonstrate\nthat when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net\npoloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a\ntwo-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically\ndominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius\ndetermined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic\nflux.

Such\nretrievals in the past have typically assumed one-dimensional temperature\nstructures which were adequate to explain extant observations. However, the\nincreasing data quality expected from exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST\nmotivates considerations of multidimensional atmospheric retrievals. We present\nAURA-3D, a three-dimensional atmospheric retrieval framework for exoplanet\ntransmission spectra. AURA-3D includes a forward model that enables rapid\ncomputation of transmission spectra in 3D geometry for a given atmospheric\nstructure and can, therefore, be used for atmospheric retrievals as well as for\ncomputing spectra from General Circulation Models (GCMs). In order to\nefficiently explore the space of possible 3D temperature structures in\nretrievals, we develop a parametric 3D pressure-temperature profile which can\naccurately represent azimuthally-averaged temperature structures of a range of\nhot Jupiter GCMs. We apply our retrieval framework to simulated JWST\nobservations of hot Jupiter transmission spectra, obtaining accurate estimates\nof the day-night temperature variation across the terminator as well as the\nabundances of chemical species. We demonstrate an example of a model hot\nJupiter transmission spectrum for which a traditional 1D retrieval of\nJWST-quality data returns biased abundance estimates, whereas a retrieval\nincluding a day-night temperature gradient can accurately retrieve the true\nabundances.

However, in the far shock precursor region where accelerated\nparticles constitute a highly relativistic and dilute beam, streaming\ninstabilities typically become inefficient and operate at very small scales\nwhen compared to the gyroradii of the beam particles. We report on a plasma\ncavitation instability that is driven by dilute relativistic beams and can\nincrease both the magnetic field strength and coherence scale by orders of\nmagnitude to reach near-equipartition values with the beam energy density. This\ninstability grows after the development of the Weibel instability and is\nassociated with the asymmetric response of background leptons and ions to the\nbeam current. The resulting net inductive electric field drives a strong energy\nasymmetry between positively and negatively charged beam species. Large-scale\nparticle-in-cell simulations are used to verify analytical predictions for the\ngrowth and saturation level of the instability and indicate that it is robust\nover a wide range of conditions, including those associated with pair-loaded\nplasmas.

Subsequently, the RAKI convolution\nfilters are refined iteratively using original and augmented ACS extracted from\nthe previous RAKI reconstruction.

In this paper, we conduct a series of\ncontrolled numerical experiments to understand the potential physical processes\ndriving this offset.

We previously found that clusters that are accreted within cuspy subhalos\nproduce streams with larger physical widths and higher dispersions in\nline-of-sight velocity and angular momentum than streams that are accreted\nwithin cored subhalos. Here, we use the same suite of simulations to\ndemonstrate that the dispersion in the tangential velocities of streams\n($\\sigma_{v_\\mathrm{Tan}}$) is also sensitive to the central DM density\nprofiles of their parent dwarfs and GCs that were accreted from: cuspy subhalos\nproduce streams with larger $\\sigma_{v_\\mathrm{Tan}}$ than those accreted\ninside cored subhalos. Using Gaia EDR3 observations of multiple GC streams we\ncompare their $\\sigma_{v_\\mathrm{Tan}}$ values with simulations.

The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e.,\nthe number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important\nimplications for the FRB progenitors. Here we show the energy functions of FRBs\nselected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment (CHIME) catalogue using the $V_{\\rm max}$ method. The $V_{\\rm max}$\nmethod allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as\nit is without any prior assumption on the evolution.

The energy functions of\nnon-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at $z\\lesssim1$. The\nenergy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards\nhigher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is\nno significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic\nstellar-mass density evolution with a 1\\% significance threshold, whereas the\ncosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99\\%\nconfidence level.

Such constraints rely, by and large, on the existence\nof quasi-universal relations, which relate the peak frequencies of the\npost-merger GW spectrum to properties of the neutron star structure in a\nmodel-independent way. In this work, we report on violations of existing\nquasi-universal relations between the peak spectral frequency, f_2, and the\nstellar radius, for EoSs models with backwards-bending slopes in their\nmass-radius relations (such that the radius increases at high masses). The\nviolations are extreme, with variations in f_2 of up to ~600 Hz between EoSs\nthat predict the same radius for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, but that have\nsignificantly different radii at higher masses. Quasi-universality can be\nrestored by adding in a second parameter to the fitting formulae that depends\non the slope of the mass-radius curve. We further find strong evidence that\nquasi-universality is better maintained for the radii of very massive stars\n(with masses 2 Msun). Both statements imply that f_2 is mainly sensitive to the\nhigh-density EoS. Combined with observations of the binary neutron star\ninspiral, these generalized quasi-universal relations can be used to\nsimultaneously infer the characteristic radius and slope of the neutron star\nmass-radius relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 19:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 20:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

This\nrealization has sparked the creation of the MLIR compiler framework that\nempowers compiler engineers to design and integrate IRs capturing specific\nabstractions. MLIR provides a generic framework for SSA-based IRs, but it\ndoesn't help us to decide how we should design IRs that are easy to develop, to\nwork with and to combine into working compilers.\n  To address the challenge of IR design, we advocate for a language-oriented\ncompiler design that understands IRs as formal programming languages and\nenforces their correct use via an accompanying type system. We argue that\nprogramming language techniques directly guide extensible IR designs and\nprovide a formal framework to reason about transforming between multiple IRs.\nIn this paper, we discuss the design of the Shine compiler that compiles the\nhigh-level functional pattern-based data-parallel language RISE via a hybrid\nfunctional-imperative intermediate language to C, OpenCL, and OpenMP.\n  We compare our work directly with the closely related pattern-based Lift IR\nand compiler.

This major challenge highlights the\nneed for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a\nphysics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to\ngenerate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of\nthree-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of\nconvolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as\npreserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the\nvelocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical,\ncomparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is\nproduced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically\nstationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data\ncompression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary,\nisotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic\nturbulence, and a Taylor-Green vortex flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR)\nas the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that\nour model based on vector quantization can offer CR $=85$ with a mean square\nerror (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the\nstatistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some\nloss. Compared to the recent study based on a conventional autoencoder where\ncompression is performed in a continuous space, our model improves the CR by\nmore than $30$ percent, and reduces the MSE by an order of magnitude.

For example, chiral molecules like DNA generate giant spin\npolarization in nanodevices characterized by large magnetoresistance (MR). This\nphenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), paves pathways\nfor unconventional spintronic devices and enantiomer separation. Different from\nordinary transport, CISS MR violates Onsager's reciprocal relation, and its\nphysical mechanism is elusive and debated. In this work, we propose that the\nCISS MR is intimately related to the electric magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA)\nwhile EMCA respects Onsager's relation. In a molecular device including a\nferromagnetic electrode, the chiral molecule, as a spin polarizer, leads to\nEMCA in the second-order response to the electric field. However, EMCA further\ngenerates extra charge accumulation in the device given the insulating nature\nof the molecule. Here, reversing either electrode magnetization or molecule\nchirality changes the charge accumulation, which we term magnetochiral charge\npolarization (MCCP). Then MCCP modifies the tunneling barrier, alters the\ntunneling resistance sensitively, and thus, leads to a higher-order MR that\nviolates Onsager's reciprocity. Our model reveals the deep connection between\nEMCA and CISS MR and explains the unusually large MR ratio and nonequilibrium\nnature of CISS. We predict that the molecular spin valve device exhibits a\ncrossover from CISS-MR to EMCA when the chiral molecule turns more metallic\nbecause of losing the accumulated charge. We further anticipate CISS MR may\nappear in chiral molecular devices without ferromagnetic electrodes but in an\nexternal magnetic field in case EMCA and charge accumulation co-exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Indeed, the mixture of\ntributyltetradecylphosphonium chloride (P$_{44414}$Cl) and acid with water\ncontent larger than 60 \\% presents a phase separation with very good extraction\nefficiency for metallic ions. Moreover, this ternary solution presents a Lower\nSolution Critical Temperature (LCST), meaning that the biphasic area of the\nphase diagram increases upon increase of temperature, in other terms the phase\nseparation from a homogeneous liquid can be induced by an elevation of\ntemperature, typically a few tens of degrees. We address here the microscopic\nmechanisms driving the phase separation. Small Angle Neutron Scattering\nprovides us with structural information for various acid content and\ntemperature. We characterized the spherical micelle formation in the binary\nionic liquid/water solution and the micelle aggregation upon addition of acid,\ndue of the screening of electrostatic repulsion. If addition of salt leads to\nidentical transitions in the solution, the ionic strength is not a relevant\nparameter and more subtle effects such as ion size or polarizability have to be\ntaken into account to rationalize the phase diagram. The increase of both acid\nconcentration and/or temperature eventually leads to the micelle flocculation\nand phase separation. This last step is achieved through chloride ion\nadsorption at the surface of the micelle with an enthalpy of adsorption of\n$\\sim$ 12 kJ/mol. The attraction between micelles can be well understood in\nterms of DLVO potential. This exothermic adsorption compensates the entropic\ncost, leading to the counter-intuitive behavior of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Because of the success of conventional deep learning kernels,\nthe less versatile Gabor kernels become less popular despite the fact that they\ncan provide abundant features at different frequencies, orientations, and\nscales with much fewer parameters. For existing loss functions for multi-class\nimage segmentation, there is usually a tradeoff among accuracy, robustness to\nhyperparameters, and manual weight selections for combining different losses.\nTherefore, to gain the benefits of using Gabor kernels while keeping the\nadvantage of automatic feature generation in deep learning, we propose a fully\ntrainable Gabor-based convolutional layer where all Gabor parameters are\ntrainable through backpropagation. Furthermore, we propose a loss function\nbased on the Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is accurate, robust to\nlearning rates, and does not require manual weight selections. Experiments on\n43 3D brain magnetic resonance images with 19 anatomical structures show that,\nusing the proposed loss function with a proper combination of conventional and\nGabor-based kernels, we can train a network with only 1.6 million parameters to\nachieve an average Dice coefficient of 83%.

Based on the characteristics of systems with\nand without high obliquities, it is suspected that obliquities are tidally\ndamped when the star has a thick convective envelope, as is the case for\nmain-sequence stars cooler than ~6100K, and the orbit is within ~8 stellar\nradii. A promising theory for tidal obliquity damping is the dissipation of\ninertial waves within the star's convective envelope. Here, we consider the\nimplications of this theory for the timing of hot Jupiter formation.\nSpecifically, hot stars that currently lack a convective envelope possess one\nduring their pre-main sequence. We find that hot Jupiters orbiting within a\ncritical distance of ~0.02au from a misaligned main-sequence star lacking a\nthick convective envelope must have acquired their tight orbits after a few\ntens of millions of years in order to have retained their obliquities\nthroughout the pre-main-sequence. There are 4 known systems for which this\nargument applies--XO-3b, Corot-3b, WASP-14b, and WASP-121b--subject to\nuncertainties surrounding inertial wave dissipation. Moreover, we conclude that\na recently-identified overabundance of near-polar hot Jupiters is unlikely\nsculpted by tides, instead reflecting their primordial configuration. Finally,\nhot Jupiters arriving around cool stars after a few 100s of millions of years\nlikely find the host star rotating too slowly for efficient obliquity damping.\nWe predict that the critical effective temperature separating aligned and\nmisaligned stars should vary with metallicity, from 6300K to 6000K as [Fe/H]\nvaries from -0.3 to +0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 21:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness\nmeasures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the\npredictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals.\nIn counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been\nmodified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data,\nbut most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the\nsensitive attributes of each node's neighbors may causally affect the\nprediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect\nother features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which\nconsiders the biases led by the above facts. To learn node representations\ntowards graph counterfactual fairness, we propose a novel framework based on\ncounterfactual data augmentation. In this framework, we generate\ncounterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node's and their\nneighbors' sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the\ncounterfactuals for each node.

These spurious correlations, between input samples and the target\nlabels, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in poor\nperformance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training\nagainst these spurious correlations requires the knowledge of group membership\nfor every sample. Such a requirement is impractical in situations where the\ndata labeling efforts for minority or rare groups are significantly laborious\nor where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive\ninformation. On the other hand, the presence of such data collection efforts\nresults in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent\nworks have tackled the fully unsupervised scenario where no labels for groups\nare available. Thus, we aim to fill the missing gap in the literature by\ntackling a more realistic setting that can leverage partially available\nsensitive or group information during training.

However, the exact physical processes that result in a\ncoherent large-scale grain alignment are far from being constrained. Aims: In\nthis work, we aim to investigate the impact of a gas-dust drift leading to a\nmechanical alignment of dust (MAD) and to dust polarization. Methods: We\nexplore fractal dust aggregates to statistically analyze the average alignment\nbehavior of distinct grain ensembles. The spin-up efficiencies for individual\naggregates are determined utilizing MC simulations. These efficiencies are\nanalyzed to identify stable points for the grain alignment in direction of the\ngas-dust drift and along the magnetic field lines. Finally, the net dust\npolarization is calculated per grain ensemble. Results: The mechanical spin-up\nwithin the CNM is sufficient to drive grains to a stable alignment. A likely\nmechanical grain alignment is parallel to the drift direction. All grains can\nalign at subsonic conditions. Here, we predict a polarization efficiency in the\norder of unity for the MAD. A supersonic drift may result in a rapid rotation\nwhere dust grains may become rotationally disrupted and the polarization\nbecomes drastically reduced. In the presence of a magnetic field, the drift\nrequired for the alignment of elongated grains is roughly one order of\nmagnitude higher compared to the pure MAD.

Signalling is intimately\nconnected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving signals,\nhumans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past\nevents, predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and\ngenerate patterns that unfold in time. We investigate how different temporal\nprocesses impact coordination and signalling between learning agents by\nintroducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost\nHollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement\nlearning agent are coupled into a two-part decision-making system that works to\nacquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two\ndomain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear walk, and\nhuman-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results\nshowcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that\ndifferent temporal representations do (and do not) have on agent-agent\ncoordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent and human-agent\ninteractions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian\nsignalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully\nadaptive communication learning between two agents. We further show how to\ncomputationally build this adaptive signalling process out of a fixed\nsignalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and\nminimal constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results\ntherefore suggest an actionable, constructivist path towards communication\nlearning between reinforcement learning agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Large-scale online services often share or replicate their data into\nmultiple data centers (DCs) in different geographic regions. Driven by the data\ncommunication need of these applications, inter-datacenter network (IDN) is\ngetting increasingly important.\n  However, we find congestion control for inter-datacenter networks quite\nchallenging. Firstly, the inter-datacenter communication involves both data\ncenter networks (DCNs) and wide-area networks (WANs) connecting multiple data\ncenters. Such a network environment presents quite heterogeneous\ncharacteristics (e.g., buffer depths, RTTs). Existing congestion control\nmechanisms consider either DCN or WAN congestion, while not simultaneously\ncapturing the degree of congestion for both.\n  Secondly, to reduce evolution cost and improve flexibility, large enterprises\nhave been building and deploying their wide-area routers based on\nshallow-buffered switching chips. However, with legacy congestion control\nmechanisms (e.g., TCP Cubic), shallow buffer can easily get overwhelmed by\nlarge BDP (bandwidth-delay product) wide-area traffic, leading to high packet\nlosses and degraded throughput.\n  This thesis describes my research efforts on optimizing congestion control\nmechanisms for the inter-datacenter networks. First, we design GEMINI - a\npractical congestion control mechanism that simultaneously handles congestions\nboth in DCN andWAN. Second, we present FlashPass - a proactive congestion\ncontrol mechanism that achieves near zero loss without degrading throughput\nunder the shallow-buffered WAN.

Dominant role\nof thin film size effects is seen in setting the magnitude of static\nmagnetization, V_{dc} and dynamics of magnetization precession in thinner films\n(\\leq 8 nm). The film thickness dependence of magnetization parameters\nindicates the presence of a magnetically disordered region at the\nfilm-substrate interface, which may promote preferential flow of spins\ngenerated by the precessing magnetization towards the substrate. However, the\nV_{dc} signal also draws contributions from rectification effects of a \\approx\n0.4 \\% anisotropic magnetoresistance and a large (\\approx 54 n\\Omega.m)\nanomalous Hall resistivity (AHR) of these films which ride over the effect of\nspin-orbit coupling driven spin-to-charge conversion near the film-substrate\ninterface. We have addressed these data in the framework of the existing\ntheories of electrodynamics of a ferromagnetic film subjected to\nradio-frequency field in a coplanar waveguide geometry. Our estimation of the\nself-induced ISHE for the sample with 54 n\\Omega.m AHR shows that it may\ncontribute significantly (\\approx 90\\%) to the measured symmetric voltage. This\nstudy is expected to be very useful for fully understanding the spin pumping\ninduced dc voltages in metallic ferromagnets with disordered interfaces and\nlarge anomalous Hall effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 01:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

To achieve this, we leverage structural parallels between how\npeople express themselves through interactions and language by reformulating\nexisting theories as regular grammars. We represent interactions as terminals\nwithin a regular grammar, similar to the role of individual words in a\nlanguage, and patterns of interactions or non-terminals as regular expressions\nover these terminals to capture common language patterns. To demonstrate our\napproach, we generate regular grammars for seven visualization taxonomies and\ndevelop code to apply them to three interaction log datasets. In analyzing our\nresults, we find that existing taxonomies at the low-level (i.e., terminals)\nshow mixed results in expressing multiple interaction log datasets, and\ntaxonomies at the high-level (i.e., regular expressions) have limited\nexpressiveness, due to primarily two challenges: inconsistencies in interaction\nlog dataset granularity and structure, and under-expressiveness of certain\nterminals.

Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets\nthat may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon,\nwith only about one third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio\ndetections. Here we present over two years of comprehensive, multi-radio\nfrequency monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh taken\nwith the Very Large Array (VLA) and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately\n10 days pre-optical peak to 810 days post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual\nradio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over two years,\nand showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin\nsynchrotron emission from 450 days post-disruption. Based on the radio\nproperties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic\nand could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream\nintersections, or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion onto the\nsupermassive black hole. This data-set provides a significant contribution to\nthe observational database of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio\ndetection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 02:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

Exploiting\nparallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this\nand to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature\nintroduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract\ntransactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far\nfrom ideal.

Depending on the direction of\nthe dipoles, various types of supersolids (e.g. checkerboard, stripe) and\nsolids (checkerboard, stripe, diagonal stripe, and an incompressible phase) can\nbe stabilized. Remarkably, we find a cluster supersolid characterized by the\nformation of horizontal clusters of particles. These clusters order along a\ndirection at an angle with the horizontal. Moreover, we find what we call a\ngrain-boundary superfluid. In this phase, regions with solid order are\nseparated by extended defects -- grain boundaries -- which support\nsuperfluidity. We also investigate the robustness of the stripe supersolid\nagainst thermal fluctuations. Finally, we comment on the experimental\nrealization of the phases found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 02:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 03:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

SLAM and\nrotation averaging are typically formalized as large-scale nonconvex point\nestimation problems, with many bad local minima that can entrap the smooth\noptimization methods typically applied to solve them; the performance of\nstandard SLAM and RA algorithms thus crucially depends upon the quality of the\nestimates used to initialize this local search. While many initialization\nmethods for SLAM and RA have appeared in the literature, these are typically\nobtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it difficult to determine\nwhether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably\ndeployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization\nthrough the lens of spectral relaxation. Specifically, we derive a simple\nspectral relaxation of SLAM and RA, the form of which enables us to exploit\nclassical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to\ncontrol the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown)\nground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation problem as a function\nof measurement noise.

In this paper, we propose a novel Efficient\nNon-Local Contrastive Attention (ENLCA) to perform long-range visual modeling\nand leverage more relevant non-local features. Specifically, ENLCA consists of\ntwo parts, Efficient Non-Local Attention (ENLA) and Sparse Aggregation. ENLA\nadopts the kernel method to approximate exponential function and obtains linear\ncomputation complexity. For Sparse Aggregation, we multiply inputs by an\namplification factor to focus on informative features, yet the variance of\napproximation increases exponentially. Therefore, contrastive learning is\napplied to further separate relevant and irrelevant features. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ENLCA, we build an architecture called Efficient Non-Local\nContrastive Network (ENLCN) by adding a few of our modules in a simple\nbackbone. Extensive experimental results show that ENLCN reaches superior\nperformance over state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 05:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 03:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

We conduct experiments to characterize the dynamical transition\nutilizing acoustic pressure and local heat release rate fluctuations. We\nobserve the transition to thermoacoustic instability for these experiments as\nwe decrease the equivalence ratio towards a fuel-lean setting. More\nimportantly, we observe significant growth of local heat release rate\nfluctuations near the bluff-body well before the appearance of large-scale\nspatial or temporal patterns during the occurrence of thermoacoustic\ninstability. By strategically positioning slots (perforations) on the\nbluff-body, we ensure the reduction of the growth of local heat release rate\nfluctuations at the stagnation zone near the bluff-body at operating conditions\nfar away from the onset of thermoacoustic instability. This reduction in the\nlocal heat release rate fluctuations ensures that the transition to\nthermoacoustic instability is avoided. We find that modified configurations of\nthe bluff-body that do not quench these local heat release rate fluctuations at\nthe stagnation zone results in the transition to thermoacoustic instability.

Conditional IV\nhas been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IV by conditioning on a\nset of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV).\nHowever, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV\nneeds complete causal structure knowledge or a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nrepresenting the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved\nvariables. This makes it impossible to discover a conditioning set directly\nfrom data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) in\ncausal inference with latent variables, we propose a new type of IV, ancestral\nIV in MAG, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the\nconditioning set for a given ancestral IV in MAG. Based on the theory, we\ndevelop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with an ancestral IV\nin MAG and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets have demonstrated the performance of the algorithm in\ncomparison with existing IV methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 07:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Due to its low cost and high\npopularity, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been used to detect proximity based\non the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). To address the fact that RSSI\ncan be markedly influenced by device carriage states, previous works have\nincorporated RSSI with inertial measurement unit (IMU) using deep learning.\nHowever, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of multipath.\nFurthermore, due to the special setup, the IMU data collected in the training\nprocess may be biased, which hampers the system's robustness and\ngeneralizability. This issue has not been studied before. We propose PRID, an\nIMU-assisted BLE proximity detection approach robust against RSSI fluctuation\nand IMU data bias.

For three topologically different chains, namely, linear, ring,\nand trefoil-knot of same molecular weight the effect of varying both\npolymer--fluid and fluid--fluid interaction nature on the width of the fluid\ninterface, chain conformation, shape, and chain dynamics. For sharp-interface\nbinary-fluid system, the interface width is insensitive to both topology and\npolymer-fluid interaction nature, while a weak non-monotonic variation is seen\nfor weak-interface system. Chain extension normal to the interface plane is\nsignificantly affected by the topology with trefoil-knot chain, due to the\nadditional constraint, has the largest value compared to both linear and ring\npolymers. Instantaneous shapes are also quantified through shape parameters.\nFurthermore, it is observed that the qualitative behavior of center of mass\nmean-square displacement (MSD) is independent of topology, i.e., all the chain\ntypes show same diffusion exponent $\\alpha~(\\approx 1)$. However, the\nself-diffusion constant depends on the topology and it is largest for\ntrefoil-knot chain. An interesting observation pertaining the early time\nbehavior of monomeric-MSD is that, within the sub-diffusive regime, the values\nof $\\alpha$ for different parameters (independent of topology) are grouped into\ntwo distinct ranges (0.52--0.59 and 0.62--0.67) which is related to the\ndifferent chain conformation for polymer-fluid interaction range below and\nabove a threshold value equal to that of the self-interaction of the pure fluid\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 08:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

This begins with basic statistical treatment,\nbriefly reviews frequency and modal analysis, and conclude with more advanced\nresearch topics such as multiscale modal decompositions and nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction. The material covered should hopefully propel\nnewcomers into the subject while remaining of interest to experienced\npractitioners. All the codes related to this lecture are made available on a\ngithub repository.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 09:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

For decades the cycle variation of the magnetic field in the\nphotosphere has been investigated. To present, there is no study to show the\nevolution of the coronal magnetic flux in the corona, nor the evolution of\nsolar cycle magnetic free energy. The paper aims to analyze the temporal\nvariation of the magnetic field and free magnetic energy in the solar corona\nfor the solar cycle 24 and how the magnetic field behaves in the two\nhemispheres. We investigate if we can obtain better estimates of the magnetic\nfield at Earth using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation\nmethod. To model the magnetic field over cycle 24 we apply the NLFFF\noptimization method to the synoptic vector magnetic maps derived from the\nobservations of Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamic\nObservatory (SDO). We found that during the solar cycle 24, the maximum of the\nSun's dynamics is different from the sunspot number (SSN) maximum peak. The\nmajor contribution to the total unsigned flux is provided by the flux coming\nfrom the magnetic field structures other than sunspots (MSOS) within latitudes\nbetween -30 and +30 degrees. The magnetic flux variation during the solar cycle\n24 shows a different evolution in the corona than in the photosphere. We found\na correlation value of 0.8 between the derived magnetic energy from our model\nand the flare energy index derived from observations. On average, cycle 24 had\na higher number of sunspots in the northern hemisphere (NH) but stronger flux\nin the southern hemisphere (SH) which could more effectively reach the higher\nlayers of the atmosphere. The coupling between the hemispheres increases with\nheight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 09:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-23"}

Most pioneering approaches reduce intra-class variations and\ninter-modality discrepancies by learning modality-shared and ID-related\nfeatures. However, an explicit modality-shared cue, i.e., body keypoints, has\nnot been fully exploited in VI-ReID. Additionally, existing feature learning\nparadigms imposed constraints on either global features or partitioned feature\nstripes, which neglect the prediction consistency of global and part features.\nTo address the above problems, we exploit Pose Estimation as an auxiliary\nlearning task to assist the VI-ReID task in an end-to-end framework. By jointly\ntraining these two tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, our model learns\nhigher quality modality-shared and ID-related features. On top of it, the\nlearnings of global features and local features are seamlessly synchronized by\nHierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), where the former supervises the latter\nusing the knowledge distillation strategy.

In this work, we\ndiscuss in particular the interactions of dark matter particles with protons\nand neutrons of $^{6}$Li.

To generalize to new speakers, previous zero-shot\nsinging adaptation methods obtain the timbre of the target speaker with a\nfixed-size embedding from single reference audio. However, they face several\nchallenges: 1) the fixed-size speaker embedding is not powerful enough to\ncapture full details of the target timbre; 2) single reference audio does not\ncontain sufficient timbre information of the target speaker; 3) the pitch\ninconsistency between different speakers also leads to a degradation in the\ngenerated voice. In this paper, we propose a new model called MR-SVS to tackle\nthese problems. Specifically, we employ both a multi-reference encoder and a\nfixed-size encoder to encode the timbre of the target speaker from multiple\nreference audios. The Multi-reference encoder can capture more details and\nvariations of the target timbre. Besides, we propose a well-designed pitch\nshift method to address the pitch inconsistency problem.

However, the SE front-end\ngenerates processing artifacts that can degrade the ASR performance. We\npreviously found that such performance degradation can occur even under fully\noverlapping conditions, depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To mitigate the degradation, we introduced a\nrule-based method to switch the ASR input between the enhanced and observed\nsignals, which showed promising results. However, the rule's optimality was\nunclear because it was heuristically designed and based only on SIR and SNR\nvalues. In this work, we propose a DNN-based switching method that directly\nestimates whether ASR will perform better on the enhanced or observed signals.\nWe also introduce soft-switching that computes a weighted sum of the enhanced\nand observed signals for ASR input, with weights given by the switching model's\noutput posteriors. The proposed learning-based switching showed performance\ncomparable to that of rule-based oracle switching. The soft-switching further\nimproved the ASR performance and achieved a relative character error rate\nreduction of up to 23 % as compared with the conventional method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 10:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

As job sizes are more variable in real\nsystems, we investigate how the performance of these policies (and in\nparticular the value of these bounds) is impacted by the job size distribution.\n  We present a unified analysis which can be used to compute the bound on the\nqueue length in case of phase-type distributed job sizes for four load\nbalancing policies.

Mobile sinks roam in the network and collect\ndata from special nodes such as Cluster Heads (CH) by means of short-range\ncommunications which improves the energy efficiency. Numerous mobile sink based\nrouting protocols have been proposed, however, they incur high delays\nespecially in large scale networks where the mobile sink has to travel for a\nlong distance to collect data from CHs and consequently they failed to ensure a\ntradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. To resolve this issue, we propose\nin this paper an Effective Hybrid Routing Protocol termed as EHRP. The main aim\nof this protocol is to combine between single-hop and multi-hop routing.\nIndeed, when the mobile sink arrives at a cluster it collects its data while\nthe other distant CHs continue to send their data using our proposed improved\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to avoid the waiting-time. The existing\nACO algorithms use in the distance heuristic which is not practical in real\nworld and fail to consider relevant statistic information of energy (e.g.,\nminimum energy, average energy) in path selection which leads to unbalanced\nenergy consumption in the network. To address these issues, the proposed\nrouting algorithm employs the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and\nstatistic information of energy to consume energy efficiently and decrease the\nprobability of sending failure. The performance of the proposed routing\nprotocol is tested and compared with those of the relevant routing protocols.\nThe simulation results show that, in comparison with its counterparts, EHRP\nsucceeds to minimize energy consumption and delay as well as enhancing the\npacket delivery ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 12:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

At the interface between intra-and\nextracellular media, the fluxes are given by nonlinear functions of ionic and\napplied currents. A rigorous homogenization process based on unfolding\noperators is applied to derive the macroscopic (homogenized) model from our\nmeso-microscopic bidomain model. We apply a three-scale unfolding method in the\nintracellular problem to obtain its homogenized equation at two levels. The\nfirst level upscaling of the intracellular structure yields the mesoscopic\nequation. The second step of the homogenization leads to obtain the\nintracellular homogenized equation. To prove the convergence of the nonlinear\nterms, especially those defined on the microscopic interface, we use the\nboundary unfolding method and a Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness's result. Next, we\nuse the standard unfolding method to homogenize the extracellular problem.\nFinally, we obtain, at the limit, a reaction-diffusion system on a single\ndomain (the superposition of the intracellular and extracellular media) which\ncontains the homogenized equations depending on three scales.

In this optimized design, the beam\nsmoothing is not simply executed in the pre-compressor or main-compressor, but\nseparated into multistage. Then, it can protect important optics in every stage\ndirectly and reduce the executing difficult of typical MPC at the same time.\nThe prism pair based pre-compressor will induce suitable spatial dispersion\nwhich is easier to be achieved and enough to protect the first grating\ndirectly. At the same time, the asymmetric four-grating compressor (AFGC) will\nalso induce spatial dispersion to further smooth the laser beam which helps to\nprotect the last grating directly. In this way, 10s-100s PW lasers can be\ncompressed by using current available optics with improved operating safety\nowing to remove random spatial intensity modulations. Furthermore, an\nadditional beam smoothing stage can be added before the main amplifier to\nprotect the biggest amplification crystal away from damage.

The effects of water droplet mass flow rate on flow\nand chemical structures in the induction zone, as well as physical / chemical\nroles of water vapor, are investigated. The results show that the oblique\ndetonation wave (ODW) can stand in a range of water mass flow rates for both\nstoichiometric and fuel-lean mixtures. With increased droplet mass flow rate,\nthe deflagration front in the induction zone is distorted and becomes\nzigzagged, but the transition mode from oblique shock wave (OSW) to ODW does\nnot change. Moreover, the initiation and transition locations monotonically\nincrease, and the OSW and ODW angles decrease, due to droplet evaporation and\nwater vapor dilution in the induction region. For fuel-lean mixtures, the\nsensitivity of characteristic locations to the droplet loading variations is\nmild, which signifies better intrinsic stability and resilience to the oncoming\nwater droplets. The chemical explosiveness of the gaseous mixture between the\nlead shock and reaction front is studied with the chemical explosive method\nanalysis. The smooth transition is caused by the highly enhanced reactivity of\nthe gas immediately behind the curved shock, intensified by the compression\nwaves. Nonetheless, the abrupt transition results from the intersection between\nthe beforehand generated detonation wave in the induction zone and OSW.\nBesides, the degree to which the gas chemical reactivity in the induction zone\nfor fuel-lean mixtures is reduced by evaporating droplets is generally lower\nthan that for stoichiometric gas. Also, physical and chemical effects of water\nvapor from liquid droplets result in significant differences in ODW initiation\nand morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The\nstudy of Ap stars that have rotation periods of tens to hundreds of years\nrepresents a promising avenue to gain additional insight into the origin and\nevolution of rotation in Ap stars.\n  Historically, almost all the longest period Ap stars known have been found to\nbe strongly magnetic; very few weakly magnetic Ap stars with very long periods\nhave been identified and studied. We performed a systematic search based on\nTESS data to identify super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars independently of\nthe strengths of their magnetic fields, with the intention to characterise the\ndistribution of the longest Ap star rotation periods in an unbiased manner. We\nfind 67 Ap stars with no rotational variability in the northern ecliptic\nhemisphere TESS data.

We present new evidence of\nthe existence of a gap between ~2 kG and ~3 kG in the distribution of the\nmagnetic field strengths of long period Ap stars. We also confirm that the\nincidence of roAp stars is higher than average in slowly rotating Ap stars.

The distinct\ngrowth behaviors between edge and basal plane of ice are one of the central\ntopics in ice growth. And the unidirectional freezing pattern stems from\nperturbations of both basal and edge planes. To date there is no direct\ncomparison of unidirectional freezing behavior between basal and edge plane\nice. Here, we in-situ investigate the planar instability as well as the\nunidirectional freezing pattern of basal and edge planes of ice by a design of\nparallel freezing samples with specified ice orientations in a NaCl solution as\na modeled sea water. The planar instability is discussed via neutral stability\ncurves with surface tension anisotropy for both basal and edge plane ice. For\nthe first time, we realize the simultaneous observation of solid/liquid\ninterfaces of basal and edge plane ice under the same set of freezing\nconditions. The results show that planar instability occurs faster for edge\nplane ice than basal plane ice. The time-lapse observations confirm a transient\ncompetitive interaction of perturbations between the basal and edge planes ice,\nwhich is explained by the anisotropic growth of perturbations in basal and edge\nplanes of ice. These experimental results provide a link between morphology\nevolution of unidirectional grown sea ice and different ice orientations and\nare suggested to enrich our understanding of sea ice growth as well as\ncrystallization pattern of other anisotropic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The performances\nof traditional classifiers will be severely affected by many data problems,\nsuch as class imbalanced problem, class overlap and noise. The Tomek-Link\nalgorithm was only used to clean data when it was proposed. In recent years,\nthere have been reports of combining Tomek-Link algorithm with sampling\ntechnique. The Tomek-Link sampling algorithm can effectively reduce the class\noverlap on data, remove the majority instances that are difficult to\ndistinguish, and improve the algorithm classification accuracy. However, the\nTomek-Links under-sampling algorithm only considers the boundary instances that\nare the nearest neighbors to each other globally and ignores the potential\nlocal overlapping instances. When the number of minority instances is small,\nthe under-sampling effect is not satisfactory, and the performance improvement\nof the classification model is not obvious. Therefore, on the basis of\nTomek-Link, a multi-granularity relabeled under-sampling algorithm (MGRU) is\nproposed. This algorithm fully considers the local information of the data set\nin the local granularity subspace, and detects the local potential overlapping\ninstances in the data set. Then, the overlapped majority instances are\neliminated according to the global relabeled index value, which effectively\nexpands the detection range of Tomek-Links. The simulation results show that\nwhen we select the optimal global relabeled index value for under-sampling, the\nclassification accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed\nunder-sampling algorithm are significantly better than other baseline\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Here we explore one such\ntechnique to address an important problem in quantum communication scenario.\nWhile transferring quantum information through a noisy quantum channel, the\nutility of the channel is characterized by its quantum capacity. Quantum\nchannels, however, display an intriguing property called super-additivity of\ncoherent information. This makes the calculation of quantum capacity a hard\ncomputational problem involving optimization over an exponentially increasing\nsearch space. In this work, we first utilize a neural network ansatz to\nrepresent quantum states and then apply an evolutionary optimization scheme to\naddress this problem. We find regions in the three-parameter space of qubit\nPauli channels where coherent information exhibits this super-additivity\nfeature. We characterised the quantum codes that achieves high coherent\ninformation, finding several non-trivial quantum codes that outperforms the\nrepetition codes for some Pauli channels. For some Pauli channels, these codes\ndisplays very high super-additivity of the order of 0.01, much higher than the\nobserved values in other well studied quantum channels. We further compared the\nlearning performance of the Neural Network ansatz with the raw ansatz to find\nthat in the three-shot case, the neural network ansatz outperforms the raw\nrepresentation in finding quantum codes of high coherent information. We also\ncompared the learning performance of the evolutionary algorithm with a simple\nParticle Swarm Optimisation scheme and show empirical results indicating\ncomparable performance, suggesting that the Neural Network ansatz coupled with\nthe evolutionary scheme is indeed a promising approach to finding non-trivial\nquantum codes of high coherent information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 05:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Specifically, time-ineffective\nrecharging operations limit the profitability of charging during service\noperations such that operators recharge vehicles off-duty at a central depot.\nHere, high investment cost and grid capacity limit available charging\ninfrastructure such that operators need to schedule charging operations to keep\nthe fleet operational. In this context, flexible service operations, i.e.\nallowing to delay or expedite vehicle departures, can potentially increase\ncharger utilization. Beyond this, jointly scheduling charging and service\noperations promises operational cost savings through better utilization of\nTime-of-Use energy tariffs and carefully crafted charging schedules designed to\nminimize battery wear. Against this background, we study the resulting joint\ncharging and service operations scheduling problem accounting for battery\ndegradation, non-linear charging, and Time-of-Use energy tariffs.

In particular, the\nthreats could be excessively amplified by transitive dependencies. Existing\nresearch either considers direct dependencies or reasoning transitive\ndependencies based on reachability analysis, which neglects the NPM-specific\ndependency resolution rules, resulting in wrongly resolved dependencies.\nConsequently, further fine-grained analysis, such as vulnerability propagation\nand their evolution in dependencies, cannot be carried out precisely at a large\nscale, as well as deriving ecosystem-wide solutions for vulnerabilities in\ndependencies. To fill this gap, we propose a knowledge graph-based dependency\nresolution, which resolves the dependency relations of dependencies as trees\n(i.e., dependency trees), and investigates the security threats from\nvulnerabilities in dependency trees at a large scale. We first construct a\ncomplete dependency-vulnerability knowledge graph (DVGraph) that captures the\nwhole NPM ecosystem (over 10 million library versions and 60 million\nwell-resolved dependency relations). Based on it, we propose DTResolver to\nstatically and precisely resolve dependency trees, as well as transitive\nvulnerability propagation paths, by considering the official dependency\nresolution rules. Based on that, we carry out an ecosystem-wide empirical study\non vulnerability propagation and its evolution in dependency trees. Our study\nunveils lots of useful findings, and we further discuss the lessons learned and\nsolutions for different stakeholders to mitigate the vulnerability impact in\nNPM. For example, we implement a dependency tree based vulnerability\nremediation method (DTReme) for NPM packages, and receive much better\nperformance than the official tool (npm audit fix).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 13:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast,\nsimple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring\nelectrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often\nneed to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on\nimproving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG\nclassification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can\nlearn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect\nabnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to\ngeneralize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which\ndrop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine\nlearning algorithms suffer a \"black-box\" issue, in which it is difficult to\ndetermine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in\nhealthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation\nin order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing\nmodel decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using\nadapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what\npatterns are being learned.

Here, a\nscheme of designing ultrathin and all-angle retroreflectors based on hyperbolic\nplasmonic metasurfaces is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The\nphysical mechanism underlying this scheme is the high-efficiency all-angle\ntransition between the traveling waves in free space and the canalized spoof\nsurface plasmon (SSP) on the hyperbolic plasmonic metasurfaces (HPMs). In this\ncase, the strong confinement characteristic benefited from the enhanced\nlight-matter interaction enables us to route and retroreflect the canalized SSP\nwith extremely ultrathin structures.

Nowadays, a generative model\nnamed variational autoencoder (VAE) has got wide acceptance in DC studies.\nNevertheless, the plain VAE is insufficient to perceive the comprehensive\nlatent features, leading to the deteriorative clustering performance. In this\npaper, a novel DC method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, the\ngenerative adversarial network and VAE are coalesced into a new autoencoder\ncalled fusion autoencoder (FAE) for discerning more discriminative\nrepresentation that benefits the downstream clustering task.

We present a method\nto discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting\ntopological features. These features are extracted from domain-specific\nknowledge as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different\nlocations and eventually find roads with analogous daily traffic profiles based\non the similarity between embeddings. The performance of this novel selection\nsystem is examined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After\nfinding a similar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize\ntraffic profiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the\nsensed road, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only.\nSeveral generation approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the\nsynthesized samples. Above all, this work intends to stimulate further research\nefforts towards enhancing the quality of synthetic traffic samples and thereby,\nreducing the need for sensing infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 15:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 15:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

The\nsecond of these QCF is important for describing the correlations between the\npositions of the fermionic atoms in two Cooper pairs, which is expected to be\nsmall at the BEC or BCS sides of the crossover, but is expected to be\nsignificant in the strong interaction unitary regime, where the size of a\nCooper pair is comparable to the separation between Cooper pairs. In GPST the\nQCF are ultimately given via the stochastic average of products of Grassmann\nstochastic momentum fields, and GPST shows that the stochastic average of the\nproducts of Grassmann stochastic momentum fields at a later time (or lower\ntemperature) is related linearly to the stochastic average of the products of\nGrassmann stochastic momentum fields at an earlier time (or higher\ntemperature), and that the matrix elements involved in the linear relations are\nall c-numbers.

We\ncan easily represent multi-attribute data more compactly on a classical\ncomputer by replacing one-hot encoding with label encoding. However, replacing\nthese encoding schemes on a QC is not straightforward as PQM and P-PQM operate\nat the quantum bit level.\n  We present an enhanced P-PQM, called EP-PQM, that allows label encoding of\ndata stored in a PQM data structure and reduces the circuit depth of the data\nstorage and retrieval procedures. We show implementations for an ideal QC and a\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device.\n  Our complexity analysis shows that the EP-PQM approach requires $O\\left(z\n\\log_2(a)\\right)$ qubits as opposed to $O(za)$ qubits for P-PQM. EP-PQM also\nrequires fewer gates, reducing gate count from $O\\left(rza\\right)$ to\n$O\\left(rz\\log_2(a)\\right)$.\n  For five datasets, we demonstrate that training an ML classification model\nusing EP-PQM requires 48% to 77% fewer qubits than P-PQM for datasets with\n$a>2$. EP-PQM reduces circuit depth in the range of 60% to 96%, depending on\nthe dataset. The depth decreases further with a decomposed circuit, ranging\nbetween 94% and 99%.\n  EP-PQM requires less space; thus, it can train on and classify larger\ndatasets than previous PQM implementations on NISQ devices. Furthermore,\nreducing the number of gates speeds up the classification and reduces the noise\nassociated with deep quantum circuits.

Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to\nfully understanding how radiation interacts with biologically relevant cellular\ncomponents to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the difficulty faced by\nmembers of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple\nMonte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA\nscale, while at the same time various groups have developed models that\ndescribe DNA repair processes with varying levels of detail. These repair\nmodels are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their\ndevelopment, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either\npart of the modelling chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track\nstructure Monte Carlo simulations of the physics interactions creating direct\ndamages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production and initial\nreactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage\ninduction, DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with\nbiological models to determine the biological consequences of the damage. We\npropose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify the interface\nbetween the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell\nrepair processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons,\nproviding an ideal environment to tease out model assumptions and identify\npersistent, underlying mechanisms.

It turns out that although representing a couple by\nits moment vector is very useful in rigid body mechanics and strength of\nmaterials, it has been very misleading in continuum mechanics. To specify the\neffect of a concentrated couple in continuum mechanics, not only the couple\nmoment, but also the line of action of its constituent parallel opposite forces\nmust be specified. However, in the governing equations of equilibrium or motion\nof a continuum, only moment of body couple, moment of couple-tractions, and\nmoment of couple-stresses appear without specifying the line of action of any\ncouple density forces. This results in non-uniqueness of the state of stresses\nand deformation in the continuum, which has shown itself in the indeterminacy\nof the couple-stress tensor. Nevertheless, the physical state of stress and\ndeformation in the continuum is unique and determinate. Therefore, this imposes\nsome restrictions on the form of body couple, couple-traction and\ncouple-stresses. Here, the uniqueness of interactions in the continuum is used\nto establish that the continuum does not support a distribution of body couple,\nand a distribution of surface twisting couple-traction with normal moment. From\nthis the mechanism of action of the couple-traction as a double layer of shear\nforce-tractions, and the skew-symmetric character of the couple-stress moment\ntensor in continuum mechanics are also established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}
