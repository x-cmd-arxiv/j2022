Recently a new\nPIML architecture was reported by the same authors, known as Opportunistic\nPhysics-mining Transfer Mapping Architecture or OPTMA, which transfers the\noriginal inputs into latent features using a transfer neural network; the\npartial physics model then uses the latent features to generate the final\noutput that is as close as possible to the high-fidelity output.

Such a description also naturally allows\nauto-differentiation (AD) of the partial physics model, thereby enabling the\nuse of efficient back-propagation methods to train the transfer network.

The semisolid magnetization is usually modeled as\nbeing purely longitudinal, with the applied $B_1^+$ field saturating but not\nrotating its magnetization, thus standard pTx pulse design methods do not\napply. Theory and Methods: Pulse design for Saturation Homogeneity (PUSH)\noptimizes pTx RF pulses by considering uniformity of root-mean squared $B_1^+$,\n$B_1^{rms}$, which relates to the rate of semisolid saturation.

Unfortunately, it has been shown that\nML-based systems are vulnerable to an attack technique referred to as\nadversarial machine learning (AML). This special kind of attack has already\nbeen demonstrated in recent studies and in multiple domains. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic AML threat analysis for O-RAN. We start by reviewing\nrelevant ML use cases and analyzing the different ML workflow deployment\nscenarios in O-RAN. Then, we define the threat model, identifying potential\nadversaries, enumerating their adversarial capabilities, and analyzing their\nmain goals. Next, we explore the various AML threats associated with O-RAN and\nreview a large number of attacks that can be performed to realize these threats\nand demonstrate an AML attack on a traffic steering model. In addition, we\nanalyze and propose various AML countermeasures for mitigating the identified\nthreats. Finally, based on the identified AML threats and countermeasures, we\npresent a methodology and a tool for performing risk assessment for AML attacks\nfor a specific ML use case in O-RAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 17:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 17:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In doing so, we learn\nthree networks underpinning the VAR process, namely a directed network\nrepresenting the Granger causal linkages between the variables, an undirected\none embedding their contemporaneous relationships and finally, an undirected\nnetwork that summarises both lead-lag and contemporaneous linkages. In\naddition, FNETS provides a suite of methods for forecasting the factor-driven\nand the idiosyncratic VAR processes. Under general conditions permitting tails\nheavier than the Gaussian one, we derive uniform consistency rates for the\nestimators in both network estimation and forecasting, which hold as the\ndimension of the panel and the sample size diverge. Simulation studies and real\ndata application confirm the good performance of FNETS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 18:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 11:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 10:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Human displacement or migration in the world is highly affected by\nequivalent weighted wealth and multidimensional poverty distribution across\ncountries. In this work, it has been shown that the equivalent weighted wealth\nas an important characteristic of a society can be introduced in a mathematical\nlanguage in terms of a country gross productivity factor, safety and social\nfactors, environmental and economic factors, political and healthy factors,\neducational and cultural factors and so on using some weights, where these\nweights can be determined using regression or machine learning techniques.

Some critical\nconditions such as earthquakes, war, famine, insecurity, and more prevent the\nnatural transmission of wealth and lead to the intensification of\nnon-uniformity in wealth distribution. The increase in the equivalent weighted\nwealth difference between countries leads to an enhanced legal migration rate\nas well as a boosted illegal migration flow rate where it exceeds a threshold\nvalue. The introduced nature-inspired model could significantly predict wealth\ndistribution as well as migration rate, which will have helped those who try to\nhave a world with a logical almost uniform equivalent weighted wealth\ndistribution and will have made the world a better place for all of the people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 19:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Recently, reconstruction-based spectrometers have gained\npopularity for their compact size, easy maneuverability, and versatile\nutilities. These devices exploit the superior computational capabilities of\nrecent computers to reconstruct hyperspectral images using detectors with\ndistinct responsivity to different wavelengths. In this paper, we propose a\nCMOS compatible reconstruction-based on-chip spectrometer pixels capable of\nspectrally resolving the visible spectrum with 1 nm spectral resolution\nmaintaining high accuracy (>95 %) and low footprint (8 um x 8 um), all without\nthe use of any additional filters. A single spectrometer pixel is formed by an\narray of silicon photodiodes, each having a distinct absorption spectrum due to\ntheir integrated nanostructures, this allows us to computationally reconstruct\nthe hyperspectral image. To achieve distinct responsivity, we utilize random\nphoton-trapping nanostructures per photodiode with different dimensions and\nshapes that modify the coupling of light at different wavelengths. This also\nreduces the spectrometer pixel footprint (comparable to conventional camera\npixels), thus improving spatial resolution. Moreover, deep trench isolation\n(DTI) reduces the crosstalk between adjacent photodiodes. This miniaturized\nspectrometer can be utilized for real-time in-situ biomedical applications such\nas Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), pulse oximetry, disease\ndiagnostics, and surgical guidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 23:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The two frameworks account for the AVs'\ntwo types of action spaces, i.e., finite and continuous action spaces,\nrespectively.

Specifically, a saliency detection\nalgorithm based on a novel attention model is proposed for identifying\nsubsurface structures within seismic data volumes. The algorithm employs 3D-FFT\nand a multi-dimensional spectral projection, which decomposes local spectra\ninto three distinct components, each depicting variations along different\ndimensions of the data. Subsequently, a novel directional center-surround\nattention model is proposed to incorporate directional comparisons around each\nvoxel for saliency detection within each projected dimension. Next, the\nresulting saliency maps along each dimension are combined adaptively to yield a\nconsolidated saliency map, which highlights various structures characterized by\nsubtle variations and relative motion with respect to their neighboring\nsections. A priori information about the seismic data can be either embedded\ninto the proposed attention model in the directional comparisons, or\nincorporated into the algorithm by specifying a template when combining\nsaliency maps adaptively. Experimental results on two real seismic datasets\nfrom the North Sea, Netherlands and Great South Basin, New Zealand demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for detecting salient seismic\nstructures of different natures and appearances in one shot, which differs\nsignificantly from traditional seismic interpretation algorithms. The results\nfurther demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms comparable\nstate-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms for natural images and videos,\nwhich are inadequate for seismic imaging data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 01:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We generate Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states\nat the wavelength of 1545 nm with Wigner negativity using a quasi-single-mode\nZnO-doped periodically poled ${\\rm LiNbO_3}$ waveguide module we developed.\nWigner negativity is regarded as an important indicator of the usefulness of\nthe quantum states as it is essential in the fault-tolerant universal quantum\ncomputation. Our result shows that our waveguide OPA can be used in wide range\nof quantum applications leading to a THz-clock optical quantum computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 02:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

However, despite their success in the\nconventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on\ngraph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which\nis specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the\ndiscreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while\nretaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To\naddress such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor\nis activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve\nthe model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus,\nwhen the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under\nthese settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the\ntrigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution\nBackdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can\nbe viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of\nGCNs.

Via applying dynamic excitations and tailoring\nthe excitation conditions, reversible transitions between all stable\nconfigurations become attainable, generating a fully-connected transition map.\nBenefiting from the nonlinearity of the quasi-static and dynamic transitions,\nbasic and compound mechanical logic gates are achieved. The versatility of the\nscheme is demonstrated by employing a single SMOV structure to realize\ndifferent complex logic operations without increasing structural complexity,\nshowing its superior computing power and inspiring the avenue for efficient\nphysical intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 05:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

To explore this, we first\nintroduce the notion of training plasticity to quantify the training progress\nof internal DNN layers.

In real-world applications, the distribution of a target\npopulation can be different from that of the source population. Therefore,\ntreatment regimes learned by existing methods may not generalize well to the\ntarget population. Due to privacy concerns and other practical issues,\nindividual-level data from the target population is often not available, which\nmakes treatment regime learning more challenging. We consider the problem of\ntreatment regime estimation when the source and target populations may be\nheterogeneous, individual-level data is available from the source population,\nand only the summary information of covariates, such as moments, is accessible\nfrom the target population. We develop a weighting framework that tailors a\ntreatment regime for a given target population by leveraging the available\nsummary statistics.

In this work, we propose factorizing the joint team\npolicy into a graph generator and graph-based coordinated policy to enable\ncoordinated behaviours among agents. The graph generator adopts an\nencoder-decoder framework that outputs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to\ncapture the underlying dynamic decision structure. We also apply the\nDAGness-constrained and DAG depth-constrained optimization in the graph\ngenerator to balance efficiency and performance. The graph-based coordinated\npolicy exploits the generated decision structure. The graph generator and\ncoordinated policy are trained simultaneously to maximize the discounted\nreturn. Empirical evaluations on Collaborative Gaussian Squeeze, Cooperative\nNavigation, and Google Research Football demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In practice, it may be intractable to\ncollect the perfect homologous data in some cases, for example, audio-corrupted\nor picture-blurry videos. To explore this kind of data and support\nhigh-fidelity few-shot visual dubbing, in this paper, we novelly propose a\nsimple yet efficient two-stage framework with a higher flexibility of mining\nheterogeneous data. Specifically, our two-stage paradigm employs facial\nlandmarks as intermediate prior of latent representations and disentangles the\nlip movements prediction from the core task of realistic talking head\ngeneration. By this means, our method makes it possible to independently\nutilize the training corpus for two-stage sub-networks using more available\nheterogeneous data easily acquired. Besides, thanks to the disentanglement, our\nframework allows a further fine-tuning for a given talking head, thereby\nleading to better speaker-identity preserving in the final synthesized results.\nMoreover, the proposed method can also transfer appearance features from others\nto the target speaker. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method in generating highly realistic videos\nsynchronized with the speech over the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 07:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

It is also\nassumed that the recuperated individuals from the native strain can be infected\nwith mutant strain through the direct contact with individual or contaminated\nsurfaces or aerosols. We compute the basic reproduction number for each strain\nindependently and take the maximum for $R_0$. We prove the nonexistence of\nbackward bifurcation using the center manifold theory, and global stability of\ndisease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number $R_0<1. An\nintermediate mutation rate $\\nu_1$ leads to oscillations. When $\\nu_1$\nincreases over a threshold, the system regains its stability and exhibits an\ninteresting dynamics called endemic bubble.

In this paper, we introduce CLEAR, the first continual image\nclassification benchmark dataset with a natural temporal evolution of visual\nconcepts in the real world that spans a decade (2004-2014).

The optimal computation-communication tradeoff has\nbeen well studied for homogeneous systems, and some results have been obtained\nunder heterogeneous conditions. However, the existing schemes require delicate\ndata placement and output function assignment, which is not feasible in some\npractical scenarios when distributed nodes fetch data without the orchestration\nof a central server. In this paper, we consider the general heterogeneous\ndistributed computing systems where the data placement and output function\nassignment are arbitrary but pre-set (i.e., cannot be designed by schemes). For\nthis general heterogeneous setup, we propose two coded computing schemes,\nOne-Shot Coded Transmission (OSCT) and Few-Shot Coded Transmission (FSCT), to\nreduce the communication load. These two schemes first group the nodes into\nclusters and divide the transmission of each cluster into multiple rounds, and\nthen design coded transmission in each round to maximize the multicast gain.\nThe key difference between OSCT and FSCT is that the former uses a one-shot\ntransmission where each encoded message can be decoded independently by the\nintended nodes, while the latter allows each node to jointly decode multiple\nreceived symbols to achieve potentially larger multicast gains. Furthermore,\nwith theoretical converse proofs, we derive sufficient conditions for the\noptimality of OSCT and FSCT, respectively.

An effective approach is to select informative content from\nthe holistic video, yielding a popular family of dynamic video recognition\nmethods. However, existing dynamic methods focus on either temporal or spatial\nselection independently while neglecting a reality that the redundancies are\nusually spatial and temporal, simultaneously. Moreover, their selected content\nis usually cropped with fixed shapes, while the realistic distribution of\ninformative content can be much more diverse. With these two insights, this\npaper proposes to integrate temporal and spatial selection into an Action\nKeypoint Network (AK-Net). From different frames and positions, AK-Net selects\nsome informative points scattered in arbitrary-shaped regions as a set of\naction keypoints and then transforms the video recognition into point cloud\nclassification. AK-Net has two steps, i.e., the keypoint selection and the\npoint cloud classification. First, it inputs the video into a baseline network\nand outputs a feature map from an intermediate layer. We view each pixel on\nthis feature map as a spatial-temporal point and select some informative\nkeypoints using self-attention. Second, AK-Net devises a ranking criterion to\narrange the keypoints into an ordered 1D sequence. Consequentially, AK-Net\nbrings two-fold benefits for efficiency: The keypoint selection step collects\ninformative content within arbitrary shapes and increases the efficiency for\nmodeling spatial-temporal dependencies, while the point cloud classification\nstep further reduces the computational cost by compacting the convolutional\nkernels. Experimental results show that AK-Net can consistently improve the\nefficiency and performance of baseline methods on several video recognition\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 09:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We validate the proposal for pedestrian\nmulti-view association, showing results over the EPFL multi-camera pedestrian\ndataset. Our approach considerably outperforms the literature data association\ntechniques, without requiring to be trained in the same scenario in which it is\ntested.

Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques\ndetect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step\nin these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the\nexecution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure\nthat stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector\nclocks, namely join and copy, require $\\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number\nof threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large.\n  In this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces\nvector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and\ncopying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of\nentries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori\n$\\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic\nhappens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that\nno other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time.

To implement realistic and effective spectrum sharing policies,\nRANs will need to seamlessly and intelligently change their operational\nparameters. In stark contrast with existing paradigms, the new O-RAN\narchitectures for 5G-and-beyond networks (NextG) separate the logic that\ncontrols the RAN from its hardware substrate, allowing unprecedented real-time\nfine-grained control of RAN components. In this context, we propose the\nChannel-Aware Reactive Mechanism (ChARM), a data-driven O-RAN-compliant\nframework that allows (i) sensing the spectrum to infer the presence of\ninterference and (ii) reacting in real time by switching the distributed unit\n(DU) and radio unit (RU) operational parameters according to a specified\nspectrum access policy. ChARM is based on neural networks operating directly on\nunprocessed I/Q waveforms to determine the current spectrum context. ChARM does\nnot require any modification to the existing 3GPP standards. It is designed to\noperate within the O-RAN specifications, and can be used in conjunction with\nother spectrum sharing mechanisms (e.g., LTE-U, LTE-LAA or MulteFire). We\ndemonstrate the performance of ChARM in the context of spectrum sharing among\nLTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed bands, where a controller operating over a RAN\nIntelligent Controller (RIC) senses the spectrum and switches cell frequency to\navoid Wi-Fi.

To analyze this, we first\nhypothesize that rarely activated neurons and frequently activated neurons have\ndifferent purposes and responsibilities for the progress of generating images.\nIn this study, by analyzing the statistics and the roles for those neurons, we\nempirically show that rarely activated neurons are related to the failure\nresults of making diverse objects and inducing artifacts.

In\nthis paper, we target at exploring how deep neural networks predict height from\na single monocular image. Towards a comprehensive understanding of MHE\nnetworks, we propose to interpret them from multiple levels: 1) Neurons:\nunit-level dissection. Exploring the semantic and height selectivity of the\nlearned internal deep representations; 2) Instances: object-level\ninterpretation. Studying the effects of different semantic classes, scales, and\nspatial contexts on height estimation; 3) Attribution: pixel-level analysis.\nUnderstanding which input pixels are important for the height estimation.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) exchange data across a shared\nbus, dropping messages whenever errors occur. If an ECU generates enough\nerrors, their transmitter is put in a bus-off state, turning it off. Previous\nwork abuses this process to disable ECUs, but is trivial to detect through the\nmultiple errors transmitted over the bus. We propose a novel attack,\nundetectable by prior intrusion detection systems, which disables ECUs within a\nsingle message without generating any errors on the bus. Performing this attack\nrequires the ability to flip bits on the bus, but not with any level of\nsophistication. We show that an attacker who can only flip bits 40% of the time\ncan execute our stealthy attack 100% of the time. But this attack, and all\nprior CAN attacks, rely on the ability to read the bus. We propose a new\ntechnique which synchronizes the bus, such that even a blind attacker,\nincapable of reading the bus, can know when to transmit. Taking a limited\nattacker's chance of success from the percentage of dead bus time, to 100%.\nFinally, we propose a small modification to the CAN error process to ensure an\nECU cannot fail without being detected, no matter how advanced the attacker is.\nTaken together we advance the state of the art for CAN attacks and blind\nattackers, while proposing a detection system against stealthy attacks, and the\nlarger problem of CAN's abusable error frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Next, we present two possible implementations within the\nframework from theoretical and hardware perspectives. The first system is\ncalled MOCA-MAN and comprises a redundant torque-controlled robotic arm and an\nomnidirectional mobile platform. The second one is called Kairos-MAN, formed by\na high-payload 6-DoF velocity-controlled robotic arm and an omnidirectional\nmobile platform. The systems share the same admittance interface, through which\nuser wrenches are translated to loco-manipulation commands generated by\nwhole-body controllers of each system.

However, the performance of\nGNNs can be deteriorated when noisy connections occur in the original graph\nstructures; besides, the dependence on explicit structures prevents GNNs from\nbeing applied to general unstructured scenarios. To address these issues,\nrecently emerged deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods propose to jointly\noptimize the graph structure along with GNN under the supervision of a node\nclassification task. Nonetheless, these methods focus on a supervised learning\nscenario, which leads to several problems, i.e., the reliance on labels, the\nbias of edge distribution, and the limitation on application tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a more practical GSL paradigm, unsupervised graph structure\nlearning, where the learned graph topology is optimized by data itself without\nany external guidance (i.e., labels). To solve the unsupervised GSL problem, we\npropose a novel StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME\nfor abbreviation) with the aid of self-supervised contrastive learning.\nSpecifically, we generate a learning target from the original data as an\n\"anchor graph\", and use a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between\nthe anchor graph and the learned graph. To provide persistent guidance, we\ndesign a novel bootstrapping mechanism that upgrades the anchor graph with\nlearned structures during model learning. We also design a series of graph\nlearners and post-processing schemes to model the structures to learn.\nExtensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant\neffectiveness of our proposed SUBLIME and high quality of the optimized graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 11:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In the case $n=1$, the causal relations are clarified\ngeometrically in terms of causal cones. Discrete Dirac spheres are introduced\nas candidates for minimizers for large $m$ in the cases $n=1, f=2$ and $n=2,\nf=4$. We provide a thorough numerical analysis of the causal action principle\nfor weighted counting measures for large $m$ in the cases $n=1,2$ and\n$f=2,3,4$. Our numerical findings corroborate that all minimizers for large $m$\nare good approximations of the discrete Dirac spheres. In the example $n=1,\nf=3$ it is explained how numerical minimizers can be visualized by projected\nspacetime plots. Methods and prospects are discussed to numerically investigate\nsettings in which hitherto no analytic candidates for minimizers are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Furthermore, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) is\napplied to the super-resolution field, which effectively improves the visual\nquality of the reconstructed image. However, under the condtion of high\nupscaling factors, the excessive abnormal reasoning of the network produces\nsome distorted structures, so that there is a certain deviation between the\nreconstructed image and the ground-truth image. In order to fundamentally\nimprove the quality of reconstructed images, this paper proposes a effective\nmethod called Dual Perceptual Loss (DP Loss), which is used to replace the\noriginal perceptual loss to solve the problem of single image super-resolution\nreconstruction. Due to the complementary property between the VGG features and\nthe ResNet features, the proposed DP Loss considers the advantages of learning\ntwo features simultaneously, which significantly improves the reconstruction\neffect of images. The qualitative and quantitative analysis on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method over\nstate-of-the-art super-resolution methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

One key challenge in scaling\ncommon fairness metrics to such models and datasets is the requirement of\nexhaustive ground truth labeling, which cannot always be done. Indeed, this\noften rules out the application of traditional analysis metrics and systems. At\nthe same time, ML-fairness assessments cannot be made algorithmically, as\nfairness is a highly subjective matter.

To improve accuracy of degree evaluation, we introduce the\nconcept of vector degree for a Boolean function and propose the vector numeric\nmapping technique which aims to describe the propagation of the vector degree.\nRecovering superpoly of the cube is the key step in the preprocessing phase of\ncube attack. Three-subset division property without unknown subset has been an\nefficient tool in recovering the exact superpoly by studying the division\ntrails. It is convenient to use off-the-shelf MILP solver to search all\ndivision trails by transforming the division property into a MILP model. But\nwhen there are too many division trails, it is difficult to find all solutions\nby a MILP solver. We propose a method to simplify this problem through\ncombining the algebraic representations of the middle-round states in the\niterative process of a cipher.

To accelerate the communication, recent works introduce In-Network\nAggregation (INA), which moves the gradients summation into network\nmiddle-boxes, e.g., programmable switches to reduce the traffic volume.\nHowever, switch memory is scarce compared to the volume of gradients\ntransmitted in distributed training. Although literature applies methods like\npool-based streaming or dynamic sharing to tackle the mismatch, switch memory\nis still a potential performance bottleneck.

Such patterns or\nfeatures often represent particular configurations of pieces, empty positions,\netc., which may be relevant for a game's strategies. Their use has been\nparticularly prevalent in the game of Go, but also many other games used as\nbenchmarks for AI research. In this paper, we formulate a design and efficient\nimplementation of spatial state-action features for general games. These are\npatterns that can be trained to incentivise or disincentivise actions based on\nwhether or not they match variables of the state in a local area around action\nvariables. We provide extensive details on several design and implementation\nchoices, with a primary focus on achieving a high degree of generality to\nsupport a wide variety of different games using different board geometries or\nother graphs. Secondly, we propose an efficient approach for evaluating active\nfeatures for any given set of features. In this approach, we take inspiration\nfrom heuristics used in problems such as SAT to optimise the order in which\nparts of patterns are matched and prune unnecessary evaluations. This approach\nis defined for a highly general and abstract description of the problem --\nphrased as optimising the order in which propositions of formulas in\ndisjunctive normal form are evaluated -- and may therefore also be of interest\nto other types of problems than board games. An empirical evaluation on 33\ndistinct games in the Ludii general game system demonstrates the efficiency of\nthis approach in comparison to a naive baseline, as well as a baseline based on\nprefix trees, and demonstrates that the additional efficiency significantly\nimproves the playing strength of agents using the features to guide search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 13:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 11:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

We report column densities (N), equivalent widths\n(w), and the kinematic spread ({\\Delta} v90) of species from neutral, singly\nionised, and higher ionisation species. We find that, using the dust correction\nprescription, the measured metallicities are consistent for singly ionised gas\nspecies such as Pii, S ii, Si ii, Mnii and Crii, and Znii in all ESDLAs within\n3-sigma uncertainty. We find that the distributions of N(Ari)/N(Hi) ratio in\nDLAs and ESDLAs are similar. We further report that ESDLAs do not show a strong\ndeficiency of Ari relative to other {\\alpha}-capture elements as is seen in\nDLAs. This supports the idea that the mentioned under-abundance of Ari in DLAs\nis possibly caused by the presence of background UV photons that penetrate the\nlow N(Hi) clouds to ionise Ari, but they cannot penetrate deep enough in the\nhigh N(Hi) ESDLA environment. The w(Mgii lambda2796) distribution in ESDLAs is\nfound to be similar to that of metal-rich Ci-selected absorbers, but the\nvelocity spread of their Mgii profile is different. For higher ionisation\nspecies (such as C iv and Si iv), {\\Delta} v90 is similar in the two\npopulations, while the {\\Delta} v90 of singly ionised species is smaller for\nESDLAs.

To\ncombat this, we propose a noise injection, based either on quantization noise\nor on Gaussian noise addition to avoid this disadvantageous information flow in\nthe cycle architecture. We find that noise injection significantly reduces the\ngeneration of watermarks and thus allows the recognition of highly relevant\nclasses such as \"traffic signs\", which are hardly detected by the ERFNet\nbaseline. We report mIoU and PSNR results on the Cityscapes dataset for\nsemantic segmentation and image reconstruction, respectively.

Our results reveal that the passive tracer exhibits profound\nsubdiffusion with increasing stickiness by exploring deep into the grafted\npolymeric zone, while purely repulsive one prefers to diffuse through the\npore-like space created along the cylindrical axis of the channel. In contrast,\nthe active tracer shows faster dynamics and intermediate superdiffusion even\nthough the tracer preferentially stays close to the dense polymeric region.\nThis observation is further supported by the sharp peaks in the density profile\nof the probability of radial displacement of the tracer.

An\nintuitive partial remedy is to add a mask detector to flag any masked faces so\nthat the FRS can act accordingly for those low-confidence masked faces. In this\nwork, we set out to investigate the potential vulnerability of such FRS\nequipped with a mask detector, on large-scale masked faces, which might trigger\na serious risk, e.g., letting a suspect evade the FRS where both facial\nidentity and mask are undetected. As existing face recognizers and mask\ndetectors have high performance in their respective tasks, it is significantly\nchallenging to simultaneously fool them and preserve the transferability of the\nattack. We formulate the new task as the generation of realistic &\nadversarial-faced mask and make three main contributions: First, we study the\nnaive Delanunay-based masking method (DM) to simulate the process of wearing a\nfaced mask that is cropped from a template image, which reveals the main\nchallenges of this new task. Second, we further equip the DM with the\nadversarial noise attack and propose the adversarial noise Delaunay-based\nmasking method (AdvNoise-DM) that can fool the face recognition and mask\ndetection effectively but make the face less natural. Third, we propose the\nadversarial filtering Delaunay-based masking method denoted as MF2M by\nemploying the adversarial filtering for AdvNoise-DM and obtain more natural\nfaces. With the above efforts, the final version not only leads to significant\nperformance deterioration of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based\nFRS, but also remains undetected by the SOTA facial mask detector, thus\nsuccessfully fooling both systems at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 14:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

In this\npaper, we discuss in detail various methods of the determination of HII region\nmetallicity in the context of Y$_p$ analyses. We show that some procedures used\nin the methods lead to biases in the metallicity estimates and underestimation\nof their uncertainties. We propose a modified method for the metallicity\ndetermination, as well as an additional criterion for selecting objects. We\nhave selected 69 objects (26 objects with high quality spectra from the\nHeBCD+NIR database and 43 objects from the SDSS catalog), for which we estimate\nY and O/H using the proposed method. We have estimated Y$_p=0.2470\\pm0.0020$\nwhich is one of the most accurate estimates obtained up to date. Its comparison\nwith the value Y$_p=0.2470\\pm0.0002$ obtained as a result of numerical\nmodelling of Primordial Nucleosynthesis with the value of $\\Omega_b$ taken from\nthe analysis of the CMB anisotropy (Planck mission), is an important tool for\nstudying the self-consistency of the Standard cosmological model (a possible\ndiscrepancy between these estimates could be an indicator of a new physics).\nThe application of the proposed method allows one to more correctly estimate\nY$_p$ and the slope $d$Y/$d$(O/H). Further analysis of the data from the SDSS\ncatalog can significantly increase the statistics of objects for the regression\nanalysis, which in turn can refine the Y$_p$ estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-24"}

However, in the common practice, this layer is\nnot separately segmented but rather included in the outer nuclear layer since\nit is difficult to perceive HFL contours on standard optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) imaging. Due to its variable reflectivity under an imaging\nbeam, delineating the HFL contours necessitates directional OCT, which requires\nadditional imaging. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a\nshape-preserving network, FourierNet, that achieves HFL segmentation in\nstandard OCT scans with the target performance obtained when directional OCT\nscans are used. FourierNet is a new cascaded network design that puts forward\nthe idea of benefiting the shape prior of HFL in the network training. This\ndesign proposes to represent the shape prior by extracting Fourier descriptors\non the HFL contours and defining an additional regression task of learning\nthese descriptors. It then formulates HFL segmentation as concurrent learning\nof regression and classification tasks, in which Fourier descriptors are\nestimated from an input image to encode the shape prior and used together with\nthe input image to construct the HFL segmentation map. Our experiments on 1470\nimages of 30 OCT scans reveal that quantifying the HFL shape with Fourier\ndescriptors and concurrently learning them with the main task of HFL\nsegmentation lead to better results. This indicates the effectiveness of\ndesigning a shape-preserving network to improve HFL segmentation by reducing\nthe need to perform directional OCT imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

A p-adic transition network (or an ultrametric network) is a\nmodel of a complex system consisting of a hierarchical energy landscape, a\nMarkov process on the energy landscape, and a master equation. We focus on\nnetworks where the transition rates between two different basins are constant\nfunctions, and the jumping process inside of each basin is controlled by a\np-adic radial function. We solve explicitly the Cauchy problem for the master\nequation attached to this type of networks. The solution of this problem is the\nnetwork response to a given initial concentration. If the Markov process\nattached to the network is conservative, the long term response of the network\nis controlled by a Markov chain. If the process is not conservative the network\nhas absorbing states. We define an absorbing time, which depends on the initial\nconcentration, if this time is finite the network reaches an absorbing state in\na finite time. We identify in the response of the network the terms responsible\nfor bringing the network to an absorbing state, we call them the fast\ntransition modes. The existence of the fast transition modes is a consequence\nof the assumption that the energy landscape is ultrametric (hierarchical), and\nto the best of our understanding this result cannot be obtained using standard\nmethods of Markov state models. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that protein\nnative states are kinetic hubs that can be reached quickly from any other\nstate.

The CME generating the ESP event is simulated by using the spheromak\nmodel of EUHFORIA, which approximates the CME's flux rope as a linear\nforce-free spheroidal magnetic field. In addition, a tool was developed to\ntrace CME-driven shock waves in the EUHFORIA simulation domain.

Previous methods performed the\nexpressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length\nstyle embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an\naverage style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In\nthis paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis\nframework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the\nproposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and\nwith proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module\n(GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion\npresenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level\nemotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively.

This is important to learn\ncounterfactuals, or because the experience was generated out of its own\ncontrol. However, off-policy learning is non-trivial, and standard\nreinforcement-learning algorithms can be unstable and divergent.\n  In this paper we discuss a novel family of off-policy prediction algorithms\nwhich are convergent by construction. The idea is to first learn on-policy\nabout the data-generating behaviour, and then bootstrap an off-policy value\nestimate on this on-policy estimate, thereby constructing a value estimate that\nis partially off-policy. This process can be repeated to build a chain of value\nfunctions, each time bootstrapping a new estimate on the previous estimate in\nthe chain. Each step in the chain is stable and hence the complete algorithm is\nguaranteed to be stable. Under mild conditions this comes arbitrarily close to\nthe off-policy TD solution when we increase the length of the chain. Hence it\ncan compute the solution even in cases where off-policy TD diverges.\n  We prove that the proposed scheme is convergent and corresponds to an\niterative decomposition of the inverse key matrix. Furthermore it can be\ninterpreted as estimating a novel objective -- that we call a `k-step\nexpedition' -- of following the target policy for finitely many steps before\ncontinuing indefinitely with the behaviour policy. Empirically we evaluate the\nidea on challenging MDPs such as Baird's counter example and observe favourable\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 15:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 11:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

Spontaneous breaking of scale\ninvariance takes place when integrating the fields that define the measures.\nWhen going to the Einstein frame we obtain: (i) An effective potential for the\nscalar fields with three flat regions which allows for a unified description of\nboth early universe inflation (in the higher energy density flat region) as\nwell as of present dark energy epoch which can be realized with a double phase,\ni.e., in two flat regions. (ii) In the slow roll inflation, only one field\ncombination the ``dilaton\", which transforms under scale transformations, has\nnon trivial dynamics, the orthogonal one, which is scale invariant remains\nconstant.

The accuracy of the method depends, first, on the number of\nGCs, the spectra of which have been studied in detail; second, on the number of\nchemical elements, the abundances of which have been worked out. Only those\nelements are of interest for this method that are produced in supernova\nexplosions and are not produced at the previous stage of the stellar evolution.\nOur estimates of nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity supernova GCs are in the\nbest agreement with the following Prompt SNIa model: Single Degenerate Pure\nDeflagration Models of white dwarfs (WDs) burning with masses in the range from\n1.30 Msun to 1.31 Msun if carbon explodes in the centre of a WD with a low\ncentral density from 0.5*10^9 g/cm^3 to 10^9 g/cm^3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 15:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

Several\nreviews have been conducted regarding Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques\nto improve pregnancy outcomes. They are limited by focusing on specific data\nsuch as mother's care during pregnancy. This systematic survey aims to explore\nhow artificial intelligence (AI) can assist with fetal growth monitoring via\nUltrasound (US) image. We used eight medical and computer science bibliographic\ndatabases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, IEEE explore, ACM\nLibrary, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. We retrieved studies published\nbetween 2010 to 2021. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using a\nnarrative approach. Out of 1269 retrieved studies, we included 107 distinct\nstudies from queries that were relevant to the topic in the survey. We found\nthat 2D ultrasound images were more popular (n=88) than 3D and 4D ultrasound\nimages (n=19). Classification is the most used method (n=42), followed by\nsegmentation (n=31), classification integrated with segmentation (n=16) and\nother miscellaneous such as object-detection, regression and reinforcement\nlearning (n=18). The most common areas within the pregnancy domain were the\nfetus head (n=43), then fetus body (n=31), fetus heart (n=13), fetus abdomen\n(n=10), and lastly the fetus face (n=10). In the most recent studies, deep\nlearning techniques were primarily used (n=81), followed by machine learning\n(n=16), artificial neural network (n=7), and reinforcement learning (n=2). AI\ntechniques played a crucial role in predicting fetal diseases and identifying\nfetus anatomy structures during pregnancy. More research is required to\nvalidate this technology from a physician's perspective, such as pilot studies\nand randomized controlled trials on AI and its applications in a hospital\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 14:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-26"}

Despite the large player base, it is still\nimportant to attract new players to prevent the community of a game from\nbecoming inactive. Entering MOBA games is, however, often demanding, requiring\nthe player to learn numerous skills at once. An important factor of success is\nbuying the correct items which forms a complex task depending on various\nin-game factors such as already purchased items, the team composition, or\navailable resources. A recommendation system can support players by reducing\nthe mental effort required to choose a suitable item, helping, e.g., newer\nplayers or players returning to the game after a longer break, to focus on\nother aspects of the game. Since Sequential Item Recommendation (SIR) has\nproven to be effective in various domains (e.g. e-commerce, movie\nrecommendation or playlist continuation), we explore the applicability of\nwell-known SIR models in the context of purchase recommendations in Dota 2. To\nfacilitate this research, we collect, analyze and publish Dota-350k, a new\nlarge dataset based on recent Dota 2 matches. We find that SIR models can be\nemployed effectively for item recommendation in Dota 2. Our results show that\nmodels that consider the order of purchases are the most effective. In contrast\nto other domains, we find RNN-based models to outperform the more recent\nTransformer-based architectures on Dota-350k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

However, the gauge volume and\nhence spatial resolution is limited by the beam defining apertures and can be\nanisotropic for very low and high diffraction (scattering) angles.\nAlternatively, wavelength resolved neutron transmission imaging has a potential\nto retrieve information tomographically about residual strain induced within\nmaterials through measurement in transmission of Bragg edges - crystallographic\nfingerprints whose locations and shapes depend on microstructure and strain\ndistribution. In such a case the spatial resolution is determined by the\ngeometrical blurring of the measurement setup and the detector point spread\nfunction. Mathematically, reconstruction of strain tensor field is described by\nthe longitudinal ray transform; this transform has a non-trivial null-space,\nmaking direct inversion impossible. A combination of the longitudinal ray\ntransform with physical constraints was used to reconstruct strain tensor\nfields in convex objects. To relax physical constraints and generalise\nreconstruction, a recently introduced concept of histogram tomography can be\nemployed. Histogram tomography relies on our ability to resolve the\ndistribution of strain in the beam direction, as we discuss in the paper. More\nspecifically, Bragg edge strain tomography requires extraction of the second\nmoment (variance about zero) of the strain distribution which has not yet been\ndemonstrated in practice. In this paper we verify experimentally that the\nsecond moment can be reliably measured for a previously well characterised\naluminium ring and plug sample. We compare experimental measurements against\nnumerical calculation and further support our conclusions by rigorous\nuncertainty quantification of the estimated mean and variance of the strain\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 12:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 05:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 10:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
