Such values are obtained from Mott-Schottky plots by\nassuming that the measured capacitance is dominated by the capacitance of the\ndepletion layer formed by the doping density within the photoanode. In this\nwork, we show that such an assumption is erroneous in many cases because the\ninjection of electrons from the collecting contact creates a ubiquitous\ncapacitance step that is very difficult to distinguish from that of the\ndepletion layer. Based on this reasoning, we derive an analytical resolution\nlimit that is independent of the assumed active area and surface roughness of\nthe photoanode, below which doping densities cannot be measured in a\ncapacitance measurement. We find that the reported doping densities in\nliterature lie very close to this value and therefore conclude that there is no\ncredible evidence from capacitance measurements that confirms that bismuth\nvanadate and haematite photoanodes contain high doping densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 16:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 09:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-22"}

Recent work has\nshown that retrievals are possible using a direct likelihood evaluation or\nlikelihood 'mappings'. The unique aspect of high-resolution retrievals is that\nthe data-processing methods required to remove the stellar and telluric lines\nalso distort the underlying exoplanet's signal and therefore the forward model\nmust be pre-processed to match this filtering.

The MDCDW\ncondensate occurs in the presence of a magnetic field. It is a single-modulated\nchiral density wave characterized by two dynamically generated parameters: the\nfermion quasiparticle mass $m$ and the condensate spatial modulation $q$. The\nlowest Landau level quasiparticle modes in the MDCDW system are asymmetric\nabout the zero energy, a fact that leads to the topological properties and\nanomalous electric transport exhibited by this phase. The topology makes the\nMDCDW phase robust against thermal phonon fluctuations, and as such, it does\nnot display the Landau-Peierls instability, a stapled feature of\nsingle-modulated inhomogeneous chiral condensates in three dimensions. The\ntopology is also reflected in the presence of the electromagnetic chiral\nanomaly in the effective action and in the formation of hybridized propagating\nmodes known as an axion-polaritons. Taking into account that one of the\naxion-polaritons of this quark phase is gapped, we argued how incident\n$\\gamma$-ray photons can be converted into gapped axion-polaritons in the\ninterior of a magnetar star in the MDCDW phase leading the star to collapse, a\nphenomenon that can serve to explain the so-called missing pulsar problem in\nthe galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 16:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

One of the major strengths that DMD possesses is having ground\ntheoretical roots from the Koopman approximation theory. Indeed, DMD may be\nviewed as the data-driven realization of the famous Koopman operator.\nNonetheless, the stable implementation of DMD incurs computing the singular\nvalue decomposition of the input data matrix. This, in turn, makes the process\ncomputationally demanding for high dimensional systems. In order to alleviate\nthis burden, we develop a framework based on sketching methods, wherein a\nsketch of a matrix is simply another matrix which is significantly smaller, but\nstill sufficiently approximates the original system. Such sketching or\nembedding is performed by applying random transformations, with certain\nproperties, on the input matrix to yield a compressed version of the initial\nsystem. Hence, many of the expensive computations can be carried out on the\nsmaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution of the original problem. We\nconduct numerical experiments conducted using the spherical shallow water\nequations as a prototypical model in the context of geophysical flows. The\nperformance of several sketching approaches is evaluated for capturing the\nrange and co-range of the data matrix. The proposed sketching-based framework\ncan accelerate various portions of the DMD algorithm, compared to classical\nmethods that operate directly on the raw input data. This eventually leads to\nsubstantial computational gains that are vital for digital twinning of high\ndimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 17:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

We present the results of the first successful ACA (Atacama\nCompact Array) [C I] $J$ = 1-0 mini-survey of seven protoplanetary disks. Using\ntailored azimuthally symmetric DALI (Dust And LInes) thermo-chemical disk\nmodels, supported by the [C I] $J$ = 1-0 and resolved CO isotopologue data, we\ndetermine the system-averaged elemental volatile carbon abundance in the outer\ndisk of three sources. Six out of seven sources are detected in [C I] $J$ = 1-0\nwith ACA, four of which show a distinct disk component. Based on the modeling\nwe find severe cold gaseous carbon depletion in the outer disk of DL Tau and\nmoderate depletion in the outer disks of DR Tau and DO Tau. Combining the outer\nand inner disk carbon abundances, we demonstrate definitive evidence for radial\ndrift in the disk of DL Tau, where the existence of multiple dust rings points\nto either short lived or leaky dust traps. We find dust locking in the compact\nand smooth disks of DO Tau and DR Tau, hinting at unresolved dust substructure.\nComparing our results with stars of different ages and luminosities, we\nidentify an observational evolutionary trend in gaseous carbon depletion that\nis consistent with dynamical models of CO depletion processes.

We illustrate\nthe testing methodology through a detailed simulation study and provide a\nprototypical example from materials science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 17:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic\nparticles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for\nlarge-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum\ncomputers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical\ncomputers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to\nperform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time\nthe calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible\nanswers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and\nare not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are\nother fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could\nbe useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a\nSystematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2021 to\nidentify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine\nlearning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 52\narticles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main\ntypes of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine\nlearning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor\nmodel, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks.\nMany articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine\nlearning but using quantum devices and algorithms.

DM-VIO performs photometric bundle adjustment with a dynamic weight\nfor visual residuals. We adopt marginalization, which is a popular strategy to\nkeep the update time constrained, but it cannot easily be reversed, and\nlinearization points of connected variables have to be fixed. To overcome this\nwe propose delayed marginalization: The idea is to maintain a second factor\ngraph, where marginalization is delayed. This allows us to later readvance this\ndelayed graph, yielding an updated marginalization prior with new and\nconsistent linearization points. In addition, delayed marginalization enables\nus to inject IMU information into already marginalized states. This is the\nfoundation of the proposed pose graph bundle adjustment, which we use for IMU\ninitialization. In contrast to prior works on IMU initialization, it is able to\ncapture the full photometric uncertainty, improving the scale estimation. In\norder to cope with initially unobservable scale, we continue to optimize scale\nand gravity direction in the main system after IMU initialization is complete.\nWe evaluate our system on the EuRoC, TUM-VI, and 4Seasons datasets, which\ncomprise flying drone, large-scale handheld, and automotive scenarios.

This paper extends\nthe study of migration to examine the role of external influences using the\nexample of the interaction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) with the Milky\nWay (MW). We first make impulse approximation estimates to characterize the\ninfluence of Sgr disc passages. The tidal forcing from Sgr can produce changes\nin both guiding radius ($\\Delta R_g$) and orbital eccentricity, as quantified\nby the maximum radial excursion, $\\Delta R_ {\\rm max} $. These changes follow a\nquadrupole-like pattern across the face of the disc, with amplitude increasing\nwith Galactocentric radius. We next examine a collisionless N-body simulation\nof a Sgr-like satellite interacting with a MW-like galaxy and find that Sgr's\ninfluence in the outer disc dominates over the secular evolution of orbits\nbetween disc passages. Finally, we use the same simulation to explore possible\nobservable signatures of Sgr-induced migration by painting the simulation with\ndifferent age stellar populations.

We\nshow that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most\nplausible source of the required viscosity, and construct a simple physical\nmodel to explore this. A key feature is to link the magnetic field strength to\nthe local star-formation surface density, $B_{\\rm tot} \\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}^\\alpha$. This provides a feed-back loop between star-formation and the\nflow of gas.

We present the [OIII]5007 ionised gas\noutflow properties of 22 z$<$0.1 X-ray AGN, derived from the BAT AGN\nSpectroscopic Survey using MUSE/VLT. With an average spatial resolution of 1\"\n(0.1-1.2 kpc), the observations resolve the ionised gas clouds down to\nsub-kiloparsec scales. Resolved maps show that the [OIII] velocity dispersion\nis, on average, higher in regions ionised by the AGN, compared to star\nformation. We calculate the instantaneous outflow rates in individual MUSE\nspaxels by constructing resolved mass outflow rate maps, incorporating variable\noutflow density and velocity. We compare the instantaneous values with\ntime-averaged outflow rates by placing mock fibres and slits on the MUSE\nfield-of-view, a method often used in the literature. The instantaneous outflow\nrates (0.2-275 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) tend to be 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the time-averaged outflow rates (0.001-40 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The\noutflow rates correlate with the AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\\rm bol}\\sim$\n10$^{42.71}$-10$^{45.62}$ erg/s) but we find no correlations with black hole\nmass (10$^{6.1}$-10$^{8.9}$ M$_{\\odot}$), Eddington ratio (0.002-1.1) and radio\nluminosity (10$^{21}$-10$^{26}$ W/Hz). We find the median coupling between the\nkinetic energy and $L_{\\rm bol}$ to be 1%, consistent with the theoretical\npredictions for an AGN-driven outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We argue\nthat TEB is ubiquitous, and elucidate its physical origin via a semiclassical\nquasiparticle picture that exactly captures the behavior of integrable spin\nchains. Further, we show that a TEB also arises in chaotic spin chains, which\nlack well-defined quasiparticles.

In the framework of evolutionary game theory and by means of\npotential functions, researchers have established equilibrium convergence under\ndifferent update rules, including best-response and imitation, by imposing\ncertain conditions on agents' utility functions. Then by using the proposed\npotential functions, they have been able to control these populations towards\nsome desired equilibrium. Nevertheless, finding a potential function is often\ndaunting, if not near impossible. We introduce the so-called coordinating agent\nwho tends to switch to a decision only if at least another agent has done so.\nWe prove that any population of coordinating agents, a coordinating population,\nalmost surely equilibrates. Apparently, some binary network games that were\nproven to equilibrate using potential functions are coordinating, and some\ncoloring problems can be solved using this notion. We additionally show that\nany mixed network of agents following best-response, imitation, or rational\nimitation, and associated with coordination payoff matrices is coordinating,\nand hence, equilibrates. As a second contribution, we provide an\nincentive-based control algorithm that leads coordinating populations to a\ndesired equilibrium. The algorithm iteratively maximizes the ratio of the\nnumber of agents choosing the desired decision to the provided incentive. It\nperforms near optimal and as well as specialized algorithms proposed for\nbest-response and imitation; however, it does not require a potential function.\nTherefore, this control algorithm can be readily applied in general situations\nwhere no potential function is yet found for a given decision-making\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

It has been\nhypothesized that there could also be a parity-conjugated copy of the standard\nmodel particles, called mirror particles. The existence of such a mirror\nuniverse has specific testable implications, especially in the domain of\nneutral particle oscillation, viz. the baryon number violating neutron to\nmirror-neutron ($n-n'$) oscillation. Consequently, there were many experiments\nthat have searched for $n-n'$ oscillation, and imposed constraints upon the\nparameters that describe it. All the previous efforts searched for $n-n'$\noscillation by comparing the relative number of ultracold neutrons that survive\nafter a period of storage for one or both of the two cases: (i) comparison of\nzero applied magnetic field to a non-zero applied magnetic field, and (ii)\ncomparison where the orientation of the applied magnetic field was reversed.\nHowever, $n-n'$ oscillations also lead to variations in the precession\nfrequency of polarized neutrons upon flipping the direction of the applied\nmagnetic field.

It is thus suggested that against a\nfixed extortioner, any adapting co-player should be subdued with full\ncooperation as their best response. In contrast, recent experiments demonstrate\nthat human players often choose not to accede to extortion out of concern for\nfairness, actually causing extortioners to suffer more loss than themselves. In\nlight of this, here we reveal fair-minded strategies that are unbending to\nextortion such that any payoff-maximizing extortioner ultimately will concede\nin their own interest by offering a fair split in head-to-head matches. We find\nand characterize multiple general classes of such unbending strategies,\nincluding generous zero-determinant strategies and Win-Stay, Lose-Shift as\nparticular examples. When against fixed unbending players, extortioners are\nforced with consequentially increasing losses whenever intending to demand more\nunfair share. Our analysis also pivots to the importance of payoff structure in\ndetermining the superiority of zero-determinant strategies and in particular\ntheir extortion ability. We show that an extortionate ZD player can be even\noutperformed by, for example, Win-Stay Lose-Shift, if the total payoff of\nunilateral cooperation is smaller than that of mutual defection. Unbending\nstrategies can be used to outlearn evolutionary extortioners and catalyze the\nevolution of Tit-for-Tat-like strategies out of ZD players. Our work has\nimplications for promoting fairness and resisting extortion so as to uphold a\njust and cooperative society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

However, the short term effects of\nram pressure on the star formation rate and AGN activity of galaxies undergoing\nstripping remain unclear. Numerical studies have recently demonstrated cosmic\nrays can dramatically influence galaxy evolution for isolated galaxies, yet\ntheir influence on ram pressure stripping remains poorly constrained. We\nperform the first cosmic-ray magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of an $L_{*}$\ngalaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping, including radiative cooling,\nself-gravity of the gas, star formation, and stellar feedback.

More recently, radio frequency (RF)-based approaches\nusing commercial WiFi devices have emerged which offer low-cost ubiquitous\nsensing whilst preserving privacy. However, the output of an RF sensing system,\nsuch as Range-Doppler spectrograms, cannot represent human motion intuitively\nand usually requires further processing. In this study, MDPose, a novel\nframework for human skeletal motion reconstruction based on WiFi micro-Doppler\nsignatures, is proposed. It provides an effective solution to track human\nactivities by reconstructing a skeleton model with 17 key points, which can\nassist with the interpretation of conventional RF sensing outputs in a more\nunderstandable way. Specifically, MDPose has various incremental stages to\ngradually address a series of challenges: First, a denoising algorithm is\nimplemented to remove any unwanted noise that may affect the feature extraction\nand enhance weak Doppler signatures. Secondly, the convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is applied to learn\ntemporal-spatial dependency from clean micro-Doppler signatures and restore key\npoints' velocity information. Finally, a pose optimising mechanism is employed\nto estimate the initial state of the skeleton and to limit the increase of\nerror. We have conducted comprehensive tests in a variety of environments using\nnumerous subjects with a single receiver radar system to demonstrate the\nperformance of MDPose, and report 29.4mm mean absolute error over all key\npoints positions, which outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based pose estimation\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

The optimal Volt/VAr control (VVC) problem is formulated\nas an optimization program, with the goal of maintaining the voltage profile\nacross the network by coordinating the VAr outputs of DERs. To overcome the\nslow convergence rate of conventional gradient-based methods, a PNM-based\nsolution algorithm is developed to solve this VVC problem. It utilizes a\nnon-diagonal symmetric positive definite matrix, developed from the Hessian\nmatrix of the objective, to scale the gradient, and thus a fast convergence\nperformance can be expected in this Newton-like algorithm. Moreover, taking\nadvantage of the instantaneous feedback of voltage measurements, the online\nimplementation of the PNM-based VVC is further designed to deal with fast\nsystem variations. In this online PNM-based VVC scheme, each bus agent\ncommunicates the instantaneous voltage measurements to the central agent, and\nthe central agent communicates the VAr output commands of DERs back to each bus\nagent. The fast convergence performance of PNM results in a stronger capability\nto track the system variations in real time. Finally, numerical case studies\nare performed to validate the effectiveness, superiority, and scalability of\nthe proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 22:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Due to their high complexity, the\nexecution of these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity\nobject tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is periodically\napplied to generate \"fresh\" references for tracking. However, the frames\nprocessed with OD incur large delays, which may make the reference outdated and\ndegrade tracking quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this\ncontext, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and OD (at the edge\nserver) processes that are resilient to large OD latency. We propose Katch-Up,\na novel tracking mechanism that improves the system resilience to excessive OD\ndelay. However, while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also\nincreases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we design SmartDet, a\nlow-complexity controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that\nlearns controlling the trade-off between resource utilization and OD\nperformance. SmartDet takes as input context-related information related to the\ncurrent video content and the current network conditions to optimize frequency\nand type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up utilization.

We evaluate MR diagnostics of over 10,000\ntransition metal complexes (TMCs) and compare to those in organic molecules.

We thus\nreviewed existing contiguous cartogram software and compared two web-based\ncartogram tools: fBlog and go-cart.io.

Additionally, the enlarged unit cells will\nencounter negligible mutual couplings when combined together, hence making\nstraightforward the process of metasurface design. These advantages combine to\nallow the design of a novel class of metasurfaces which support the high\nefficiency redirection of electromagnetic (EM) waves over a wide bandwidth and\noperation angle. Moreover, an aggressively discretized metasurface may realize\nfunctionalities such as diffraction mode circulation, which are unsupported in\nits continuous counterparts.

Previous models of the\natmospheric structure and evolution of these exoplanets, which have been used\nto constrain their atmospheric mass fractions, have neglected this\ncompositional coupling. In this work, we show that silicate vapor in a\nhydrogen-dominated atmosphere acts as a condensable species, decreasing in\nabundance with altitude. The resultant mean molecular weight gradient inhibits\nconvection at temperatures above $\\sim 4000$ K, inducing a near-surface\nradiative layer.

By using\nfirst-principles calculations, we propose that two ferromagnetic spinel\nmaterials of X2MnO4 (X=Li, Na) have Weyl-type nodal chains around the Fermi\nlevel. Their stabilities are validated by cohesive energies, phonon\ndispersions, and elastic constants. The nodal chains are composed of two types\nof nodal loops, which are protected by the glide operation Mz, the mirror\noperation M101 and their equivalent. The drumhead surface states are observed\non the (001) surface and they exhibit nontrivial topological features. In\naddition, under different electron correlations and lattice strains, the\nsemimetal states of these two materials are well kept. Our work provides two\npromising candidates for exploring the combination of magnetic materials and\ntopological semimetal states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 05:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

These are risks that are\ntransferable across partner firms. They can be decomposed into intrinsic risks\na firm faces from its own operations and extrinsic risks transferred from its\npartners. Firms broadly have access to two security strategies: either they can\nindependently eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic risks by securing their\nlinks with partners, or alternatively, firms can cooperate with partners to\neliminate sources of intrinsic risk in the network. We develop a\ngraph-theoretic model of interdependent security and demonstrate that the\nnetwork-optimal security strategy can be computed in polynomial time. Then, we\nuse cooperative game-theoretic tools to examine whether and when firms can\nsustain the network-optimal security strategy via cost-sharing mechanisms that\nare stable, fair, computable, and implementable via a series of bilateral\ncost-sharing arrangements. We consider different informational assumptions in\nthe network and show that, when the players know only their own costs, firms\nhave a clear incentive to cooperate globally whereas, in the presence of public\ninformation, there may not exist cost-sharing mechanisms that can sustain\nnetwork-wide cooperation. We then design a novel cost-sharing mechanism: the\nagreeable allocation, that is easy to compute, bilaterally implementable,\nensures stability, and is fair in a well-defined sense. However, the agreeable\nallocation need not always exist. We then generalize levels of agreeable\nallocation, with weaker implementability properties but greater existence\nguarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 05:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 06:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Traditional CPP strategies focus\non minimizing the number of viewpoints or traveling distance of robots under\nthe condition of full coverage inspection. The measurement uncertainty when\ncollecting the scanning data is less considered in the free-form surface\ninspection. To address this problem, a novel CPP method with the optimal\nviewpoint sampling strategy is proposed to incorporate the measurement\nuncertainty of key measurement points (MPs) into free-form surface inspection.\nAt first, the feasible ranges of measurement uncertainty are calculated based\non the tolerance specifications of the MPs.

In the\nlanguage of bundle theory, one can construct a vector bundle over the set of\nall possible motion states of a massive particle, in whose fibers the moving\nparticle's internal quantum state as perceived by a fixed inertial observer is\nencoded. A link between the usual Hilbert space description is provided by a\ngeneralized induced representation construction on the $L^2$-section space of\nthe bundle. The aim of this paper is two-fold. One is to communicate the basic\nideas of RQI to mathematicians and the other is to suggest an improved\nformalism for single-particle state spaces that encompasses all known massive\nparticles including those which have never been dealt with in the RQI\nliterature. Some of the theoretical implications of the formalism will be\nexplored at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 06:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The intrinsic ferromagnetic Jauns\nmonolayer, and hence the tunable physical properties, is therefore of great\ninterest. Here, through comprehensive density functional theory calculations\nand Monte Carlo simulations, we unveil that single-layer MnSSe is an intrinsic\nferromagnetic half-metal with a direct band gap of 1.14 eV in spin-down channel\nand a Curie temperature of about 72 K.

Inspired by the thoughts of\nShannon information theory, the JDE system model is established in the presence\nof complex white Gaussian noise. We make several main contributions: (1) the\nequivalent JDE channel and the posterior probability density function are\nderived based on the priori statistical characteristic of the noise, target\nscattering and joint target parameter; (2) the performance of the JDE system is\nmeasured by the joint entropy deviation and the joint information that is\ndefined as the mutual information between received signal and the joint target\nparameter; (3) the sampling a posterior probability and cascaded JDEers are\nproposed, and their performance is measured by the empirical joint entropy\ndeviation the empirical joint information; (4) the joint theorem is proved that\nthe joint information is the available limit of the overall performance, that\nis, the joint information is available, and the empirical joint information of\nany JDEer is no greater than the joint information; (5) the cascaded theorem is\nproved that the sum of empirical detection information and empirical estimation\ninformation can approximate the joint information, i.e., the performance limit\nof cascaded JDEer is available. Simulation results verify the correctness of\nthe joint and the cascaded theorems, and show that the performance of the\nsampling a posterior probability JDEer is asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the\nperformance of cascaded JDEer can approximate the system performance of JDE\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 07:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

We are developing a UCN detector for the with a high spatial\nresolution, which consists of a Si substrate, a thin converter layer including\n$^{10}$B$_{4}$C, and a layer of fine-grained nuclear emulsion. Its resolution\nwas estimated to be less than 100 nm by fitting tracks of either $^{7}$Li\nnuclei or $\\alpha$-particles, which were created when neutrons interacted with\nthe $^{10}$B$_{4}$C layer. For actual measurements of the spatial\ndistributions, the following two improvements were made: The first was to\nestablish a method to align microscopic images with high accuracy within a wide\nregion of 65 mm $\\times$ 0.2 mm. We created reference marks of 1 $\\mu$m and 5\n$\\mu$m diameter with an interval of 50 $\\mu$m and 500 $\\mu$m, respectively, on\nthe Si substrate by electron beam lithography and realized a position accuracy\nof less than 30 nm. The second was to build a holder that could maintain the\natmospheric pressure around the nuclear emulsion to utilize it under vacuum\nduring exposure to UCNs. The intrinsic resolution of the improved detector was\nestimated by evaluating the blur of a transmission image of a gadolinium\ngrating taken by cold neutrons as better than 0.56 $\\pm$ 0.08 $\\mu$m, which\nincluded the grating accuracy. A test exposure to UCNs was conducted to obtain\nthe spatial distribution of UCNs in the Earth's gravitational field. Although\nthe test was successful, a blurring of 6.9 $\\mu$m was found in the\nmeasurements, compared with a theoretical curve. We identified the blurring\ncaused by the refraction of UCNs due to the roughness of the upstream surface\nof the substrate.

Combining symmetry analysis and first-principles\ncalculations, we predict that light illumination could inject non-equilibrium\nmagnetic moments into the sliding ferroelectrics.

Among emerging memory technologies, Spin-Transfer Torque\nMagnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is known as the most promising replacement for\nSRAM-based cache memories. The main advantages of STT-MRAM are its\nnon-volatility, near-zero leakage power, higher density, soft-error immunity,\nand higher scalability. Despite these advantages, the high error rate in\nSTT-MRAM cells due to retention failure, write failure, and read disturbance\nthreatens the reliability of cache memories built upon STT-MRAM technology. The\nerror rate is significantly increased in higher temperatures, which further\naffects the reliability of STT-MRAM-based cache memories. The major source of\nheat generation and temperature increase in STT-MRAM cache memories is write\noperations, which are managed by cache replacement policy. In this paper, we\nfirst analyze the cache behavior in the conventional LRU replacement policy and\ndemonstrate that the majority of consecutive write operations (more than 66%)\nare committed to adjacent cache blocks. These adjacent write operations cause\naccumulated heat and increased temperature, which significantly increases the\ncache error rate. To eliminate heat accumulation and the adjacency of\nconsecutive writes, we propose a cache replacement policy, named Thermal-Aware\nLeast-Recently Written (TA-LRW), to smoothly distribute the generated heat by\nconducting consecutive write operations in distant cache blocks. TA-LRW\nguarantees the distance of at least three blocks for each two consecutive write\noperations in an 8-way associative cache. This distant write scheme reduces the\ntemperature-induced error rate by 94.8%, on average, compared with the\nconventional LRU policy, which results in 6.9x reduction in cache error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 09:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Several effects due to the axion cloud, such as the spin-down of\nblack holes and the emission of monochromatic gravitational waves, open a new\nwindow to search for axions by astrophysical observations. When the axion\nself-interaction is considered, the evolution of cloud is altered\nsignificantly, and an explosive phenomenon called bosenova can happen. Thus, it\nis necessary to understand the precise evolution of self-interacting clouds for\nthe detection of axions by astrophysical observations. In this paper, we\npropose a new method to track the whole process of the growth of\nself-interacting axion clouds employing the adiabatic approximation. We\nemphasize that our method relies neither on the non-relativistic approximation\nnor on perturbative treatment of the self-interaction, which is often used in\nliterature. Our main finding is that the evolution of cloud in the strongly\nself-interacting regime depends on the strength of the gravitational coupling\nbetween the axion and the black hole. For a large coupling, the cloud evolves\ninto a quasi-stationary state where the superradiant energy gain is balanced\nwith the energy dissipation to infinity by the self-interaction. On the other\nhand, when one decreases the size of coupling, clouds become unstable at some\nenergy, which would be interpreted as the onset of bosenova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 09:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 05:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

In the case of non-rotating black holes, Pseudo-Newtonian description\nof surrounding space-time enables one to make a significant progress in\npredicting spectral and timing properties. This formalism is lacking for\nspinning black holes. In this paper, we show that there exists an exact form of\n'natural' potential derivable from the general relativistic (GR) radial\nmomentum equation. Use of this potential in an otherwise Newtonian set of\nequations allows to describe transonic flows very accurately as is evidenced by\ncomparing with solutions obtained from the full GR framework.

Above all, the PLMs based\nrecommenders are inefficient, as the encoding of user-side information will\ntake huge computation costs. Although the computation can be accelerated with\nefficient transformers or distilled PLMs, it is still not enough to make timely\nrecommendations for the active users, who are associated with super long news\nbrowsing histories.\n  In this work, we tackle the efficient news recommendation problem from a\ndistinctive perspective.

In such object-oblivious flash devices, concurrent writes\nfrom different objects are simply packed in their arrival order to flash memory\nblocks; hence objects with different lifetimes are multiplexed onto the same\nflash blocks. This multiplexing incurs write amplification, worsening the\nperformance. Tackling the multiplexing problem, we propose a novel interface\nfor flash storage, FlashAlloc. It is used to pass the logical address ranges of\nlogical objects to the flash storage and thus enlighten the storage to stream\nwrites by objects. The object-aware flash storage can de-multiplex writes from\ndifferent objects with distinct deathtimes into per-object dedicated flash\nblocks. Given that popular data stores separate writes using objects (e.g.,\nSSTables in RocksDB), we can achieve, unlike the existing solutions,\ntransparent write streaming just by calling FlashAlloc upon object creation.\nOur experimental results using an open-source SSD prototype demonstrate that\nFlashAlloc can reduce write amplification factor (WAF) in RocksDB, F2FS, and\nMySQL by 1.5, 2.5, and 0.3, respectively and thus improve throughput by 2x,\n1.8x, and 1.2x, respectively.

Here, we present a general method to directly measure the D4000\nwith narrow-band (NB) photometry; it has been validated using realistic\nsimulations, and then evaluated with PAUS NBs, cross-matched with VIPERS\nspectra ($i_{\\rm AB} < 22.5$, $0.562 < z < 0.967$). We also reconstruct the\nD4000 with the SED-fitting code CIGALE; the use of PAUS NBs instead of broad\nbands significantly improves the SED fitting results. For D4000$_{\\rm n}$, the\ndirect measurement has $\\rm \\langle SNR \\rangle \\sim 4$, but we find that for\n$i_{\\rm AB}<21$ all direct D4000 measurements have $\\rm SNR>3$. The CIGALE\nD4000$_{\\rm n}$ has $\\rm \\langle SNR \\rangle \\sim 20$, but underestimates the\nerror by $>$50\\%. Furthermore, the direct method recreates well the D4000-SFR\nrelation, as well as the D4000-mass relation for blue galaxies (for red\ngalaxies, selection effects impact the results). On the other hand, CIGALE\naccurately classifies galaxies into red and blue populations.

The most common treatment after GBM diagnosis is chemotherapy, which\nworks by sending rapidly dividing cells to apoptosis. However, this form of\ntreatment is not effective when the MGMT promoter sequence is methylated, and\ninstead leads to severe side effects decreasing patient survivability.\nTherefore, it is important to be able to identify the MGMT promoter methylation\nstatus through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based machine\nlearning (ML) models. This is accomplished using the Brain Tumor Segmentation\n(BraTS) 2021 dataset, which was recently used for an international Kaggle\ncompetition.

Typically this `vertical shear' issues from a baroclinic\neffect driven by the central star's radiation field, but it might also arise\nduring the launching of a magnetocentrifugal wind. As a consequence,\nprotoplanetary discs are subject to a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical\nshear instability' (VSI), whose breakdown into turbulence could transport a\nmoderate amount of angular momentum and facilitate, or interfere with, the\nprocess of planet formation. Magnetic fields may suppress the VSI, however,\neither directly via magnetic tension or indirectly through magnetorotational\nturbulence. On the other hand, protoplanetary discs exhibit notoriously low\nionisation fractions, and non-ideal effects, if sufficiently dominant, may come\nto the VSI's rescue. In this paper we develop a local linear theory that\nexplores how non-ideal MHD influences the VSI, while also launching additional\ndiffusive shear instabilities. We derive a set of analytical criteria that\nestablish when the VSI prevails, and then show how it can be applied to a\nrealistic global model of a protoplanetary disc. Our calculations suggest that\nwithin ~10au the VSI should have little trouble emerging in the main body of\nthe disk, but beyond that, and in the upper regions of the disc, its onset\ndepends sensitively on the size of the preponderant dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Two major approaches are adopted to\noptimize CGF: (i) to reduce search space of inputs by inferring relationships\nbetween input bytes and path constraints; (ii) to formulate fuzzing processes\n(e.g., path transitions) and build up probability distributions to optimize\npower schedules, i.e., the number of inputs generated per seed. However, the\nformer is subjective to the inference results which may include extra bytes for\na path constraint, thereby limiting the efficiency of path constraints\nresolution, code coverage discovery, and bugs exposure; the latter\nformalization, concentrating on power schedules for seeds alone, is inattentive\nto the schedule for bytes in a seed. In this paper, we propose a lightweight\nfuzzing approach, Truzz, to optimize existing Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzers\n(CGFs). To address two aforementioned challenges, Truzz identifies the bytes\nrelated to the validation checks (i.e., the checks guarding error-handling\ncode), and protects those bytes from being frequently mutated, making most\ngenerated inputs examine the functionalities of programs, in lieu of being\nrejected by validation checks. The byte-wise relationship determination\nmitigates the problem of loading extra bytes when fuzzers infer the\nbyte-constraint relation. Furthermore, the proposed path transition within\nTruzz can efficiently prioritize the seed as the new path, harvesting many new\nedges, and the new path likely belongs to a code region with many undiscovered\ncode lines. The experimental results show that on average, Truzz can generate\n16.14% more inputs flowing into functional code, in addition to 24.75% more new\nedges than the vanilla fuzzers.

Based on the iterative method, we provide\na unified algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers (characteristic\nmultipliers) and determine the stability of the periodic linear differential\nequations on time scales unifying discrete, continuous, and hybrid dynamics.\nOur approach is based on calculating the value of A and B (see Theorem 3.1),\nwhich are the sum and product of all Floquet multipliers (characteristic\nmultipliers) of the system, respectively. We obtain an explicit expression of A\n(see Theorem 4.1) by the method of variation and approximation theory and an\nexplicit expression of B by Liouville's formula. Furthermore, a computer\nprogram is designed to realize our algorithm. Specifically, you can determine\nthe stability of a second order periodic linear system, whether they are\ndiscrete, continuous or hybrid, as long as you enter the program codes\nassociated with the parameters of the equation. In fact, few literatures have\ndealt with the algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers, not mention to\ndesign the program for its computer realization. Our algorithm gives the\nexplicit expressions of all Floquet multipliers and our computer program is\nbased on the approximations of these explicit expressions. In particular, on an\narbitrary discrete periodic time scale, we can do a finite number of\ncalculations to get the explicit value of Floquet multipliers (see Theorem\n4.2). Therefore, for any discrete periodic system, we can accurately determine\nthe stability of the system even without computer!

This technology allows producing CO2 free fuels. Thanks\nto its high flexibility, it may offer services to the power system, fostering\nVariable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) and the electricity demand match,\nmitigating the issues related to VRES overproduction. The role of P2G plants\nconnected to the transmission system as flexibility asset has been extensively\nanalyzed in the literature. Conversely, the analysis of these systems used at\ndistribution level has only been dealt with in a few studies: however, in this\ncase critical operation conditions can easily arise, both on electrical and gas\ninfrastructure. This article presents a methodological analysis on the impact\nof different simulation approaches when P2G is installed at distribution system\nlevel. The choice of the most appropriate modeling approaches for electricity\nand distribution grids is required in order to avoid overestimating or\nunderestimating the potential flexibility that P2G plants connected to\ndistribution networks can offer. The aim of this paper is to understand the\nimpact of different modeling approaches in order to determine whether, and\nunder which conditions, this is acceptable. An illustrative case study has been\ndeveloped to perform this kind of analysis. The results demonstrated that it is\nimportant to take into account the electric distribution network topology, as\nthe performance of P2G plants could be affected by their placement in the\nnetwork. Neglecting the dynamics of a gas network or the interactions between\nP2G plant components under a low gas demand condition can lead to an\nunderestimation of the flexibility of the entire system. If the demand for gas\nis high enough, the use of simplified assumptions that do not consider the\ndynamics of the gas network and P2G systems may be acceptable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 14:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 18:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

Often, deep learning-based methods are\nused to perform moving object segmentation (MOS). The performance of these\nnetworks, however, strongly depends on the diversity and amount of labeled\ntraining data, information that may be costly to obtain. In this paper, we\npropose an automatic data labeling pipeline for 3D LiDAR data to save the\nextensive manual labeling effort and to improve the performance of existing\nlearning-based MOS systems by automatically generating labeled training data.\nOur proposed approach achieves this by processing the data offline in batches.\nIt first exploits an occupancy-based dynamic object removal to detect possible\ndynamic objects coarsely. Second, it extracts segments among the proposals and\ntracks them using a Kalman filter. Based on the tracked trajectories, it labels\nthe actually moving objects such as driving cars and pedestrians as moving. In\ncontrast, the non-moving objects, e.g., parked cars, lamps, roads, or\nbuildings, are labeled as static. We show that this approach allows us to label\nLiDAR data highly effectively and compare our results to those of other label\ngeneration methods. We also train a deep neural network with our auto-generated\nlabels and achieve similar performance compared to the one trained with manual\nlabels on the same data, and an even better performance when using additional\ndatasets with labels generated by our approach.

We find a common model of the vertical aerosol\ndistribution that is consistent with the observed reflectivity spectra of both\nplanets, consisting of: 1) a deep aerosol layer with a base pressure > 5-7 bar,\nassumed to be composed of a mixture of H2S ice and photochemical haze; 2) a\nlayer of photochemical haze/ice, coincident with a layer of high static\nstability at the methane condensation level at 1-2 bar; and 3) an extended\nlayer of photochemical haze, likely mostly of the same composition as the\n1-2-bar layer, extending from this level up through to the stratosphere, where\nthe photochemical haze particles are thought to be produced.

While physicochemical bacteria filtration is well-documented, recent\nstudies showed that bacterial motility plays a key role in the transport\nprocess. Flow and transport experiments performed in microfluidic chips\ncontaining randomly placed obstacles confirmed that the distributions of\nnon-motile particles stays compact, whereas for the motile strains, the\ndistributions are characterized by both significant retention as well as fast\ndownstream motion. For motile bacteria, the detailed microscopic study of\nindividual bacteria trajectories reveals two salient features: (i) the\nemergence of an active retention process triggered by motility, (ii)\nenhancement of dispersion due to the exchange between fast flow channels and\nlow flow regions in the vicinity of the solid grains.

This approach accounts\nfor bacteria dispersion via variable pore-scale flow velocities through a\nMarkov model for equidistant particle speeds. Motility of bacteria is modeled\nby a two-rate trapping process that accounts for the motion towards and active\ntrapping at the obstacles. This approach captures the forward tails observed\nfor the distribution of bacteria displacements, and quantifies an enhanced\nhydrodynamic dispersion effect that originates in the interaction between flow\nat the pore-scale and bacterial motility. The model reproduces the experimental\nobservations, and predicts bacteria dispersion and transport at the macroscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 18:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 09:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

The current diagnostic procedure\nuses patient assessments to evaluate symptoms and sometimes a magnetic\nresonance imaging or MRI scan. However, symptom variations cause inaccurate\nassessments, and the analysis of MRI scans requires experienced specialists.\nThis research proposes to accurately diagnose PD severity with deep learning by\ncombining symptoms data and MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers\nInitiative database. A new hybrid model architecture was implemented to fully\nutilize both forms of clinical data, and models based on only symptoms and only\nMRI scans were also developed. The symptoms based model integrates a fully\nconnected deep learning neural network, and the MRI scans and hybrid models\nintegrate transfer learning based convolutional neural networks. Instead of\nperforming only binary classification, all models diagnose patients into five\nseverity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages\nfour and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms only, MRI scans only,\nand hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively.\nThe hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95.\nReal clinical cases confirm the strong performance of the hybrid, where\npatients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by\nthe hybrid. It is also consistent across the five severity stages, indicating\naccurate early detection.

Traditional waveform modeling of full-time and\nfull-frequency information is the split-step Fourier method (SSFM), which has\nlong been regarded as challenging in long-haul wavelength division multiplexing\n(WDM) optical fiber communication systems because it is extremely\ntime-consuming. Here we propose a linear-nonlinear feature decoupling\ndistributed (FDD) waveform modeling scheme to model long-haul WDM fiber\nchannel, where the channel linear effects are modelled by the NLSE-derived\nmodel-driven methods and the nonlinear effects are modelled by the data-driven\ndeep learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme only focuses on one-span\nfiber distance fitting, and then recursively transmits the model to achieve the\nrequired transmission distance. The proposed modeling scheme is demonstrated to\nhave high accuracy, high computing speeds, and robust generalization abilities\nfor different optical launch powers, modulation formats, channel numbers and\ntransmission distances. The total running time of FDD waveform modeling scheme\nfor 41-channel 1040-km fiber transmission is only 3 minutes versus more than 2\nhours using SSFM for each input condition, which achieves a 98% reduction in\ncomputing time.

Over the years, a number of frameworks for\ndata management and storage with various characteristics and features have\nbecome available. Most of these are highly efficient, but ultimately create\ndata silos. It becomes difficult to move and work coherently with data as new\nrequirements emerge as no single framework can efficiently fulfill the data\nmanagement needs of diverse applications. A possible solution is to design\nsmart and efficient hierarchical (multi-tier) storage solutions. A hierarchical\nstorage system (HSS) is a meta solution that consists of different storage\nframeworks organized as a jointly constructed large storage pool. It brings a\nnumber of benefits including better utilization of the storage,\ncost-efficiency, and use of different features provided by the underlying\nstorage frameworks. In order to maximize the gains of hierarchical storage\nsolutions, it is important that they include intelligent and autonomous\nmechanisms for data management grounded in the features of the different\nunderlying frameworks. These decisions should be made according to the\ncharacteristics of the dataset, tier status, and access patterns. These are\nhighly dynamic parameters and defining a policy based on the mentioned\nparameters is a non-trivial task. This paper presents an open-source\nhierarchical storage framework with a dynamic migration policy based on\nreinforcement learning (RL). We present a mathematical model, a software\narchitecture, and an implementation based on both simulations and a live\ncloud-based environment. We compare the proposed RL-based strategy to a\nbaseline of three rule-based policies, showing that the RL-based policy\nachieves significantly higher efficiency and optimal data distribution in\ndifferent scenarios compared to the dynamic rule-based policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 15:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}
