Ever since the initial theories of such quantum fluids were\nformulated, there has been speculation as to the possibility of multi-component\nquantum order. A particularly simple multi-component condensate is built from\nparticles occupying different quantum states, or bands, prior to condensation.\nThe particles in one or both bands may undergo condensation, as seen for\ncertain solids and anticipated for certain cold atom systems. For bulk solids,\nthe different bands always order simultaneously, with conventional pairing\ncharacterized by complex order parameters describing the condensates in each\nband. Another type of condensate, notably occurring at room temperature, has\nbeen identified for magnons, the magnetic analogue of lattice vibrations,\ninjected by microwaves into yttrium iron garnet.

When these globular\nclusters are susceptible to tidal disruption, this process likely starts\nalready inside the parent satellite leading to an early stellar stream within\nthe satellite. When the parent satellite merges with the Milky Way, the\nglobular cluster and its pre-merger stellar stream are accreted in a somewhat\nchaotic process. Here, we investigate the properties of the accreted stream\nafter the merger as we would see it today using a suite of simulations of\naccretion events. We find that the accretion process leads to a wide range of\nbehaviors, but generally scatters the accreted stream over a wide,\ntwo-dimensional area of the sky. The behavior ranges from a set of a few or\nmore well-defined \"sub-streams\" extending out from the post-merger thin stream\nby tens of degrees, to more widely dispersed debris over much of the sky,\ndepending on how close to the center of the MilkyWay the merger happened. Using\nmock Gaia-like observations of the simulated streams, we demonstrate that an\naccreted-stream component can explain the off-track features observed in the\nGD-1 stream. Sub-streams can appear like thin tidal streams themselves that are\nseemingly unassociated with the post-merger stream, raising the possibility\nthat some of the progenitor-less streams observed in the Milky Way are part of\na single or a few accreted streams created in an ancient merger event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 16:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

We detect mid-infrared (MIR) flares delayed by about\ntwo months relative to the optical outburst, with an extremely high peak\nluminosity of log(L_4.6um)>44 erg/s. The MIR peak luminosity is at least an\norder of magnitude higher than any known supernovae explosions, suggesting the\noptical outburst might be due to a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE).

Despite the dramatic X-ray variability,\nthere are no coincident strong flux variations in optical, UV and MIR bands.\nThis unusual variability behavior has been seen in other highly accreting AGNs\nand could be attributed to absorption variability. In this scenario, the\ndecrease in the covering factor of absorber with accretion rate could cause the\nX-ray brightening, possibly induced by the TDE. Most strikingly, while the\nUV/optical continuum remains little changes with time, an evident enhancement\nin the flux of H_alpha broad emission line is observed, about a decade after\nthe nuclear optical outburst, which is an anomalous behavior never seen in any\nother AGNs. Such an H_alpha anomaly could be explained by the replenishment of\ngas clouds and excitation within Broad Line Region (BLR) that originates,\nperhaps from the interaction of outflowing stellar debris with BLR. The results\nhighlight the importance of late-time evolution of TDE that could affect the\naccreting properties of AGN, as suggested by recent simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 16:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

We re-analyze the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations\ncovering the pre-outburst, outburst and post-outburst epochs, and confirm the\ndiscovery of the broad feature in the ~5--7 keV band during the period of\noutburst that could be interpreted as a relativistic Fe K_alpha emission line.\nOur analysis suggests that its flux has increased in tandem with the 2--10 keV\ncontinuum, making it the second changing look AGN in which the broad Fe K_alpha\nline responds to the X-ray continuum variability.

In addition, we\nfind the response of narrow Fe K_alpha emission line to the changes in the\nX-ray continuum on a time-scale as short as four months, allowing to put the\nlocation of line-emitting region at <0.1 pc, comparable to the size of optical\nBLR.

In this\npaper, we study the effect of compensated reviews on non-compensated reviews by\nutilizing online reviews on 1,240 auto shipping companies over a ten-year\nperiod from a transportation website. Because some online reviews have missing\ninformation on their compensation status, we first develop a classification\nalgorithm to differentiate compensated reviews from non-compensated reviews by\nleveraging a machine learning-based identification process, drawing upon the\nunique features of the compensated reviews. From the classification results, we\nempirically investigate the effects of compensated reviews on non-compensated.\nOur results indicate that the number of compensated reviews does indeed\nincrease the number of non-compensated reviews.

Besides methodological contributions in\ntext classification and empirical modeling, our study provides empirical\nevidence on how to prove the effectiveness of compensated online reviews in\nterms of improving the platform's overall online reviews and ratings.

In particular, we\nprove that whenever the local stepsizes are small, and the update direction is\ngiven by FedAvg in conjunction with Random Reshuffling over all clients, one\ncan take a big leap in the obtained direction and improve rates for convex,\nstrongly convex, and non-convex objectives.

Recently, Armas $et~al.$\nput this construction on a firmer footing by clearing up issues with apparent\ndivergent asymptotics.

Building on\nthis, we revisit the BZ perturbative expansion, and extend the perturbative\napproach to higher orders in the spin parameter of the Kerr black hole. We\nemploy matched-asymptotic-expansions and semi-analytic techniques to extend the\nsplit-monopole solution to the sixth-order in perturbation theory.

We show that these higher order terms result in non-analytic\ncontributions to the power and angular momentum output. In particular, we\ncompute for the first time the perturbative contributions to the energy\nextraction at seventh- and eighth-order in the spin parameter. The resulting\nformula for the energy extraction improves the agreement with numerical\nsimulations at finite spin. Moreover, we present a novel numerical procedure\nfor resolving the FFE equations across the outer light surface, resulting in\nsignificantly faster convergence and greater accuracy, and extend this to\nhigher orders as well.

To test the\nreusability claim, we asked TREC assessors to judge new pools created from new\nsearch results for the TREC-8 ad hoc collection. These new search results\nconsisted of five new runs (one each from three transformer-based models and\ntwo baseline runs that use BM25) plus the set of TREC-8 submissions that did\nnot previously contribute to pools. The new runs did retrieve previously unseen\ndocuments, but the vast majority of those documents were not relevant. The\nranking of all runs by mean evaluation score when evaluated using the official\nTREC-8 relevance judgment set and the newly expanded relevance set are almost\nidentical, with Kendall's tau correlations greater than 0.99. Correlations for\nindividual topics are also high. The TREC-8 ad hoc collection was originally\nconstructed using deep pools over a diverse set of runs, including several\neffective manual runs. Its judgment budget, and hence construction cost, was\nrelatively large. However, it does appear that the expense was well-spent: even\nwith the advent of neural techniques, the collection has stood the test of time\nand remains a reliable evaluation instrument as retrieval techniques have\nadvanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 17:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

Conventional planning methods can, thus, normally not be used when\nwanting to change costs in an adaptive way following the requirements of some\ntask. Here we show that one can define a neural network representation of path\nfinding problems by transforming cost values into synaptic weights, which\nallows for online weight adaptation using network learning mechanisms. When\nstarting with an initial activity value of one, activity propagation in this\nnetwork will lead to solutions, which are identical to those found by the\nBellman Ford algorithm. The neural network has the same algorithmic complexity\nas Bellman Ford and, in addition, we can show that network learning mechanisms\n(such as Hebbian learning) can adapt the weights in the network augmenting the\nresulting paths according to some task at hand. We demonstrate this by learning\nto navigate in an environment with obstacles as well as by learning to follow\ncertain sequences of path nodes. Hence, the here-presented novel algorithm may\nopen up a different regime of applications where path-augmentation (by\nlearning) is directly coupled with path finding in a natural way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 18:29:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 12:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2022 13:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

The model's capability is demonstrated by extracting\nstructure in recordings from retinal neurons, but it can be widely applied to\ndiscover and model latent structure in noisy binary data. In the context of\nspiking neural data, the task is to \"explain\" spikes of individual neurons in\nterms of groups of neurons, \"Cell Assemblies\" (CAs), that often fire together,\ndue to mutual interactions or other causes. The model infers sparse activity in\na set of binary latent variables, each describing the activity of a cell\nassembly. When the latent variable of a cell assembly is active, it reduces the\nprobabilities of neurons belonging to this assembly to be inactive. The\nconditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the\ndata in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent\nstates and parameter adjustments to the model.

By replacing the weights of a neural network with\nquantized (e.g., 4-bit, or binary) counterparts, massive savings in computation\ncost, memory, and power consumption are attained. To that end, we generalize a\npost-training neural-network quantization method, GPFQ, that is based on a\ngreedy path-following mechanism. Among other things, we propose modifications\nto promote sparsity of the weights, and rigorously analyze the associated\nerror. Additionally, our error analysis expands the results of previous work on\nGPFQ to handle general quantization alphabets, showing that for quantizing a\nsingle-layer network, the relative square error essentially decays linearly in\nthe number of weights -- i.e., level of over-parametrization. Our result holds\nacross a range of input distributions and for both fully-connected and\nconvolutional architectures thereby also extending previous results. To\nempirically evaluate the method, we quantize several common architectures with\nfew bits per weight, and test them on ImageNet, showing only minor loss of\naccuracy compared to unquantized models.

But these techniques are\nlimited in scope, labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any\nnetwork. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation possible? We\nintroduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual-information-guided linguistic\nannotation of neurons) that automatically labels neurons with open-ended,\ncompositional, natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a\ndescription by searching for a natural language string that maximizes pointwise\nmutual information with the image regions in which the neuron is active. MILAN\nproduces fine-grained descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and\nlogical structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high agreement\nwith human-generated feature descriptions across a diverse set of model\narchitectures and tasks, and can aid in understanding and controlling learned\nmodels. We highlight three applications of natural language neuron\ndescriptions.

However a single two-level quantum system (UDW detector) that remains\noutside of the horizon has been shown to distinguish between a black hole and\nits associated geon counterpart via its different response rates. Here we\nextend this investigation of the quantum vacuum outside of an $\\mathbb{RP}_2$\ngeon by considering the entanglement structure of the vacuum state of a quantum\nscalar field in this spacetime, and how this differs from its BTZ black hole\ncounterpart. Employing the entanglement harvesting protocol, where field\nentanglement is swapped to a pair of UDW detectors, we find that the\nclassically hidden topology of the geon can have an appreciable difference in\nthe amount of entanglement harvested in the two spacetimes for sufficiently\nsmall mass. In this regime, we find that detectors with a small energy gap\nharvest more entanglement in the BTZ spacetime; however as the energy gap\nincreases, the detectors harvest more entanglement in a geon spacetime. The\nenergy gap at the crossover is dependent on the black hole mass, occurring at a\nlower values for lower masses. This also impacts the size of the entanglement\nshadow, the region near the horizon where the detectors cannot harvest\nentanglement.

However,\nthe velocity distribution of field pulsars peaks at 5-10 times the escape\nvelocities of GCs. Consequently, only a small fraction of GC-NSs should have\nbeen retained, even accounting for low-velocity NSs formed through\nelectron-capture supernovae. Thus, too few low-velocity NSs should have been\nretained in GCs, giving rise to the NS retention problem in GCs. Here we\nsuggest a novel solution, in which the progenitors of most GC-NSs were ONe\nwhite-dwarfs (WDs) that accreted ambient intra-cluster gas and formed\nlow-velocity NSs through accretion induced collapse (AIC). The existence of an\nearly gas-enriched environment in GCs is supported by observations of GC\nmultiple stellar populations. It is thought that 10s-100s of Myrs after the\nformation of the first generation of stars, and after ONe-WDs were already\nformed, GCs were replenished with gas which formed a second generation of\nstars. Accretion of such replenished gas onto the ONe-WDs catalyzed the AIC\nprocesses. The number of AIC-formed NSs is then sufficient to explain the large\nnumber of NSs retained in GCs. Similar processes might also drive CO-WDs to\nproduce type-Ia SNe or to merge and form NSs, and similarly drive NSs to AIC\nand mergers producing BHs. Moreover, the wide variety of gas-catalyzed binary\nmergers and explosive transients suggest to occur in the gas-rich environments\nof AGN disk could similarly, and even more efficiently, occur in\nsecond-generation gas in GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 09:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

It is the first and the only\nknown isolated intra-cluster cloud detected in X-ray, H$\\alpha$, and CO\nemission. We found a total of about $2.2\\times 10^8 M_\\odot$ of H$_2$ with the\nIRAM 30-m telescope in two regions, one associated with the peak of H$\\alpha$\nemission and another with the peak of X-ray emission surrounded by weak\nH$\\alpha$ filaments. The velocity of the molecular gas is offset from the\nunderlying H$\\alpha$ emission by > 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the region where the\nX-ray peaks. The molecular gas may account for about 10% of the total cloud's\nmass, which is dominated by the hot X-ray component. The previously measured\nupper limit on the star formation rate in the cloud indicates that the\nmolecular component is in a non-star-forming state, possibly due to a\ncombination of low density of the gas and the observed level of velocity\ndispersion. The presence of the three gas phases associated with the cloud\nsuggests that gas phase mixing with the surrounding intra-cluster medium is\ntaking place. The possible origin of the orphan cloud is a late evolutionary\nstage of a ram pressure stripping event. In contrast, the nearby ram pressure\nstripped galaxy 2MASX J11443212+2006238 is in an early phase of stripping and\nwe detected about $2.4\\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ of H$_2$ in its main body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

We also characterise the instrument's\nstructural (mechanical and thermal) behaviour, discussing preliminary results\nfrom the background composition and the telescope-health monitoring variables.\nFinally, we discuss the implementations of an optimisation algorithm to improve\nthe volcano internal density distribution estimation and machine learning\ntechniques for background rejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 19:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

This effort has culminated in\nthe discovery of Cooper multiplets, in which the splitting of a Cooper pair is\nenabled via a series of Andreev reflections that entangle four (or more)\nelectrons. In this text, we show conclusively that multiplet resonances can\nalso emerge as a consequence of the three terminal circuit model. The\nsupercurrent appears due to the correlated phase dynamics at values that\ncorrespond to the multiplet condition $nV_1 = -mV_2$ of applied bias. The\nemergence of multiplet resonances is seen in i) a nanofabricated three-terminal\ngraphene Josephson junction, ii) an analog three terminal Josephson junction\ncircuit, and iii) a circuit simulation. The mechanism which stabilizes the\nstate of the system under those conditions is purely dynamical, and a close\nanalog to Kapitza's inverted pendulum problem. We describe parameter\nconsiderations that best optimize the detection of the multiplet lines both for\ndesign of future devices. Further, these supercurrents have a classically\nrobust $\\cos2\\phi$ energy contribution, which can be used to engineer qubits\nbased on higher harmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 20:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 19:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 15:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 13:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

As no searcher model yet exists that considers both aspects\nand the SAL domain, we propose, by augmenting the Complex Searcher Model (CSM),\nthe Subtopic Aware Complex Searcher Model (SACSM) - modelling aspects as\nsubtopics to the user's need. We then instantiate several agents (i.e.,\nsimulated users), with different subtopic selection strategies, which can be\nconsidered as different prototypical learning strategies (e.g., should I deeply\nexamine one subtopic at a time, or shallowly cover several subtopics?).\nFinally, we report on the first large-scale simulated analysis of user\nbehaviours in the SAL domain.

Both of these\nobservations, in turn, imply a more robust contribution from gas free mergers\nin the histories of typical elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 22:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

The end result is a lightweight online CPD algorithm, that is also\nexplainable by virtue of the well-appreciated interpretability of RDPG\nembeddings. This is in stark contrast with most existing graph CPD approaches,\nwhich either rely on extensive computation, or they store and process the\nentire observed time series. An apparent limitation of the RDPG model is its\nsuitability for undirected and unweighted graphs only, a gap we aim to close\nhere to broaden the scope of the CPD framework.

However, the understanding of several consequential\nphenomena, such as the Many-Body Localization (MBL), has been obstructed by the\nlack of a systematic approach to obtain many-body entanglement dynamics. This\npaper introduces the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) approach to\nentanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems and employs this new\nframework to demonstrate the mechanism of MBL in disordered spin chains. We\nshow that in the QCTF framework, the entanglement dynamics of two-level\nconstituent particles of a many-body quantum system can be fully characterized\ndirectly from the system's Hamiltonian, which circumvents the bottleneck of\ncalculating the many-body system's time-evolution. By employing the QCTF-based\napproach to entanglement dynamics, we demonstrate MBL dynamics in disordered\nHeisenberg spin chains through the suppressed quasi-periodic spin's\nentanglement evolution after a quench from an anti-ferromagnetic state.\nFurthermore, we prove the validity of a previous fundamental conjecture\nregarding the MBL phase by showing that in strongly-disordered spin chains with\nshort-range interactions, the quantum correlation between particles is\nexponentially attenuated with respect to the site-to-site distance. Moreover,\nwe obtain the lowest possible amplitude of the quasi-periodic spin's\nentanglement as a function of disorder in the chain. The QCTF analysis is\nverified by exact numerical simulation of the system's evolution. We also show\nthat QCTF provides a new foundation to study the Eigenstate Thermalization\nHypothesis (ETH). The QCTF methodology can be extended in various ways to\naddress general issues regarding non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics in spin\nlattices with different geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 22:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Although this has been\nverified for some special classes of graphs such as outerplanar graphs,\ncircular arc graphs, and series-parallel graphs, the answer is negative for\ngeneral graphs. In this paper, we prove among other results that if we replace\nthe vertex by a bond, then the answer is affirmative. A bond of a graph is a\nminimal nonempty edge-cut. In particular, in any 2-connected graph, the set of\nall edges incident to a vertex is a bond, called a vertex-bond. Clearly, for a\n2-connected graph, a path passes through a vertex $v$ if and only if it meets\nthe vertex-bond with respect to $v$. Therefore, a very natural approach to\nGallai's question is to study whether there is a bond meeting all longest\npaths. Let $p$ denote the length of a longest path of connected graphs. We show\nthat for any 2-connected graph, there is a bond meeting all paths of length at\nleast $p-1$.

In such\ncases, these mathematically different but similar looking functional forms are\ntypically considered interchangeable. Recent work, however, shows that similar\nfunctional responses may nonetheless result in significantly different\nbifurcation points for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the\nbifurcation behaviours include destabilising oscillations, predicting the\noccurrence of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different\nbifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained from the\nmodels. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to the extinction\nof both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions is also clearly\nimportant for conservationists. Mathematically, this difference in bifurcation\nstructure given similar functional responses is called structural sensitivity.\nWe extend the existing work to find that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey\nsystem is also structurally sensitive to the functional response. Using the\nRosenzweig-MacArthur and Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if\nthere is some way to obtain a functional description of data such that our\nmodel is not structurally sensitive. We first add stochasticity to the\nfunctional responses and find that better similarity of the resulting\nbifurcation structures is achieved. Then, we analyze the functional responses\nusing two different methods to determine which part of each function\ncontributes most to the observed bifurcation behaviour.

We generate constant-velocity positive streamers in air with\nan axisymmetric fluid model, by initially adjusting the applied voltage based\non the streamer velocity. After an initial transient, we observe steady\npropagation for velocities of $3\\times10^4$ m/s to $1.2\\times10^5$ m/s, during\nwhich streamer properties and the background field do not change. This\npropagation mode is not fully stable, in the sense that a small change in\nstreamer properties or background field eventually leads to acceleration or\ndeceleration. An important finding is that faster streamers are able to\npropagate in significantly lower background fields than slower ones, indicating\nthat there is no unique stability field. We relate the streamer radius,\nvelocity, maximal electric field and background electric field to a\ncharacteristic time scale for the loss of conductivity. This relation is\nqualitatively confirmed by studying streamers in N2-O2 mixtures with less\noxygen than air. In such mixtures, steady streamers require lower background\nfields, due to a reduction in the attachment and recombination rates.

These\nAI models are usually complicated mathematical functions that map from an input\nspace to an output space. Stakeholders are interested to know the rationales\nbehind models' decisions and functional behavior. We study this functional\nbehavior in relation to the data used to create the models. On this topic,\nscholars have often assumed that models do not extrapolate, i.e., they learn\nfrom their training samples and process new input by interpolation. This\nassumption is questionable: we show that models extrapolate frequently; the\nextent of extrapolation varies and can be socially consequential. We\ndemonstrate that extrapolation happens for a substantial portion of datasets\nmore than one would consider reasonable. How can we trust models if we do not\nknow whether they are extrapolating? Given a model trained to recommend\nclinical procedures for patients, can we trust the recommendation when the\nmodel considers a patient older or younger than all the samples in the training\nset? If the training set is mostly Whites, to what extent can we trust its\nrecommendations about Black and Hispanic patients? Which dimension (race,\ngender, or age) does extrapolation happen? Even if a model is trained on people\nof all races, it still may extrapolate in significant ways related to race. The\nleading question is, to what extent can we trust AI models when they process\ninputs that fall outside their training set? This paper investigates several\nsocial applications of AI, showing how models extrapolate without notice. We\nalso look at different sub-spaces of extrapolation for specific individuals\nsubject to AI models and report how these extrapolations can be interpreted,\nnot mathematically, but from a humanistic point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 01:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

FL involves\nthe collaborative training of a single ML model among edge devices on their\ndistributed datasets while keeping data locally. While FL requires less\ncommunication compared to classical distributed learning, it remains hard to\nscale for large models. In vehicular networks, FL must be adapted to the\nlimited communication resources, the mobility of the edge nodes, and the\nstatistical heterogeneity of data distributions. Indeed, a judicious\nutilization of the communication resources alongside new perceptive\nlearning-oriented methods are vital.

To\nensure heterogeneous service requirements for different vehicles, we propose a\nnetwork slicing architecture. We focus on a non-cellular network scenario where\nvehicles communicate by the broadcast approach via the direct device-to-device\ninterface. In such a vehicular network, resource allocation among vehicles is\nvery difficult, mainly due to (i) the rapid variation of wireless channels\namong highly mobile vehicles and (ii) the lack of a central coordination point.\nThus, the possibility of acquiring instantaneous channel state information to\nperform centralized resource allocation is precluded. The resource allocation\nproblem considered is therefore very complex. It includes not only the usual\nspectrum and power allocation, but also coverage selection (which target\nvehicles to broadcast to) and packet selection (which network slice to use).\nThis problem must be solved jointly since selected packets can be overlaid\nusing NOMA and therefore spectrum and power must be carefully allocated for\nbetter vehicle coverage. To do so, we provide a optimization approach and study\nthe NP-hardness of the problem. Then, we model the problem using multi-agent\nMarkov decision process. Finally, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\napproach to solve the problem. The proposed DRL algorithm is practical because\nit can be implemented in an online and distributed manner.

However, forest occlusion poses challenges for marker-based\nregistration methods, and some marker-free automated registration methods have\nlow efficiency due to the process of object (e.g., tree, crown) segmentation.\nTherefore, we use a divide-and-conquer strategy and propose an automated and\nefficient method to register ULS and ground LiDAR point clouds in forests.\nRegistration involves coarse alignment and fine registration, where the coarse\nalignment of point clouds is divided into vertical and horizontal alignment.\nThe vertical alignment is achieved by ground alignment, which is achieved by\nthe transformation relationship between normal vectors of the ground point\ncloud and the horizontal plane, and the horizontal alignment is achieved by\ncanopy projection image matching. During image matching, vegetation points are\nfirst distinguished by the ground filtering algorithm, and then, vegetation\npoints are projected onto the horizontal plane to obtain two binary images. To\nmatch the two images, a matching strategy is used based on canopy shape context\nfeatures, which are described by a two-point congruent set and canopy overlap.\nFinally, we implement coarse alignment of ULS and ground LiDAR datasets by\ncombining the results of ground alignment and image matching and finish fine\nregistration. Also, the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod are demonstrated by field measurements of forest plots. Experimental\nresults show that the ULS and ground LiDAR data in different plots are\nregistered, of which the horizontal alignment errors are less than 0.02 m, and\nthe average runtime of the proposed method is less than 1 second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 03:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

The active filament was rooted in a small sunspot of the\nactive region. Particularly, it underwent the partial eruption in three steps,\ni.e. the precursor, the first eruption, and the second eruption, while the\nlater two were associated with a C1.0 flare and a C3.9 flare, respectively.\nDuring the precursor, slow magnetic reconnection took place between the\nfilament and the adjoining loops that also rooted in the sunspot. The\ncontinuous reconnection not only caused the filament to split into three groups\nof threads vertically but also formed a new filament, which was growing and\naccompanied brightening took place around the site. Subsequently, the growing\nfilament erupted together with one group splitted threads, resulted in the\nfirst eruption. At the beginning of the first eruption, a subsequent magnetic\nreconnection occurred between the erupting splitted threads and another ambient\nmagnetic loop. After about three minutes, the second eruption occurred as a\nresult of the eruption of two larger unstable filaments induced by the magnetic\nreconnection. The high-resolution observation provides a direct evidence that\nmagnetic reconnection between filament and its ambient magnetic fields could\ninduce the vertical splitting of the filament, resulting in partial eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 04:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

However, the limitation of imaging\nsensors has reduced its spatial resolution that causes detail loss. One\nsolution is to fuse the low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and\nthe panchromatic image (PAN) with inverse features to get the high-resolution\nhyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Most of the existing fusion methods just focus on\nsmall fusion ratios like 4 or 6, which might be impractical for some large\nratios' HSI and PAN image pairs. Moreover, the ill-posedness of restoring\ndetail information in HSI with hundreds of bands from PAN image with only one\nband has not been solved effectively, especially under large fusion ratios.\nTherefore, a lightweight unmixing-based pan-guided fusion network (Pgnet) is\nproposed to mitigate this ill-posedness and improve the fusion performance\nsignificantly.

Generally, the\nteacher models used to teach smaller student models are cumbersome in nature\nand expensive to train. To eliminate the necessity for a cumbersome teacher\nmodel completely, we propose a simple yet effective knowledge distillation\nframework that we termed Dynamic Rectification Knowledge Distillation (DR-KD).\nOur method transforms the student into its own teacher, and if the self-teacher\nmakes wrong predictions while distilling information, the error is rectified\nprior to the knowledge being distilled.

To alleviate labeled data scarcity, self-training\nmethods have been widely adopted on graphs by labeling high-confidence\nunlabeled nodes and then adding them to the training step. In this line, we\nempirically make a thorough study for current self-training methods on graphs.\nSurprisingly, we find that high-confidence unlabeled nodes are not always\nuseful, and even introduce the distribution shift issue between the original\nlabeled dataset and the augmented dataset by self-training, severely hindering\nthe capability of self-training on graphs. To this end, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Distribution Recovered Graph Self-Training framework (DR-GST),\nwhich could recover the distribution of the original labeled dataset.\nSpecifically, we first prove the equality of loss function in self-training\nframework under the distribution shift case and the population distribution if\neach pseudo-labeled node is weighted by a proper coefficient. Considering the\nintractability of the coefficient, we then propose to replace the coefficient\nwith the information gain after observing the same changing trend between them,\nwhere information gain is respectively estimated via both dropout variational\ninference and dropedge variational inference in DR-GST.

Testing Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) via\natomic systems attracts extensive interests in theory and experiment. Some\nrecent proposals for testing LSV present that the effects of violation can be\ndescribed as a local interaction. Further, the test precision of LSV can be\nenhanced via quantum entanglement and its quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nimplicates that the test precision can asymptotically reach the Heisenberg\nlimit. In general, the limited resolution of collective observables prevents\nthe detection of large QFI. Here, we propose a multimode many-body quantum\ninterferometry for testing the LSV parameter $\\kappa$ via an ensemble of spinor\natoms. By employing an $N$-atom multimode GHZ state, the test precision can\nattain the Heisenberg limit $\\Delta \\kappa \\propto 1/(F^2N)$ with the spin\nlength $F$ and the atomic number $N$. We find an actual observable (or\npractical measurement process) to achieve the ultimate precision and study the\nLSV test via an experimentally accessible three-mode interferometry with Bose\ncondensed spin-1 atoms for example. By selecting suitable input states and\nunitary recombination operation, the LSV parameter $\\kappa$ can be extracted\nvia population measurement. Especially, the measurement precision of the LSV\nparameter $\\kappa$ can beat the standard quantum limit and even approach the\nHeisenberg limit via spin mixing dynamics or driving through quantum phase\ntransitions.\n  Our proposed scheme may open up a feasible way for a drastic improvement of\nthe LSV tests with atomic systems and provide an alternative application of\nmulti-particle entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 02:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 05:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 09:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

Multiple side-channel attacks, which seek to\nexploit shared components for leaking information, have been devised, mostly\ntargeting shared caching components. In response, the research community has\nproposed multiple cache designs that aim at curbing the source of side\nchannels. With multiple competing designs, there is a need for assessing the\nlevel of security against side-channel attacks that each design offers.\n  In this work we propose CacheFX, a flexible framework for assessing and\nevaluating the resilience of cache designs to side-channel attacks. CacheFX\nallows the evaluator to implement various cache designs, victims, and\nattackers, as well as to exercise them for assessing the leakage of information\nvia the cache.\n  To demonstrate the power of CacheFX, we implement multiple cache designs and\nreplacement algorithms, and devise three evaluation metrics that measure\ndifferent aspects of the caches:(1) the entropy induced by a memory access; (2)\nthe complexity of building an eviction set; and (3) protection against\ncryptographic attacks. Our experiments highlight that different security\nmetrics give different insights to designs, making a comprehensive analysis\nmandatory. For instance, while eviction-set building was fastest for randomized\nskewed caches, these caches featured lower eviction entropy and higher\npractical attack complexity. Our experiments show that all non-partitioned\ndesigns allow for effective cryptographic attacks. However, in state-of-the-art\nsecure caches, eviction-based attacks are more difficult to mount than\noccupancy-based attacks, highlighting the need to consider the latter in cache\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Different from images\nwhere RGB pixels are stored in the regular grid, for point clouds, the\nunderlying semantic and structural information of point clouds is the spatial\nlayout of the points. Moreover, the properties of challenging in-context and\nbackground noise pose more challenges to point cloud analysis. One assumption\nis that the poor performance of the classification model can be attributed to\nthe indistinguishable embedding feature that impedes the search for the optimal\nclassifier. This work offers a new strategy for learning powerful\nrepresentations via a contrastive learning approach that can be embedded into\nany point cloud classification network. First, we propose a supervised\ncontrastive classification method to implement embedding feature distribution\nrefinement by improving the intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability.

However, objects often follow a non-linear\nmotion pattern in the real domain and some recent methods attempt to model\nper-pixel motion by non-linear models (e.g., quadratic). A quadratic model can\nalso be inaccurate, especially in the case of motion discontinuities over time\n(i.e. sudden jerks) and occlusions, where some of the flow information may be\ninvalid or inaccurate.\n  In our paper, we propose to approximate the per-pixel motion using a\nspace-time convolution network that is able to adaptively select the motion\nmodel to be used. Specifically, we are able to softly switch between a linear\nand a quadratic model. Towards this end, we use an end-to-end 3D CNN\nencoder-decoder architecture over bidirectional optical flows and occlusion\nmaps to estimate the non-linear motion model of each pixel. Further, a motion\nrefinement module is employed to refine the non-linear motion and the\ninterpolated frames are estimated by a simple warping of the neighboring frames\nwith the estimated per-pixel motion.

Recent literature suggests that if the spacetime metric is not\nfixed, e.g. because it is to be quantized along with the other fields, one may\nnot be able to avoid considering the Feynman integral in the original Lorentz\nsignature, without Wick rotation. Several mathematical phenomena are known,\nhowever, which are at some point showstoppers to a mathematically sound\ndefinition of Feynman integral in Lorentz signature. The Feynman integral\nformulation, however, is known to have a differential reformulation, called to\nbe the master Dyson--Schwinger (MDS) equation for the field correlators. In\nthis paper it is shown that a particular presentation of the MDS equation can\nbe cast into a mathematically rigorously defined form: the involved function\nspaces and operators can be strictly defined and their properties can be\nestablished. Therefore, MDS equation can serve as a substitute for the Feynman\nintegral, in a mathematically sound formulation of constructive QFT, in\narbitrary signature, without a fixed background causal structure. It is also\nshown that even in such a generally covariant setting, there is a canonical way\nto define the Wilsonian regularization of the MDS equation. The main result of\nthe paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for the regularized MDS\nsolution space to be nonempty, for conformally invariant Lagrangians. This\ntheorem also provides an iterative approximation algorithm for obtaining\nregularized MDS solutions, and is guaranteed to be convergent whenever the\nsolution space is nonempty. The algorithm could eventually serve as a method\nfor putting Lorentz signature QFTs onto lattice, in the original metric\nsignature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 09:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 15:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

To reduce the barrier for\nsoftware engineers and data scientists to adopt FPGAs, C++- and OpenCL-based\ndesign entries with high-level synthesis (HLS) have been introduced. They\nprovide higher abstraction compared to register-transfer level (RTL)-based\ndesign. HLS offers faster development time, better maintainability and more\nflexibility in code exploration, when evaluating options for multi-dimension\ntensors, convolutional layers or parallelism. Thus, HLS has been adopted by DNN\naccelerator generation frameworks such as FINN and hls4ml.\n  In this paper, we present an alternative backend RTL library for FINN. We\ninvestigate and evaluate, across a spectrum of design dimensions, an RTL-based\nimplementation versus the original HLS variant. We show that for smaller design\nparameters, RTL produces significantly smaller circuits. For larger circuits,\nhowever, the look-up table (LUT) count of RTL-based design is slightly higher,\nup to around $15\\%$. On the other hand, HLS consistently requires more\nflip-flops (FFs) (orders-of-magnitude increase) and block RAMs (BRAMs)\n($2\\times$ more). This also impacts the critical path delay, with RTL producing\nsignificantly faster circuits, up to $80\\%$. Furthermore, RTL also benefits\nfrom at-least a $10\\times$ reduction in synthesis time. Finally the results\nwere practically validated using a real-world use case of a multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) network used in network intrusion detection. Overall, since\nHLS frameworks code-generate the hardware design, the benefits of the ease in\nthe design entry is less important as compared to synthesis time reduction\ntogther with resource benefits, this might make the RTL abstraction an\nattractive alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

We\nconsider a recently proposed particle acceleration mechanism called stochastic\nshock drift acceleration (SSDA). We find that SSDA may be understood as a\ndiffusive particle acceleration mechanism at an oblique shock of finite\nthickness. More specifically, it is described by a solution to the\ndiffusion-convection equation for particles with the characteristic diffusion\nlength comparable to the shock thickness. On the other hand, the same equation\nyields the standard DSA if the diffusion length is much longer than the\nthickness. Although SSDA predicts, in general, a spectral index steeper than\nDSA, it is much more efficient for low-energy electron acceleration and is\nfavorable for injection. The injection threshold energy corresponds to the\ntransition energy between the two different regimes.

However, high-precision satellite photometry\nreveals tiny complex features in the light curves of some of these stars that\nare difficult to explain as caused by a surface phenomenon under reasonable\nassumptions. These features might originate from light extinction in corotating\nmagnetospheric clouds supported by a complex magnetic field dominated by\nhigher-order multipoles. We aim to understand the photometric signatures of\ncorotating magnetospheres that are governed by higher-order multipoles. We\ndetermined the location of magnetospheric clouds from the minima of the\neffective potential along the magnetic field lines for different orders of\nmultipoles and their combination. From the derived magnetospheric density\ndistribution, we calculated light curves accounting for absorption and\nsubsequent emission of light. For axisymmetric multipoles, the rigidly rotating\nmagnetosphere model is able to explain the observed tiny features in the light\ncurves only when the higher-order multipoles dominate the magnetic field not\nonly at the stellar surface, but even at the Kepler radius. However, even a\nrelatively weak nonaxisymmetric component leads to warping of equilibrium\nsurfaces. This introduces structures that can explain the tiny features\nobserved in the light curves of chemically peculiar stars. The light emission\ncontributes to the light variability only if a significant fraction of light is\nabsorbed in the magnetosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 10:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

However, TTVs can also prevent the detection of small planets in\ntransit surveys, or bias the recovered planetary and transit parameters. Here\nwe show that Kepler-1972 c, initially the \"not transit-like\" false positive\nKOI-3184.02, is an Earth-sized planet whose orbit is perturbed by Kepler-1972 b\n(initially KOI-3184.01). The pair is locked in a 3:2 Mean-motion resonance,\neach planet displaying TTVs of more than 6h hours of amplitude over the\nduration of the Kepler mission. The two planets have similar masses $m_b/m_c\n=0.956_{-0.051}^{+0.056}$ and radii $R_b=0.802_{-0.041}^{+0.042}R_{Earth}$,\n$R_c=0.868_{-0.050}^{+0.051}R_{Earth}$, and the whole system, including the\ninner candidate KOI-3184.03, appear to be coplanar.

Recovering\nthe correct ephemerides of the planets is essential to have a complete picture\nof the observed planetary systems.

The line profile and\nwidth of [O I] are employed to infer the ejecta geometry and the expansion\nvelocity of the inner core. These two measurements are then compared with the\nSN sub types, and further with the [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, which is used as an\nindicator of the progenitor CO core mass. Based on the best fit results of the\n[O I] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups,\nand we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature\nfor all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at about 1 sigma level) that the\ndistributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical\nSESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O I] width and [O I]/[Ca\nII] ratio is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to\nexpand faster for objects with a more massive CO core. Such a correlation can\nbe utilized to constrain the relation between the progenitor mass and the\nkinetic energy of the explosion. Further, when [O I]/[Ca II] ratio increases,\nthe fraction of objects with Gaussian [O I] profile increases, while those with\ndouble-peaked profile decreases. This phenomenon connects ejecta geometry and\nthe progenitor CO core mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 12:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Optical quasar polarisation appears to be\npreferentially either aligned or orthogonal to the host large-scale structure,\nspecifically large quasar groups (LQGs). Using a sample of 71 LQGs at redshifts\n$1.0 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$, we investigate whether LQGs themselves exhibit\ncorrelated orientation. We find that LQG position angles (PAs) are unlikely to\nbe drawn from a uniform distribution ($p$-values $0.008 \\lesssim p \\lesssim\n0.07$). The LQG PA distribution is bimodal, with median modes at\n$\\bar{\\theta}\\sim45\\pm2^{\\circ}, 136\\pm2^{\\circ}$, remarkably close to the mean\nangles of quasar radio polarisation reported in two regions coincident with our\nLQG sample. We quantify the degree of alignment in the PA data, and find that\nLQGs are aligned and orthogonal across very large scales. The maximum\nsignificance is $\\simeq 0.8\\%$ ($2.4\\sigma$) at typical angular (proper)\nseparations of $\\sim 30^{\\circ}$ (1.6 Gpc). If the LQG orientation correlation\nis real, it represents large-scale structure alignment over scales larger than\nthose predicted by cosmological simulations and at least an order of magnitude\nlarger than any so far observed, with the exception of quasar-polarisation /\nradio-jet alignment. We conclude that LQG alignment helps explain\nquasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment, but raises challenging questions\nabout the origin of the LQG correlation and the assumptions of the concordance\ncosmological model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 12:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

Nowadays, it can be performed using a\ndorsal approach by fixing a plate to the bones and a new radial approach is in\ndevelopment. To date, there is no consensus on the biomechanically optimal and\nmost reliable surgical construct for four-corner arthrodesis. Methods: To\nevaluate them biomechanically and thus assist the surgeon in choosing the best\nimplant orientation, radial or dorsal, the two different four-corner\narthrodesis surgical constructs were virtually simulated on a 3D finite element\nmodel representing all major structures of the wrist. Two different realistic\nload sets were applied to the model, representing common tasks for the elderly.\nFindings: Results consistency was assessed by comparing with the literature the\nforce magnitude computed on the carpal bones. The Von Mises stress distribution\nin the radial and dorsal plates were calculated. Stress concentration was\nlocated at the plate-screw interface for both surgical constructs, with a\nmaximum stress value of 413 MPa for the dorsal plate compared to 326 MPa for\nthe radial plate, meaning that the stress levels are more unfavourable in the\ndorsal approach. Interpretation: Although some bending stress was found in one\nload case, the radial plate was mechanically more robust in the other load\ncase. Despite some limitations, this study provides, for the first time,\nquantified evidence that the newly developed radial surgical construct is\nmechanically as efficient as the dorsal surgical construct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 12:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

In this paper, we provide several new\nresults on when one can or cannot expect benign overfitting to occur, for both\nregression and classification tasks. We consider a prototypical and rather\ngeneric data model for benign overfitting of linear predictors, where an\narbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension $k$ is concatenated with a\nhigh-dimensional distribution. For linear regression which is not necessarily\nwell-specified, we show that the minimum-norm interpolating predictor (that\nstandard training methods converge to) is biased towards an inconsistent\nsolution in general, hence benign overfitting will generally not occur.\nMoreover, we show how this can be extended beyond standard linear regression,\nby an argument proving how the existence of benign overfitting on some\nregression problems precludes its existence on other regression problems. We\nthen turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much\nmore favorable. Specifically, we prove that the max-margin predictor (to which\nstandard training methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically\nbiased towards minimizing a weighted \\emph{squared hinge loss}. This allows us\nto reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler\nquestion of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification\nerror, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 12:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 07:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 10:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 08:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Accordingly, this work addresses\nthe problem of human gesture recognition. In particular, we focus on head and\neye gestures, and adopt an egocentric (first-person) perspective using eyewear\ncameras. We argue that this egocentric view may offer a number of conceptual\nand technical benefits over scene- or robot-centric perspectives. A\nmotion-based recognition approach is proposed, which operates at two temporal\ngranularities. Locally, frame-to-frame homographies are estimated with a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). The output of this CNN is input to a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) to capture longer-term temporal visual relationships,\nwhich are relevant to characterize gestures. Regarding the configuration of the\nnetwork architecture, one particularly interesting finding is that using the\noutput of an internal layer of the homography CNN increases the recognition\nrate with respect to using the homography matrix itself. While this work\nfocuses on action recognition, and no robot or user study has been conducted\nyet, the system has been designed to meet real-time constraints. The\nencouraging results suggest that the proposed egocentric perspective is viable,\nand this proof-of-concept work provides novel and useful contributions to the\nexciting area of HRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 13:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 17:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

The latter adaptively rescales the loss function of the generated signal\nfor all channels by comparing the overall range of muscle activity and thus\ndynamically evaluates similarities between both signals. The model achieves a\nremarkable precision for previously trained motion while new motions that were\nnot trained before still have high accuracy. Further, these models are trained\non multiple subjects and thus are able to generalize across individuals. In\naddition, we distinguish between a general model that has been trained on\nseveral subjects, a subject-specific model, and a specific pre-trained model\nthat uses the general model as a basis and is adapted to a specific subject\nafterward.

The brane is\nparallel to the AdS boundary and it divides the space into two regions with\ndistinct properties of the fermionic vacuum.

Adversarial\ngenerative methods, e.g., DualGAN, are utilized for unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation to minimize the pixel-level domain gap, which is one of the common\napproaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, the existing\nimage translation methods are facing two problems when performing RS images\ntranslation: 1) ignoring the scale discrepancy between two RS datasets which\ngreatly affects the accuracy performance of scale-invariant objects, 2)\nignoring the characteristic of real-to-real translation of RS images which\nbrings an unstable factor for the training of the models. In this paper,\nResiDualGAN is proposed for RS images translation, where an in-network resizer\nmodule is used for addressing the scale discrepancy of RS datasets, and a\nresidual connection is used for strengthening the stability of real-to-real\nimages translation and improving the performance in cross-domain semantic\nsegmentation tasks. Combined with an output space adaptation method, the\nproposed method greatly improves the accuracy performance on common benchmarks,\nwhich demonstrates the superiority and reliability of ResiDuanGAN.

NVMs suffer from\nthe read disturb issue, where the programmed resistance state drifts upon\nrepeated access of a cell during inference. Resistance drifts can lower the\ninference accuracy. To address this, it is necessary to periodically reprogram\nmodel parameters (a high overhead operation). We study read disturb failures of\nan NVM cell. Our analysis show both a strong dependency on model\ncharacteristics such as synaptic activation and criticality, and on the voltage\nused to read resistance states during inference.

Hence, it\nis vital to build a more practical black-box threat model to overcome this\nlimitation and evaluate the vulnerability of deployed models.

In the coded caching literature, the notion of\nprivacy is considered only against demands. On the motivation that multi-round\ntransmissions almost appear everywhere in real communication systems, this\npaper formulates the coded caching problem with private demands and caches.\nOnly one existing private caching scheme, which is based on introducing virtual\nusers, can preserve the privacy of demands and caches simultaneously, but with\nan extremely large subpacketization exponential to the product of the numbers\nof users and files in the system. In order to reduce the subpacketization while\nsatisfying the privacy constraint, we propose a novel approach which constructs\nprivate coded caching schemes through private information retrieval (PIR).\nBased on this approach, we propose novel schemes with private demands and\ncaches which have a subpacketization level in the order exponential to $K$\n(number of users) against $NK$ in the virtual user scheme where $N$ stands for\nthe numbers of files. As a by-product, for the coded caching problem with\nprivate demands, a private coded caching scheme could be obtained from the\nproposed approach, which generally improves the memory-load tradeoff of the\nprivate coded caching scheme by Yan and Tuninetti.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 14:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 11:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

They have been observed in Halpha and optical\nlines for more than 50 years and called surges. The term \"jet\" comes from X-ray\nobservations after the launch of the Yohkoh satellite in 1991. They are the\nmeans of transporting energy through the heliosphere and participate to the\ncorona heating and the acceleration of solar wind. Several characteristics have\nbeen derived about their velocities, their rates of occurrence, and their\nrelationship with CMEs. However, the initiation mechanism of jets, e.g.\nemerging flux, flux cancellation, or twist, is still debated. In the last\ndecade coordinated observations of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS) with the instruments on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) allow\nto make a step forward for understanding the trigger of jets and the\nrelationship between hot jets and cool surges. We observe at the same time the\ndevelopment of 2D and 3D MHD numerical simulations to interpret the results.\nThis paper summarizes recent studies of jets showing the loci of magnetic\nreconnection in null points or in bald patch regions forming a current sheet.\nIn the pre-jet phase a twist is frequently detected by the existence of a mini\nfilament close to the dome of emerging flux. The twist can also be transferred\nto the jet from a flux rope in the vicinity of the reconnection by slippage of\nthe polarities. Bidirectional flows are detected at the reconnection sites. We\nshow the role of magnetic currents detected in the footprints of flux rope and\nquasi-separatrix layers for initiating the jets.\n  We select a few studies and show that with the same observations, different\ninterpretations are possible based on different approaches e.g. non linear\nforce free field extrapolation or 3D MHD simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 14:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Although weak\nsupervision is beneficial, it is not entirely reliable, for the results are\nquite sensitive to the neighboring images considered.

By self-awareness\nhere, we refer to the solution derived from the image itself in the form of\nsaliency cue, which can also be unreliable if applied alone. Nevertheless,\ncombining these two paradigms together can lead to a better co-localization\nability.

Therefore, we call this method \\textit{ASOC}: Adaptive Self-aware\nObject Co-localization.

We use the Landau collisional operator and\nthe moment method of Grad. We focus on the 21-moment model that is analogous to\nthe Braginskii model, and we also consider a 22-moment model. Both models are\nformulated for general multi-species plasmas with arbitrary masses and\ntemperatures, where all the fluid moments are described by their evolution\nequations. The 21-moment model contains two \"heat flux vectors\" (3rd and\n5th-order moments) and two \"viscosity-tensors\" (2nd and 4th-order moments). The\nBraginskii model is then obtained as a particular case of a one ion-electron\nplasma with similar temperatures, with de-coupled heat fluxes and\nviscosity-tensors expressed in a quasi-static approximation. We provide all the\nnumerical values of the Braginskii model in a fully analytic form (together\nwith the 4th and 5th-order moments). For multi-species plasmas, the model makes\ncalculation of transport coefficients straightforward. Formulation in fluid\nmoments (instead of Hermite moments) is also suitable for implementation into\nexisting numerical codes. It is emphasized that it is the quasi-static\napproximation which makes some Braginskii coefficients divergent in a\nweakly-collisional regime. Importantly, we show that the heat fluxes and\nviscosity-tensors are coupled even in the linear approximation, and that the\nfully contracted (scalar) perturbations of the 4th-order moment, which are\naccounted for in the 22-moment model, modify the energy exchange rates. We also\nprovide several Appendices, which can be useful as a guide for deriving the\nBraginskii model with the moment method of Grad.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 08:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

We wish to\nachieve heat to work conversion in the setup while avoiding the use of a\nworking substance (medium) or macroscopic heat baths. The core issues we\nconsider, taking account of the quantum nature of the setup, are: (i) How and\nto what extent can information act as work resource or, conversely, be\nredundant for work extraction? (ii) What is the optimal way of extracting work\nvia information acquired by measurements? (iii) What is the bearing of\ninformation on the efficiency-power tradeoff achievable in such setups?

State-of-the-art models for\nTTL caches assume zero object fetch delay, i.e., the time required to fetch a\nrequested object that is not in cache from a different cache or the origin\nserver. Particularly, in cache hierarchies, this delay has a significant impact\non performance metrics such as the object hit probability. Recent work suggests\nthat the impact of the object fetch delay on the cache performance will\ncontinue to increase due to the scaling mismatch between shrinking\ninter-request times (due to higher data center link rates) in contrast to\nprocessing and memory access times.\n  In this paper, we analyze tree-based cache hierarchies with random object\nfetch delays and provide an exact analysis of the corresponding object hit\nprobability. Our analysis allows understanding the impact of random delays and\nTTLs on cache metrics for a wide class of request stream models characterized\nthrough Markov arrival processes. This is expressed through a metric that we\ndenote delay impairment of the hit probability. In addition, we analyze and\nextend state-of-the-art approximations of the hit probability to take the delay\ninto account. We provide numerical and trace-based simulation-based evaluation\nresults showing that larger TTLs do not efficiently compensate for the\ndetrimental effect of object fetch delays. Our evaluations also show that\nunlike our exact model the state-of-the-art approximations do not capture the\nimpact of the object fetch delay well especially for cache hierarchies.\nSurprisingly, we show that the impact of this delay on the hit probability is\nnot monotonic but depends on the request stream properties, as well as, the\nTTL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Under mild\nassumptions similar to those employed by modern fast solvers for linear\nprograms, our reduction causes only a polylogarithmic multiplicative increase\nin the size of the program and runs in nearly-linear time. Our reduction\napplies to high-accuracy approximation algorithms and exact algorithms. Given\nan approximate solution to the 2-commodity flow problem, we can extract a\nsolution to the linear program in linear time with only a polynomial factor\nincrease in the error. This implies that any algorithm that solves the\n2-commodity flow problem can solve linear programs in essentially the same\ntime. Given a directed graph with edge capacities and two source-sink pairs,\nthe goal of the 2-commodity flow problem is to maximize the sum of the flows\nrouted between the two source-sink pairs subject to edge capacities and flow\nconservation. A 2-commodity flow can be directly written as a linear program,\nand thus we establish a nearly-tight equivalence between these two classes of\nproblems.\n  Our proof follows the outline of Itai's polynomial-time reduction of a linear\nprogram to a 2-commodity flow problem (JACM'78).

In addition, we establish an error\nbound for approximately solving each intermediate problem in the reduction, and\nshow that the accumulated error is polynomially bounded. We remark that our\nreduction does not run in strongly polynomial time and that it is open whether\n2-commodity flow and linear programming are equivalent in strongly polynomial\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

First, we\ntheoretically study the accuracy of this algorithm on near-term quantum\ncomputers with noisy gates, and we derive some rigorous error bounds that\ndepend on the timestep of the collision model and on the gate errors.

Importantly,\nwithin-patient seizure evolutions do not change randomly over time, but instead\nappear to fluctuate over circadian and slower timescales. However, the specific\ntimescales of this variability, as well as the specific seizure characteristics\nthat change over time, are unclear.\n  Here we analysed this within-patient seizure variability in 10 patients with\nchronic intracranial EEG recordings (185-767 days of recording time, 57-452\nanalysed seizures/patient). We characterised the seizure evolutions as\nsequences of a finite number of functional network states. We then compared\nseizure state occurrence and seizure state duration to (1) time since\nimplantation and (2) patient-specific circadian and multidien cycles in\ninterictal spike rate, which were extracted using empirical mode decomposition.\n  In most patients, the occurrence or duration of at least one state was\nassociated with the time since implantation (8 and 9 patients for state\noccurrence and state duration, respectively). Additionally, some patients also\nhad one or more states that were associated with phases of circadian and/or\nmultidien spike rate cycles (4 and 7 patients for state occurrence and state\nduration, respectively). A given state's occurrence and duration were not\nusually associated with the same timescale.\n  Our results suggest that time-varying factors modulate within-patient seizure\nevolutions over multiple timescales, with separate processes modulating a\nseizure state's occurrence and duration.

The developed and\nvalidated predictive model can enable a wider adoption of collective wind farm\noperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 20:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}
