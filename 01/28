In this problem, one or\nmore remote servers store identical copies of a set of $K$ messages, and there\nis a user that initially knows $M$ of these messages, and wants to privately\nretrieve one other message from the set of $K$ messages. The objective is to\ndesign a retrieval scheme in which the user downloads the minimum amount of\ninformation from the server(s) while the identity of the message wanted by the\nuser and the identities of an $M_1$-subset of the $M$ messages known by the\nuser (referred to as reusable side information) are protected, but the\nidentities of the remaining $M_2=M-M_1$ messages known by the user (referred to\nas single-use side information) do not need to be protected. The PIR-RSSI\nproblem reduces to the classical Private Information Retrieval (PIR) problem\nwhen ${M_1=M_2=0}$, and reduces to the problem of PIR with Private Side\nInformation or PIR with Side Information when ${M_1\\geq 1,M_2=0}$ or\n${M_1=0,M_2\\geq 1}$, respectively.

Another puzzle is that the resultant\nradiation reaction, of ${\\cal O}(G^3)$, is nevertheless correct and confirmed\nby a number of direct calculations. We ascribe these puzzles to the BMS\nambiguity in defining angular momentum. The loss of angular momentum is to be\ncounted out from the ADM value and, therefore, should be calculated in the\nso-called canonical gauge under the BMS transformations in which the\nremote-past limit of the Bondi angular momentum coincides with the ADM angular\nmomentum. This calculation correctly gives the ${\\cal O}(G^3)$ loss. On the\nother hand, we introduce a gauge in which the Bondi light cones tend\nasymptotically to those emanating from the center of mass world line. We find\nthat the angular momentum flux in this gauge is precisely the one used by\nDamour for his radiation reaction result. We call this new gauge \"intrinsic\"\nand argue that, although the correct angular momentum flux is to be computed in\nthe canonical gauge, any mechanical calculation of gauge-dependent quantities\n-- such as angular momentum -- gives the result in the intrinsic gauge.\nTherefore, it is this gauge that should be used in the linear response formula.\nThis solves the puzzles and establishes the correspondence between the\nintrinsic mechanical calculations and the Bondi formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 16:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 14:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

To this aim, the concept of Turing machines is used,\nwhich provides fundamental performance limits of digital computers.

While Markovian dynamics can be learned easily, given a\nsufficient amount of data, non-Markovian systems are non-trivial and their\ndescription requires the memory knowledge of past states. Here we analyse the\nfeature of such memory by taking a simple 1D Heisenberg model as many-body\nHamiltonian, and construct a non-Markovian description by representing the\nsystem over the single-particle reduced density matrix. The number of past\nstates required for this representation to reproduce the time-dependent\ndynamics is found to grow exponentially with the number of spins and with the\ndensity of the system spectrum. Most importantly, we demonstrate that neural\nnetworks can work as time propagators at any time in the future and that they\ncan be concatenated in time forming an autoregression. Such neural-network\nautoregression can be used to generate long-time and arbitrary dense time\ntrajectories. Finally, we investigate the time resolution needed to represent\nthe system memory. We find two regimes: for fine memory samplings the memory\nneeded remains constant, while longer memories are required for coarse\nsamplings, although the total number of time steps remains constant.

Depending on the initial conditions at\nformation, this evolution can differ substantially from the typical dipolar\nspin-down, resulting in pulsars that show spin periods longer than their coeval\npeers. By using general assumptions for the pulsar spin period and magnetic\nfield at birth, initial fallback accretion rates and including magnetic field\ndecay, we find that very long spin periods (>100s) can be reached in the\npresence of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields (>10^{14}G) and moderate\ninitial fallback accretion rates (~10^{22-27} g s^{-1}).

We perform the first systematic, controlled study into when\nand how bias amplification occurs. To enable this study, we design a simple\nimage-classification problem in which we can tightly control (synthetic)\nbiases. Our study of this problem reveals that the strength of bias\namplification is correlated to measures such as model accuracy, model capacity,\nmodel overconfidence, and amount of training data. We also find that bias\namplification can vary greatly during training. Finally, we find that bias\namplification may depend on the difficulty of the classification task relative\nto the difficulty of recognizing group membership: bias amplification appears\nto occur primarily when it is easier to recognize group membership than class\nmembership.

Following\nthe report of QPEs in apparently passive galaxies, alternatives including\nhighly unequal mass compact object binaries have been proposed to explain their\nproperties. We perform a systematic study of the five known QPE host galaxies\nwith the aim of providing new insights into their nature.

We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the CANDELS fields to\nidentify star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z=0.5-3 in both compact and\nextended phases and use Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the distribution of\nAGN accretion rates and track black hole growth within these galaxies.\nAccounting for the impact of AGN light changes ~20% of the X-ray sources from\ncompact to extended galaxy classifications. We find that ~10-25% of compact\nstar-forming galaxies host an AGN, a mild enhancement (by a factor ~2) compared\nto extended star-forming galaxies or compact quiescent galaxies of equivalent\nstellar mass and redshift. However, AGN are not ubiquitous in compact\nstar-forming galaxies and this is not the evolutionary phase, given its\nrelatively short timescale, where the bulk of black hole mass growth takes\nplace. Conversely, we measure the highest AGN fractions (~10-30%) within the\nrelatively rare population of extended quiescent galaxies. For massive galaxies\nthat quench at early cosmic epochs, substantial black hole growth in this\nextended phase is crucial to produce the elevated black hole mass-to-galaxy\nstellar mass scaling relation observed for quiescent galaxies at z~0. We also\nshow that AGN fraction increases with compactness in star-forming galaxies and\ndecreases in quiescent galaxies within both the compact and extended\nsub-populations, demonstrating that AGN activity depends closely on the\nstructural properties of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 14:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Here we show that sustained super-Eddington accretion\ncan be achieved for BHs with Eddington fractions $f_{\\rm Edd}$ > 2/$\\epsilon$,\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the efficiency with which radiation is generated in the\naccretion process. In this regime, the radiation carries too little momentum to\nhalt the accretion flow and the infalling gas traps the radiation. The BH\ngrowth then proceeds unimpeded until the gas supply is exhausted, in contrast\nto accretion at lower rates which is limited by the radiation generated in the\naccretion process. The large gas supply available in massive high-redshift\nquasar host galaxies may be readily accreted onto seed BHs via this\nsupply-limited mode of accretion, providing an explanation for how such\nsupermassive BHs are assembled in the early universe. This sustained\nsuper-Eddington growth may also explain the short lifetimes inferred for the H\nII regions surrounding high-redshift quasars, if the bulk of the BH growth\noccurs without the associated radiation escaping to ionize the intergalactic\nmedium. It furthermore implies that a population of obscured rapidly growing\nBHs may be difficult to detect, perhaps explaining why so few quasars with\nEddington fractions higher than a few have been observed. Finally, this simple\ncondition for sustained super-Eddington growth can easily be implemented in\ncosmological simulations which can be used to assess in which environments it\noccurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 04:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

This\nchallenge can be addressed through a security primitive called attestation\nwhich allows a remote backend to verify the firmware integrity of the devices\nit manages. In order to accelerate broad attestation adoption in the IoT domain\nthe Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has introduced the Device Identifier\nComposition Engine (DICE) series of specifications. DICE is a hardware-software\narchitecture for constrained, e.g., microcontroller-based IoT devices where the\nfirmware is divided into successively executed layers.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate a remote Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU)\nattack on DICE-based attestation.

The main idea of our attack\nis to install malware during runtime of application logic in the top firmware\nlayer. The malware reads the valid attestation key and stores it on the\ndevice's flash memory. After reboot, the malware uses the previously stored key\nfor all subsequent attestations to the backend.

In such scenario, the implementation of quantum\nerror correction is impossible and the performance of those devices is quite\nmodest. In particular, the depth of circuits implementable with reasonably high\nfidelity is limited, and the minimization of circuit depth is required. Such\ndepths depend on the efficiency of the universal set of gates $\\mathcal{S}$\nused in computation, and can be bounded using the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.\nHowever, it is known that much better, asymptotically tight bounds of the form\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{log}(\\epsilon^{-1}))$, can be obtained for specific\n$\\mathcal{S}$. Those bounds are controlled by so called spectral gap, denoted\n$\\mathrm{gap}(\\mathcal{S})$. Yet, the computation of\n$\\mathrm{gap}(\\mathcal{S})$ is not possible for general $\\mathcal{S}$ and in\npractice one considers spectral gap at a certain scale $r(\\epsilon)$, denoted\n$\\mathrm{gap}_r(\\mathcal{S})$.

The clusters with large displacements are found to be homogeneously\ndistributed in space in the elastic regime, followed by a localization within a\nsystem-spanning shear band after yielding. The distributions of the\ndisplacement field exhibit power-law nature with exponents strongly dependent\non the deformation.

We first constrain the massive star content (ages and\nmetallicities) and UV attenuation, by fitting the stellar continuum with a\ncombination of simple stellar population models. The models, together with\naccurate LyC flux measurements, allow to determine the absolute LyC photon\nescape fraction for each galaxy ($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm abs}$). We measure the\nequivalent widths and residual fluxes of multiple HI and low-ionization state\n(LIS) lines, and the geometrical covering fraction adopting the picket-fence\nmodel.

The HI and LIS line equivalent widths scale with the UV luminosity and\nattenuation, and inversely with the residual flux of the lines. The HI and LIS\nresidual fluxes are correlated, indicating that the neutral gas is spatially\ntraced by the LIS transitions.

Our setup can be regarded as the\nlimit of an infinite compactification radius in ADD model and is not viable as\nrealistic cosmology, but it still may be useful as a simple analytically\nsolvable model catching certain features of more realistic scenarios. The model\nconsists of two point masses moving inside a flat three-dimensional brane,\nembedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space and interacting only through a\nmassless scalar field localized on the same brane, while gravitational\nradiation is emitted into the bulk. This setup avoids the difficulties\nassociated with taking into account the gravitational stresses binding the\nsystem, which require the cubic terms in the perturbative gravitational\nLagrangian, and permits to limit ourselves to linearized theory. We calculate\nradiation in a linearized five-dimensional gravity generalizing the\nRohrlich-Teitelboim approach to extract the emitted part of the retarded\ngravitational field.

The distributed formation control includes a serial DSMPC with\nguaranteed recursive feasibility, closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction,\nand string stability.

We\ntest different values for the inner and outer radii, half opening angle, radial\nand polar exponent of the power-law density profile, opacity, and viewing\nangle. Furthermore, we also test the dust grains size and different optical and\ncalorimetric properties of silicate grains. The best fitting model consists of\ntwo concentric components with outer radii of 1.8 and 28 pc, respectively. We\nfind that the size and the optical and calorimetric properties of graphite and\nsilicate grains in the dust structure are key to reproduce the spectra of\nNGC1068. We conclude that the dust in NGC1068 reaches different scales, where\nthe highest contribution to the mid-infrared is given by a central and compact\ncomponent. A less dense and extended component is present, which can be either\npart of the same torus (conforming a flared disk) or can represent the emission\nof a polar dust component, as already suggested from interferometric\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Here the DAE dramatically simplifies the\nsearch space by mapping inputs into a continuous latent space where familiar\nBayesian optimization tools can be more readily applied. Despite this\nsimplification, the latent space typically remains high-dimensional. Thus, even\nwith a well-suited latent space, these approaches do not necessarily provide a\ncomplete solution, but may rather shift the structured optimization problem to\na high-dimensional one. In this paper, we propose LOL-BO, which adapts the\nnotion of trust regions explored in recent work on high-dimensional Bayesian\noptimization to the structured setting. By reformulating the encoder to\nfunction as both an encoder for the DAE globally and as a deep kernel for the\nsurrogate model within a trust region, we better align the notion of local\noptimization in the latent space with local optimization in the input space.\nLOL-BO achieves as much as 20 times improvement over state-of-the-art latent\nspace Bayesian optimization methods across six real-world benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that improvement in optimization strategies is as important as\ndeveloping better DAE models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 23:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

The constructed velocity field enables the preservation of the solid\nvelocity in the solid domain while extending the velocity in the normal\ndirection throughout the diffuse interface region. With this treatment, the GMV\nreduces the normal velocity difference of the level sets of the order parameter\nwhich alleviates the undesired thickening or thinning of the diffuse interface\nregion due to the convection. During this process, the time-dependent mobility\ncoefficient is substantially reduced and there is a lesser curvature flow. The\nGMV ensures that the diffuse interface region moves with the solid bulk such\nthat the fluid-solid interface conforms to the geometry of the solid. Using the\nunified momentum equation and the phase-dependent interpolation, we integrate\nthe IGP method into a fully Eulerian variational FSI solver based on the\nincompressible viscous fluid and the neo-Hookean solid. We first demonstrate\nthe ability of the phase-field-based IGP method for the convection of circular\nand square interfaces with a prescribed velocity field. The variational FSI\nframework with the IGP method is then examined for the flow passing a fixed\ndeformable block in a channel domain. Finally, the vibration of a plate\nattached behind a stationary cylinder subjected to incoming flow is employed to\nassess the fully Eulerian framework for a large aspect ratio and sharp corners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 01:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Two important tasks related to the automatic extraction and\nanalysis of information in Microblogs are Entity Mention Detection (EMD) and\nEntity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model the\nnon-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets.\nThey extract a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical,\nand semantic -- from individual messages for noisy text modeling and entity\nextraction. But given the constantly evolving nature of microblog streams,\ndetecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short\nmessages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named\nEMD Globalizer, better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog\nstreams. It deviates from the processing of isolated microblog messages by\nexisting EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate context of a\nmessage is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity\ncandidates by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining\nto find additional candidate mentions that are missed during this first\ndetection. Aggregating the local contextual representations of these mentions,\na global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate\nwithin a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities\nwithin the candidates from false positives. All mentions of said entities from\nthe stream are produced in the framework's final outputs. Our experiments show\nthat EMD Globalizer can enhance the effectiveness of all existing EMD systems\nthat we tested (on average by 25.61%) with a small additional computational\noverhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 01:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

There\ncurrently exist some debates and uncertainties about the effect of excess PbI2\non the efficiency and stability of the solar cell with respect to its energy\nalignment and energetics of defects. Herein, by applying the first-principles\ncalculations, we investigate the energetics, changes of work function and the\ndefective levels associated with the iodine vacancy (VI) and interstitial\niodine (II) defects of monolayer PbI2 (ML-PbI2). We find that the PbI2 has a\nvery low formation energy of VI of 0.77 and 0.19 eV for dilute and high\nconcentration, respectively, reflecting coalescence tendency of isolated VI,\nmuch lower than that of vacancies in other 2D materials like phosphorene.\nSimilar to VI, a low formation energy of II of 0.65 eV is found, implying a\nhigh population of such defects. Both defects generate in-gap defective levels\nwhich are mainly due to the unsaturated chemical bonds of p-orbitals of exposed\nPb or inserted I. Such rich defective levels allow the VI and II as the\nreservoir or sinks of electron/hole carriers in PbI2. Our results suggest that\nthe remnant PbI2 in perovskite MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) would play dual opposite\nroles in affecting the efficiency of the perovskite: (1) Forming Schottky-type\ninterface with MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) in which the built-in potential would\nfacilitate the electron-hole separation and prolong the carrier lifetime; (2)\nActing as the recombination centers due to the deep defective levels. To\npromote the efficiency by the Schottky effect, our work reveals that the II\ndefect is favored, and to reduce the recombination centers the VI defect should\nbe suppressed. Our results shall be beneficial in improving strategies for the\nrelated optoelectronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 02:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

However, the complexity of the ionic and\nelectronic dynamics in MXene based hybrids, which are normally needed for\ndevice integration, triggers both challenges and opportunities for its\napplication. In this paper, as a prototype of metallic hybrids of MXene,\nheterostructures consisting of Ti3C2T2 (T= None, O and F atoms) and metallic\nMoS2 (1T phase) are investigated. Through density functional theory, we\ninvestigate the interfacial electronic variation, thermal activation, and anode\nperformance in the lithium-ion battery (LIB) of Ti3C2T2/1T-MoS2. We found that\ndifferent surface atomic groups in MXene can significantly alter the affinity,\nredox reaction and kinetics of Li atoms in the interface of the Ti3C2T2 and\n1T-MoS2. Through examining the three possible pathways of Li by climbing\nimage-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)\nsimulation, the diffusion curve becomes significantly flattened from the naked\nto O- and F-terminated Ti3C2 MXene with activation barriers reducing from 0.80\nto 0.22 and 0.29 eV, respectively, and room-temperature diffusion coefficients\nincreasing from 1.20x10-6 to 2.75x10-6, 1.70x10-4 cm2 s-1, respectively.

Our work\nsuggests that surface functional groups play a significant role in\nTi3C2T2/1T-MoS2 modification and Ti3C2F2/1T-MoS2 with the high diffusion\ncoefficient and theoretical capacity could be a promising anode material for\nLIBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 02:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Throughout the outburst, the spectra are well fitted with power-law plus\ndisk-blackbody components. In the soft-intermediate and soft states, we\nobserved the canonical relation L ~ T_in^4 between disk luminosity L and peak\ncolour temperature T_in, with a constant inner radius R_in (traditionally\nidentified with the innermost stable circular orbit). At other stages of the\noutburst cycle, the behaviour is more unusual, inconsistent with the canonical\noutburst evolution of black hole transients. In particular, during the hard\nrise, the apparent inner radius is smaller than in the soft state (and\nincreasing), and the peak colour temperature is higher (and decreasing). This\nanomalous behaviour is found even when we model the spectra with\nself-consistent Comptonization models, which take into account the\nup-scattering of photons from the disk component into the power-law component.\nTo explain both those anomalous trends at the same time, we suggest that the\nhardening factor for the inner disk emission was larger than the canonical\nvalue of ~1.7 at the beginning of the outburst. A more physical trend of radii\nand temperature evolution requires a hardening factor evolving from ~3.5 at the\nbeginning of the hard state to ~1.7 in the hard intermediate state. This could\nbe evidence that the inner disk was in the process of condensing from the hot,\noptically thin medium and had not yet reached a sufficiently high optical depth\nfor its emission spectrum to be described by the standard optically-thick disk\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 03:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Specifically, FIGS generalizes the CART\nalgorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in a summation. The\ntotal number of splits across all the trees can be restricted by a\npre-specified threshold, thereby keeping both the size and number of its trees\nunder control. When both are small, the fitted tree-sum can be easily\nvisualized and written out by hand, making it highly interpretable. A partially\noracle theoretical result hints at the potential for FIGS to overcome a key\nweakness of single-tree models by disentangling additive components of\ngenerative additive models, thereby reducing redundancy from repeated splits on\nthe same feature. Furthermore, given oracle access to optimal tree structures,\nwe obtain L2 generalization bounds for such generative models in the case of C1\ncomponent functions, matching known minimax rates in some cases.

This\nwork puts forth a model-informed data-based optimal flexibility design for\naggregators, which deals with the time-coupled, uncertain, and non-convex\nmodels of individual loads. The proposed solution first generates efficiently a\nlabeled dataset of (non)-disaggregatable schedules. The feasible set of the\naggregator is then approximated by an ellipsoid upon training a convex\nquadratic classifier using the labeled dataset. The ellipsoid is subsequently\ninner approximated by a polytope.

The trader encounters a trade-off between the\ntransaction costs incurred due to market impact and the volatility risk of\nholding the position. Our formulation begins with a continuous-time and\ninfinite horizon variation of the seminal model of Almgren and Chriss (2000),\nbut we define as the objective the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the\nimplementation shortfall, and allow for dynamic (adaptive) trading strategies.\nIn this setting, we are able to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal\nliquidation strategy and its value function.\n  Our results yield a number of important practical insights. We are able to\nquantify the benefit of adaptive policies over optimized static policies. The\nrelevant improvement depends only on the level of risk aversion: for moderate\nlevels of risk aversion, the optimal dynamic policy outperforms the optimal\nstatic policy by 5-15%, and outperforms the optimal volume weighted average\nprice (VWAP) policy by 15-25%. This improvement is achieved through dynamic\npolicies that exhibit \"aggressiveness-in-the-money\": trading is accelerated\nwhen price movements are favorable, and is slowed when price movements are\nunfavorable.\n  From a mathematical perspective, our analysis exploits the dual\nrepresentation of CVaR to convert the problem to a continuous-time, zero-sum\ngame. We leverage the idea of the state-space augmentation, and obtain a\npartial differential equation describing the optimal value function, which is\nseparable and a special instance of the Emden-Fowler equation. This leads to a\nclosed-form solution.

In this context, temporal aggregation and\nreconciliation techniques have been useful in improving forecasts, reducing\nmodel uncertainty, and providing a coherent forecast across different time\nhorizons. However, an underlying assumption spanning all these techniques is\nthe complete availability of data across all levels of the temporal hierarchy,\nwhile this offers mathematical convenience but most of the time low frequency\ndata is partially completed and it is not available while forecasting. On the\nother hand, high frequency data can significantly change in a scenario like the\nCOVID pandemic and this change can be used to improve forecasts that will\notherwise significantly diverge from long term actuals. We propose a dynamic\nreconciliation method whereby we formulate the problem of informing low\nfrequency forecasts based on high frequency actuals as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) allowing for the fact that we do not have complete information\nabout the dynamics of the process. This allows us to have the best long term\nestimates based on the most recent data available even if the low frequency\ncycles have only been partially completed.

The result also underscores the fact\nthat while low frequency forecasts can improve the high frequency forecasts as\nmentioned in the temporal reconciliation literature (based on the assumption\nthat low frequency forecasts have lower noise to signal ratio) the high\nfrequency forecasts can also be used to inform the low frequency forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 07:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

In that\ncase, the complete-data likelihood associated with mixtures of elliptical\ndistributions is well adapted to the EM framework with missing data thanks to\nits conditional distribution, which is shown to be a multivariate\n$t$-distribution.

However, the\nmemory throughput has not increased at the same rate, which has led to the\nmemory wall problem in turn increasing the gap between effective and\ntheoretical peak processor performance. To cope with this, there has been an\nabundance of work in the area of data/instruction prefetcher designs. Broadly,\nprefetchers predict future data/instruction address accesses and proactively\nfetch data/instructions in the memory hierarchy with the goal of lowering\ndata/instruction access latency. To this end, one or more prefetchers are\ndeployed at each level of the memory hierarchy, but typically, each prefetcher\ngets designed in isolation without comprehensively accounting for other\nprefetchers in the system. As a result, individual prefetchers do not always\ncomplement each other, and that leads to lower average performance gains and/or\nmany negative outliers. In this work, we propose Puppeteer, which is a hardware\nprefetcher manager that uses a suite of random forest regressors to determine\nat runtime which prefetcher should be ON at each level in the memory hierarchy,\nsuch that the prefetchers complement each other and we reduce the\ndata/instruction access latency. Compared to a design with no prefetchers,\nusing Puppeteer we improve IPC by 46.0% in 1 Core (1C), 25.8% in 4 Core (4C),\nand 11.9% in 8 Core (8C) processors on average across traces generated from\nSPEC2017, SPEC2006, and Cloud suites with ~10KB overhead. Moreover, we also\nreduce the number of negative outliers by over 89%, and the performance loss of\nthe worst-case negative outlier from 25% to only 5% compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 10:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

For the Kitaev chain in the entire\ntopological phase, the edge squashed entanglement is quantized to log(2)/2,\nhalf the maximal Bell-state entanglement, and vanishes in the trivial phase.\nSuch topological squashed entanglement exhibits the correct scaling at the\nquantum phase transition, is stable in the presence of interactions, and is\nrobust against disorder and local perturbations. Edge quantum conditional\nmutual information and edge squashed entanglement defined with respect to\ndifferent multipartitions discriminate topological superconductors from\nsymmetry breaking magnets, as shown by comparing the fermionic Kitaev chain and\nthe spin-1/2 Ising model in transverse field. For systems featuring multiple\ntopological phases with different numbers of edge modes, like the quasi 1D\nKitaev ladder, topological squashed entanglement counts the number of Majorana\nexcitations and distinguishes the different topological phases of the system.\nIn fact, we show that the edge quantum conditional mutual information and the\nedge squashed entanglement remain valid detectors of topological\nsuperconductivity even for systems, like the Kitaev tie with long-range\nhopping, featuring geometrical frustration and a suppressed bulk-edge\ncorrespondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 10:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 01:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 22:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 12:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

Pore-scale modeling of diffusion layers and gas distributor has been\nestablished as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes.\n  Investigating the interface between the cathode layers, a particular\nchallenge is the combination and interaction of the multi-phase flow in the\nporous material of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) with the free flow in the gas\ndistributor channels. The formation, growth and detachment of water droplets on\nthe hydrophobic, porous surface of the GDL have a major influence on the mass,\nmomentum and energy exchange between the layers.\n  A dynamic pore-network model is used to describe the flow through the porous\nGDL on the pore-scale.

The use of Laplacian\neigenvectors as embeddings for the purpose of multiscale graph comparison has\nhowever been limited. Here we propose the Embedded Laplacian Discrepancy (ELD)\nas a simple and fast approach to compare graphs (of potentially different\nsizes) based on the similarity of the graphs' community structures. The ELD\noperates by representing graphs as point clouds in a common, low-dimensional\nspace, on which a natural Wasserstein-based distance can be efficiently\ncomputed. A main challenge in comparing graphs through any eigenvector-based\napproaches is the potential ambiguity that could arise due to sign-flips and\nbasis symmetries. The ELD leverages a simple symmetrization trick to bypass any\nsign ambiguities. For comparing graphs that do not have any ambiguities due to\nbasis symmetries (i.e. the spectrums are simple), we show that the ELD becomes\na natural pseudo-metric that enjoys nice properties such as invariance under\ngraph isomorphism. For comparing graphs with non-simple spectrums, we propose a\nprocedure to approximate the ELD via a simple perturbation technique to resolve\nany ambiguity from basis symmetries. We show that such perturbations are stable\nusing matrix perturbation theory under mild assumptions that are\nstraightforward to verify in practice.

Although this activity is\noften seen as being concerned with solving mathematical problems and conceiving\nalgorithms, it is essentially an empirical and socially framed activity, where\ninteractions between clients and analysts, and between them and concerned third\nparties, play a crucial role. Since the 80s, two concepts have structured the\nliterature devoted to analysing this aspect of decision support: validity and\nlegitimacy. Whereas validity is focused on the interactions between the client\nand the analyst, legitimacy refers to the broader picture: the organisational\ncontext, the overall problem situation, the environment, culture, history.\nDespite its importance, this concept has not received the attention it deserves\nin the literature in decision support. The present paper aims at filling this\ngap. For that purpose, we review the literature in other disciplines relevant\nto elaborate a concept of legitimacy useful in decision support contexts. Based\non this review, we propose a general theory of legitimacy, adapted to decision\nsupport contexts, encompassing the relevant contributions we found in the\nliterature. According to this general theory, a legitimate decision support\nintervention is one for which the decision support provider produces a\njustification that satisfies two conditions: (i) it effectively convinces the\ndecision support provider's interlocutors (effectiveness condition) and (ii) it\nis organised around the active elicitation of as many and as diverse\ncounterarguments as possible (truthfulness condition).

However, it is still a challenge to extract discriminative features\nfrom point cloud, especially when the input is partial and composed by\nindistinguishable surfaces (planes, smooth surfaces, etc.). As a result, the\nproportion of inlier correspondences that precisely match points between two\nunaligned point clouds is beyond satisfaction. Motivated by this, we devise\nseveral techniques to promote feature-learning based point cloud registration\nperformance by leveraging inlier correspondences proportion: a pyramid\nhierarchy decoder to characterize point features in multiple scales, a\nconsistent voting strategy to maintain consistent correspondences and a\ngeometry guided encoding module to take geometric characteristics into\nconsideration.

Thus, we conclude that there is no\ndetectable activity cycle on such timescales. We identified the flares and\nbuilt their energy distribution. The number of flares observed around the\nphases of the planetary eclipses is not statistically different from the number\nof flares during transit phases. However, we do find a hint of a difference in\nthe flare-energy distributions, as the flares observed around the planetary\neclipses tend to be more energetic than the flares observed around the primary\ntransits of the planet. We modeled the distribution of the number of flares per\nday with a power law, showing that it is steeper than the one observed in the\nSun and in other Main Sequence stars. The steepness hints at a significant\nfraction of undetected micro-flares. Altogether, the plasma temperatures below\n1 keV observed during the flares, along with the slightly larger fraction of\nenergetic flares seen at the secondary transits highlight the peculiarity of\nthe corona of HD 189733 A and points to star-planet interaction as the\nplausible origin of part of its X-ray emission.

The\ntheory establishes a bridge between monolingual data and code-switching data.\nWe leverage this linguistics theory to design the code-switching E2E ASR model.\nThe proposed model efficiently transfers language knowledge from rich\nmonolingual data to improve the performance of the code-switching ASR model. We\nevaluate our model on ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching challenge\ndataset. Compared to the baseline model, our proposed model achieves a 17.12%\nrelative error reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 14:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 16:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 16:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 13:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

In current studies, patterns decoded from movement are\nmainly applied to the binary classification between movement state and resting\nstate, such as elbow flexion and rest. The classifications between two movement\nstates and among multiple movement states are still challenging. This study\nproposes a new method, the star-arrangement spectral filtering (SASF), to solve\nthe multi-class pre-movement classification problem. We first design a\nreferenced task-related component analysis (RTRCA) framework that consists of\ntwo modules. This first module is the classification between movement state and\nresting state; the second module is the classification of multiple movement\nstates. SASF is developed by optimizing the features in RTRCA. In SASF, feature\nselection on filter banks is used on the first module of RTRCA, and feature\nselection on time windows is used on the second module of RTRCA. A linear\ndiscriminant analysis classifier is used to classify the optimized features. In\nthe binary classification between two motions, the classification accuracy of\nSASF achieves 0.9670$\\pm$0.0522, which is significantly higher than the result\nprovided by the deep convolutional neural network (0.6247$\\pm$0.0680) and the\ndiscriminative spatial pattern method (0.4400$\\pm$0.0700). In the multi-class\nclassification of 7 states, the classification accuracy of SASF is\n0.9491$\\pm$0.0372. The proposed SASF greatly improves the classification\nbetween two motions and enables the classification among multiple motions.

The seller has complete knowledge of the\nactual state and can send signals to the buyers so as to disclose information\nabout it. For instance, the state of nature may reflect the condition and/or\nsome particular features of the item, which are known to the seller only. The\nproblem faced by the seller is about how to partially disclose information\nabout the state so as to maximize revenue. Unlike classical signaling problems,\nin this setting, the seller must also correlate the signals being sent to the\nbuyers with some price proposals for them. This introduces additional\nchallenges compared to standard settings. We consider two cases: the one where\nthe seller can only send signals publicly visible to all buyers, and the case\nin which the seller can privately send a different signal to each buyer. As a\nfirst step, we prove that, in both settings, the problem of maximizing the\nseller's revenue does not admit an FPTAS unless P=NP, even for basic instances\nwith a single buyer. As a result, in the rest of the paper, we focus on\ndesigning PTASs. In order to do so, we first introduce a unifying framework\nencompassing both public and private signaling, whose core result is a\ndecomposition lemma that allows focusing on a finite set of possible buyers'\nposteriors. This forms the basis on which our PTASs are developed. In\nparticular, in the public signaling setting, our PTAS employs some ad hoc\ntechniques based on linear programming, while our PTAS for the private setting\nrelies on the ellipsoid method to solve an exponentially-sized LP in polynomial\ntime.

However,\nreducing the total energy consumption in the context of work stealing runtimes\nis still challenging, particularly when using asymmetric architectures with\ndifferent types of CPU cores. A common approach for energy savings involves\ndynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) wherein throttling is carried out\nbased on factors like task parallelism, stealing relations and task\ncriticality. This paper makes the following observations: (i) leveraging DVFS\non a per-task basis is impractical when using fine-grained tasking and in\nenvironments with cluster/chip-level DVFS; (ii) task moldability, wherein a\nsingle task can execute on multiple threads/cores via work-sharing, can help to\nreduce energy consumption; and (iii) mismatch between tasks and assigned\nresources (i.e.~core type and number of cores) can detrimentally impact energy\nconsumption. In this paper, we propose ERASE (EneRgy Aware SchedulEr), an\nintra-application task scheduler on top of work stealing runtimes that aims to\nreduce the total energy consumption of parallel applications. It achieves\nenergy savings by guiding scheduling decisions based on per-task energy\nconsumption predictions of different resource configurations. In addition,\nERASE is capable of adapting to both given static frequency settings and\nexternally controlled DVFS.

This approach has three benefits over deterministic\nchaining: 1) the metric space is not necessarily bounded, 2) facilitation of\nsubsequent analysis to yield more explicit bound, and 3) further opportunity to\noptimize the bound by removing the geometric rigidity of the partitions. The\nproposed approach includes the traditional chaining as a special case, and can\ntherefore also utilize any deterministic chaining construction.

A single\ntransformation matrix in this case is too strict to provide a flexible\nprojection, thus it is necessary to adopt relaxation on transformation matrix.\nThis paper proposes a double transformation matrices learning method based on\nlatent low-rank feature extraction. The core idea is to use double\ntransformation matrices for relaxation, and jointly projecting the learned\nprincipal and salient features from two directions into the label space, which\ncan share the pressure of a single transformation matrix. Firstly, the low-rank\nfeatures are learned by the latent low rank representation (LatLRR) method\nwhich processes the original data from two directions. In this process, sparse\nnoise is also separated, which alleviates its interference on projection\nlearning to some extent. Then, two transformation matrices are introduced to\nprocess the two features separately, and the information useful for the\nclassification is extracted. Finally, the two transformation matrices can be\neasily obtained by alternate optimization methods. Through such processing,\neven when a large amount of redundant information is contained in samples, our\nmethod can also obtain projection results that are easy to classify.\nExperiments on multiple data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nfor classification, especially for complex scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 04:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 14:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-18"}

However, these metrics provide limited insight into the\noverall network-level traffic management. On the other hand, some safety\nassessment efforts are devoted to processing crash reports and identifying\nspatial and temporal patterns of crashes that correlate with road geometry,\ntraffic volume, and weather conditions. This approach relies merely on crash\nreports and ignores the rich information of traffic videos that can help\nidentify the role of safety violations in crashes. To bridge these two\nperspectives, we define a new set of network-level safety metrics (NSM) to\nassess the overall safety profile of traffic flow by processing imagery taken\nby RSU cameras.

However, due\nto the inevitable reality gap between the simulation and the real world, a\npolicy learned in the simulation may not always generate a safe behaviour on\nthe real robot. As a result, during adaptation of the policy in the real world,\nthe robot may damage itself or cause harm to its surroundings. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel learning algorithm called SafeAPT that leverages a diverse\nrepertoire of policies evolved in the simulation and transfers the most\npromising safe policy to the real robot through episodic interaction. To\nachieve this, SafeAPT iteratively learns a probabilistic reward model as well\nas a safety model using real-world observations combined with simulated\nexperiences as priors. Then, it performs Bayesian optimization on the\nrepertoire with the reward model while maintaining the specified safety\nconstraint using the safety model. SafeAPT allows a robot to adapt to a wide\nrange of goals safely with the same repertoire of policies evolved in the\nsimulation. We compare SafeAPT with several baselines, both in simulated and\nreal robotic experiments and show that SafeAPT finds high-performance policies\nwithin a few minutes in the real world while minimizing safety violations\nduring the interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 16:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

The performance of the fabricated antenna is also compared with a\ncommercial rigid antenna by interfacing with a USB dongle. The printed antenna\ndemonstrates better performance with respect to signal strength at specific\ndistances when compared with the commercial antenna. This work demonstrates\nthat rigid and long commercial antennas can be replaced with paper-based\nflexible and cheap antennas and incorporated with wearable technologies.\nAdditionally, replacing Ag NPs with nanowires provides transparency without\ncompromising on the electrical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 17:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

In\nthis paper we further study the nonlinear structural stability and the linear\ndynamic instability of these steady transonic solutions. When the C^1-smooth\ntransonic steady-states pass through the sonic line, they produce singularities\nfor the system, and cause some essential difficulty in the proof of structural\nstability. For any relaxation time, by means of elaborate singularity analysis,\nwe first investigate the structural stability of the C^1-smooth transonic\nsteady-states, once the perturbations of the initial data and the doping\nprofiles are small enough. Moreover, when the relaxation time is large enough,\nunder the condition that the electric field is positive at the shock location,\nwe prove that the transonic shock steady-states are structurally stable with\nrespect to small perturbations of the supersonic doping profile. Furthermore,\nwe show the linearly dynamic instability for these transonic shock\nsteady-states provided that the electric field is suitable negative. The proofs\nfor the structural stability results are based on singularity analysis, a\nmonotonicity argument on the shock position and the downstream density, and the\nstability analysis of supersonic and subsonic solutions. The linear dynamic\ninstability of the steady transonic shock for Euler-Poisson equations can be\ntransformed to the ill-posedness of a free boundary problem for the\nKlein-Gordon equation. By using a nontrivial transformation and the shooting\nmethod, we prove that the linearized problem has a transonic shock solution\nwith exponential growths. These results enrich and develop the existing\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

If there are n jobs in the considered queueing system and a\nnew job arrives, then the arriving job is lost or the service of a job is\ninterrupted and this job is lost. We study two rules to choose the job to be\nlost. In accordance with one of these rules, the job with the shortest\nremaining length is lost. Relations are obtained between the state\nprobabilities of considered system and the state probabilities of the\ncorresponding unlimited processor sharing system. These relations allow to\ncompute the state probabilities for considered system if the state\nprobabilities for the unlimited processor sharing system are known. In the case\nof Poisson arrival process, the probability that the server capacity is\nexhausted is equal to the probability that a job is lost.

Among other efforts that tried to close the gap between them,\nanthropomorphic robotic hands is the most prominent direction. However, exactly\nfollowing human hand design might be unnecessary as it will significantly\nincrease the mechanical complexity and hence make it less economically\nfeasible. Recently, soft robotic hands, a new trend has emerged, aiming to make\nthe design adequately complex and affordable while requiring much less effort\nto control. In the first part of this article, we will lay out several\nprominent designs in this direction and their applications in real world\nscenarios. Having a suitable hardware simplified the complexity of software\ndesigning. However, manually controlling the hand for one task requires a\nsignificantly large amount of time and effort and doing it repeatedly is\nunsurprisingly tedious. Therefore, in the second part, we will show some recent\ntechniques for soft hand autonomous control. We start by briefly discussing the\nanalytic methods that mainly exploit the hand dynamic information. Then,\ndata-driven approaches will be our main focus.
