The main novelty is that\ninstead of comparing directly the trainee's movements to a template or a\nmovement pattern, extracted from a top-rated athlete in the field, we offer an\nindependent way of technique analysis. We incorporate design tools of automatic\ncontrol theory to link the trainee's movement patterns to specific performance\ncharacteristics. This makes it possible to suggest technique modifications that\nprovide the desired performance improvement, taking into account the individual\nbody parameters and constraints. Representing the performed maneuvers in terms\nof a dynamic response of closed-loop control system offers an unconventional\ninsight into the motor equivalence problem. The method is demonstrated on three\ncase studies of aerial rotation of skilled, less-skilled, and elite skydivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 19:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In this paper, we\npropose two novel RLS-based A2C algorithms and investigate their performance.\nBoth proposed algorithms, called RLSSA2C and RLSNA2C, use the RLS method to\ntrain the critic network and the hidden layers of the actor network. The main\ndifference between them is at the policy learning step. RLSSA2C uses an\nordinary first-order gradient descent algorithm and the standard policy\ngradient to learn the policy parameter. RLSNA2C uses the Kronecker-factored\napproximation, the RLS method and the natural policy gradient to learn the\ncompatible parameter and the policy parameter. In addition, we analyze the\ncomplexity and convergence of both algorithms, and present three tricks for\nfurther improving their convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of both algorithms on 40 games in the Atari 2600 environment and\n11 tasks in the MuJoCo environment. From the experimental results, it is shown\nthat our both algorithms have better sample efficiency than the vanilla A2C on\nmost games or tasks, and have higher computational efficiency than other two\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

This model, with no\nexplicit coupling between the sites, shows an infinite number of phase\ntransitions which is a consequence of the partition function factorizing into a\nproduct over Matsubara frequencies. We calculate the quenched free energy in\ntwo different ways, first in terms of the single-particle energies, and second\nby solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations. The first calculation can be done\nentirely in terms of a one-site model. The conjugate replica enters due to\nnon-analyticities when Matsubara frequencies enter the spectral support of the\ncoupling matrix. The second calculation is based on the replica trick of the\ntwo-site partition function. Both methods give the same result. The\nfree-fermion partition function can be rephrased as a matrix model for the\ncoupling matrix. Up to minor details, this model is the random matrix model\nthat describes the chiral phase transition of QCD, and the order parameter of\nthe two-body model corresponds to the chiral condensate of QCD. Comparing to\nthe corresponding four-body model, we are able to determine which features of\nthe free energy are due to chaotic nature of the four-body model. The\nhigh-temperature phase of both models is entropy dominated, and in both cases\nis determined by the spectral density. The four-body SYK model has a\nlow-temperature phase whose free energy is almost temperature-independent,\nsignaling an effective gap of the theory even though the actual spectrum does\nnot exhibit a gap. However the low-temperature free energy of the two-body SYK\nmodel is not flat, in fact it oscillates to arbitrarily low temperature. This\nindicates a less desirable feature that the entropy of the two-body model is\nnot always positive, which most likely is a consequence of the nonhermiticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 02:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The study examines the effects of slit shape (i.e., converging,\ndiverging, and parallel slits), the effect of slit-area ratios, slit-width, and\nits angle with the freestream velocity on aerodynamic forces, vibration\nresponse, and associated flow characteristics. The results demonstrate that the\naddition of the slit assists the VIV suppression by adding an extra amount of\nflow to the main flow. It results in the stabilized wake with the pressure\nrecovery downstream of the cylinder and causes a reduction in the lift force\nover the cylinder. Also, there exist different shedding patterns associated\nwith different slit shapes. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the flow\nfield suggests that among all the three slits, the parallel slit heavily\nmodifies the flow behind the cylinder by distributing the amount of energy to a\nlarge number of modes as compared to other slits (converging slit and diverging\nslit), where the most of the energy is contained in a couple of modes. Further,\nincreasing the slit angle (for parallel slit) with respect to the freestream\nincreases the slit effectiveness up to a specific value of slit-angle and\nbeyond that starts to affect the VIV suppression adversely.

First, in real\nworld, atypical interactions may signal users' temporary interest different\nfrom their general preference. Therefore, simply filtering out the atypical\ninteractions as noise may be inappropriate and degrade the personalization of\nrecommendations. Second, it is hard to acquire the temporary interest since\nthere are no explicit supervision signals to indicate whether an interaction is\natypical or not. To address this challenges, we propose a novel model called\nTemporary Interest Aware Recommendation (TIARec), which can distinguish\natypical interactions from normal ones without supervision and capture the\ntemporary interest as well as the general preference of users. Particularly, we\npropose a reinforcement learning framework containing a recommender agent and\nan auxiliary classifier agent, which are jointly trained with the objective of\nmaximizing the cumulative return of the recommendations made by the recommender\nagent. During the joint training process, the classifier agent can judge\nwhether the interaction with an item recommended by the recommender agent is\natypical, and the knowledge about learning temporary interest from atypical\ninteractions can be transferred to the recommender agent, which makes the\nrecommender agent able to alone make recommendations that balance the general\npreference and temporary interest of users.

To overcome these issues, we propose a\nMulti-Sparse-Domain Collaborative Recommendation (MSDCR) model for multi-target\ncross-domain recommendation. Unlike traditional CDR methods, MSDCR treats the\nmultiple relevant domains as all sparse and can simultaneously improve the\nrecommendation performance in each domain. We propose a Multi-Domain Separation\nNetwork (MDSN) and a Gated Aspect Preference Enhancement (GAPE) module for\nMSDCR to enhance a user's domain-specific aspect preferences in a domain by\ntransferring the complementary aspect preferences in other domains, during\nwhich the uniqueness of the domain-specific preference can be preserved through\nthe adversarial training offered by MDSN and the complementarity can be\nadaptively determined by GAPE.

Second, in the existing thermal LB models\nfor liquid-vapor phase change, the finite-difference computations of the\ngradient terms $\\nabla \\cdot u$ and $\\nabla T$ usually require special\ntreatment at boundary nodes, while in the proposed thermal LB model these two\nterms are calculated locally. Moreover, in some of the existing thermal LB\nmodels, the error term ${\\partial _{{t_0}}}\\left( {Tu} \\right)$ is eliminated\nby adding local correction terms to the collision process in the moment space,\nwhich causes these thermal LB models to be limited to the D2Q9 lattice in two\ndimensions and the D3Q15 or D3Q19 lattice in three dimensions. Conversely, the\nproposed model does not suffer from such an error term and therefore the\nthermal LB equation can be constructed on the D3Q7 lattice, which simplifies\nthe model and improves the computational efficiency. Numerical simulations are\ncarried out to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed thermal\nmultiphase LB model for simulating liquid-vapor phase change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 13:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we\npropose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature\nbalancing.

The proposed strategy utilize the same\ncomputational mesh for the discretization of the surface Partial Differential\nEquation (PDE) and the bulk PDEs and can be combined with different techniques\nfor representing and evolving the interface, here the level set method is used.\nNumerical simulations in both two and three space dimensions are presented\nincluding simulations showing the role of surfactant in the interaction between\ntwo drops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 14:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 11:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

This perspective gives an overview of\nstate-of-the-art magnetic nanoparticle-based imaging techniques and theranostic\napplications and discusses their opportunities and challenges. To address these\nchallenges and exploit these opportunities to the fullest, we provide three\npromising research directions. The first considers novel magnetic field\nsequences, utilizing the rich magnetic dynamics of the particles, which boost\nthe capabilities of many nanoparticle-based applications. Secondly ,we\nintroduce the concept of smart theranostics based on feedback mechanisms\nbetween the particle applications and their supporting imaging procedure to\nenhance the performance of both and allow real-time monitoring of treatment\nefficiency. Finally, we show how data-driven models could enhance therapy and\ndiagnostics, and handle the platform's large amount of data and decision\nsupport algorithms. The latter research track also includes hybrid models in\nwhich physics-based and data-driven models are combined to overcome challenges\nof applications with limited data, as well as to uncover unknown nanoparticle\ndynamics. Contrasting other literature, which mainly focuses on developing\nmagnetic nanoparticles with the right characteristics, we put forward advances\nin magnetic nanoparticle imaging techniques and applications to enable the use\nof a broader range of magnetic nanoparticles in theranostics.

In order to better adopt stray animals, scoring the\npawpularity (cuteness) of stray animals is very important, but evaluating the\npawpularity of animals is a very labor-intensive thing. Consequently, there has\nbeen an urgent surge of interest to develop an algorithm that scores\npawpularity of animals. However, the dataset in Kaggle not only has images, but\nalso metadata describing images. Most methods basically focus on the most\nadvanced image regression methods in recent years, but there is no good method\nto deal with the metadata of images. To address the above challenges, the paper\nproposes an image regression model called PETS-SWINF that considers metadata of\nthe images. Our results based on a dataset of Kaggle competition,\n\"PetFinder.my\", show that PETS-SWINF has an advantage over only based images\nmodels. Our results shows that the RMSE loss of the proposed model on the test\ndataset is 17.71876 but 17.76449 without metadata. The advantage of the\nproposed method is that PETS-SWINF can consider both low-order and high-order\nfeatures of metadata, and adaptively adjust the weights of the image model and\nthe metadata model.

Specifically, gap between outputs of models in the\nneighborhood region is gauged by a defined metric based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence. This metric provides similar insights with the minimum description\nlength principle on interpreting flat minima. By minimizing both this\ndivergence and empirical loss, NRS could explicitly drive the optimizer towards\nconverging to flat minima. We confirm the effectiveness of NRS by performing\nimage classification tasks across a wide range of model architectures on\ncommonly-used datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where generalization ability\ncould be universally improved.

To avoid the defects, some works make the\nperturbations unrestricted to gain better robustness and transferability.\nHowever, these examples usually look unnatural and alert the guards.

Intra-band and\ninter-band Fermi surface (FS) nesting can drive unique superconducting (SC)\nground states with $d$-wave and $s^{\\pm}$ pairing symmetries, respectively,\naccording to the criterion that the SC gap changes sign across the nesting\nwavevector. For an odd number of FSs, when multiple inter-band nesting is of\ncomparable strength, the sign-reversal criterion between different FS sheets\ncan leads to frustration, which promotes novel SC order parameters. Here we\nreport the experimental observation of a time-reversal symmetry breaking\npairing state in Re$_2$Hf resulting from FS nesting frustration. Furthermore,\nour electronic specific heat and transverse-field $\\mu$SR experiments suggest a\nfully gaped pairing symmetry. The first-principle electronic structure\ncalculation reveals multiple Fermi surface sheets with comparable inter-band\nnesting strength. Implementing the {\\it ab-initio} band structure, we compute\nspin-fluctuation mediated SC pairing symmetry which reveals a $s+is'$-pairing\nstate - consistent with experimental observations. Our investigation\ndemonstrates a novel SC state which provides a putative setting for both\napplied and fundamental study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

As trustworthiness of chain after outsourcing including\nfabrication houses is not established, any adversary in between, with malicious\nintent may tamper the design by inserting Hardware Trojans (HTs). Detection of\nsuch HTs is of utmost importance to assure the trust and integrity of the\nchips. However, the efficiency of detection techniques based on side-channel\nanalysis is largely affected by process variations. In this paper, a\nmethodology for detecting HTs by analyzing the delays of topologically\nsymmetric paths is proposed. The proposed technique, rather than depending on\ngolden ICs as a reference for HT detection, employs the concept of\nself-referencing. In this work, the fact that delays of topologically symmetric\npaths in an IC will be affected similarly by process variations is exploited. A\nprocedure to chose topologically symmetric paths that are minimally affected by\nprocess variations is presented. Further, a technique is proposed to create\ntopologically symmetric paths by inserting extra logic gates if such paths do\nnot exist in the design intrinsically. Simulations performed on ISCAS-85\nbenchmarks establish that the proposed method is able to achieve a true\npositive rate of 100% with a false positive rate less than 3%.
