Motivated by applications\nwhere curves stem from paths and walks on an underlying graph (such as a road\nnetwork), we define and study the Fr\\'{e}chet distance for paths and walks on\ngraphs.

NOMA is beneficial when the channel vectors of the users are\nin the same direction, which is not always possible in conventional wireless\nsystems. With the help of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), the base\nstation can control the directions of the channel vectors of the users. Thus,\nby combining both technologies, the RIS-assisted NOMA systems are expected to\nachieve greater improvements in the network throughput. However, ideal phase\ncontrol at the RIS is unrealizable in practice because of the imperfections in\nthe channel estimations and the hardware limitations. This imperfection in\nphase control can have a significant impact on the system performance.\nMotivated by this, in this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted uplink NOMA\nsystem in the presence of imperfect phase compensation.

Brittleness characterizes\nenergy dissipation rate and strain localization at failure. Brittleness has\nbeen investigated in hydrocarbon-bearing mudrocks in order to quantify the\nimpact of hydraulic fracturing on the creation of complex fracture networks and\nsurface area for reservoir drainage. Typical well logging correlations\nassociate brittleness with carbonate content or dynamic elastic properties.\nHowever, an index of rock brittleness should involve actual rock failure and\nhave a consistent method to quantify it. Here we present a systematic method to\nquantify mudrock brittleness based on micro-mechanical measurements from the\nscratch test. Brittleness is formulated as the ratio of energy associated with\nbrittle failure to the total energy required to perform a scratch. Soda lime\nglass and polycarbonate are used for comparison to identify failure in brittle\nand ductile mode and validate the developed method. Scratch testing results on\nmudrocks indicate that it is possible to use the recorded transverse force to\nestimate brittleness. Results show that tested samples rank as follows in\nincreasing degree of brittleness: Woodford, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Mancos, and\nVaca Muerta. Eagle Ford samples show mixed ductile/brittle failure\ncharacteristics. There appears to be no definite correlation between\nmicro-scratch brittleness and quartz or total carbonate content. Dolomite\ncontent shows a stronger correlation with brittleness than any other major\nmineral group. The scratch brittleness index correlates positively with\nincreasing Young's modulus and decreasing Poisson's ratio, but shows deviations\nin rocks with distinct porosity and with stress-sensitive brittle/ductile\nbehavior (Eagle Ford).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 16:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

The magnetic manipulations of\nferrofluids have been useful in augmenting heat transfer, as evident from\nrecent investigations. In the present study, we examine a novel strategy for\naugmenting two-phase heat transfer and show that the magnetic manipulation of\nnon-boiling Taylor bubble flow (TBF) of ferrofluids can provide on-demand\naugmentation. In an earlier investigation (DOI:10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.124589),\nwe had shown that the characteristics of the TBF of ferrofluids could be\naltered through external magnetic manipulations. As transport characteristics\nof TBFs primarily depend on their flow morphology, it was anticipated that such\nalteration would affect their thermal transport characteristics, which are\nexamined in the present work. The generation of smaller bubbles and unit-cells\nthrough magnetic manipulations decreases the void fraction of the resulting\nTBF. In addition, a greater number of units participated in the heat exchange\nprocess compared to larger bubble-slug systems at any time instance. Such flow\nmodifications cause considerable augmentation (which can go up to 100%) in\ntwo-phase heat transfer. The extent of augmentation depends on the applied\nmagnetic field and induced magnetic force, homogeneous gas fraction, liquid\nfilm thickness/void fraction and flow morphology of the resulting TBF, which\nare examined in the present study. The application of ferrofluids in TBFs\nprovides multiple benefits, such as suspension of nanoparticles with better\nthermal properties and additional functionality of the flow manipulations\nthrough external means. The proposed application with the suggested\nmanipulation technique provides an effective alternative for an on-demand\naugmentation in two-phase heat transfer in low Reynolds number flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 17:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The goal of the\nreward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently\nwhile ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the\nnew reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward\nfunction. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward\npoisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the\nreward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are\ninadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the\nproblem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward\ndesign problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging,\nand it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then\nproceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates\nthe optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more\namenable to optimization techniques and analysis.

To exemplify, we find, display, and\nstudy in a unified manner a Minkowski-Minkowski closed universe and a\nMinkowski-Minkowski traversable wormhole. By joining two 3-dimensional flat\nballs along a thin shell two-sphere of matter, i.e., a spherical domain wall,\ninto a single spacetime one gets a Minkowski-Minkowski static closed universe,\ni.e., a bubble universe.

Thus, Minkowski-Minkowski bubble universes and wormholes\ncan be seen as complementary. It is also striking that these two spacetimes\nhave resemblances with two well-known static universes. The Minkowski-Minkowski\nstatic closed universe resembles the Einstein universe, a static closed\nspherical universe homogeneously filled with dust matter and with a\ncosmological constant. The Minkowski-Minkowski static open universe resembles\nthe Friedmann static universe, a static open hyperbolic universe homogeneously\nfilled with negative energy density dust and with a negative cosmological, a\nuniverse with two disjoint branes that can be considered a failed wormhole. In\nthis light, the Einstein and Friedmann universes are also two sides of the same\nconcept. A linear stability analysis for all these spacetimes is performed. The\ncomplementarity between bubble universes and traversable wormholes, that exists\nfor these static spacetimes, can be can carried out for dynamical spacetimes,\nindicating that such a complementarity is general. The study suggests that\nbubble universes and traversable wormholes can be seen as coming out of the\nsame concept, and thus, if ones exist the others should also exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

One\npromising scenario is that magnetic fields generated during inflation, larger\nthan 0.1 nG on Mpc scales, were adiabatically compressed to $\\mu$G strengths in\ngalaxies during structure formation. Thus, detecting a scale-invariant\nprimordial magnetic field (PMF) above 0.1 nG on Mpc scales just after\nrecombination would indicate an inflationary origin of galactic magnetic\nfields. This would also provide compelling evidence that inflation occurred\nsince only an inflationary mechanism could generate such a strong,\nscale-invariant magnetic field on Mpc scales. In contrast, constraining the\nscale-invariant PMF strength to be below 0.1 nG would imply an inflationary\nscenario is not the primary origin, since such weak PMFs cannot be amplified\nenough via adiabatic compression to produce the strength of the galactic fields\nwe observe today. We find that measurements of anisotropic birefringence by\nfuture CMB surveys will be able to improve the sensitivity to Mpc-scale\ninflationary PMFs by an order of magnitude, and, in particular, that CMB-HD\nwould lower the upper bound to 0.072 nG at the 95% C.L., which is below the\ncritical 0.1 nG threshold for ruling out a purely inflationary origin.

Differently from\nclassical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a\nknown partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input\nparameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map\nof a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so\nfar restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning\nhidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural\noperator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is\nresolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of\nhandling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and\nclassifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network\nas a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of\ninfinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose\nstability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with\nintegral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range\ndependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of\nnode-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance\nwith neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network\ndynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN's optimal parameters\nfrom shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep\ninitialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods\nin both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and\ngeneralize well to different resolutions and depths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 19:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Here we propose a voter model\nincorporating bots and radical or intolerant individuals in the decision-making\nprocess. The dynamics of the system occur in a multiplex network of interacting\nagents composed of two layers, one for the dynamics of opinions where agents\nchoose between two possible alternatives, and the other for the tolerance\ndynamics, in which agents adopt one of two tolerance levels. The tolerance\naccounts for the likelihood to change opinion in an interaction, with tolerant\n(intolerant) agents switching opinion with probability $1.0$ ($\\gamma \\le 1$).\nWe find that intolerance leads to a consensus of tolerant agents during an\ninitial stage that scales as $\\tau^+ \\sim \\gamma^{-1} \\ln N$, who then reach an\nopinion consensus during the second stage in a time that scales as $\\tau \\sim\nN$, where $N$ is the number of agents.

Regularized\noptimization-based techniques, a prominent class of TDE algorithms, optimize a\nnon-linear energy functional consisting of data constancy and spatial\ncontinuity constraints to obtain the displacement and strain maps between the\ntime-series frames under consideration. The existing optimization-based TDE\nmethods often consider the L2-norm of displacement derivatives to construct the\nregularizer.

The quantity of interest is the fixation\nprobability, i.e., the probability that the initial mutant eventually takes\nover the whole population.

The data\ngeneration scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space\npruning to ensure high-quality controls.

Our\nextensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification\naccuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet\nconverges substantially faster.

It is\nalso true for amenable groups that a non-zero solution exists for any finite\nsystem of linear equations over $R$, where the number of unknowns exceeds the\nnumber of equations. Recently Bartholdi proved the converse. As a consequence\nof this theorem, Kielak proved that R.\\,Thompson's group $F$ is amenable if and\nonly if it satisfies the Ore condition. The amenability problem for $F$ is a\nlong-standing open question.\n  In this paper we prove that some equations or their systems have non-zero\nsolutions in the group rings of $F$.

Most\nmethods routinely adopt either pointwise or pairwise loss to train the model\nparameters, while rarely pay attention to softmax loss due to the high\ncomputational cost. Sampled softmax loss emerges as an efficient substitute for\nsoftmax loss. Its special case, InfoNCE loss, has been widely used in\nself-supervised learning and exhibited remarkable performance for contrastive\nlearning. Nonetheless, limited studies use sampled softmax loss as the learning\nobjective to train the recommender. Worse still, none of them explore its\nproperties and answer \"Does sampled softmax loss suit for item recommendation?\"\nand \"What are the conceptual advantages of sampled softmax loss, as compared\nwith the prevalent losses?\", to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we aim\nto better understand sampled softmax loss for item recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first theoretically reveal three model-agnostic advantages:\n(1) mitigating popularity bias, which is beneficial to long-tail\nrecommendation; (2) mining hard negative samples, which offers informative\ngradients to optimize model parameters; and (3) maximizing the ranking metric,\nwhich facilitates top-K performance. Moreover, we probe the model-specific\ncharacteristics on the top of various recommenders. Experimental results\nsuggest that sampled softmax loss is more friendly to history and graph-based\nrecommenders (e.g., SVD++ and LightGCN), but performs poorly for ID-based\nmodels (e.g., MF). We ascribe this to its shortcoming in learning\nrepresentation magnitude, making the combination with the models that are also\nincapable of adjusting representation magnitude learn poor representations. In\ncontrast, the history- and graph-based models, which naturally adjust\nrepresentation magnitude according to node degree, are able to compensate for\nthe shortcoming of sampled softmax loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 04:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

We observe that the amplitude\nand dominant frequency of the limit cycle oscillations gradually decrease as\nthe length of the coupling tube is increased. Complete suppression (AD) of\nthese oscillations is observed when the length of the coupling tube is nearly\n3/8 times the wavelength of the fundamental acoustic mode of the combustor.\nMeanwhile, as we approach this state of amplitude death, the dynamical behavior\nof acoustic pressure changes from the state of limit cycle oscillations to\nlow-amplitude chaotic oscillations via intermittency.

The model-based defense scheme considered in this study,\nnamely Bayesian defense mechanism, chooses reasonable reactions through\nobservation of the system's behavior using models of the system's stochastic\ndynamics, the vulnerability to be exploited, and the attacker's objective. On\nthe other hand, rational attackers take deceptive strategies for misleading the\ndefender into making inappropriate decisions.

It is shown that\nthe belief of the true scenario has a limit in a stochastic sense at an\nequilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact implies that there are only\ntwo possible cases: the defender asymptotically detects the attack with a firm\nbelief, or the attacker takes actions such that the system's behavior becomes\nnominal after a finite time step. Consequently, if different scenarios result\nin different stochastic behaviors, the Bayesian defense mechanism guarantees\nthe system to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective\ncountermeasures are implemented.

Via extensive\ntheoretical and empirical analysis, we show that mixup, when used together with\nGenLabel, can effectively resolve the aforementioned phenomenon, improving the\ngeneralization performance and the adversarial robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 07:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

To this end, this paper proposes a novel cross-modality deep feature\nlearning framework to segment brain tumors from the multi-modality MRI data.\nThe core idea is to mine rich patterns across the multi-modality data to make\nup for the insufficient data scale. The proposed cross-modality deep feature\nlearning framework consists of two learning processes: the cross-modality\nfeature transition (CMFT) process and the cross-modality feature fusion (CMFF)\nprocess, which aims at learning rich feature representations by transiting\nknowledge across different modality data and fusing knowledge from different\nmodality data, respectively.

Various deep\nlearning models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nmotion prediction. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling\ntemporal dynamics in the pose space. Unfortunately, the complicated and high\ndimensionality nature of human motion brings inherent challenges for dynamic\ncontext capturing. Therefore, we move away from the conventional pose based\nrepresentation and present a novel approach employing a phase space trajectory\nrepresentation of individual joints. Moreover, current methods tend to only\nconsider the dependencies between physically connected joints. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel convolutional neural model to effectively leverage\nexplicit prior knowledge of motion anatomy, and simultaneously capture both\nspatial and temporal information of joint trajectory dynamics.

Existing deraining methods usually make heuristic assumptions of the\nrain model, which compels them to employ complex optimization or iterative\nrefinement for high recovery quality. This, however, leads to time-consuming\nmethods and affects the effectiveness for addressing rain patterns deviated\nfrom from the assumptions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient\nderaining method by formulating deraining as a predictive filtering problem\nwithout complex rain model assumptions. Specifically, we identify\nspatially-variant predictive filtering (SPFilt) that adaptively predicts proper\nkernels via a deep network to filter different individual pixels. Since the\nfiltering can be implemented via well-accelerated convolution, our method can\nbe significantly efficient. We further propose the EfDeRain+ that contains\nthree main contributions to address residual rain traces, multi-scale, and\ndiverse rain patterns without harming the efficiency. First, we propose the\nuncertainty-aware cascaded predictive filtering (UC-PFilt) that can identify\nthe difficulties of reconstructing clean pixels via predicted kernels and\nremove the residual rain traces effectively. Second, we design the\nweight-sharing multi-scale dilated filtering (WS-MS-DFilt) to handle\nmulti-scale rain streaks without harming the efficiency. Third, to eliminate\nthe gap across diverse rain patterns, we propose a novel data augmentation\nmethod (i.e., RainMix) to train our deep models. By combining all contributions\nwith sophisticated analysis on different variants, our final method outperforms\nbaseline methods on four single-image deraining datasets and one video\nderaining dataset in terms of both recovery quality and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 08:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Transfer moves cause non-smoothor\nbumpy surfaces and get worse for materials with large inertia like clay. For\nsurface models, the effects of continuity are even more severe, in terms of\nsurface quality and model stability. In this paper, we introduce an original\ncriterion \"one-path-patch\" (OPP), for representing a shell surface patch that\ncan be traversed in one path considering fabrication constraints. We study the\nproperties of an OPP and the merging operations for OPPs, and propose a\nbottom-up OPP merging procedure for decomposing the given shell surface into a\nminimal number of OPPs and generating the \"as-continuous-as-possible\" (ACAP)\ntoolpath. Furthermore, we customize the path planning algorithm with a curved\nlayer printing scheme, which reduces the staircase defect and improves the\ntoolpath continuity via possibly connecting multiple segments. We evaluate the\nACAP algorithm for both ceramic and thermoplastic materials, and results\ndemonstrate that it improves the fabrication of surface models in both surface\nquality and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 09:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 20:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 May 2022 08:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

Reduction of the confinement distance (the gap between\nthe solid surfaces) leads to systematized nano-particle agglomeration yielding\nto spokes-like patterns similar to those found on scallop shells instead of\ncircumferential edge deposition. Alteration of the confinement length modulates\nthe curvature that entails variations in the evaporation flux across the\nliquid-vapor interface. Consequently, flow inside different liquid bridges\n(LBs) varies significantly for different confinement lengths. Small confinement\nlengths result in the stick-slip motion of squeezed liquid bridges. On the\ncontrary, the stretched LBs exhibit pinned contact lines. We decipher a\nproposition that a drying liquid thin film present during dewetting near the\nthree-phase contact line is responsible for the aligned deposition of\nparticles. The confinement distance determines the height of this thin film,\nand its theoretical estimations are validated against the experimental\nobservations using reflection interferometry, further exhibiting good agreement\n(in order of magnitude). Modulating the particle size does not significantly\ninfluence the precipitate patterns; however, particle concentration can\nsubstantially affect the deposition patterns. The differences in deposition\npatterns are attributed to the complex interplay of the gradient of evaporation\nflux induced motion of contact line in combination with the drying of thin\nliquid film during dewetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 09:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

In contrast, in this paper we develop a\nmodel-free feedback controller for efficient steady-state operation of general\ndynamical systems. The proposed design consists in updating control inputs via\ngradient estimates constructed from evaluations of the nonconvex objective at\nthe current input and at the measured output. We study the dynamic\ninterconnection of the proposed iterative controller with a stable nonlinear\ndiscrete-time plant. For this setup, we characterize the optimality and the\nstability of the closed-loop behavior as functions of the problem dimension,\nthe number of iterations, and the rate of convergence of the physical plant.

Many\nmethods have been proposed to deal with Human-to-Object Interaction (HOI)\ndetection, i.e., detecting in an image which person and object interact\ntogether and classifying the type of interaction. However, Human-to-Human\nInteractions, such as social and violent interactions, are generally not\nconsidered in available HOI training datasets. As we think these types of\ninteractions cannot be ignored and decorrelated from HOI when analyzing human\nbehavior, we propose a new interaction dataset to deal with both types of human\ninteractions: Human-to-Human-or-Object (H2O). In addition, we introduce a novel\ntaxonomy of verbs, intended to be closer to a description of human body\nattitude in relation to the surrounding targets of interaction, and more\nindependent of the environment. Unlike some existing datasets, we strive to\navoid defining synonymous verbs when their use highly depends on the target\ntype or requires a high level of semantic interpretation. As H2O dataset\nincludes V-COCO images annotated with this new taxonomy, images obviously\ncontain more interactions. This can be an issue for HOI detection methods whose\ncomplexity depends on the number of people, targets or interactions. Thus, we\npropose DIABOLO (Detecting InterActions By Only Looking Once), an efficient\nsubject-centric single-shot method to detect all interactions in one forward\npass, with constant inference time independent of image content. In addition,\nthis multi-task network simultaneously detects all people and objects. We show\nhow sharing a network for these tasks does not only save computation resource\nbut also improves performance collaboratively. Finally, DIABOLO is a strong\nbaseline for the new proposed challenge of H2O Interaction detection, as it\noutperforms all state-of-the-art methods when trained and evaluated on HOI\ndataset V-COCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 11:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

That\nis, we want to simulate an array containing the answers of a join query sorted\nin a lexicographic order chosen by the user. A recent dichotomy showed for\nwhich queries and orders this task can be done in polylogarithmic access time\nafter quasilinear preprocessing, but this dichotomy does not tell us how much\ntime is required in the cases classified as hard. We determine the\npreprocessing time needed to achieve polylogarithmic access time for all join\nqueries and all lexicographical orders. To this end, we propose a\ndecomposition-based general algorithm for direct access on join queries. We\nthen explore its optimality by proving lower bounds for the preprocessing time\nbased on the hardness of a certain online Set-Disjointness problem, which shows\nthat our algorithm's bounds are tight for all lexicographic orders on join\nqueries. Then, we prove the hardness of Set-Disjointness based on the\nZero-Clique Conjecture which is an established conjecture from fine-grained\ncomplexity theory. Interestingly, while proving our lower bound, we show that\nself-joins do not affect the complexity of direct access (up to logarithmic\nfactors). Our algorithm can also be used to solve queries with projections and\nrelaxed order requirements, though in these cases, its running time not\nnecessarily optimal. We also show that similar techniques to those used in our\nlower bounds can be used to prove that, for enumerating answers to\nLoomis-Whitney joins, it is not possible to significantly improve upon\ntrivially computing all answers at preprocessing.

Up to now, the\nmultimedia forensics literature has proposed various techniques to localize\nmanipulations in natural photographs, but the integrity assessment of SAR\nimages was never investigated.

Our goal is to localize regions\nof an amplitude SAR image that have been copied and pasted from another image,\npossibly undergoing some kind of editing in the process. To do so, we leverage\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract a fingerprint highlighting\ninconsistencies in the processing traces of the analyzed input.

However, they can hardly model\nthe relationship quantitatively among different levels of depth changes,\ntexture degeneration, and the view synthesis distortion (VSD), which is crucial\nfor rate-distortion optimization and rate allocation. In this paper, an\nauto-weighted layer representation based view synthesis distortion estimation\nmodel is developed. Firstly, the sub-VSD (S-VSD) is defined according to the\nlevel of depth changes and their associated texture degeneration. After that, a\nset of theoretical derivations demonstrate that the VSD can be approximately\ndecomposed into the S-VSDs multiplied by their associated weights. To obtain\nthe S-VSDs, a layer-based representation of S-VSD is developed, where all the\npixels with the same level of depth changes are represented with a layer to\nenable efficient S-VSD calculation at the layer level. Meanwhile, a nonlinear\nmapping function is learnt to accurately represent the relationship between the\nVSD and S-VSDs, automatically providing weights for S-VSDs during the VSD\nestimation. To learn such function, a dataset of VSD and its associated S-VSDs\nare built. Experimental results show that the VSD can be accurately estimated\nwith the weights learnt by the nonlinear mapping function once its associated\nS-VSDs are available.

CBIID is found to originate from the steady,\nnon-homogeneous solution of the governing system of equations. Similar to\nStokes drift induced by surface waves, CBIID also generates a compensating\nEulerian return flow to satisfy the no-flux lateral boundaries, e.g. the\nshoreline. CBIID increases with an increase in the particle's initial depth,\nbottom undulation's amplitude, and the strength of the alongshore current.\nAdditionally, CBIID near the free (bottom) surface increases (decreases) with\nan increase in bottom undulation's wavelength. Maximum CBIID is obtained for\nlong wavelength bottom topography that approximately makes $\\pi/4$ angle with\nthe shoreline.

Despite early success, segmentation networks may still\ngenerate anatomically aberrant segmentations, with holes or inaccuracies near\nthe object boundaries. To enforce anatomical plausibility, recent research\nstudies have focused on incorporating prior knowledge such as object shape or\nboundary, as constraints in the loss function. Prior integrated could be\nlow-level referring to reformulated representations extracted from the\nground-truth segmentations, or high-level representing external medical\ninformation such as the organ's shape or size. Over the past few years,\nprior-based losses exhibited a rising interest in the research field since they\nallow integration of expert knowledge while still being architecture-agnostic.\nHowever, given the diversity of prior-based losses on different medical imaging\nchallenges and tasks, it has become hard to identify what loss works best for\nwhich dataset. In this paper, we establish a benchmark of recent prior-based\nlosses for medical image segmentation.

The most recent spectrographs, such as ESPRESSO or\nEXPRES, have the potential to detect Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.\nHowever, stellar activity can induce radial velocity variations that dilute or\neven mimic the signature of a planet. A widely recognized method for\ndisentangling these signals is to model the radial velocity time series,\njointly with stellar activity indicators, using Gaussian processes and their\nderivatives. However, such modeling is prohibitive in terms of computational\nresources for large data sets, as the cost typically scales as the total number\nof measurements cubed.\n  Here, we present S+LEAF 2, a Gaussian process framework that can be used to\njointly model several time series, with a computational cost that scales\nlinearly with the data set size.

However, the use\nof Transfer Entropy is usually discouraged in such cases. We simulate\nsimplistic examples where we confirm the failure of classic implementations of\nTransfer Entropy when applied to narrow-band signals, as made evident by a\nflawed recovery of effect sizes and interaction delays.

The first part of this paper studies the deletion channel\nthat deletes a symbol with some fixed probability $p$, while focusing on two\ninstances of this channel. Since operating the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder\nin this case is computationally unfeasible, we study a slightly degraded\nversion of this decoder for two channels and its expected normalized distance.\nWe identify the dominant error patterns and based on these observations, it is\nderived that the expected normalized distance of the degraded ML decoder is\nroughly $\\frac{3q-1}{q-1}p^2$, when the transmitted word is any $q$-ary\nsequence and $p$ is the channel's deletion probability.

Considering\nsymmetric hypothesis testing, the quantum Chernoff bound is derived and limits\non detection error probability is analysed for both the two-mode squeezed\nvacuum state and the coherent state classical benchmark. Our findings show that\nin such a scheme the potential quantum advantage is amplified even in regimes\nwhere quantum illumination alone offers no advantage, thereby extending its\npotential use. The same cannot be said for coherent states, whose performances\nare generally bounded by that without amplification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 14:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 14:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-09"}

In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive\nmodels based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby\ncreating an adaptive steganographic system.

Furthermore, a partial correlation analysis shows that many commonly\ndiscussed correlations between galaxy properties and quenching are spurious,\nand that the fundamental correlation is between quenching and velocity\ndispersion. In particular, we find that at fixed velocity dispersion, there is\nonly a very weak dependence of quenching on the disc properties, whereby more\ndiscy galaxies are slightly more likely to be forming stars.

The $r$-bit term is an encoder artifact\nindispensable to ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\\frac{\\sigma}{n})$\nbits per letter. We complement this bound by a series of examples showing that\nan $\\Omega(\\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary when $\\sigma > n/3$, where\n$\\Omega(\\sigma + r)$ is at least $\\frac{\\sigma-1}{4}+r-2$. We argue that\nsimilar examples exist for any methods that distribute letters in tANS tables\nusing only the knowledge about frequencies. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture\nthat the redundancy is $O(\\frac{\\sigma}{n^2})$ bits per letter.\n  We also propose a new variant of range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed\naccuracy, that is parameterized by $k \\ge 1$. In this variant the integer\ndivision, which is unavoidable in rANS, is performed only in cases when its\nresult belongs to $[2^k..2^{k+1})$. Hence, the division can be computed by\nfaster methods provided $k$ is small. We bound the redundancy for the rANS with\nfixed accuracy $k$ by $\\frac{n}{2^k-1}\\log e+r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 15:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

Objective: Create a dataset for developing\nand evaluating clinical EQA systems that can handle natural multi-answer and\nmulti-focus questions. Methods: We leveraged the annotated relations from the\n2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) corpus to generate an EQA dataset.\nSpecifically, the 1-to-N, M-to-1, and M-to-N drug-reason relations were\nincluded to form the multi-answer and multi-focus QA entries, which represent\nmore complex and natural challenges in addition to the basic\none-drug-one-reason cases.

However, it has been challenging to\nimplement the true 3D holography with high-reconstruction quality due to the\nspeckle. Here, we propose the practical solution to realize speckle-free,\nhigh-contrast, true 3D holography by combining random-phase, temporal\nmultiplexing, binary holography, and binary optimization. We adopt the random\nphase for the true 3D implementation to achieve the maximum axial resolution\nwith fully independent control of the 3D voxels.

To detect such groups, a common model is to represent fraudster groups'\nstatic networks, consequently overlooking the longitudinal behavior of a\nreviewer thus the dynamics of co-review relations among reviewers in a group.\nHence, these approaches are incapable of excluding outlier reviewers, which are\nfraudsters intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine\nreviewers happen to co-review in fraudster groups.

The\nsustainability of this technology relies on the end-of-life management of its\nmoderator, which is activated into a long-lived nuclear waste, by neutron\nfluxes, during operating time. In particular, C14 is created. Nuclear\ntransmutation, enabled by laser-driven particle acceleration, has been\nenvisioned as a potential novel treatment scheme for long-lived nuclear waste.\nBy triggering controlled nuclear reactions with energetic particles, long-lived\nradionuclides could be transformed into stable isotopes. Such a system could\ntreat the C14 nuclei trapped within the i-graphite matrix, which is difficult\nto isolate by other means. This work performs a quantitative preliminary study\nof this transmutation scheme, in order to assess its feasibility at an\nindustrial scale. The method used can be transposed to assess any transmutation\nscheme using a beam of particles directly sent on the material to be treated.\nFirst, a nuclear interaction channel which transmutes C14 nuclei without\ncreating new long-lived radionuclides is identified. It consists in the choice\nof a type of particle, among which protons, gamma photons and neutrons can all\nbe accelerated by laser-matter interaction; and it is completed by the adequate\nenergy at which this particle must be sent on i-graphite. To that end, the\nnuclear cross-sections of C12, C13 and C14 are reviewed, neglecting other\nimpurities in i-graphite. Then, based on the interaction channel\nidentification, the energy cost of this scheme is estimated. Protons between 1\nand 5 MeV make it possible to transmute C14 without creating any new long-lived\nactivity. However, our result show that, even in this favorable reaction\nchannel, the transmutation energy cost is too high for an i-graphite\ntransmutation scheme to be feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 10:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 17:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

The unseen, unknown, scenarios are known as\ncounterfactuals. AI algorithms use a representation based on knowledge graphs\n(KG) to represent the concepts of time, space, and facts. A KG is a graphical\ndata model which captures the semantic relationships between entities such as\nevents, objects, or concepts. The existing KGs represent causal relationships\nextracted from texts based on linguistic patterns of noun phrases for causes\nand effects as in ConceptNet and WordNet. The current causality representation\nin KGs makes it challenging to support counterfactual reasoning. A richer\nrepresentation of causality in AI systems using a KG-based approach is needed\nfor better explainability, and support for intervention and counterfactuals\nreasoning, leading to improved understanding of AI systems by humans. The\ncausality representation requires a higher representation framework to define\nthe context, the causal information, and the causal effects. The proposed\nCausal Knowledge Graph (CausalKG) framework, leverages recent progress of\ncausality and KG towards explainability. CausalKG intends to address the lack\nof a domain adaptable causal model and represent the complex causal relations\nusing the hyper-relational graph representation in the KG.

So\nfar, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating\nrule induction has been reported. This is first study to consider the\nacceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We\npropose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the\naccelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a\nrule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree,\ncalled Consistence-based Value Reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis\nto accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed Key Set,\nwhich only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to\nconduct value reduction. The monotonicity of Key Set ensures the feasibility of\nour accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on Key\nSet, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the\nunaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of Key Set\nensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and\nthe unaccelerated method.

To tackle such scenarios, a controller needs to ensure a\npredefined tracking accuracy so as not to violate the constraints while\nsimultaneously tackling uncertainties and disturbances. However,\nstate-of-the-art controllers dealing with constrained system motion are either\nnot applicable for an underactuated system like quadrotor, or cannot tackle\nsystem uncertainties under full state constraints. This work attempts to fill\nsuch a gap in literature by designing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) based\nrobust controllers to satisfy multiple state-constraints while simultaneously\nnegotiating parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The superiority\nof the BLF control method over a typical unconstrained controller is\ndemonstrated, followed by a robust control design to satisfy position and\norientation constraints on quadrotor dynamics. Finally, full state-constraints\non a quadrotor(i.e., constraints on the position, orientation, linear velocity\nand angular velocity) are satisfied with robust control.

There are reasons to expect eccentric\nmagnetized disks to also exist, but the behavior of the MRI in these disks\nremains largely uncharted territory. Here we present the first simulations that\nfollow the nonlinear development of the MRI in eccentric disks. We find that\nthe MRI in eccentric disks resembles circular disks in two ways, in the overall\nlevel of saturation and in the dependence of the detailed saturated state on\nmagnetic topology. However, in contrast with circular disks, the Maxwell stress\nin eccentric disks can be negative in some disk sectors, even though the\nintegrated stress is always positive. The angular momentum flux raises the\neccentricity of the inner parts of the disk and diminishes the same of the\nouter parts. Because material accreting onto a black hole from an eccentric\norbit possesses more energy than material tracing the innermost stable circular\norbit, the radiative efficiency of eccentric disks may be significantly lower\nthan circular disks.

Both buyers and sellers make\ndecisions without knowing the present and future state of the large and dynamic\nreal estate market. Current approaches rely on analysis of historic\ntransactions to price a property. However, as we show in this paper, the\ntransaction data alone cannot be used to forecast demand. We develop a housing\ndemand index based on microscopic home showings events data that can provide\ndecision-making support for buyers and sellers on a very granular time and\nspatial scale. We use statistical modeling to develop a housing market demand\nforecast up to twenty weeks using high-volume, high-velocity data on home\nshowings, listing events, and historic sales data. We demonstrate our analysis\nusing data from seven million individual records sourced from a unique,\nproprietary dataset that has not previously been explored in application to the\nreal estate market. We then employ a series of predictive models to estimate\ncurrent and forecast future housing demand. A housing demand index provides\ninsight into the level of demand for a home on the market and to what extent\ncurrent demand represents future expectation. As a result, these indices\nprovide decision-making support into important questions about when to sell or\nbuy, or the elasticity present in the housing demand market, which impact price\nnegotiations, price-taking and price-setting expectations. This forecast is\nespecially valuable because it helps buyers and sellers to know on a granular\nand timely basis if they should engage in a home transaction or adjust their\nhome price both in current and future states based on our forecasted housing\ndemand index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 21:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The modern industry is rapidly shifting from manual control\nof systems to automation, in order to increase productivity and to deliver\nquality products. Computer-based systems, though feasible for improving quality\nand productivity, are inflexible to work with, and the cost of such systems is\nsignificantly high. This led to the swift adoption of automated systems to\nperform industrial tasks. One such task of industrial significance is of\npicking and placing objects from one place to another. The implementation of\nautomation in pick and place tasks helps to improve efficiency of system and\nalso the performance. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate the designing\nand working of an automated robotic arm with the Machine Learning approach.

However, special disease features of diabetes and\nits wide heterogeneity make it difficult to apply individualized approaches. In\nthis study, a novel framework was established based on the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP) approach to calculate various physiological factors\nweights when developing a diabetic exercise prescription. Proposed factors were\ninvestigated with respect to three groups which contains 12 different aspects.\nThe relative weights were assessed by a database which established through a\nquestionnaire survey. It is concluded that the physical fitness factors and\ncardiovascular risk factors need to be paid more attention to considered in the\nformulation of exercise rehabilitation programs than disease factors. And the\ncardiopulmonary function of physical fitness factors accounts for the highest\nimportance. Furthermore, it was found that blood lipids have the lowest\nimportance among studied factors. The mathematical model of exercise\nrehabilitation program for diabetes patients was established, which provided\nthe theoretical basis for individualized guidance of exercise rehabilitation\nprogram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 11:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

The AGC sported 72kb of ROM, 4kb of RAM, and a whopping 14,245 FLOPS,\nroughly 30 million times fewer than the computer this report is being written\non. These limitations are what make the AGC so interesting, as its programmers\nhad to ration each individual word of memory due to the bulk of memory\ntechnology of the time. Despite these limitations (or perhaps due to them), the\nAGC was highly optimized, and arguably the most advanced computer of its time,\nas its computational power was only matched in the late 1970s by computers like\nthe Apple II. It is safe to say that the AGC had no intended market, and was\nexplicitly designed to enhance control of the Apollo Command Module and Apollo\nLunar Module. The AGC was not entirely internal to NASA, however, and was\ndesigned in MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory, and manufactured by Raytheon, a\nweapons and defense contractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 18:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

While multiple algorithms were proposed for full\nenumeration or sampling-based estimates, these methods fail in very large\ngraphs. Recent advances in parallelization allow for estimates of total\nsub-graphs counts in very large graphs. The task of counting the frequency of\neach sub-graph associated with each vertex also received excellent solutions\nfor undirected graphs. However, there is currently no good solution for very\nlarge directed graphs.\n  We here propose VDMC (Vertex specific Distributed Motif Counting) -- a fully\ndistributed algorithm to optimally count all the 3 and 4 vertices connected\ndirected graphs (sub-graph motifs) associated with each vertex of a graph. VDMC\ncounts each motif only once and its efficacy is linear in the number of counted\nmotifs. It is fully parallelized to be efficient in GPU-based computation. VDMC\nis based on three main elements: 1) Ordering the vertices and only counting\nmotifs containing increasing order vertices, 2) sub-ordering motifs based on\nthe average length of the BFS composing the motif, and 3) removing isomorphisms\nonly once for the entire graph. We here compare VDMC to analytical estimates of\nthe expected number of motifs and show its accuracy. VDMC is available as a\nhighly efficient CPU and GPU code with a novel data structure for efficient\ngraph manipulation. We show the efficacy of VDMC and real-world graphs. VDMC\nallows for the precise analysis of sub-graph frequency around each vertex in\nlarge graphs and opens the way for the extension of methods until now limited\nto graphs of thousands of edges to graphs with millions of edges and above.\n  GIT: https://github.com/louzounlab/graph-measures\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 23:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

The main challenge of such computations is the high\nmemory effort of classical solvers, which limits the accuracy of chosen\ndiscretizations. In this work, we derive a method for the computation of\neffective eigenvalues when the underlying solution has a low-rank structure.\nThis is accomplished by utilizing dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA),\nwhich is an efficient strategy to derive time evolution equations for low-rank\nsolution representations. The main idea is to interpret the iterates of the\nclassical inverse power iteration as pseudo-time steps and apply the DLRA\nconcepts in this framework. In our numerical experiment, we demonstrate that\nour method significantly reduces memory requirements while achieving the\ndesired accuracy. Analytic investigations show that the proposed iteration\nscheme inherits the convergence speed of the inverse power iteration, at least\nfor a simplified setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 21:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

This is a subject\nof growing importance in modern UK society with the withdrawal of cash\ninfrastructure and a shift towards online banking. This research develops a\ncomposite indicator using a wide-range of input variables, including the\nlocations of existing cash infrastructure, various demographic factors (such as\nincome and housing tenure) and other freely available lifestyle data to\nidentify areas at greatest risk of financial exclusion, thereby aiding\norganisations to develop intervention strategies to tackle the problem. The\nindicator illustrates that whilst there is no apparent correlation between\nfinancial exclusion and deprivation, pockets of extreme financial exclusion are\ngenerally found in deprived communities, and affluent, suburban areas tend to\nscore consistently more favourably and consequently carry less risk. The\nattributing causes vary, from a lack of infrastructure, to low car\navailability, but income levels have a pronounced influence. Three policy\nproposals are put forward, including offering banking services at PayPoint\noutlets, and converting cash machines to cash recyclers, but improving digital\nadoption was found to be the most effective intervention, provided that it is\nimplemented by community organisations. Policies purely targeting\ninfrastructure provision or addressing social exclusion are unlikely to be\neffective, as community-based initiatives coupled with wider reforms to the\nfinancial system are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 14:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}
