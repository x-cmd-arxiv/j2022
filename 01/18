Unfortunately, even the simplest problem\nof deciding if a string appears as a subpath of a graph admits a quadratic\nlower bound under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (Equi et al. ICALP 2019,\nSOFSEM 2021). To avoid this bottleneck, the research has shifted towards more\nspecific graph classes, e.g. those induced from multiple sequence alignments\n(MSAs). Consider segmenting $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..n]$ into $b$ blocks\n$\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..j_1]$, $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_1+1..j_2]$, $\\ldots$,\n$\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_{b-1}+1..n]$.

An EFG is called indexable if a node label occurs as a prefix of only\nthose paths that start from a node of the same block. Equi et al.

In this study we seek to categorize\nand analyze relevant work related to software engineering in a DevOps context\nin order to clarify the different focus areas, themes, and objectives\nunderlying non-functional requirements and also to identify future research\ndirections in this field. We conducted a systematic mapping study, including\n142 selected primary studies, extracted the focus areas, and synthesized the\nthemes and objectives of the described NFRs. In order to examine\nnon-engineering-focused studies related to non-functional requirements in\nDevOps, we conducted a backward snowballing step and additionally included 17\nprimary studies. Our analysis revealed 7 recurrent focus areas and 41 themes\nthat characterize NFRs in DevOps, along with typical objectives for these\nthemes.

The lack of methodological support for specifying, measuring,\nand evaluating fulfillment of these NFRs in DevOps-driven projects offers ample\nopportunities for future research in this field.

We used the strong radius dependence of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect amplitude, caused by planetary companions, to\nmeasure the apparent radius change caused by the exoplanet atmosphere. In order\nto retrieve the transmission spectrum, the radial velocities, which were\ncomputed over wavelength bins that encompass several spectral orders, were used\nto simultaneously fit the Keplerian motion and the RM effect. From this, the\nradius ratio was computed as a function of the wavelength, which allows one to\nretrieve the low-resolution broadband transmission spectrum of a given\nexoplanet.

While THz frequency bands provide abundant bandwidth and\nextremely high data rates, their effective operation is inhibited by short\ncommunication ranges and narrow beams, thus, leading to major challenges\npertaining to user mobility, beam alignment, and handover. In particular, there\nis a strong need for novel beam tracking methods that consider the tradeoff\nbetween enhancing the received signal strength via increasing beam directivity,\nand increasing the coverage probability by widening the beam. In this paper, a\nmulti-objective optimization problem is formulated with the goal of jointly\nmaximizing the expected rate and minimizing the outage probability subject to\ntransmit power and overhead constraints. Subsequently, a novel parameterized\nbeamformer with dynamic beamwidth adaptation is proposed. In addition to the\nprecoder, an event-based beam tracking approach is introduced that efficiently\nprevents outages caused by beam misalignment and dynamic blockage while\nmaintaining a low pilot overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed\nbeamforming scheme improves average rate performance and reduces the amount of\noutages caused by the brittle THz misalignment process and the particularly\nsevere path loss in the THz band. Moreover, the proposed event-triggered THz\nchannel estimation approach enables connectivity with minimal overhead and\nreliable communication at THz bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 17:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 23:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

A summary of these tweets is required by the government\norganizations, agencies, and volunteers for efficient and quick disaster\nresponse. However, the huge influx of tweets makes it difficult to manually get\na precise overview of ongoing events. To handle this challenge, several tweet\nsummarization approaches have been proposed. In most of the existing\nliterature, tweet summarization is broken into a two-step process where in the\nfirst step, it categorizes tweets, and in the second step, it chooses\nrepresentative tweets from each category. There are both supervised as well as\nunsupervised approaches found in literature to solve the problem of first step.\nSupervised approaches requires huge amount of labelled data which incurs cost\nas well as time. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches could not clusters\ntweet properly due to the overlapping keywords, vocabulary size, lack of\nunderstanding of semantic meaning etc. While, for the second step of\nsummarization, existing approaches applied different ranking methods where\nthose ranking methods are very generic which fail to compute proper importance\nof a tweet respect to a disaster. Both the problems can be handled far better\nwith proper domain knowledge. In this paper, we exploited already existing\ndomain knowledge by the means of ontology in both the steps and proposed a\nnovel disaster summarization method OntoDSumm. We evaluate this proposed method\nwith 4 state-of-the-art methods using 10 disaster datasets.

To quantify the strength of the MIs,\nwe derived the integrated change of horizontal field and total change of\nLorentz force over an area. These quantities correlate well with the flare\nstrength, irrespective of whether flares being eruptive or not, short or long\nduration. Further, the free-energy (FE), determined from virial-theorem\nestimates, exhibits statistically significant downward trend which starts\naround the flare time is observed in majority of flares. The change of FE\nduring flares do not depend on eruptivity but have a strong positive\ncorrelation ($\\approx 0.8$) with the Lorentz force change, indicating that the\npart of FE released would penetrate into the photosphere.

The latter is a unique one since it does not exist in\nthe spin-1/2 proton. The vector-polarized PDFs are the same for both the proton\nand spin-1 hadrons; therefore, we mainly investigate the unique PDFs in\ntensor-polarized hadrons. By using the operator product expansion, the twist-3\nPDF $f_{LT}$ can be expressed by two terms in the same way with $g_T$ of the\nproton. The first term is determined by the twist-2 PDF $f_{1LL}$ (or $b_1$)\nwhich was measured by an experiment, and the second term is expressed by\ntwist-3 quark-gluon distributions. If we neglect the higher-twist effects,\n$f_{LT}$ is simply given by $f_{1LL}$, and this relation is similar to the\nWandzura-Wilczek relation of $g_T$. Furthermore, a new sum rule is also\nobtained for $f_{2LT}=2/3 f_{LT}- f_{1LL}$, which is analogous to the\nBurkhardt-Cottingham sum rule, in the tensor-polarized spin-1 hadrons.

In cases such as cardiac imaging, motion may\nbe unavoidable and evaluating motion may be of clinical interest.\nReconstructing images with reduced motion artifacts has typically been achieved\nby developing systems with faster gantry rotation or using algorithms which\nmeasure and/or estimate the displacements. However, these approaches have had\nlimited success due to both physical constraints as well as the challenge of\nestimating/measuring non-rigid, temporally varying, and patient-specific\nmotions. We propose a novel reconstruction framework, NeuralCT, to generate\ntime-resolved images free from motion artifacts. Our approaches utilizes a\nneural implicit approach and does not require estimation or modeling of the\nunderlying motion. Instead, boundaries are represented using a signed distance\nmetric and neural implicit framework. We utilize `analysis-by-synthesis' to\nidentify a solution consistent with the acquired sinogram as well as spatial\nand temporal consistency constraints. We illustrate the utility of NeuralCT in\nthree progressively more complex scenarios: translation of a small circle,\nheartbeat-like change in an ellipse's diameter, and complex topological\ndeformation. Without hyperparameter tuning or change to the architecture,\nNeuralCT provides high quality image reconstruction for all three motions, as\ncompared to filtered backprojection, using mean-square-error and Dice metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 18:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Condensed forms under\northogonal transformations present easy analysis tools for existence,\nuniqueness, regularity, and numerical methods to check these properties.\n  After recalling the concepts for general linear and nonlinear descriptor\nsystems, we demonstrate that many difficulties that arise in general descriptor\nsystems can be easily overcome within the port-Hamiltonian framework. The\nproperties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems are analyzed,\ntime-discretization, and numerical linear algebra techniques are discussed.\nStructure-preserving regularization procedures for descriptor systems are\npresented to make them suitable for simulation and control. Model reduction\ntechniques that preserve the structure and stabilization and optimal control\ntechniques are discussed.\n  The properties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems and their use in\nmodeling simulation and control methods are illustrated with several examples\nfrom different physical domains. The survey concludes with open problems and\nresearch topics that deserve further attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 19:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Adding\nwords that can positively impact the quality of the search query or are\ninformative enough play an important role in returning or gathering relevant\ndocuments that cover a certain topic can result in improving the efficiency of\nthe information retrieval system. Typically, query expansion techniques are\nused to add or substitute words to a given search query to collect relevant\ndata. In this paper, we design and implement a pipeline of automated query\nexpansion. We outline several tools using different methods to expand the\nquery. Our methods depend on targeting emergent events in streaming data over\ntime and finding the hidden topics from targeted documents using probabilistic\ntopic models. We employ Dynamic Eigenvector Centrality to trigger the emergent\nevents, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation to discover the topics. Also, we\nuse an external data source as a secondary stream to supplement the primary\nstream with relevant words and expand the query using the words from both\nprimary and secondary streams.

To address the problem of lack of generalizability for the\ntreatment effect estimated by the RCT sample, we leverage observational studies\nwith large samples that are representative of the target population. This paper\nconcerns evaluating treatment effects on survival outcomes for a target\npopulation and considers a broad class of estimands that are functionals of\ntreatment-specific survival functions, including differences in survival\nprobability and restricted mean survival times. Motivated by two intuitive but\ndistinct approaches, i.e., imputation based on survival outcome regression and\nweighting based on inverse probability of sampling, censoring, and treatment\nassignment, we propose a semiparametric estimator through the guidance of the\nefficient influence function. The proposed estimator is doubly robust in the\nsense that it is consistent for the target population estimands if either the\nsurvival model or the weighting model is correctly specified, and is locally\nefficient when both are correct.

To this end, the recent rise of developments in machine\nlearning has lead to vast improvements in the area of autonomous process\nsupervision. However, the more complex and powerful these models become, the\nless transparent and explainable they generally are as well. One of the main\nchallenges is the monitoring of live deployments of these machine learning\nsystems and raising alerts when encountering events that might impact model\nperformance. In particular, supervised classifiers are typically build under\nthe assumption of stationarity in the underlying data distribution. For\nexample, a visual inspection system trained on a set of material surface\ndefects generally does not adapt or even recognize gradual changes in the data\ndistribution - an issue known as \"data drift\" - such as the emergence of new\ntypes of surface defects. This, in turn, may lead to detrimental\nmispredictions, e.g. samples from new defect classes being classified as\nnon-defective. To this end, it is desirable to provide real-time tracking of a\nclassifier's performance to inform about the putative onset of additional error\nclasses and the necessity for manual intervention with respect to classifier\nre-training. Here, we propose an unsupervised framework that acts on top of a\nsupervised classification system, thereby harnessing its internal deep feature\nrepresentations as a proxy to track changes in the data distribution during\ndeployment and, hence, to anticipate classifier performance degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 19:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Our locally adaptive model-based approach for robustly\ndecoupling combines Bayesian trend filtering and machine learning based\nregularization. An over-parameterized Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is\nfirst applied to characterize drift. Then a weighted penalized likelihood\nestimator is paired with the estimated DLM posterior distribution to identify\nshifts. We show how Bayesian DLMs specified with so-called shrinkage priors can\nprovide smooth estimates of underlying trends in the presence of complex noise\ncomponents. However, their inability to shrink exactly to zero inhibits direct\nchangepoint detection. In contrast, penalized likelihood methods are highly\neffective in locating changepoints.

Metals such as\nsilver, gold, and copper nanoparticles, can concentrate electromagnetic (EM)\nfields at the nanoscale, due to the special property called localized surface\nplasmon resonance (LSPR). This laid the foundation for a wide range of\napplications, including nanoscale optics, solar energy harvesting,\nphotocatalysis, and biosensing. However, there are inherent problems associated\nwith plasmonic metals, such as high heating losses, and their inability to be\nscaled-up like semiconductor fabrication processes. In addition, the field\nenhancement is restricted only to electric fields. All together these inhibit\nthe broader use of PMNs in practical applications. In this work, we report\nsubmicron cupric oxide (CuO) particles with a medium refractive index that can\nexhibit strong electric and magnetic Mie resonances with strong\nextinction/scattering cross-sections comparable to or slightly exceeding those\nof their plasmonic counterparts. Through the development of particle synthesis\ntechniques with strong shape and size control, optical spectroscopy, and\nfinite-difference-time-domain simulations we show that the Mie resonance peak\nwavelengths are size- and shape-dependent.

Techniques to fuse sensor data from camera,\nradar, and lidar sensors have been proposed to improve AV perception. However,\nexisting methods are insufficiently robust in difficult driving contexts (e.g.,\nbad weather, low light, sensor obstruction) due to rigidity in their fusion\nimplementations. These methods fall into two broad categories: (i) early\nfusion, which fails when sensor data is noisy or obscured, and (ii) late\nfusion, which cannot leverage features from multiple sensors and thus produces\nworse estimates. To address these limitations, we propose HydraFusion: a\nselective sensor fusion framework that learns to identify the current driving\ncontext and fuses the best combination of sensors to maximize robustness\nwithout compromising efficiency. HydraFusion is the first approach to propose\ndynamically adjusting between early fusion, late fusion, and combinations\nin-between, thus varying both how and when fusion is applied. We show that, on\naverage, HydraFusion outperforms early and late fusion approaches by 13.66% and\n14.54%, respectively, without increasing computational complexity or energy\nconsumption on the industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 AV hardware platform.

Current works commonly leverage traditional static maps to represent\nstatic obstacles and the detection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO)\nmethod to model dynamic obstacles separately. The detection module requires\npre-training, and the dynamic obstacles can only be modeled with certain\nshapes, such as cylinders or ellipsoids. This work utilizes the dual-structure\nparticle-based (DSP) dynamic occupancy map to represent the arbitrary-shaped\nstatic obstacles and dynamic obstacles simultaneously, and proposes an\nefficient risk-aware sampling-based local trajectory planner to realize safe\nflights in this map. The trajectory is planned by sampling motion primitives\ngenerated in the state space. Each motion primitive is divided into two phases:\na short-term phase with a strict risk limitation and a relatively long-term\nphase designed to avoid high-risk regions. The risk is evaluated with the\npredicted particle-form future occupancy status, considering the time\ndimension. With an approach to split from and merge to an arbitrary global\ntrajectory, the planner can also be used in the tasks with preplanned global\ntrajectories. Comparison experiments show that the obstacle avoidance system\ncomposed of the DSP map and our planner performs the best in dynamic\nenvironments. In real-world tests, our quadrotor reaches a speed of 6 m/s with\nthe motion capture system and 2.5 m/s with everything running on a low-price\nsingle-board computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 22:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 11:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

A framework known as Modern Coexistence Theory\nmeasures mechanisms of coexistence by comparing a species perturbed to low\ndensity (the invader) to other species that remain at their typical densities\n(the residents); this invader-resident comparison measures a rare-species\nadvantage that results from specialization. However, there are several\nreasonable ways (i.e., methods) to compare invaders and residents, each\ndiffering in practicality and biological interpretation. Here, using\ntheoretical arguments and case studies, we compare four such methods for\ncalculating coexistence mechanisms: 1) Scaling factors, the traditional\napproach where resident growth rates are scaled by a measure of relative\nsensitivity to competition, obtained by solving a system of linear equations;\n2) The simple comparison, which gives equal weight to all resident species; 3)\nSpeed conversion factors, a novel method in which resident growth rates are\nscaled by a ratio of generation times, and; 4) The invader-invader comparison,\nanother novel method in which a focal species is compared to itself at high vs.\nlow density. We conclude that the conventional scaling factors can be useful in\nsome theoretical research, but are not recommended for empirical applications,\ni.e., determining the mechanisms of coexistence in real communities. Instead,\nwe recommend the simple comparison and speed conversion factor methods. The\nspeed conversion factors are most useful when comparing species with dissimilar\ngeneration times. However, ecologists often study coexistence in guilds of\nspecies with similar life-histories, and therefore, similar generation times.\nIn such scenarios, the easier-to-use simple comparison method is reasonable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 23:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Our goal here is to provide a clearer understanding of the conditions\nfor the storage effect as a step towards a better general explanation for\ncoexistence in a variable environment. Our approach focuses on dividing one of\nthe key conditions for the storage effect, covariance between environment and\ncompetition, into two pieces, namely that there must be a causal relationship\nbetween environment and competition, and that the effects of the environment do\nnot change too quickly. This finer-grained definition can explain a number of\nprevious results, including 1) that the storage effect promotes annual plant\ncoexistence when the germination rate fluctuates, but not when the seed yield\nfluctuates, 2) that the storage effect is more likely to be induced by resource\ncompetition than apparent competition, and 3) that the spatial storage effect\nis more probable than the temporal storage effect.

A brief review of the\ndefinition, diagnosis, and conventional treatment of heteroscedasticity is\npresented herein, and based on that, two more generalized methods for both\nunivariate and multivariate cases are proposed. For a typical four-span simply\nsupported girder bridge, a series of nonlinear time history analyses were\nperformed through multiple stripe analysis to determine its seismic\ndemand-intensity that can be employed as a sample set. For both univariate and\nmultivariate cases, probabilistic seismic demand models were developed based on\nthe two aforementioned methods under the Bayesian regression framework, and the\nfitted results were compared and analyzed with the conventional models using\nlinear regression approaches. In the presence of probabilistic seismic demand\nconsidering heteroscedasticity, the patterns of non-constant variance or\ncovariance can be characterized effectively, and a better-calibrated prediction\nregion than that of homoscedastic models can be provided. The causes of the\nheteroscedasticity phenomenon and subsequent solutions are thoroughly\ndiscussed. The analysis procedures can be further embedded in seismic fragility\nand risk assessment, thus providing a more accurate basis for aseismic\ndecision-making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 01:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Citing the work of Kokubo & Genda [ApJL, 714L,\n21], they argue that the differences between the final planets in simulations\nwith perfect-merging and those where collisions are resolved accurately are\nsmall, and it is, therefore, justified to use perfect-merging results as an\nacceptable approximation to realistic simulations. In this paper, we show that\nthis argument does not stand. We demonstrate that when the mass lost during\ncollisions is taken into account, the final masses of the planets will be so\ndifferent from those obtained from perfect-merging that the latter cannot be\nused as a valid approximation. We carried out a large number of SPH simulations\nof embryo-embryo collisions and determined the amount of the mass and water\nlost in each impact. We applied the results to collisions in a typical\nperfect-merging simulation and showed that even when the mass-loss in each\ncollision is as small as 10%, perfect-merging can, on average, overestimate the\nmasses of the final planets by $\\sim 35\\%$ and their water-contents by more\nthan 18%. Our analysis demonstrates that, while perfect-merging simulations are\nstill a powerful tool in proving concepts, they cannot be used to make\npredictions, draw quantitative conclusions (especially about the past history\nof a planetary system) and serve as a valid approximation to, or in lieu of the\nsimulations in which collisions are resolved accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 02:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Recently, an R2 indicator\nvariant (i.e., $R_2^{\\text{HVC}}$ indicator) is proposed to approximate the\nhypervolume contribution.

The final masses of these\nbinaries are $(6.85M_{\\odot},\\,2.14M_{\\odot})$ and\n$(6.04M_{\\odot},\\,1.31M_{\\odot})$ which look like\n$(9.0_{-1.7}^{+1.7}M_{\\odot},\\, 1.91_{-0.24}^{+0.33}M_{\\odot})$ of GW200105 and\n$(5.9_{-2.5}^{+2.0}M_{\\odot},\\,1.44_{-0.29}^{+0.85}M_{\\odot})$ of GW200115,\nrespectively. We also estimate that 2.68-19.7 PSR-BH binaries in our galaxy\nwill be observed by SKA. The existence of NS-BHs in our galaxy can be confirmed\nin future SKA era. Using the GW observation of NS-BH mergers and the radio\nobservation of PSR-BHs in future, we can get more severe constraints on the\nNS-BH formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 02:57:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 10:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

As a safety net, it is\nnatural to improve the robustness to noise of the optimization algorithm which\nupdates the network parameters in the final process of learning. Previous works\nrevealed that the first momentum used in Adam-like stochastic gradient descent\noptimizers can be modified based on the Student's t-distribution to produce\nupdates robust to noise.

Although many spaceflight\nexperiments were performed in the past to test for potential terrestrial\norganisms as Panspermia seeds, it is uncertain whether such organisms will\nlikely \"seed\" a new planet even if they are able to survive spaceflight.\nTherefore, rather than using organisms, using abiotic chemicals as seeds has\nbeen proposed as part of the molecular Panspermia hypothesis.

All of these functions can result in the gels'\ncapability to alter local geochemical niches on other planets, thereby allowing\nchemical evolution to lead to OoL events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

EUV light is injected through an off-axis\nrotating mirror at the back focal plane and provides off-axis illumination\n(precession beam) to the mask and bounces back twice (at the mask and the\nwafer), finally goes out from the resonator through the rotating mirror. This\nis a single path cavity, there is no resonant effect. The orbital error or\nvibration of the rotating mirror do not affect on the imaging quality. The\noff-axis illumination is essential for high-NA optics, which recovers the high\nspatial frequency, and improves the edge contrast. The matched annular-aperture\nis located at the back-focal plane of the projector mirror, which acts as\nFourier filter passing only the horizontally scattered waves reflected by the\ndensity modulations F(kx,ky,0) : 0-th z-order Fourier component of the mask.\nDuring single precession of the beam, this system creates 2D image of the\nnormally projected density map of the mask pattern onto the wafer, where the\nlongitudinal variation (3D effect) disappears, and thus the mask-shadowing\nproblem is moderated. The depth-of-focus (DOF) is long, and also the image\ncontrast becomes very high. As the objective mirror, Schwarzschild objective or\nWolter telescope will be a suitable candidate. Wolter telescope is axisymmetric\nand lighter than conventional solid concave mirror, therefore, a larger\ndiameter can be fabricated in high precession. By optimizing Wolter telescope,\nit may be possible to cover the wafer field size 26 mm x 33 mm of single\npatterning. Example parameter design was performed, seems technically feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 05:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In order to improve the reliability and accuracy of small-sized road\nextraction when roads of multiple sizes coexist in an HRSI, an enhanced deep\nneural network model termed Dual-Decoder-U-Net (DDU-Net) is proposed in this\npaper.

Their significant impacts on the stability\nregimes of ordered phases, phase diagrams, and elastic properties of the\nsystem, as compared to those of the original PFC model, are revealed through\nsystematic analyses and simulations. The nontrivial contribution from\nthree-point direct correlation leads to the variation of the critical point of\norder-disorder transition to which all the phase boundaries in the\ntemperature-density phase diagram converge.

Therefore, by perceiving the inherent property of air-to-ground massive\nMIMO-OFDM channel samples, the DL-based E2E neural network can establish the\nmapping function from the channel to the beamformer, so that the explicit\nchannel reconstruction can be avoided with reduced pilot and feedback overhead.\nBesides, practical low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) introduce the\nquantization constraint, leading to the intractable gradient backpropagation\nwhen training the neural network.

In the field of modern healthcare, predicting whether patients would\nexperience any risks based on their EHRs has emerged as a promising research\narea, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role. To make AI models\npractically applicable, it is required that the prediction results should be\nboth accurate and interpretable. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a\nlabel-dependent and event-guided risk prediction model (LERP) to predict the\npresence of multiple disease risks by mainly extracting information from\nunstructured medical notes. Our model is featured in the following aspects.\nFirst, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to\nwords from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk\nlabels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also\nindicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from\nevents and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical\nnotes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are\nintegrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is\nenabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate\nthe applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset,\nwhich contains real-world EHRs collected from hospitals. Our method is\nevaluated in both quantitative and qualitative ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 07:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

By means of the newly developed natural\norbitals renormalization group (NORG) method, we investigated the magnetic\ncorrelation between two Kondo impurities interacting with the helical edge\nstates, based on the Kane-Mele model defined in a finite zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon with spin-orbital coupling (SOC). We find that the SOC effect breaks\nthe symmetry in spatial distribution of the magnetic correlation, leading to\nanisotropy in the RKKY interaction. Specifically, the total correlation is\nalways ferromagnetic (FM) when the two impurities are located at the same\nsublattice, while it is always antiferromagnetic (AFM) when at the different\nsublattices. Meanwhile, the behavior of the in-plane correlation is consistent\nwith that of the total correlation. However, the out-of-plane correlation can\nbe tuned from FM to AFM by manipulating either the Kondo coupling or the\ninterimpurity distance. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation is tunable by the\nSOC, especially that the out-of-plane correlation can be adjusted from FM to\nAFM by increasing the strength of SOC. Dynamic properties of the system,\nrepresented by the spin-staggered excitation spectrum and the spin-staggered\nsusceptibility at the two impurity sites, are finally explored. It is shown\nthat the spin-staggered susceptibility is larger when the two impurities are\nlocated at the different sublattices than at the same sublattice, which is\nconsistent with the behavior of the out-of-plane correlation. On the other\nhand, our study further demonstrates that the NORG is an effective numerical\nmethod for studying the quantum impurity systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 07:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

To connect these\nobservations and infer the properties of dense matter and neutron stars\nsimultaneously, models for the equation of state are introduced. Parametric\nmodels rely on carefully engineered functional forms that reproduce a large\narray of realistic equations of state.

As opposed to the basic KP, GMDKP allows multiple choices per\nitem type under multiple weight constraints. Although several efficient\nalgorithms are known and the properties of their solutions have been examined\nto a significant extent for basic KPs, there is a paucity of known algorithms\nand studies on the solution properties of GMDKP. To gain insight into the\nproblem, we assess the typical achievable limit of the total profit for a\nrandom ensemble of GMDKP using the replica method.

AR 11283 had been present on the solar\nsurface for several days when a bipole emerged on 2011 September 4. Its\npositive polarity collided with the pre-existing negative polarity belonging to\na different bipole, producing recurrent solar activities along the polarity\ninversion line (PIL) between the colliding polarities, namely the so-called\ncollisional PIL (cPIL). Our results show that a large amount of energy and\nhelicity were built up in the form of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), with\nrecurrent release and accumulation processes. These MFRs were built up along\nthe cPIL. A flux deficit method is adopted and shows that magnetic cancellation\nhappens along the cPIL due to the collisional shearing scenario proposed by\nChintzoglou et al.

The fast\nexpansion of the twist kernels of the MFRs and the continuous eruptive\nactivities are both driven by the collisional shearing process.

The estimates are transmitted from sensors to the associated\nnodes, in the presence of one-step time delay and subject to packet loss.

From the perspective of\nutility, if a system's utility is damaged by some bad data, the system needs to\nforget these data to regain utility.

However, in\nthe MOT scenarios, each historical tracklet is composed of an object sequence,\nwhile each candidate detection is just a flat image, which lacks temporal\nfeatures of the object sequence. The feature difference between current\ncandidate detections and historical tracklets makes the object association much\nharder. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mutual Representation Learning\n(STURE) approach which learns spatial-temporal representations between current\ncandidate detections and historical sequences in a mutual representation space.\nFor historical trackelets, the detection learning network is forced to match\nthe representations of sequence learning network in a mutual representation\nspace.

As a result, spatial-temporal feature is learned mutually\nto reinforce the current detection features, and the feature difference can be\nrelieved.

It offers a larger capacity and higher\nbandwidth compared to SRAM but is slower than the latter. With each passing\ngeneration, DRAMs are becoming denser. One of its side-effects is the deviation\nof nominal parameters: process, voltage, and temperature. DRAMs are often\nconsidered as the bottleneck of the system as it trades off performance with\ncapacity. With such inherent limitations, further deviation from nominal\nspecifications is undesired. In this paper, we investigate the impact of\nvariations in conventional DRAM devices on the aspects of performance,\nreliability, and energy requirements. Based on this study, we model a\nvariation-aware framework, called VAR-DRAM, targeted for modern-day DRAM\ndevices. It provides enhanced power management by taking variations into\naccount. VAR-DRAM ensures faster execution of programs as it internally remaps\ndata from variation affected cells to normal cells and also ensures data\npreservation. On extensive experimentation, we find that VAR-DRAM achieves peak\nenergy savings of up to 48.8% with an average of 29.54% on DDR4 memories while\nimproving the access latency of the DRAM compared to a variation affected\ndevice by 7.4%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 10:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We demonstrate that our approach learns\nto disentangle motion and appearance codes even without the explicit structural\ncomposition in the generator. Several experiments with qualitative and\nquantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 11:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

However, the robustness,\nincluding robustness to trimaps and generalization to images from different\ndomains, is still under-explored. Although some works propose to either refine\nthe trimaps or adapt the algorithms to real-world images via extra data\naugmentation, none of them has taken both into consideration, not to mention\nthe significant performance deterioration on benchmarks while using those data\naugmentation. To fill this gap, we propose an image matting method which\nachieves higher robustness (RMat) via multilevel context assembling and strong\ndata augmentation targeting matting. Specifically, we first build a strong\nmatting framework by modeling ample global information with transformer blocks\nin the encoder, and focusing on details in combination with convolution layers\nas well as a low-level feature assembling attention block in the decoder. Then,\nbased on this strong baseline, we analyze current data augmentation and explore\nsimple but effective strong data augmentation to boost the baseline model and\ncontribute a more generalizable matting method. Compared with previous methods,\nthe proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nComposition-1k benchmark (11% improvement on SAD and 27% improvement on Grad)\nwith smaller model size, but also shows more robust generalization results on\nother benchmarks, on real-world images, and also on varying coarse-to-fine\ntrimaps with our extensive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 11:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

To optimize\nparticles for a specific application, it is crucial to interrelate their\nperformance with their structural and magnetic properties. This review presents\nthe advantages of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering techniques for\nachieving a detailed multiscale characterization of magnetic nanoparticles and\ntheir ensembles in a mesoscopic size range from 1 to a few hundred nanometers\nwith nanometer resolution. Both X-rays and neutrons allow the ensemble-averaged\ndetermination of structural properties, such as particle morphology or particle\narrangement in multilayers and 3D assemblies. Additionally, the magnetic\nscattering contributions enable retrieving the internal magnetization profile\nof the nanoparticles as well as the inter-particle moment correlations caused\nby interactions within dense assemblies. Most measurements are used to\ndetermine the time-averaged ensemble properties, in addition advanced\nsmall-angle scattering techniques exist that allow accessing particle and spin\ndynamics on various timescales. In this review, we focus on conventional\nsmall-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS), X-ray and neutron\nreflectometry, gracing-incidence SAXS and SANS, X-ray resonant magnetic\nscattering, and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy techniques. For each technique,\nwe provide a general overview, present the latest scientific results, and\ndiscuss its strengths as well as sample requirements. Finally, we give our\nperspectives on how future small-angle scattering experiments, especially in\ncombination with micromagnetic simulations, could help to optimize the\nperformance of magnetic nanoparticles for specific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Among the many techniques that have been\nproposed in the last years, learning-based methods are receiving large\nattention due to their high performance and potential for improvement. Such\nalgorithms depend on large and diverse training sets to achieve good\ncompression performance. ShapeNet is a large-scale dataset composed of CAD\nmodels with texture and constitute and effective option for training such\ncompression methods. This dataset is entirely composed of meshes, which must go\nthrough a sampling process in order to obtain point clouds with geometry and\ntexture information. Although many existing software libraries are able to\nsample geometry from meshes through simple functions, obtaining an output point\ncloud with geometry and color of the external faces of the mesh models is not a\nstraightforward process for the ShapeNet dataset. The main difficulty\nassociated with this dataset is that its models are often defined with\nduplicated faces sharing the same vertices, but with different color values.\nThis document describes a script for sampling the meshes from ShapeNet that\ncircumvent this issue by excluding the internal faces of the mesh models prior\nto the sampling.

Moreover, in standard\nknowledge distillation, the teacher is trained without awareness of the\nstudent's characteristics and capacity. In this paper, we explore two\nmechanisms for enhancing representation distillation using classifier sharing\nbetween the teacher and student.

In this paper we introduce the\nnovel task of coarse-to-fine learning of semantic segmentation architectures in\npresence of domain shift. We consider subsequent learning stages progressively\nrefining the task at the semantic level; i.e., the finer set of semantic labels\nat each learning step is hierarchically derived from the coarser set of the\nprevious step. We propose a new approach (CCDA) to tackle this scenario. First,\nwe employ the maximum squares loss to align source and target domains and, at\nthe same time, to balance the gradients between well-classified and harder\nsamples. Second, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine knowledge distillation\nconstraint to transfer network capabilities acquired on a coarser set of labels\nto a set of finer labels. Finally, we design a coarse-to-fine weight\ninitialization rule to spread the importance from each coarse class to the\nrespective finer classes. To evaluate our approach, we design two benchmarks\nwhere source knowledge is extracted from the GTA5 dataset and it is transferred\nto either the Cityscapes or the IDD datasets, and we show how it outperforms\nthe main competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

In a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of\nexperts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while\n90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. They thus\nconsiderably outperform the broadly applied MAPO (Maximum Amplitude of Pressure\nOscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from\nprevious works. Our analysis indicates that the neural network learned\nphysically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance\nfrequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach.\nDeeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization\nability to unseen operating points. In addition, the model proved to classify\nknocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting\nto their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking\ncycles. The algorithm takes below 1 ms (on CPU) to classify individual cycles,\neffectively making it suitable for real-time engine control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

Following the structure of MMDP, our method, View-Consistent\nDynamics (VCD), learns state representations by training a view-consistent\ndynamics model in the latent space, where views are generated by applying data\naugmentation to states. Empirical evaluation on DeepMind Control Suite and\nAtari-100k demonstrates VCD to be the SoTA data-efficient algorithm on visual\ncontrol tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

We propose\na new variant of DEIM, which we call L-DEIM, a combination of the strength of\ndeterministic leverage scores and DEIM. This method allows for the selection of\na number of indices greater than the number of available singular vectors.\nSince DEIM requires singular vectors as input matrices, L-DEIM is particularly\nattractive for example in big data problems when computing a rank-$k$-SVD\napproximation is expensive even for moderately small $k$ since it uses a\nlower-rank SVD approximation instead of the full rank-$k$ SVD.

We incorporate the distinguishable nature of agents regarding both,\ntheir residence, and their usual destination. The proposed model allows both a\nfast computation of the spatio-temporal pattern of the epidemic trajectory and.\nthe analytical calculation of the epidemic threshold.

The numerical homogenization\nmethod has been well studied for analyzing mechanical behaviors of\nmicrostructures; however, it is too time-consuming to be applied to online\ncomputing or applications requiring high-frequency calling, e.g., topology\noptimization. Data-driven homogenization methods emerge as a more efficient\nchoice but limit the microstructures into a cubic shape, which are infeasible\nto the periodic microstructures with a more general shape, e.g.,\nparallelepiped. This paper introduces a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for fast homogenization of parallel-shaped microstructures, named\nPH-Net. Superior to existing data-driven methods, PH-Net predicts the local\ndisplacements of microstructures under specified macroscope strains instead of\ndirect homogeneous material, motivating us to present a label-free loss\nfunction based on minimal potential energy. For dataset construction, we\nintroduce a shape-material transformation and voxel-material tensor to encode\nmicrostructure type,base material and boundary shape together as the input of\nPH-Net, such that it is CNN-friendly and enhances PH-Net on generalization in\nterms of microstructure type, base material, and boundary shape. PH-Net\npredicts homogenized properties with hundreds of acceleration compared to the\nnumerical homogenization method and even supports online computing. Moreover,\nit does not require a labeled dataset and thus is much faster than current deep\nlearning methods in training processing. Benefiting from predicting local\ndisplacement, PH-Net provides both homogeneous material properties and\nmicroscopic mechanical properties, e.g., strain and stress distribution, yield\nstrength, etc. We design a group of physical experiments and verify the\nprediction accuracy of PH-Net.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 03:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

The method uses a\ncenter-symmetric copper foil electrode or the ITO (Indium Tin Oxide)\ntransparent electrode to apply voltage, which can arbitrarily adjust the\ndirection of the average electric field in the crystal, so as to improve the\nhalf-wave voltage of the bismuth germanate (Bi4Ge3O12, or BGO) crystal directly\nwithout additional SF6 gas or quartz glass. The internal electric field of the\nBGO crystal is simulated by the finite element method, and the half-wave\nvoltage is calculated by the coupling wave theory of electro-optic effect. The\nresults show that the maximum regulated half-wave voltage, considering the\n1{\\deg} angle, can reach 2.67e3 kV.

Financial markets by their nature are complex, non-linear\nand chaotic, which implies that accurately predicting the prices of assets that\nare part of it becomes very complicated. In this paper we propose a stock\ntrading system having as main core the feed-forward deep neural networks (DNN)\nto predict the price for the next 30 days of open market, of the shares issued\nby Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) in the stock market of the New York Stock\nExchange (NYSE).\n  The system we have elaborated calculates the most effective technical\nindicator, applying it to the predictions computed by the DNNs, for generating\ntrades. The results showed an increase in values such as Expectancy Ratio of\n2.112% of profitable trades with Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar Ratios of 2.194,\n3.340, and 12.403 respectively. As a verification, we adopted a backtracking\nsimulation module in our system, which maps trades to actual test data\nconsisting of the last 30 days of open market on the ANF asset. Overall, the\nresults were promising bringing a total profit factor of 3.2% in just one month\nfrom a very modest budget of $100. This was possible because the system reduced\nthe number of trades by choosing the most effective and efficient trades,\nsaving on commissions and slippage costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 16:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

Generating electric potential by moving a droplet of ionic\nsolution over two-dimensional (2D) materials is a novel method for rain energy\nharvesting. This work demonstrated a liquid-solid contact electrification-based\n3D printed nanogenerator where raindrop passes through the positively charged\nultrathin Gadolinium Telluride (Gd2Te3) sheets. Experimental results showed\nthat voltage as high as ~0.6 V could be generated by moving a droplet of ionic\nsolution on the decorated 3D printed nanogenerator.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are\ndone, revealing that the high electrical conductivity of (112) surface of\nGd2Te3 is due to the p-type charge carriers. Additionally, we illustrate the\nenhancement of the output performance (~0.8V) by using a graphite rod and\narbitrarily manipulating the surface charge.
