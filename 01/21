An example is the fractional\nquantum Hall effect, where interaction between electrons gives rise to\nfractionally quantized Hall conductance. In photonic systems, the nonlinear\nresponse of an ambient medium acts to mediate interaction between photons; in\nthe mean-field limit these dynamics are described by the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (also called Gross-Pitaevskii) equation. Recently, it was shown\nthat at weak nonlinearity, soliton motion in nonlinear Thouless pumps (a\ndimensionally reduced implementation of a Chern insulator) could be quantized\nto the Chern number of the band from which the soliton bifurcates. Here, we\nshow theoretically and experimentally using arrays of coupled optical\nwaveguides that sufficiently strong nonlinearity acts to fractionally quantize\nthe motion of solitons. Specifically, we find that the soliton returns to\nitself after multiple cycles of the Thouless pump - but displaced by an integer\nnumber of unit cells - leading to a rich fractional plateaux structure\ndescribing soliton motion.

We argue that explicitly highlighting this association has\nimportant implications on our understanding of the fundamental limits of OPE.\nFirst, this implies that current formulation of OPE corresponds to a narrow set\nof tasks, i.e. a specific causal estimand which is focused on prospective\nevaluation of policies over populations or sub-populations. Second, we\ndemonstrate how this association motivates natural desiderata to consider a\ngeneral set of causal estimands, particularly extending the role of OPE for\ncounterfactual off-policy evaluation at the level of individuals of the\npopulation. A precise description of the causal estimand highlights which OPE\nestimands are identifiable from observational data under the stated generative\nassumptions. For those OPE estimands that are not identifiable, the causal\nperspective further highlights where more experimental data is necessary, and\nhighlights situations where human expertise can aid identification and\nestimation. Furthermore, many formalisms of OPE overlook the role of\nuncertainty entirely in the estimation process.We demonstrate how specifically\ncharacterising the causal estimand highlights the different sources of\nuncertainty and when human expertise can naturally manage this uncertainty. We\ndiscuss each of these aspects as actionable desiderata for future OPE research\nat scale and in-line with practical utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

It reveals a possibility for the axion\ncavity experiment to handle the signal sensitivity at the quantum level, e.g.\ncross-power and second order correlation measurements. The correlation of\nphoton field quadratures in the amplification chain, within current technology,\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio up to two orders of magnitude or one order\nof magnitude compared with single-path amplification scheme based on high\nelectronic mobility transistor amplifier or Josephson Parametric Amplifiers\n(JPAs), respectively. Especially, it is useful to combine the dual-path\ninterferometry scheme with other techniques, e.g. JPAs, to overcome the\ninevitable microwave signals insertion loss (normally it is $\\sim-3\\,$dB) in\nthe channels between the cavity and the quantum-limited amplifiers. This\nenhancement would greatly reduce the signal scanning time and improve the\nsensitivity of the axion-photon coupling. In addition, the second order\ncorrelation function measurement in the dual-path scheme can provide an\nadditional verification that if the candidate signals are axion converted or\nother noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 16:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 13:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Such wave packets exhibit unique\ncharacteristics, such as controllable group velocities in free space and exotic\nrefractive phenomena. At the root of these behaviors is a fundamental feature\nunderpinning ST wave packets: their spectra are not separable with respect to\nthe spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. Indeed, the spatio-temporal\nstructure is endowed with non-differentiable angular dispersion, in which each\nspatial frequency is associated with a single prescribed wavelength.\nFurthermore, deviation from this particular spatio-temporal structure yields\nnovel behaviors that depart from propagation invariance in a precise manner,\nsuch as acceleration with an arbitrary axial distribution of the group\nvelocity, tunable dispersion profiles, and Talbot effects in space-time.\nAlthough the basic concept of ST wave packets has been known since the 1980's,\nonly very recently has rapid experimental development emerged. These advances\nare made possible by innovations in spatio-temporal Fourier synthesis, thereby\nopening a new frontier for structured light at the intersection of beam optics\nand ultrafast optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

The\nanalysis involves a Markov process on a state space with dimension of order\n$N^2$. It is quite remarkable that the state process describing the evolution\nof the stations, whose dimension is of order $N$, converges in distribution,\nalthough not Markov, to an non-homogeneous Markov process. We prove this\nmean-field convergence.

Since the inseparable\nsamples are often mixed with hard samples, current informative sample mining\nstrategies used to deal with inseparable problem may bring up some\nside-effects, such as instability of objective function, etc. To alleviate this\nproblem, we propose a novel distance metric learning algorithm, named adaptive\nneighborhood metric learning (ANML). In ANML, we design two thresholds to\nadaptively identify the inseparable similar and dissimilar samples in the\ntraining procedure, thus inseparable sample removing and metric parameter\nlearning are implemented in the same procedure. Due to the non-continuity of\nthe proposed ANML, we develop an ingenious function, named \\emph{log-exp mean\nfunction} to construct a continuous formulation to surrogate it, which can be\nefficiently solved by the gradient descent method. Similar to Triplet loss,\nANML can be used to learn both the linear and deep embeddings. By analyzing the\nproposed method, we find it has some interesting properties. For example, when\nANML is used to learn the linear embedding, current famous metric learning\nalgorithms such as the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) and neighbourhood\ncomponents analysis (NCA) are the special cases of the proposed ANML by setting\nthe parameters different values. When it is used to learn deep features, the\nstate-of-the-art deep metric learning algorithms such as Triplet loss, Lifted\nstructure loss, and Multi-similarity loss become the special cases of ANML.\nFurthermore, the \\emph{log-exp mean function} proposed in our method gives a\nnew perspective to review the deep metric learning methods such as Prox-NCA and\nN-pairs loss. At last, promising experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Especially with the increasing\ndigitization of education and interest in large-scale standardized testing, the\npopularity of automatic grading has risen to the point where commercial\nsolutions are widely available and used. However, for short answer formats,\nautomatic grading is challenging due to natural language ambiguity and\nversatility. While automatic short answer grading models are beginning to\ncompare to human performance on some datasets, their robustness, especially to\nadversarially manipulated data, is questionable. Exploitable vulnerabilities in\ngrading models can have far-reaching consequences ranging from cheating\nstudents receiving undeserved credit to undermining automatic grading\naltogether - even when most predictions are valid.

The need for such stored representations arises from\nthe fact that immediate sensory signals coming from the body do not specify\nmetric details about body size and shape. Several aspects of somatoperception,\ntherefore, require that immediate sensory signals be combined with stored body\nrepresentations.

The hydrodynamic behavior of the electronic\nfluid reveals itself as a decrease of the electrical resistance with increasing\ntemperature (the Gurzhi effect) in narrow conducting channels, polynomial\nscaling of the resistance as a function of the channel width, substantial\nviolation of the Wiedemann-Franz law supported by the emergence of the\nPoiseuille flow. Similarly to whirlpools in flowing water, the viscous\nelectronic flow generates vortices, resulting in abnormal sign-changing\nelectrical response driven by the backflow of electrical current.\nExperimentally, the presence of the hydrodynamic vortices was observed in\nlow-temperature graphene as a negative voltage drop near the current-injecting\ncontacts. However, the question of whether the long-ranged sign-changing\nelectrical response can be produced by a mechanism other than hydrodynamics has\nnot been addressed so far. Here we use polarization-sensitive laser microscopy\nto demonstrate the emergence of visually similar abnormal sign-alternating\npatterns in charge density in multilayer tungsten ditelluride at room\ntemperature where this material does not exhibit true electronic hydrodynamics.\nWe argue that this pseudo-hydrodynamic behavior appears due to a subtle\ninterplay between the diffusive transport of electrons and holes. In\nparticular, the sign-alternating charge accumulation in WTe2 is supported by\nthe unexpected backflow of compressible neutral electron-hole current, which\ncreates charge-neutral whirlpools in the bulk of this nearly compensated\nsemimetal. We demonstrate that the exceptionally large spatial size of the\ncharge domains is sustained by the long recombination time of electron-hole\npairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

However, vaccine acceptance varies among\ncommunities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors\naffecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to\nidentify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes\nand behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world.\nMethods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab\npeople participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify\nwhat demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and\nbehavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants,\n56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were\nhesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were\nsignificant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas\nthe analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public\nattitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media\nusers were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being\nexaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media\nusers.

Researchers examine how varying a factor of\ninterest, while controlling for other relevant factors, influences\ndecision-making. Currently, there exist two methodological approaches to\nanalyzing data from a conjoint experiment. The first focuses on estimating the\naverage marginal effects of each factor while averaging over the other factors.\nAlthough this allows for straightforward design-based estimation, the results\ncritically depend on the distribution of other factors and how interaction\neffects are aggregated. An alternative model-based approach can compute various\nquantities of interest, but requires researchers to correctly specify the\nmodel, a challenging task for conjoint analysis with many factors and possible\ninteractions. In addition, a commonly used logistic regression has poor\nstatistical properties even with a moderate number of factors when\nincorporating interactions.

Even though grazing planetary orbits are rare (due to geometric\nselection effects), for many low to moderate signal-to-noise cases, a\nsignificant fraction of the posterior distribution is nonetheless consistent\nwith a grazing geometry. A failure to accurately model grazing transits can\ntherefore lead to biased inferences even for cases where the planet is not\nactually on a grazing trajectory. With recent advances in stellar\ncharacterization, the limiting factor for many scientific applications is now\nthe quality of available transit fits themselves, and so the time is ripe to\nrevisit the transit fitting problem. In this paper, we model exoplanet transits\nusing a novel application of umbrella sampling and a geometry-dependent\nparameter basis that minimizes covariances between transit parameters. Our\ntechnique splits the transit fitting problem into independent Monte Carlo\nsampling runs for the grazing, non-grazing, and transition regions of the\nparameter space, which we then recombine into a single joint posterior\nprobability distribution using a robust weighting scheme. Our method can be\ntrivially parallelized and so requires no increase in the wall clock time\nneeded for computations. Most importantly, our method produces accurate\nestimates of exoplanet properties for both grazing and non-grazing orbits,\nyielding more robust results than standard methods for many common star-planet\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Implementation of fast parallel MD\nsimulation demands both high bandwidth and low latency for inter-node\ncommunication, but in current semiconductor technology, neither of these\nproperties is scaling as quickly as intra-node computational capacity. This\ndisparity in scaling necessitates architectural innovations to maximize the\nutilization of computational units.

Tightly integrating this network with specialized computation pipelines\nenables Anton 3 to perform simulations orders of magnitude faster than any\ngeneral-purpose supercomputer, and to outperform its predecessor, Anton 2 (the\nstate of the art prior to Anton 3), by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we\npresent the three key features of the network that contribute to the high\nperformance of Anton 3. First, through architectural optimizations, the network\nachieves very low end-to-end inter-node communication latency for fine-grained\nmessages, allowing for better overlap of computation and communication. Second,\nnovel application-specific compression techniques reduce the size of most\nmessages sent between nodes, thereby increasing effective inter-node bandwidth.\nLastly, a new hardware synchronization primitive, called a network fence,\nsupports fast fine-grained synchronization tailored to the data flow within a\nparallel MD application.

O$_2$ production from this metabolic process was so vigorous that it\nsaturated its photochemical sinks, permitting it to reach \"runaway\" conditions\nand rapidly accumulate in the atmosphere despite its reactivity.

This runaway occurs because the ability of\nan atmosphere to photochemically cleanse itself of trace gases is generally\nfinite.

Planets orbiting smaller, cooler stars, such as the M dwarfs that\nare the prime targets for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are especially\nfavorable for runaway due to their lower UV emission compared to higher-mass\nstars.

We characterize the equations necessary\nto obtain the steady-state distribution for the average error and then analyze\nthe system behavior under both high and low gossip rates. In the high gossip\nrate, in which each node can access other nodes' information more frequently,\nwe show that the nodes update their information based on the majority of the\ninformation in the network. In the low gossip rate, we introduce and analyze\nthe gossip gain, which is the reduction at the average error due to gossiping.\nIn particular, we develop an adaptive policy that the source can use to\ndetermine its current transmission capacity $m$ based on its past transmission\nrates and the accuracy of the information at the nodes. In numerical results,\nwe show that when the source's transmission capacity $m$ is limited, gossiping\ncan be harmful as it causes incorrect information to disseminate. We then find\nthe optimal gossip rates to minimize the average error for a fixed $m$.\nFinally, we illustrate the outperformance of our adaptive policy compared to\nthe constant $m$-selection policy even for the high gossip rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

This paper deals with the estimation of RC-densities conditional on\na (large-dimensional) set of control variables using machine learning\ntechniques. The conditional RC-density allows to disentangle observable from\nunobservable heterogeneity in partial effects of continuous treatments adding\nto a growing literature on heterogeneous effect estimation using machine\nlearning. %It is also informative of the conditional potential outcome\ndistribution. This paper proposes a two-stage sieve estimation procedure. First\na closed-form sieve approximation of the conditional RC density is derived\nwhere each sieve coefficient can be expressed as conditional expectation\nfunction varying with controls. Second, sieve coefficients are estimated with\ngeneric machine learning procedures and under appropriate sample splitting\nrules. The $L_2$-convergence rate of the conditional RC-density estimator is\nderived. The rate is slower by a factor then typical rates of mean regression\nmachine learning estimators which is due to the ill-posedness of the RC density\nestimation problem. The performance and applicability of the estimator is\nillustrated using random forest algorithms over a range of Monte Carlo\nsimulations and with real data from the SOEP-IS. Here behavioral heterogeneity\nin an economic experiment on portfolio choice is studied. The method reveals\ntwo types of behavior in the population, one type complying with economic\ntheory and one not. The assignment to types appears largely based on\nunobservables not available in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Our predicted planets are currently\nundetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should\nreveal many such perturbers.

Alternatively, young\nplanets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the\nresponsible planets are more massive (and located further inwards) than\ndebris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution\nmodelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having\nunreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the\ndominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs.

Most in-kernel pointers remain static, exacerbating the problem\nwhen pointers are leaked.\n  Adelie, our kernel defense mechanism, overcomes KASLR limitations, increases\nKASLR entropy, and makes successful ROP attacks on the Linux kernel much harder\nto achieve. First, Adelie enables the position-independent code (PIC) model so\nthat the kernel and its modules can be placed anywhere in the 64-bit virtual\naddress space, at any distance apart from each other.

The accumulation of TDE observations\nover the last years has revealed that post-starburst galaxies are significantly\noverrepresented in the sample of TDE hosts. Here we address the post-starburst\npreference by investigating the decline of TDE rates in a Milky-Way like\nnuclear stellar cluster featuring either a monochromatic (1 M$\\odot$) or a\ncomplete, evolved stellar mass function. In the former case, the decline of TDE\nrates with time is very mild, and generally up to a factor of a few in 10 Gyr.\nConversely, if a complete mass function is considered, a strong TDE burst over\nthe first 0.1-1 Gyr is followed by a considerable rate drop, by at least an\norder of magnitude over 10 Gyr. The decline starts after a mass segregation\ntime-scale, and it is more pronounced assuming a more top-heavy initial mass\nfunction and/or an initially denser nucleus. Our results thus suggest that the\npost-starburst preference can be accounted for in realistic systems featuring a\ncomplete stellar mass function, even in moderately dense galactic nuclei.\nOverall, our findings support the idea that starbursting galactic nuclei are\ncharacterized by a top-heavy initial mass function; we speculate that\naccounting for this can reconcile the discrepancy between observed and\ntheoretically predicted TDE rates even in quiescent galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 16:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

The system can be interpreted as a natural quantum\nmetamaterial with a periodicity that can be engineered via the twist angle.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are particularly\nsuitable for this type of problems given their learning capabilities. A special\ncase of a prescriptive operation is the power allocation task, which can be\nconsidered as a sequential allocation problem, where the action space is\nbounded by a simplex constraint. A general continuous action-space solution of\nsuch sequential allocation problems has still remained an open research\nquestion for RL algorithms. In continuous action-space, the standard Gaussian\npolicy applied in reinforcement learning does not support simplex constraints,\nwhile the Gaussian-softmax policy introduces a bias during training. In this\nwork, we propose the Dirichlet policy for continuous allocation tasks and\nanalyze the bias and variance of its policy gradients. We demonstrate that the\nDirichlet policy is bias-free and provides significantly faster convergence,\nbetter performance and better hyperparameters robustness over the\nGaussian-softmax policy. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of the\nproposed algorithm on a prescriptive operation case, where we propose the\nDirichlet power allocation policy and evaluate the performance on a case study\nof a set of multiple lithium-ion (Li-I) battery systems.

Their characterisation is important\nboth for the interpretation of observations and for the development of\ntheoretical models. The methods used so far for estimating the CR ionisation\nrate ($\\zeta$) in molecular clouds have several limitations due to\nuncertainties in the adopted chemical networks. We refine and extend the method\nproposed by Bialy (2020) to estimate $\\zeta$ by observing rovibrational\ntransitions of H$_{2}$ at near-infrared wavelengths, which are mainly excited\nby secondary CR electrons. Combining models of interstellar CR propagation and\nattenuation with the calculation of the expected secondary electron spectrum\nand updated H$_{2}$ excitation cross sections by electron collisions, we derive\nthe intensity of the four H$_{2}$ rovibrational transitions observable in\ndense, cold gas: (1-0)O(2), (1-0)Q(2), (1-0)S(0), and (1-0)O(4).

To understand and control particle acceleration in plasmas using\nultra-small spatial configurations, researchers have been developing\ncomputational models to simulate the acceleration environment. Within these\nmodels, computational scientists have introduced virtual diagnostics to serve\nas the digital parallel to experimental detectors. Using WarpX\\cite{Vay:2021},\nan advanced Particle-in-Cell code that simulates laser-driven particle\nacceleration, we have developed a virtual diagnostic to measure electromagnetic\nradiation. Such radiation can for instance be produced from scattered and\ntransmitted laser beams. This \\textit{FieldProbe} diagnostic measures\nindividual field components for electric and magnetic fields at a point or at\nall points along a specified geometry (line or plane). This diagnostic is\nGPU-accelerated and parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and\ncan thus run on High Performance Computing Centers such as NERSC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 22:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 19:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

In this paper, we first develop a framework of deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-driven deep-unfolding with adaptive depth\nfor different inputs, where the trainable parameters of deep-unfolding NN are\nlearned by DDPG, rather than updated by the stochastic gradient descent\nalgorithm directly.

This is done via a central server that aggregates learning in the form of\nweight updates. However, this comes at the cost of repeated expensive\ncommunication between the clients and the server, and concerns about\ncompromised user privacy. The inversion of gradients into the data that\ngenerated them is termed data leakage. Encryption techniques can be used to\ncounter this leakage, but at added expense. To address these challenges of\ncommunication efficiency and privacy, we propose TOFU, a novel algorithm which\ngenerates proxy data that encodes the weight updates for each client in its\ngradients. Instead of weight updates, this proxy data is now shared. Since\ninput data is far lower in dimensional complexity than weights, this encoding\nallows us to send much lesser data per communication round. Additionally, the\nproxy data resembles noise, and even perfect reconstruction from data leakage\nattacks would invert the decoded gradients into unrecognizable noise, enhancing\nprivacy. We show that TOFU enables learning with less than 1% and 7% accuracy\ndrops on MNIST and on CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. This drop can be\nrecovered via a few rounds of expensive encrypted gradient exchange. This\nenables us to learn to near-full accuracy in a federated setup, while being 4x\nand 6.6x more communication efficient than the standard Federated Averaging\nalgorithm on MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The transport is determined by the\nHamiltonian structure of the velocity field induced by the heton's component\nvortices. The dynamics displays a sequence of bifurcations as one moves through\nthe heton-induced velocity field in height. These bifurcations create and\ndestroy unstable fixed points whose associated invariant manifolds bound the\ntrapped volume. Heton configurations fall into three categories.

The local diffusion coefficient is manifestly\npositive-semidefinite. Waves are allowed to be off-shell (i.e. not constrained\nby a dispersion relation), and a collision integral of the Balescu--Lenard type\nemerges in a form that is not restricted to any particular Hamiltonian. This\noperator conserves particles, momentum, and energy, and it also satisfies the\nH-theorem, as usual. As a spin-off, a general expression for the spectrum of\nmicroscopic fluctuations is derived. For on-shell waves, which satisfy a\nquasilinear wave-kinetic equation, the theory conserves the momentum and energy\nof the wave--plasma system. The action of nonresonant waves is also conserved,\nunlike in the standard version of QLT. Dewar's oscillation-center QLT of\nelectrostatic turbulence (1973, Phys.

We provide a simple model that describes well such\na connection between halos and galaxies. The index 0.55 of the $j_{\\rm\ns}$-$M_{\\rm s}$ relation comes from the product of the indices of the $j_{\\rm\ntot}\\propto M_{\\rm tot}^{0.81}$, $M_{\\rm tot}\\propto M_{\\rm s}^{0.67}$, and\n$j_{\\rm s}\\propto j_{\\rm tot}$ relations, where $j_{\\rm tot}$ and $M_{\\rm tot}$\nare overall sAM and mass of a halo.

Recent\nadvances in silicon-based qubits have enabled the implementations of high\nquality one and two qubit systems. However, the demonstration of quantum error\ncorrection, which requires three or more coupled qubits and often involves a\nthree-qubit gate, remains an open challenge.

Classical basis functions\ninclude the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), Fourier basis functions, and\ntheir combinations. The unsupervised machine learning method, e.g., the K-SVD\nalgorithm, has recently tapped into the basis function design, showing better\nrepresentation performance than the EOFs. However, existing methods do not\nconsider basis function learning approaches that treat 3D SSF data as a\nthird-order tensor, and thus cannot fully utilize the 3D\ninteractions/correlations therein. To circumvent such a drawback, basis\nfunction learning is linked to tensor decomposition in this paper, which is the\nprimary drive for recent multi-dimensional data mining.

Assuming that $G$ is\nconnected and that $f$ is degree-bounded, we prove the following: if $G$ is not\na cycle, then $f^{n+1}$ may be a constant. In that case, $f$ describes a very\nsimple dynamics: a global convergence toward a unique fixed point in $n+1$\niterations. This shows that, in the degree-bounded case, the fact that $f$\ndescribes a complex dynamics {\\em cannot} be deduced from its interaction\ngraph. We then widely generalize the above result, obtaining, as immediate\nconsequences, other limits on what can be deduced from the interaction graph\nonly, as the following weak converses of Thomas' rules: if $G$ is connected and\nhas a positive (negative) cycle, then $f$ may have two (no) fixed points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 08:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

We establish finite-temperature phase\ndiagrams by identifying a series of topological phase transitions via the\nrenormalization group flow equations and Debye-H\\\"uckel approximation.\nAccordingly, a series of Kosterlitz-Thouless topological transitions are found\nto occur successively at different temperatures, which are triggered by\nproliferation of defects, defect bound states, and so on. Such a\n\\emph{hierarchical proliferation} brings rich phase structures. Meanwhile, a\nscreening effect from sufficiently high density of defect bound states leads to\ninstability and collapse of the intermediate temperature phases, which further\nenriches the phase diagrams.

Current research has led to a variety of notions, metrics, and\nunfairness mitigation procedures. The evaluation of each procedure has been\nheterogeneous and limited to a mere comparison with models not accounting for\nfairness. It is hence hard to contextualize the impact of each mitigation\nprocedure w.r.t. the others. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of\nmitigation procedures against consumer unfairness in rating prediction and\ntop-n recommendation tasks. To this end, we collected 15 procedures proposed in\nrecent top-tier conferences and journals. Only 8 of them could be reproduced.\nUnder a common evaluation protocol, based on two public data sets, we then\nstudied the extent to which recommendation utility and consumer fairness are\nimpacted by these procedures, the interplay between two primary fairness\nnotions based on equity and independence, and the demographic groups harmed by\nthe disparate impact.

Enstatite chondrites, one of the most\nimportant repositories of oldhamite, are believed to be the representative of\nthe material which formed Earth. Thus, the formation mechanism and the\nevolution process of oldhamite are of great significance to the deeply\nunderstanding about the solar nebula, meteorites, the origin of Earth, and the\nC-O-S-Ca cycles of Earth. To date, no report about the oldhamite in the mantle\nexists. However, here we show the formation of oldhamite through the reaction\nbetween sulfide-bearing orthopyroxenite and molten CaCO3 at 1.5 GPa/1510 K and\n0.5 GPa/1320 K. Surprisingly the oxygen fugacities in our experiments are\nwithin the range of mantle conditions, which is at least 6 orders of magnitude\nhigher than that of the solar nebula mechanism. Oldhamite is easily oxidized to\nCaSO4. Low oxygen fugacity of magma and extreme low oxygen content of\natmosphere are necessary for existence of oldhamite on the surface of a planet;\notherwise, anhydrite or gypsum will exist in large quantities. The widespread\nexistence of oldhamite on the planet's surface indicates the planet is\ndefinitely not habitable. The formation and oxidation of oldhamite are\naccompanied by the production of CO2 and the consumption of O2, which may have\nimpact on the ecosystem of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 09:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 13:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 14:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 14:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 07:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

A backdoored model behaves normally for inputs containing no\nattacker-secretly-chosen trigger and maliciously for inputs with the trigger.\nTo date, backdoor attacks and countermeasures mainly focus on image\nclassification tasks. And most of them are implemented in the digital world\nwith digital triggers. Besides the classification tasks, object detection\nsystems are also considered as one of the basic foundations of computer vision\ntasks. However, there is no investigation and understanding of the backdoor\nvulnerability of the object detector, even in the digital world with digital\ntriggers. For the first time, this work demonstrates that existing object\ndetectors are inherently susceptible to physical backdoor attacks. We use a\nnatural T-shirt bought from a market as a trigger to enable the cloaking\neffect--the person bounding-box disappears in front of the object detector. We\nshow that such a backdoor can be implanted from two exploitable attack\nscenarios into the object detector, which is outsourced or fine-tuned through a\npretrained model. We have extensively evaluated three popular object detection\nalgorithms: anchor-based Yolo-V3, Yolo-V4, and anchor-free CenterNet. Building\nupon 19 videos shot in real-world scenes, we confirm that the backdoor attack\nis robust against various factors: movement, distance, angle, non-rigid\ndeformation, and lighting. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) in most\nvideos is 100% or close to it, while the clean data accuracy of the backdoored\nmodel is the same as its clean counterpart. The latter implies that it is\ninfeasible to detect the backdoor behavior merely through a validation set. The\naveraged ASR still remains sufficiently high to be 78% in the transfer learning\nattack scenarios evaluated on CenterNet.

We conclude that the MP ubiquity, variety, and dependence on GC mass are\nproperties common to VLM and more-massive stars. We combined UV, optical, and\nNIR observations of NGC 2808 and NGC 6121 (M 4) to identify MPs along with a\nwide range of stellar masses (~ 0.2 - 0.8M ), from the MS turn off to the VLM\nregime, and measured, for the first time, their mass functions (MFs). We find\nthat the fraction of MPs does not depend on the stellar mass and that their MFs\nhave similar slopes. These findings indicate that the properties of MPs do not\ndepend on stellar mass. In a scenario where the second generations formed in\nhigher-density environments than the first generations, the possibility that\nthe MPs formed with the same initial MF would suggest that it does not depend\non the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 10:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

The\nsaliency maps are conventionally generated by fusing the channels of the target\nfeature map using a weighted average scheme. It is a weak model for the\ninter-channel relation, in the sense that it only models the relation among\nchannels in a contrastive way (i.e., channels that play key roles in the\nprediction are given higher weights for them to stand out in the fusion). The\ncollaborative relation, which makes the channels work together to provide cross\nreference, has been ignored. Furthermore, the model has neglected the\nintra-channel relation thoroughly.In this paper, we address this problem by\nintroducing Conceptor learning into CAM generation. Conceptor leaning has been\noriginally proposed to model the patterns of state changes in recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs). By relaxing the dependency of Conceptor learning to RNNs, we\nmake Conceptor-CAM not only generalizable to more DNN architectures but also\nable to learn both the inter- and intra-channel relations for better saliency\nmap generation. Moreover, we have enabled the use of Boolean operations to\ncombine the positive and pseudo-negative evidences, which has made the CAM\ninference more robust and comprehensive. The effectiveness of Conceptor-CAM has\nbeen validated with both formal verifications and experiments on the dataset of\nthe largest scale in literature.

A modest increase of 43% (=0.02/0.014) in metallicity compared\nto solar models means that the models evolve similarly to solar models but with\nslightly larger mass loss.

Unfortunately, the network\npresented with a non-negligible percentage of pulse amplitude overshoots in the\ntest subset, despite the optimal control pulses used in training were fully\nconstrained. Here, we have extended the convolutional neural network with a\ncustom-made clipping layer that completely eliminates the risk of pulse\namplitude overshoots, while preserving the ability to compensate the\ninhomogeneous field conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 12:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The fluctuation theorems for quantum channels are less\nrestrictive. We show that the given entropy production can be equal to the\nresult of a closed system environment. The assumption that the system evolves\nunder a completely positive and trace preserving map is quite general, but it\nis more specific for cases in which the system is initially correlated with the\nenvironment. System-environment correlations arise naturally in multitime\nprocesses, with which we can give clear and physical interpretations regarding\nthe effects of correlations. Multitime processes can provide many-body\nchannels. The Choi state of such a many-body channel is called a process\ntensor. One can derive channels by executing the process tensor on a set of\noperations. We establish a general quantum fluctuation theorem framework for a\nmany-body channel and its derived channels. In this framework, the effects of\ncorrelations are reflected in a Markovian property. For Markovian processes, we\ncan extend the two-point measurement to a three-point measurement and obtain\nthat the fluctuation theorems contain complete information about the\nintermediate state. For non-Markovian processes, the complete measurement of\nthe intermediate state leads to conflicts. Therefore, we use a general\nmeasurement, which only provides partial information, for the intermediate\nstate. The corresponding fluctuation theorems show that memory effects can\nreduce these fluctuations. This is consistent with the fact that system states\ncan be recovered under non-Markovian processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 13:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Halo PNe exhibit declining velocity\ndispersion and rotation profiles, while the velocity dispersion and rotation of\nthe exponential envelope increase notably at large radii. We identify three\nregimes with distinct kinematics that are linked to distinct stellar population\nproperties: (i) the rotating core (within $1~R_\\mathrm{eff}$) formed in situ\nand dominated by metal-rich ([M/H]~0) stars likely formed in situ, (ii) the\nhalo from 1 to $7.5~R_\\mathrm{eff}$ consisting of intermediate-metallicity\nstars ([M/H]>-1), either formed in situ or brought in through major mergers,\nand (iii) the exponential envelope reaching beyond our farthest data point at\n16 $R_\\mathrm{eff}$, predominately composed of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1) stars.

First, we present a generalization of\nexisting random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as\nRademacher and Gaussian sketches and TensorSRHT, using complex-valued random\nfeatures.

They rely\non topology estimations, forecasting and fault detection methods to complete\ntheir tasks. This disjointed design has led to most systems being capable of\nfulfilling only a single role or being resistant to change and extensions in\nfunctionality. By allocating roles, functional responsibilities and technical\nrequirements to bounded systems a more unified view of energy systems can be\nachieved. This is made possible by representing an energy system as a\ndistributed peer-to-peer (P2P) environment where each individual demand energy\nresource (DER) on the consumer's side of the meter is responsible for their\nportion of the network and can facilitate trade with numerous entities\nincluding the grid.

Comparison of MPC simulation results\nfor active polymers in dilute solution with results of Brownian dynamics\nsimulations accounting for hydrodynamics via the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor\nconfirm the suitability of the implementation. The polymer conformational and\ndynamical properties are analyzed by the static and dynamic structure factor,\nand the scaling behavior of the latter with respect to the wave-number and time\ndependence are discussed. The dynamic structure factor displays various\nactivity-induced temporal regimes, depending on the considered wave number,\nwhich reflect the persistent diffusive motion of the whole polymer at small\nwave numbers, and the activity-enhanced internal dynamics at large wave\nnumbers. The obtained simulation results are compared with theoretical\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 15:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

An inviscid theoretical vortex model is\nemployed to describe the hydrodynamic interactions between a flexible body, its\nwake, gravity waves and the incident current. The model reveals two distinct\nvibration states of a piezoelectric device that correspond to almost similar\noptimal energy production levels. The first is associated with the cantilever\nfluttering mode of the plate with limited dependency on the plate's flexibility\nacross different Froude numbers and incoming wave frequencies. The other is the\nflow-induced flapping mode in more flexible plates, wherein much higher\ndependency on the plate flexibility is observed. The concurrent existence of\nthese two energetic modes allows adjustment of the plate length to consistently\nachieve the maximum energy production level across different flow conditions.\nThe role of the Froude number of the system's responses is explored and\ncorrelated to the appearance of gravity wave groups on the surface, each\npropagating with a different wavenumber. It is shown that the submergence depth\nof less than half of the body length is required to reach a high energetic\ncondition in subcritical and critical flows, with Froude number less than or\nequal to one. Finally, the role of electrical parameters are quantified and the\noptimal inductive and resistive values are related to proper matching between\ntimescales of flow, mechanical and electrical domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 15:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The\nrisk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits\nof in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such\nas vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of\nnon-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised\nacademic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide\non and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In\nthe context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the\nvirus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these\ndecisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven\nagent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974\nfaculty members in a medium-sized European university.

However, to obtain a dense spatial coverage, a\nlarge number of static monitors are required, thereby making it a costly\noption. Dense spatiotemporal coverage can be achieved using only a fraction of\nstatic sensors by deploying them on the moving vehicles, known as the drive by\nsensing paradigm. The redundancy present in the air quality data can be\nexploited by processing the sparsely sampled data to impute the remaining\nunobserved data points using the matrix completion techniques. However, the\naccuracy of imputation is dependent on the extent to which the moving sensors\ncapture the inherent structure of the air quality matrix. Therefore, the\nchallenge is to pick those set of paths (using vehicles) that perform\nrepresentative sampling in space and time. Most works in the literature for\nvehicle subset selection focus on maximizing the spatiotemporal coverage by\nmaximizing the number of samples for different locations and time stamps which\nis not an effective representative sampling strategy. We present regressive\nfacility location-based drive by sensing, an efficient vehicle selection\nframework that incorporates the smoothness in neighboring locations and\nautoregressive time correlation while selecting the optimal set of vehicles for\neffective spatiotemporal sampling. We show that the proposed drive by sensing\nproblem is submodular, thereby lending itself to a greedy algorithm but with\nperformance guarantees. We evaluate our framework on selecting a subset from\nthe fleet of public transport in Delhi, India. We illustrate that the proposed\nmethod samples the representative spatiotemporal data against the baseline\nmethods, reducing the extrapolation error on the simulated air quality data.\nOur method, therefore, has the potential to provide cost effective dense air\nquality maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

When the optimization\nalgorithm iteratively evaluates different loading cases, the traditional\nnumerical simulation methods used usually lead to a substantial computational\ncost. To effectively reduce the computational effort, data-driven approaches\nare used to train a surrogate model as a mapping between the prescribed\nexternal loads and various geometry. However, the existing model are trained by\ndata-driven methods which requires intensive training samples that from\nnumerical simulations and not really effectively solve the problem. Choosing\nthe steady heat conduction problems as examples, this paper proposes a\nPhysics-driven Convolutional Neural Networks (PD-CNN) method to infer the\nphysical field solutions for random varied loading cases. After that, the\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the sizes and\nthe positions of the hole masks in the prescribed design domain, and the\naverage temperature value of the entire heat conduction field is minimized, and\nthe goal of minimizing heat transfer is achieved. Compared with the existing\ndata-driven approaches, the proposed PD-CNN optimization framework not only\npredict field solutions that are highly consistent with conventional simulation\nresults, but also generate the solution space with without any pre-obtained\ntraining data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 10:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Monte Carlo methods are often used to solve\ntransport problems especially for applications which require high accuracy. In\nthese cases, common non-intrusive solution strategies that involve repeated\nsimulations of the problem at different points in the parameter space quickly\nbecome infeasible due to their long run-times. Intrusive methods however limit\nthe usability in combination with proprietary simulation engines. In our\nprevious paper [51], we demonstrated the application of a new non-intrusive\nuncertainty quantification approach for Monte Carlo simulations in proton dose\ncalculations with normally distributed errors on realistic patient data. In\nthis paper, we introduce a generalized formulation and focus on a more in-depth\ntheoretical analysis of this method concerning bias, error and convergence of\nthe estimates. The multivariate input model of the proposed approach further\nsupports almost arbitrary error correlation models. We demonstrate how this\nframework can be used to model and efficiently quantify complex auto-correlated\nand time-dependent errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 15:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

In this article, we consider a convex region (i.e., a\ngeneralisation of squares and disks) on which wireless nodes are uniformly\ndistributed. We have investigated two types of critical transmission radii,\ndefined in terms of k-connectivity and the minimum vertex degree, respectively,\nand have also established their precise asymptotic distributions. These make\nthe previous results obtained under the circumstance of squares or disks\nspecial cases of this work. More importantly, our results reveal how the region\nshape impacts on the critical transmission ranges: it is the length of the\nboundary of the (fixed-area) region that completely determines the transmission\nranges. Furthermore, by isodiametric inequality, the smallest critical\ntransmission ranges are achieved when regions are disks only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 02:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}
