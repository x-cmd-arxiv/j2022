In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art\nimage classification models trained on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets against\nthe fast gradient sign method attack, a simple yet effective method of\ndeceiving neural networks.

However, existing PIM accelerators suffer\nfrom frequent and energy-intensive analog-to-digital (A/D) conversions,\nseverely limiting their performance. This paper presents a new PIM architecture\nto efficiently accelerate deep learning tasks by minimizing the required A/D\nconversions with analog accumulation and neural approximated peripheral\ncircuits. We first characterize the different dataflows employed by existing\nPIM accelerators, based on which a new dataflow is proposed to remarkably\nreduce the required A/D conversions for VMMs by extending shift and add (S+A)\noperations into the analog domain before the final quantizations.

The regions\n$O_{\\mathsf{one-cut}}$ and $O_{\\mathsf{two-cut}}$ are separated by critical\ncurves, which can be calculated in terms of critical trajectories of an\nauxiliary quadratic differential. In our previous work the one-cut phase region\nwas investigated in detail. In the present paper we investigate the two-cut\nregion. We prove that in the two-cut region the endpoints of the cuts are\nanalytic functions of the real and imaginary parts of the parameter $t$, but\nnot of the parameter $t$ itself. We also obtain the semiclassical asymptotics\nof the orthogonal polynomials associated with the ensemble of random matrices\nand their recurrence coefficients. The proofs are based on the Riemann--Hilbert\napproach to semiclassical asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials and the\ntheory of $S$-curves and quadratic differentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 16:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Unfortunately, the leading rationalization models often rely on\ndata biases, especially shortcut features, to compose rationales and make\npredictions without probing the critical and causal patterns. Moreover, such\ndata biases easily change outside the training distribution. As a result, these\nmodels suffer from a huge drop in interpretability and predictive performance\non out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose a new strategy of\ndiscovering invariant rationale (DIR) to construct intrinsically interpretable\nGNNs. It conducts interventions on the training distribution to create multiple\ninterventional distributions. Then it approaches the causal rationales that are\ninvariant across different distributions while filtering out the spurious\npatterns that are unstable. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets validate the superiority of our DIR in terms of interpretability and\ngeneralization ability on graph classification over the leading baselines.

Recent work is\nconsidering hybrid models and multi-view learning. However, they use only\nsimple features, limiting the accuracy of these approaches in practice. In this\npaper, we propose DeepCatra, a multi-view learning approach for Android malware\ndetection, whose model consists of a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and a graph\nneural network (GNN) as subnets. The two subnets rely on features extracted\nfrom statically computed call traces leading to critical APIs derived from\npublic vulnerabilities. For each Android app, DeepCatra first constructs its\ncall graph and computes call traces reaching critical APIs. Then, temporal\nopcode features used by the BiLSTM subnet are extracted from the call traces,\nwhile flow graph features used by the GNN subnet are constructed from all the\ncall traces and inter-component communications. We evaluate the effectiveness\nof DeepCatra by comparing it with several state-of-the-art detection\napproaches. Experimental results on over 18,000 real-world apps and prevalent\nmalware show that DeepCatra achieves considerable improvement, e.g., 2.7% to\n14.6% on F1-measure, which demonstrates the feasibility of DeepCatra in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 16:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 08:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

Indeed, entropy\ncan be extracted from any $d\\in\\mathsf{Dir}$ by a two-step process, where the\nfirst step is a rig homomorphism out of $\\mathsf{Dir}$, the \\emph{set} of\nDirichlet polynomials, with rig structure given by standard addition and\nmultiplication. In this short note, we show that this rig homomorphism can be\nupgraded to a rig \\emph{functor}, when we replace the set of Dirichlet\npolynomials by the \\emph{category} of ordinary (Cartesian) polynomials.\n  In the Cartesian case, the process has three steps. The first step is a rig\nfunctor $\\mathbf{Poly}^{\\mathbf{Cart}}\\to\\mathbf{Poly}$ sending a polynomial\n$p$ to $\\dot{p}\\mathcal{y}$, where $\\dot{p}$ is the derivative of $p$.

This abstraction is central in the design and implementation\nof fault-tolerant distributed systems, as many fault-tolerant distributed\napplications require communication with provable guarantees on message\ndeliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for\nmessage-passing systems that are prone to process-failures, such as crashes and\nmalicious behavior.\n  At PODC 1983, Bracha and Toueg, in short, BT, solved the BRB problem. BT has\noptimal resilience since it can deal with t < n/3 Byzantine processes, where n\nis the number of processes. The present work aims at the design of an even more\nrobust solution than BT by expanding its fault-model with self-stabilization, a\nvigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine and\ncommunication failures, self-stabilizing systems can recover after the\noccurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These faults represent any violation\nof the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate\n(provided that the algorithm code remains intact).\n  We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-stabilizing\nByzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) solution for repeated BRB in signature-free\nmessage-passing systems (that follows BT's problem specifications). Our\ncontribution includes a self-stabilizing variation on a BT that solves a\nsingle-instance BRB for asynchronous systems. We also consider the problem of\nrecycling instances of single-instance BRB. Our self-stabilizing BFT recycling\nfor time-free systems facilitates the concurrent handling of a predefined\nnumber of BRB invocations and, by this way, can serve as the basis for\nself-stabilizing BFT consensus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 17:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 12:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

It is known that some observable quantities, related\nto particle motion around the black hole, such as the eikonal quasinormal\nmodes, radius of the shadow, frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit,\nand others, depend mostly on only a few of the lowest coefficients of the\nparametrization.

For instance, English word order rules constrain the word order of a\nsentence like \"The dog chewed the bone\" even though the status of \"dog\" as\nagent and \"bone\" as patient can be inferred from world knowledge and\nplausibility. Quantifying how often this redundancy occurs, and how the level\nof redundancy varies across typologically diverse languages, can shed light on\nthe function and evolution of grammar. To that end, we performed a behavioral\nexperiment in English and Russian and a cross-linguistic computational analysis\nmeasuring the redundancy of grammatical cues in transitive clauses extracted\nfrom naturalistic text. English and Russian speakers (n=484) were presented\nwith subjects, verbs, and objects (in random order and with morphological\nmarkings removed) extracted from naturally occurring sentences and were asked\nto identify which noun is the agent of the action. Accuracy was high in both\nlanguages (~89% in English, ~87% in Russian).

Across 30 languages from eight\nlanguage families, performance was consistently high: a median accuracy of 87%,\ncomparable to the accuracy observed in the human experiments. The conclusion is\nthat grammatical cues such as word order are necessary to convey agenthood and\npatienthood in only at most 10-15% of naturally occurring sentences;\nnevertheless, they can (a) provide an important source of redundancy and (b)\nare crucial for conveying intended meaning that cannot be inferred from the\nwords alone, including descriptions of human interactions, where roles are\noften reversible (e.g., Ray helped Lu/Lu helped Ray), and expressing\nnon-prototypical meanings (e.g., \"The bone chewed the dog.\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 21:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

Chemical crosslinking contributes to the stiffening behavior\ncharacterizing the brittle response of aged elastomers. In this work, we first\nmodify the Helmholtz free energy to incorporate the effect of\nthermo-chemically-driven crosslinking processes.

Recently, a series of\nalgorithms such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has been proposed for\ndomain generalization. However, Rosenfeld et al. (2021) shows that in a simple\nlinear data model, even if non-convexity issues are ignored, IRM and its\nextensions cannot generalize to unseen environments with less than $d_s+1$\ntraining environments, where $d_s$ is the dimension of the spurious-feature\nsubspace. In this paper, we propose to achieve domain generalization with\nInvariant-feature Subspace Recovery (ISR). Our first algorithm, ISR-Mean, can\nidentify the subspace spanned by invariant features from the first-order\nmoments of the class-conditional distributions, and achieve provable domain\ngeneralization with $d_s+1$ training environments under the data model of\nRosenfeld et al.

On the\nother hand, it has also been argued that accepting nonlocality leads to a form\nof retrocausality. In this article we seek to elucidate the relationship\nbetween retrocausality and locality. We begin by providing a brief schema of\nthe various ways in which violations of Bell's inequalities might lead us to\nconsider some form of retrocausality. We then consider some possible\nmotivations for using retrocausality to rescue locality, arguing that none of\nthese motivations is adequate and that therefore there is no clear reason why\nwe should prefer local retrocausal models to nonlocal retrocausal models. Next,\nwe examine several different conceptions of retrocausality, concluding that\n`all-at-once' retrocausality is more coherent than the alternative dynamical\npicture. We then argue that since the `all-at-once' approach requires\nprobabilities to be assigned to entire histories or mosaics, locality is\nsomewhat redundant within this picture. Thus we conclude that using\nretrocausality as a way to rescue locality may not be the right route to\nretrocausality. Finally, we demonstrate that accepting the existence of\nnonlocality and insisting on the nonexistence of preferred reference frames\nleads naturally to the acceptance of a form of retrocausality, albeit one which\nis not mediated by physical systems travelling backwards in time. We argue that\nthis is the more natural way to motivate retrocausal models of quantum\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 23:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

In this paper, we exploit\nthe freedom of gate reordering based on the commutation rules to show the\nimpact of gate error propagation paths on the output state fidelity of the\nquantum circuit, propose advanced predictive techniques to project the success\nrate of the circuit, and develop a new compilation phase post-quantum circuit\nmapping to improve its reliability. Our proposed approaches have been validated\nusing a variety of quantum circuits with different success metrics, which are\nexecuted on IBM quantum computers. Our results show that rescheduling quantum\ngates based on their error propagation paths can significantly improve the\nfidelity of the quantum circuit in the presence of variable gate error rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

To bridge this gap, we propose an Enhanced Bayesian Upper\nConfidence Bound (EBUCB) framework that can efficiently accommodate bandit\nproblems in the presence of approximate inference.

Parametric PDE solutions are often approximated using a spectral\ndecomposition based on polynomial chaos expansions. For the class of systems we\nconsider (i.e., high dimensional with limited solution evaluations) the\ncoefficients are given by an underdetermined linear system in a regression\nformulation. This implies additional assumptions, such as sparsity of the\ncoefficient vector, are needed to approximate the solution. Here, we present an\napproach where we assume the coefficients are close to the range of a\ngenerative model that maps from a low to a high dimensional space of\ncoefficients. Our approach is inspired be recent work examining how generative\nmodels can be used for compressed sensing in systems with random Gaussian\nmeasurement matrices. Using results from PDE theory on coefficient decay rates,\nwe construct an explicit generative model that predicts the polynomial chaos\ncoefficient magnitudes. The algorithm we developed to find the coefficients,\nwhich we call GenMod, is composed of two main steps. First, we predict the\ncoefficient signs using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Then, we assume the\ncoefficients are within a sparse deviation from the range of a sign-adjusted\ngenerative model. This allows us to find the coefficients by solving a\nnonconvex optimization problem, over the input space of the generative model\nand the space of sparse vectors. We obtain theoretical recovery results for a\nLipschitz continuous generative model and for a more specific generative model,\nbased on coefficient decay rate bounds. We examine three high-dimensional\nproblems and show that, for all three examples, the generative model approach\noutperforms sparsity promoting methods at small sample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 02:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Here, current-induced\nspin-orbit torques in VO$_2$/NiFe heterostructures were investigated using\nspin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, where the VO$_2$ layer undergoes a\nprominent insulator-metal transition. A roughly two-fold increase in the\nGilbert damping parameter, $\\alpha$, with temperature was attributed to the\nchange in the VO$_2$/NiFe interface spin absorption across the VO$_2$ phase\ntransition. More remarkably, a large modulation ($\\pm$100%) and a sign change\nof the current-induced spin-orbit torque across the VO$_2$ phase transition\nsuggest two competing spin-orbit torque generating mechanisms. The bulk spin\nHall effect in metallic VO$_2$, corroborated by our first-principles\ncalculation of spin Hall conductivity, $\\sigma_{SH} \\approx 10^4\n\\frac{\\hbar}{e} \\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, is verified as the main source of the\nspin-orbit torque in the metallic phase. The self-induced/anomalous torque in\nNiFe, of the opposite sign and a similar magnitude to the bulk spin Hall effect\nin metallic VO$_2$, could be the other competing mechanism that dominates as\ntemperature decreases. For applications, the strong tunability of the torque\nstrength and direction opens a new route to tailor spin-orbit torques of\nmaterials which undergo phase transitions for new device functionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 03:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

A storage\nloop is added relative to previous gates as a key innovation, which bestows an\nasynchronous property to the gate such that input bits can arrive at different\ntimes as long as their order is clearly preserved. The shift register\nrepresents bit states by flux polarity, both in the stored bit as well as the\nballistic input and output bits.

We leveraged the fact that deep models, including both\nrandom forests and deep networks, learn internal representations which are\nunions of polytopes with affine activation functions to conceptualize them both\nas generalized partitioning rules. We replace the affine function in each\npolytope populated by the training data with Gaussian kernel that results in a\ngenerative model. Theoretically, we derive the conditions under which our\ngenerative models are a consistent estimator of the corresponding class\nconditional density. Moreover, our proposed models obtain well calibrated\nposteriors for in-distribution, and extrapolate beyond the training data to\nhandle out-of-distribution inputs reasonably. We believe this approach may be\nan important step in unifying the thinking and the approaches across the\ndiscriminative and the generative divide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 05:07:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 14:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 14:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 03:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 21:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Several of the most popular and\ntop-performing similarity graphs, such as NSG and HNSW, at their core employ\nbest-first traversal along the underlying graph indices to search near\nneighbors.

Early Vision Transformers such as ViT and DeiT adopt global\nself-attention, which is computationally expensive when the number of patches\nis large.

Despite the fact that window-based local self-attention significantly\nboosts efficiency, it fails to capture the relationships between distant but\nsimilar patches in the image plane. To overcome this limitation of image-space\nlocal attention, in this paper, we further exploit the locality of patches in\nthe feature space. We group the patches into multiple clusters using their\nfeatures, and self-attention is computed within every cluster. Such\nfeature-space local attention effectively captures the connections between\npatches across different local windows but still relevant.

The energy\nanisotropy governed by parameter K' has deep consequences on equilibrium &\nnon-equilibrium properties. Using GB model, which shows Nm & low temperature Sm\norder, we undertake large-scale MC & MD simulations to probe effect of K' on\nthe equilibrium phase diagram & the non-equilibrium domain growth following a\nquench in the temperature T (coarsening). There are 2 transitions in the model,\nI->Nm at Tc1 & Nm->Sm at Tc2<Tc1. K' decreases Tc1 significantly, but has\nrelatively little effect on Tc2. Domain growth in Nm phase exhibits the\nwell-known LAC law, L(t)~t^0.5 & evolution is via annihilation of string\ndefects. The system exhibits dynamical scaling that is also robust with respect\nto K'. We find that Sm phase at quench temperatures T (T>Tc1->T<Tc2) that we\nconsider has SmB order with a hexatic arrangement of the LC molecules in the\nlayers. Coarsening in this phase exhibits a striking two-time-scale scenario:\nfirst the LC molecules align & develop orientational order, followed by\nemergence of characteristic layering along with the hexatic\nbond-orientational-order within layers. Consequently, the growth follows the\nLAC law L(t)~t^0.5 at early times & then shows a sharp crossover to a slower\ngrowth regime at later times. Our observations strongly suggest L(t)~t^0.25 in\nthis regime. Interestingly, the correlation function shows dynamical scaling in\nboth the regimes & the scaling function is universal. The dynamics is also\nrobust with respect to changes in K', but the smecticity is more pronounced at\nlarger values. Further, the early-time dynamics is governed by string defects,\nwhile the late-time evolution is dictated by interfacial defects.

When a magnetic field reconnects, its\nenergy is converted to the kinetic energy of charged particles, as observed for\nsolar energetic particles arriving on earth. This accelerates the cosmic\nbackground nuclei, and energetic nuclei induce nonthermal reactions. A\nconstraint on the dissipation is derived from a theoretical calculation of the\nnonthermal reactions during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We found that\nobservations of the Li and D abundances can be explained if 0.01--0.1 % of the\ncosmic energy density was utilized for nuclear acceleration after the\nelectron--positron annihilation epoch. Reconnections of such amplitudes of\nmagnetic fields generate outgoing jets, the bulk velocity of which evolves to\nvalues appropriate for cosmic ray (CR) nuclear energies of 0.1--1 MeV necessary\nfor successful CR nucleosynthesis. Therefore, acceleration of cosmic background\nnuclei during the dissipation of primordial magnetic fields is a possible\ngeneration mechanism of soft CRs that has been suggested as a solution to the\ncosmic Li problem.

In addition, for the LRU policy we derive a backtracking\nalgorithm as well as an approach for using it as a last resort after other\nanalyses have failed to conclude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Recently, compression-induced softening and\nheating-induced hardening (CISHIH) dual anomaly was predicted in group VB\nelements such as vanadium. Here, the evidence for this counterintuitive\nphenomenon is reported. By using accurate high-temperature high-pressure sound\nvelocities measured at Hugoniot states generated by shock-waves, together with\nfirst-principles calculations, we observe not only the prominent\ncompression-induced sound velocity reduction, but also strong heating-induced\nsound velocity enhancement, in shocked vanadium. The former corresponds to the\nsoftening in shear modulus by compression, whereas the latter reflects the\nreverse hardening by heat. These experiments also unveil another anomaly in\nYoung's modulus that wasn't reported before. Based on the experimental and\ntheoretical data, we infer that vanadium might transition from BCC into two\ndifferent rhombohedral (RH1 and RH2) phases at about 79GPa and 116GPa along the\nHugoniot, respectively, which implies a dramatic difference in static and\ndynamic loading, as well as the significance of deviatoric stress and\nrate-relevant effects in high-pressure phase transition dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 09:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

The\nmost common models of transcription are primarily concerned with the effect of\nactivators/repressors on the overall transcription rate and approximate the\nbasal transcription processes as a one step event. According to such effective\nmodels, the Fano factor of mRNA copy distributions is always greater than\n(super-Poissonian) or equal to 1 (Poissonian), and the only way to go below\nthis limit (sub-Poissonian) is via a negative feedback. It is partly due to\nthis limit that the first stage of transcription is held responsible for most\nof the stochastic noise in mRNA copy numbers. However, by considering all major\nreactions that build and drive the basal transcription machinery, from the\nfirst protein that binds a promoter to the entrance of the transcription\ncomplex (TC) into productive elongation, it is shown that the first two stages\nof transcription, namely the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and the\npromoter proximal pausing (PPP), is a highly punctual process. In other words,\nthe time between the first and the last step of this process is narrowly\ndistributed, which gives rise to sub-Poissonian distributions for the number of\nTCs that have entered productive elongation. In fact, having simulated the PIC\nformation and the PPP via the Gillespie algorithm using 2000 distinct parameter\nsets and 4 different reaction network topologies, it is shown that only 4.4%\ngive rise to a Fano factor that is > 1 with the upper bound of 1.7, while for\n31% of cases the Fano factor is below 0.5, with 0.19 as the lower bound. These\nresults cast doubt on the notion that most of the stochastic noise observed in\nmRNA distributions always originates at the promoter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 10:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

By comparison with experimental values, the ANN model is found to give\nvery good descriptions of the half-lives of the neutron-deficient nuclei.\nMoreover CPPMT is found to perform better than CPPM, indicating the importance\nof employing temperature-dependent nuclear potential. Furthermore, to predict\nthe {\\alpha}-decay half-lives of unmeasured neutron-deficient nuclei, another\nANN algorithm is trained to predict the Q {\\alpha} values. The results of the Q\n{\\alpha} predictions are compared with the Weizs\\\"acker-Skyrme-4+RBF (WS4+RBF)\nformula.

The analysis is carried out via two\nalternative routes, recently considered in the literature: first, the kinetic\nor thermal route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing\nof the evolution curves of the kinetic temperature (average kinetic energy),\nand, second, the stochastic thermodynamics or entropic route, in which the\nMpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the distance to equilibrium\nin probability space.

The backdoored DNN model will behave\nmaliciously when images containing backdoor triggers arrive. To date, existing\nbackdoor attacks are single-trigger and single-target attacks, and the triggers\nof most existing backdoor attacks are obvious thus are easy to be detected or\nnoticed. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and multi-channel\nbackdoor attack against Deep Neural Networks by exploiting Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) steganography. Based on the proposed backdoor attack method, we\nimplement two variants of backdoor attacks, i.e., N-to-N backdoor attack and\nN-to-One backdoor attack. Specifically, for a colored image, we utilize DCT\nsteganography to construct the trigger on different channels of the image. As a\nresult, the trigger is stealthy and natural. Based on the proposed method, we\nimplement multi-target and multi-trigger backdoor attacks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the average attack success rate of the N-to-N backdoor attack\nis 93.95% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 91.55% on TinyImageNet dataset, respectively.\nThe average attack success rate of N-to-One attack is 90.22% and 89.53% on\nCIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed\nbackdoor attack does not affect the classification accuracy of the DNN model.\nMoreover, the proposed attack is demonstrated to be robust to the\nstate-of-the-art backdoor defense (Neural Cleanse).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 12:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

We\nclarify the relation between the sign of delta-T noise and the quantum exchange\nstatistics of tunneling quasiparticles. We find that, for infinite systems\nhosting chiral channels with local interactions (e.g., quantum Hall or quantum\nspin Hall edges), when the delta-T noise is negative, the tunneling particles\nare boson-like, revealing their tendency towards bunching. However, the\nopposite is not true: Boson-like particles do not necessarily produce negative\ndelta-T noise. Importantly, the bosonic nature of particles generating the\nnegative delta-T is not necessarily intrinsic, but can be induced by the\ninteractions. This particularly implies that negative delta-T noise for\ntunneling between the edge states cannot serve as a smoking gun for detecting\n\"intrinsic anyons\". We also establish a connection between the delta-T noise\nand the temperature derivative of the thermal noise in interacting systems,\nboth governed by the same scaling dimensions. As a demonstration of the above\nstatements, we study tunneling between two interacting quantum spin Hall edges.\nWith bosonization and renormalization-group techniques, we find that many-body\ninteractions can generate negative delta-T noise for both direct tunneling\nthrough a point contact and in Kondo exchange tunneling via a localized spin.\nIn both setups, we show that the noise can become negative at sufficiently low\ntemperatures, when interactions renormalize the tunneling to favor boson-like\npair-tunneling of electrons.

First, these local features\nsimply boil down to the localized map activations of a neural network, and\nhence can be extremely redundant. Second, they are typically trained with a\nglobal loss that only acts on top of an aggregation of local features; by\ncontrast, testing is based on local feature matching, which creates a\ndiscrepancy between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel\narchitecture for deep image retrieval, based solely on mid-level features that\nwe call Super-features. These Super-features are constructed by an iterative\nattention module and constitute an ordered set in which each element focuses on\na localized and discriminant image pattern. For training, they require only\nimage labels. A contrastive loss operates directly at the level of\nSuper-features and focuses on those that match across images. A second\ncomplementary loss encourages diversity. Experiments on common landmark\nretrieval benchmarks validate that Super-features substantially outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods when using the same number of features, and only\nrequire a significantly smaller memory footprint to match their performance.\nCode and models are available at: https://github.com/naver/FIRe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 12:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

One of the successful approaches to achieve\nthis goal is to accelerate and transport intense ion charge bunches in an\naccelerator and then focus the charge bunches ballistically in a section of the\naccelerator that contains a neutralizing background plasma. This requires the\nability to control space-charge effects during un-neutralized (non-neutral)\nbeam transport in the accelerator and transport sections, and the ability to\neffectively neutralize the space charge and current by propagating the beam\nthrough background plasma. As the beam intensity and energy are increased in\nfuture heavy ion fusion (HIF) drivers and Fast Ignition (FI) approaches, it is\nexpected that nonlinear processes and collective effects will become much more\npronounced than in previous experiments.

We used ALMA in extended configuration\n(resolution ~0.064\") to measure the 1287 um (233 GHz) continuum flux of the\ncomet. Observations were performed on August 8, 2021 at a 20.0 au distance from\nthe Sun. The high spatial resolution was chosen in order to filter out any dust\ncontribution. We detected the thermal emission of the object at ~10 sigma, with\na flux of 0.128+/-0.012 mJy. Based on observational constraints and our\ntheoretical estimates of the dust contribution, the entirety of the measured\nflux can be attributed to the nucleus. From NEATM modelling combined with the\nHr magnitude, we determine a surface-equivalent diameter of 137+/-17 km and a\nred geometric albedo of 5.3+/-1.2 %. This confirms that 2014 UN271 is by far\nthe largest Oort-cloud object ever found (almost twice as large as comet C/1995\nO1 Hale-Bopp), and except for the Centaur 95P/Chiron which shows outburst-like\nactivity, the largest known comet in the Solar System. On the other hand, the\nobject albedo is typical of comets, adding credence for a \"universal\" comet\nnucleus albedo. With its distant perihelion and uniquely large size, 2014 UN271\nis the prominent archetype of distant comets, whose activity is driven by\nhypervolatiles.

Using these results, we calculate the deflection\nangle of a test particle passing through a spherically symmetric oscillating\ndistribution of a self-gravitating scalar field with a logarithmic potential.\nIt turned out that, in a wide range of amplitudes, oscillations in the\ndeflection angle are sinusoidal and become small for ultrarelativistic\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 13:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Restoring\ndiacritics and correcting spelling is important for proper language use and the\ndisambiguation of texts for both humans and downstream algorithms. However,\nboth of these problems are typically addressed separately: the state-of-the-art\ndiacritics restoration methods do not tolerate other typos, but classical\nspellcheckers also cannot deal adequately with all the diacritics missing.

Several machine learning-based techniques have been\nproposed to assist in the analysis process. However, the ML models typically\nneed to be trained to perform a specific task, e.g., brain tumour segmentation\nor classification. Not only do the corresponding training data require\nlaborious manual annotations, but a wide variety of abnormalities can be\npresent in a human brain MRI - even more than one simultaneously, which renders\nrepresentation of all possible anomalies very challenging. Hence, a possible\nsolution is an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) system that can learn a\ndata distribution from an unlabelled dataset of healthy subjects and then be\napplied to detect out of distribution samples. Such a technique can then be\nused to detect anomalies - lesions or abnormalities, for example, brain\ntumours, without explicitly training the model for that specific pathology.\nSeveral Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based techniques have been proposed in\nthe past for this task. Even though they perform very well on controlled\nartificially simulated anomalies, many of them perform poorly while detecting\nanomalies in clinical data. This research proposes a compact version of the\n\"context-encoding\" VAE (ceVAE) model, combined with pre and post-processing\nsteps, creating a UAD pipeline (StRegA), which is more robust on clinical data,\nand shows its applicability in detecting anomalies such as tumours in brain\nMRIs.

Exoplanets with orbital periods of less than one day are known as\nultra-short period (USP) planets. They are relatively rare products of\nplanetary formation and evolution processes, but especially favourable for\ncharacterisation with current planet detection methods. At the time of writing,\n125 USP planets have already been confirmed. Aims. Our aim is to validate the\nplanetary nature of two new transiting planet candidates around M dwarfs\nannounced by the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), registered\nas TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) TOI-1442.01 and TOI-2445.01. Methods. We\nused TESS data, ground-based photometric light curves, and Subaru/IRD\nspectrograph radial velocity (RV) measurements to validate both planetary\ncandidates and to establish their physical properties. Results. TOI-1442 b is a\nvalidated exoplanet with an orbital period of $P$=0.4090682+/-0.0000004 d, a\nradius of $R_p$=1.15+/-0.06$R_{\\oplus}$, and equilibrium temperature of\n$T_{p,eq}$=1357$_{-42}^{+49}$K. TOI-2445 b is also validated with an orbital\nperiod of $P$=0.3711286+/-0.0000004 d, a radius of $R_p$=\n1.33+/-0.09$R_{\\oplus}$, and equilibrium temperature of\n$T_{p,eq}$=1330$_{-56}^{+61}$K. Their physical properties align with current\nempirical trends and formation theories of USP planets. Based on the RV\nmeasurements, we set 3$\\sigma$ upper mass limits of 8$M_{\\oplus}$ and\n20$M_{\\oplus}$, thus confirming the non-stellar, sub-Jovian nature of both\ntransiting objects. More RV measurements will be needed to constrain the\nplanetary masses and mean densities, and the predicted presence of outer\nplanetary companions. These targets extend the small sample of USP planets\norbiting around M dwarfs up to 21 members.

Superconductivity\nhas drawn considerable attention and the mechanism behind it is a topic of\nactive discussion. MATBG has been experimentally characterized by numerous\ntransport and scanning-probe experiments. The material has also emerged as a\nversatile platform for superconducting electronics, as proven by the\nrealization of monolithic Josephson junctions. However, even though\nphase-coherent phenomena have been measured, no control of the superconducting\nphase has been demonstrated so far. Here, we present a Superconducting Quantum\nInterference Device (SQUID) in MATBG, where the superconducting phase\ndifference is controlled through the magnetic field. We observe\nmagneto-oscillations of the critical current, demonstrating long-range\ncoherence agreeing with an effective charge of 2e for the superconducting\ncharge carriers. We tune to both asymmetric and symmetric SQUID configurations\nby electrostatically controlling the critical currents through the junctions.\nWith this tunability, we study the inductances in the device, finding values of\nup to 2{\\mu}H. Furthermore, we directly observe the current-phase relation of\none of the Josephson junctions of the device. Our results show that\nsuperconducting devices in MATBG can be scaled up and used to reveal properties\nof the material. We expect this to foster a more systematic realization of\ndevices of this type, increasing the accuracy with which microscopic\ncharacteristics of the material are extracted. We also envision more complex\ndevices to emerge, such as phase-slip junctions or high kinetic inductance\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 14:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Fulfilling this goal requires the ability to assure quality of service\n(QoS) end to end (E2E), which remains a challenge. A key factor that makes E2E\nQoS assurance difficult in a telecommunication system is that access networks\n(ANs) and core networks (CNs) manage their resources autonomously. So far, few\nresults have been available that can ensure E2E QoS over autonomously managed\nANs and CNs. Existing techniques rely predominately on each subsystem to meet\nstatic local QoS budgets with no recourse in case any subsystem fails to meet\nits local budgets and, hence will have difficulty delivering E2E assurance.\nMoreover, most existing distributed optimization techniques that can be applied\nto assure E2E QoS over autonomous subsystems require the subsystems to exchange\nsensitive information such as their local decision variables. This paper\npresents a novel framework and a distributed algorithm that can enable ANs and\nCNs to autonomously \"cooperate\" with each other to dynamically negotiate their\nlocal QoS budgets and to collectively meet E2E QoS goals by sharing only their\nestimates of the global constraint functions, without disclosing their local\ndecision variables.

Similar scheme is also explored for dissolved molecular\noxygen, where physical excitations form singlet oxygen with different spin\nconfigurations and generate a long chain of ionic and free-radical reactions.\nThis work utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize\nionic dynamics of proposed spin conversion methods applied to dissolving of\ncarbon dioxide CO$_2$ and hydrogen peroxide H$_2$O$_2$ in pure water excited by\nfluctuating weak magnetic field in uT range. Measurement results demonstrate\ndifferent ionic reactivities and surface tension effects triggered by\nexcitations at 10$^{-8}$J/mL. The CO$_2$- and O$_2$-related reaction pathways\nare well distinguishable by EIS. Control experiments without CO$_2$/H$_2$O$_2$\ninput show no significant effects. Dynamics of electrochemical impedances and\ntemperature of fluids indicates anomalous quasi-periodical fluctuations\npointing to possible carbonate-induced cyclic reactions or cyclical spin\nconversion processes. This approach can underlay development of affordable\nsensors operating with spin conversion technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 10:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

While previous GW population analyses assumed all NSs\nobey the same maximum mass, if rapidly spinning NSs exist, they can extend to\nlarger maximum masses than nonspinning NSs.

This article reviews\nthe work of image deblurring and specifically introduces more classic image\ndeblurring methods, which is helpful to understand current research and look\nforward to future trends. This article reviews the traditional image deblurring\nmethods and depth-represented image deblurring methods, and comprehensively\nclassifies and introduces the corresponding technical methods. This review can\nprovide some guidance for researchers in the field of image deblurring, and at\nthe same time facilitate their subsequent study and research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 02:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Online teaching will prove to be the\nmost commonly used method that should compensate for the inability to work in\nthe classroom and allow the educational process to continue. Of course, this\nteaching method was not created in 2020, but it was only presented and\nimplemented in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia with the beginning of\nthe pandemic. In this paper, we see how these countries have faced abrupt\nchanges in teaching, and how this change has affected students. Online teaching\ncannot be a mere transfer of analog content to digital; a different approach is\nneeded in the implementation of teaching as required and offered by the digital\nmedium, but at the same time it is necessary to preserve the basic principles\nof the lecturer and the curriculum. It is a call, both for teachers and\nstudents. Since this is a current and universal problem, we hope that the\nconclusions presented are useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 17:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

Financial incentives, behavioral interventions, and\nmandates can drive technology adoption, while land-use zoning policies provide\nthe framework for development of the built environment. Often policies and\ntheir impacts are evaluated top down, typically on a national scale, or\npost-hoc on developments vis-\\`a-vis different policies in the past. Such\nhigh-level analyses and post-hoc evaluations cannot show possible developments\npathways for specific cities, and hence cannot serve as input to policymakers\nat the local level such as county, municipal, or city governments. Here, we\npresent IMPACT pathways from a bottom-up model with residence level granularity\nthat integrate policy for technology adoption with zoning policy, climate\nchange, and grid decarbonization scenarios. With the city at the heart of the\nanalysis, our results show potential greenhouse gas emission pathways, identify\nsynergies and trade-offs between policies, and show the importance of\nappropriate baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 02:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 02:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Digital data sources,\nwhich are sources of innovation, such as patents, publications, social media,\nwebsites, etc., are increasingly growing at unprecedented volume. Manual idea\ngeneration is time-consuming and is affected by the subjectivity of the\nindividuals involved. Therefore, the use machine-driven data analytics\ntechniques to analyze data to generate ideas and support idea generation by\nserving users is useful. The objective of this study is to study state-of\nthe-art machine-driven analytics for idea generation and data sources, hence\nthe result of this study will generally server as a guideline for choosing\ntechniques and data sources. A systematic literature review is conducted to\nidentify relevant scholarly literature from IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science and\nGoogle Scholar. We selected a total of 71 articles and analyzed them\nthematically. The results of this study indicate that idea generation through\nmachine-driven analytics applies text mining, information retrieval (IR),\nartificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning, statistical\ntechniques, natural language processing (NLP), NLP-based morphological\nanalysis, network analysis, and bibliometric to support idea generation. The\nresults include a list of techniques and procedures in idea generation through\nmachine-driven idea analytics. Additionally, characterization and heuristics\nused in idea generation are summarized. For the future, tools designed to\ngenerate ideas could be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 21:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}
