Based on a Landau-theoretical\nframework, which encompasses spatially resolved information, we interpret these\nregimes: initially, the response is dominated by thermal noise, then the top of\nthe film expands, followed by a permeation of this response into the bulk. An\nimportant signature of this interpretation is a significant dependence of the\nregime time scales on film thickness, where we observe a clear\nthin-film-to-bulk transition. The point of transition coincides with the\nemergence of spatial inhomogeneities in the bulk, i.e., domain formation, and\nshould be avoided due to the less predictable steady-state expansion it gives\nrise to. Finally, we show that this domain formation can be suppressed by\ndecreasing the initial thickness of the film, and increasing the linear\ndimensions of the mesogens, or their orientational order when crosslinked into\nthe network, though this comes at the cost of the deformation magnitude.

Its probability is quantified via simulations\nfor the four groups of the 2022/23 UEFA Nations League A under two\nwell-established tie-breaking rules, goal difference and head-to-head records.\nIn these home-away round-robin contests with four teams and 12 matches, the\ncompetitiveness of the final four games can be promoted by giving priority to\ngoal difference, which reduces the chance of a fixed position in the group\nranking by at least two and usually five percentage points in the last round.\nOur findings, supported by sensitivity analysis in a theoretical model, provide\nimportant lessons on how to design ranking systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 18:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 09:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Although these languages alleviate the need for\nmandatory type annotations, types still play a critical role in program\nunderstanding and preventing runtime errors. An attractive option is to infer\ntypes automatically to get static guarantees without writing types. Existing\ninference techniques rely mostly on static typing tools such as PyType for\ndirect type inference; more recently, neural type inference has been proposed.\nHowever, neural type inference is data hungry, and depends on collecting\nlabeled data based on static typing. Such tools, however, are poor at inferring\nuser defined types. Furthermore, type annotation by developers in these\nlanguages is quite sparse. In this work, we propose novel techniques for\ngenerating high quality types using 1) information retrieval techniques that\nwork on well documented libraries to extract types and 2) usage patterns by\nanalyzing a large repository of programs. Our results show that these\ntechniques are more precise and address the weaknesses of static tools, and can\nbe useful for generating a large labeled dataset for type inference by machine\nlearning methods. F1 scores are 0.52-0.58 for our techniques, compared to\nstatic typing tools which are at 0.06, and we use them to generate over 37,000\ntypes for over 700 modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 22:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

While OCE has been applied to\nrelatively homogeneous samples, tissues with significantly varying elasticity\nthrough depth pose a challenge, requiring depth-resolved measurement with\nsufficient resolution and accuracy. Here, we develop a broadband Rayleigh-wave\nOCE technique capable of measuring the elastic moduli of the 3 major skin\nlayers (epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis) reliably by analyzing the dispersion\nof leaky Rayleigh surface waves over a wide frequency range of 0.1-10 kHz.

Methods:\nWe used the Geneva stellar evolution code. The evolution was computed until the\nend of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch\nphase, or the core helium-flash for massive, intermediate, and low mass stars,\nrespectively. Results: The outputs of the present stellar models are well\nframed by the outputs of the two grids obtained by our group for metallicities\nabove and below the one considered here.

Actually, our definition of\nflip processes is more general, in that $\\mathcal{R}(F)$ is a probability\ndistribution on $\\mathcal{H}_k$, thus allowing randomised replacements.\n  Given a flip process with a rule $\\mathcal{R}$, we construct time-indexed\ntrajectories $\\Phi:\\mathcal{W}_0\\times [0,\\infty)\\rightarrow\\mathcal{W}_0$ in\nthe space of graphons. We prove that for any $T > 0$ starting with a large\nfinite graph $G_0$ which is close to a graphon $W_0$ in the cut norm, with high\nprobability the flip process will stay in a thin sausage around the trajectory\n$(\\Phi(W_0,t))_{t=0}^T$ (after rescaling the time by the square of the order of\nthe graph).\n  These graphon trajectories are then studied from the perspective of dynamical\nsystems. Among others topics, we study continuity properties of these\ntrajectories with respect to time and initial graphon, existence and stability\nof fixed points and speed of convergence (whenever the infinite time limit\nexists). We give an example of a flip process with a periodic trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 14:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 06:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 12:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

In particular, AI will enable the\noptimization of more and more intricate economic settings, in which multiple\ndifferent activities need to be jointly automated. This is the case of, e.g.,\nGoogle Hotel Ads and Tripadvisor, where auctions are used to display ads of\nsimilar products or services together with their prices. As in classical ad\nauctions, the ads are ranked depending on the advertisers' bids, whereas,\ndifferently from classical settings, ads are displayed together with their\nprices, so as to provide a direct comparison among them. This dramatically\naffects users' behavior, as well as the properties of ad auctions. We show\nthat, in such settings, social welfare maximization can be achieved by means of\na direct-revelation mechanism that jointly optimizes, in polynomial time, the\nads allocation and the advertisers' prices to be displayed with them. However,\nin practice it is unlikely that advertisers allow the mechanism to choose\nprices on their behalf. Indeed, in commonly-adopted mechanisms, ads allocation\nand price optimization are decoupled, so that the advertisers optimize prices\nand bids, while the mechanism does so for the allocation, once prices and bids\nare given. We investigate how this decoupling affects the efficiency of\nmechanisms. In particular, we study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of\nStability (PoS) of indirect-revelation mechanisms with both VCG and GSP\npayments, showing that the PoS for the revenue may be unbounded even with two\nslots, and the PoA for the social welfare may be as large as the number of\nslots. Nevertheless, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications\nto the indirect-revelation mechanism with VCG payments achieve a PoS of 1 for\nthe revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-31"}

TMSA divides the video into small clips,\non which mutual attention is applied for joint motion estimation, feature\nalignment and feature fusion, while self attention is used for feature\nextraction. To enable cross-clip interactions, the video sequence is shifted\nfor every other layer. Besides, parallel warping is used to further fuse\ninformation from neighboring frames by parallel feature warping.

Recently, the study of variance reduced (VR)\nmethods and their accelerated variants has made exciting progress. However, the\nstep size used in the existing VR algorithms typically depends on the\nsmoothness parameter, which is often unknown and requires tuning in practice.\nTo address this problem, we propose two novel adaptive VR algorithms: Adaptive\nVariance Reduced Accelerated Extra-Gradient (AdaVRAE) and Adaptive Variance\nReduced Accelerated Gradient (AdaVRAG).

Each individual is assumed to support an outcome if they\nagree with the outcome on at least as many topics as they disagree on.

The major difference between the two lies in the\nstructure of the system of PDEs: BDNK theory only has a set of conservation\nlaws, whereas MIS also includes a set of evolution equations for its\ndissipative degrees of freedom. The simpler structure of the BDNK PDEs in this\nrespect allows for rigorous proofs of stability, causality, and hyperbolicity\nin full generality which have as yet been impossible for MIS. To capitalize on\nthese advantages, we present the first fully conservative multi-dimensional\nfluid solver for the BDNK equations suitable for physical applications. The\nscheme includes a flux-conservative discretization, non-oscillatory\nreconstruction, and a central-upwind numerical flux, and is designed to\nsmoothly transition to a high-resolution shock-capturing perfect fluid solver\nin the inviscid limit. We assess the robustness of our new method in a series\nof flat-spacetime tests for a conformal fluid, and provide a detailed\ncomparison with previous approaches of Pandya & Pretorius (2021).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 18:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 01:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 01:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In this work, we revisit the appropriateness of the Shapley value for\nGNN explanation, where the task is to identify the most important subgraph and\nconstituent nodes for GNN predictions. We claim that the Shapley value is a\nnon-ideal choice for graph data because it is by definition not\nstructure-aware.

When used to score node importance, the HN value utilizes graph\nstructures to attribute cooperation surplus between neighbor nodes, resembling\nmessage passing in GNNs, so that node importance scores reflect not only the\nnode feature importance, but also the node structural roles.

Employing an\nFE method also facilitates meshing of complicated domain geometries and\ncoupling with FE methods for local problems. However, nonlocal weak problems\ninvolve the computation of a double-integral, which is computationally\nexpensive and presents several challenges. In particular, the inner integral of\nthe variational form associated with the stiffness matrix is defined over the\nintersections of FE mesh elements with a ball of radius $\\delta$, where\n$\\delta$ is the range of nonlocal interaction. Identifying and parameterizing\nthese intersections is a nontrivial computational geometry problem. In this\nwork, we propose a quadrature technique where the inner integration is\nperformed using quadrature points distributed over the full ball, without\nregard for how it intersects elements, and weights are computed based on the\ngeneralized moving least squares method. Thus, as opposed to all previously\nemployed methods, our technique does not require element-by-element integration\nand fully circumvents the computation of element-ball intersections. This paper\nconsiders one- and two-dimensional implementations of piecewise linear\ncontinuous FE approximations, focusing on the case where the element size h and\nthe nonlocal radius $\\delta$ are proportional, as is typical of practical\ncomputations. When boundary conditions are treated carefully and the outer\nintegral of the variational form is computed accurately, the proposed method is\nasymptotically compatible in the limit of $h \\sim \\delta \\to 0$, featuring at\nleast first-order convergence in L^2 for all dimensions, using both uniform and\nnonuniform grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 19:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

A fast and accurate\npredictive model allows researchers to more efficiently identify or construct a\nmaterial with desirable properties. As in many fields, deep learning is one of\nthe state-of-the art approaches, but fully training a deep learning model is\nnot always feasible in materials informatics due to limitations on data\navailability, computational resources, and time. Accordingly, there is a\ncritical need in the application of deep learning to materials informatics\nproblems to develop efficient transfer learning algorithms. The Bayesian\nframework is natural for transfer learning because the model trained from the\nsource data can be encoded in the prior distribution for the target task of\ninterest. However, the Bayesian perspective on transfer learning is relatively\nunaccounted for in the literature, and is complicated for deep learning because\nthe parameter space is large and the interpretations of individual parameters\nare unclear. Therefore, rather than subjective prior distributions for\nindividual parameters, we propose a new Bayesian transfer learning approach\nbased on the penalized complexity prior on the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the predictive models of the source and target tasks.

One important concept is the Allee threshold\nthat determines the persistence or extinction of the population in a long time.\nIn general, a small initial population size is harmful to the survival of a\nspecies since when the initial data is below the Allee threshold the population\ntends to extinction, rather than persistence. Another interesting feature of\npopulation evolution is that a species whose movement strategy follows a\nconditional dispersal strategy is more likely to persist. In other words, the\nbiased movement can be a benefit for the persistence of the population. The\ncoexistence of the above two conflicting mechanisms makes the dynamics rather\nintricate. However, some numerical results obtained by Cosner et. al. (SIAM J.\nAppl.

However, a significant\nchallenge with these representations is that both training and inference with\nan MLP over a large number of input coordinates to learn and represent an\nimage, video, or 3D object, require large amounts of computation and incur long\nprocessing times. In this work, we aim to accelerate inference and training of\ncoordinate-based MLPs for implicit neural representations by proposing a new\nsplit MLP architecture, CoordX. With CoordX, the initial layers are split to\nlearn each dimension of the input coordinates separately. The intermediate\nfeatures are then fused by the last layers to generate the learned signal at\nthe corresponding coordinate point. This significantly reduces the amount of\ncomputation required and leads to large speedups in training and inference,\nwhile achieving similar accuracy as the baseline MLP. This approach thus aims\nat first learning functions that are a decomposition of the original signal and\nthen fusing them to generate the learned signal.

Assuming no prior\nknowledge or pre-training of the environment safety model given a task, an\nagent has to learn, via exploration, which states and actions are safe. A\npopular approach in this line of research is to combine a model-free RL\nalgorithm with the Lagrangian method to adjust the weight of the constraint\nreward relative to the utility reward dynamically. It relies on a single policy\nto handle the conflict between utility and constraint rewards, which is often\nchallenging. We present SEditor, a two-policy approach that learns a safety\neditor policy transforming potentially unsafe actions proposed by a utility\nmaximizer policy into safe ones. The safety editor is trained to maximize the\nconstraint reward while minimizing a hinge loss of the utility state-action\nvalues before and after an action is edited. SEditor extends existing safety\nlayer designs that assume simplified safety models, to general safe RL\nscenarios where the safety model can in theory be arbitrarily complex. As a\nfirst-order method, it is easy to implement and efficient for both inference\nand training. On 12 Safety Gym tasks and 2 safe racing tasks, SEditor obtains\nmuch a higher overall safety-weighted-utility (SWU) score than the baselines,\nand demonstrates outstanding utility performance with constraint violation\nrates as low as once per 2k time steps, even in obstacle-dense environments. On\nsome tasks, this low violation rate is up to 200 times lower than that of an\nunconstrained RL method with similar utility performance.

Our findings reveal that in general, entropy rewards should be\napplied with caution to policy evaluation. On one hand, the entropy reward,\nlike any other intrinsic reward, could obscure the main task reward if it is\nnot properly managed.

While the physics of particle filtration results in the\nPFE being size-dependent, measurement standards are specified using a single,\nintegrated PFE, for simplicity. This integrated PFE is commonly defined with\nrespect to either the number (NBFE) or mass (MBFE) distribution of particles as\na function of size. This relationship is non-trivial; it is influenced by both\nthe shape of the particle distribution and the fact that multiple practical\ndefinitions of particle size are used. This manuscript discusses the\nrelationship between NBFE and MBFE in detail, providing a guide to\npractitioners. Our discussion begins with a theoretical discussion of the\nunderlying principles. We then present experimental results for a database of\nsize-resolved PFE (SPFE) measurements for over 900 candidate respirators and\nfilter media, including filter media with systematically varied properties and\ncommercial samples that span the 20%-99.8% MBFE. The observed relationships\nbetween NBFE and MBFE are discussed in terms of the most-penetrating particle\nsize (MPPS) and charge state of the media. For the NaCl particles used here, we\nobserved that MBFEs were greater than NBFEs for charged materials and vice\nversa for uncharged materials. This relationship is observed because a shift\nfrom NBFE to MBFE weights the distribution towards larger sizes, while charged\nmaterials shift the MPPS to smaller sizes. Results are validated by comparing\nthe output of a pair of TSI 8130As, a common instrument used in gauging\nstandards compliance, to that of MBFEs computed from a system capable of\nmeasuring SPFE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 22:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

For finding a walk in an arbitrary graph\nwith $|E|$ edges that exactly matches a pattern of length $m$, a lower bound\nbased on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) implies an algorithm\nsignificantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ time is unlikely [Equi et al., ICALP 2019].\nHowever, for many special graphs, such as de Bruijn graphs, the problem can be\nsolved in linear time [Bowe et al., WABI 2012]. For approximate matching, the\npicture is more complex. When edits (substitutions, insertions, and deletions)\nare only allowed to the pattern, or when the graph is acyclic, the problem is\nagain solvable in $O(|E|m)$ time. When edits are allowed to arbitrary cyclic\ngraphs, the problem becomes NP-complete, even on binary alphabets [Jain et al.,\nRECOMB 2019]. These results hold even when edits are restricted to only\nsubstitutions. The complexity of approximate pattern matching on de Bruijn\ngraphs remained open. We investigate this problem and show that the properties\nthat make de Bruijn graphs amenable to efficient exact pattern matching do not\nextend to approximate matching, even when restricted to the substitutions only\ncase with alphabet size four. We prove that determining the existence of a\nmatching walk in a de Bruijn graph is NP-complete when substitutions are\nallowed to the graph. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm\nsignificantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ is unlikely for de Bruijn graphs in the\ncase where only substitutions are allowed to the pattern. This stands in\ncontrast to pattern-to-text matching where exact matching is solvable in linear\ntime, like on de Bruijn graphs, but approximate matching under substitutions is\nsolvable in subquadratic $O(n\\sqrt{m})$ time, where $n$ is the text's length\n[Abrahamson, SIAM J.

We model execution behavior by\ncollecting low-level signals at run time and using those signals to build\nmachine learning models. These models can identify previously-unseen executions\nthat are more likely to exhibit errors. We describe a tractable approach for\ncollecting dynamic binary runtime signals on ARSs, allowing the systems to\nabsorb most of the overhead from dynamic instrumentation. The architecture of\nARSs is particularly well-adapted to hiding the overhead from instrumentation.\nWe demonstrate the efficiency of these approaches on ARDUPILOT -- a popular\nopen-source autopilot software system -- and HUSKY -- an unmanned ground\nvehicle -- in simulation. We instrument executions to gather data from which we\nbuild supervised machine learning models of executions and evaluate the\naccuracy of these models. We also analyze the amount of training data needed to\ndevelop models with various degrees of accuracy, measure the overhead added to\nexecutions that use the analysis tool, and analyze which runtime signals are\nmost useful for detecting unusual behavior on the program under test.

To train\nthese models with increasing sizes, many neural network practitioners attempt\nto increase the batch sizes in order to leverage multiple GPUs to improve\ntraining speed. However, increasing the batch size often makes the optimization\nmore difficult, leading to slow convergence or poor generalization that can\nrequire orders of magnitude more training time to achieve the same model\nquality. In this paper, we explore the steepness of the loss landscape of\nlarge-batch optimization for adapting pre-trained Transformer-based language\nmodels to domain-specific tasks and find that it tends to be highly complex and\nirregular, posing challenges to generalization on downstream tasks.\n  To tackle this challenge, we propose ScaLA, a novel and efficient method to\naccelerate the adaptation speed of pre-trained transformer networks. Different\nfrom prior methods, we take a sequential game-theoretic approach by adding\nlightweight adversarial noise into large-batch optimization, which\nsignificantly improves adaptation speed while preserving model generalization.\nExperiment results show that ScaLA attains 2.7--9.8$\\times$ adaptation speedups\nover the baseline for GLUE on BERT-base and RoBERTa-large, while achieving\ncomparable and sometimes higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art large-batch\noptimization methods. Finally, we also address the theoretical aspect of\nlarge-batch optimization with adversarial noise and provide a theoretical\nconvergence rate analysis for ScaLA using techniques for analyzing non-convex\nsaddle-point problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 01:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

We first\nconsider the uplink, and the case where each RRH applies a linear dimension\nreduction filter to its multi-antenna received signal vector. It is shown that\nunder a joint mutual information criteria, the optimal dimension reduction\nfilters are given by a variant of the conditional Karhunen-Loeve transform,\nwith a stationary point found using block co-ordinate ascent. These filters are\nthen modified such that each RRH can calculate its own dimension reduction\nfilter in a decentralised manner, using knowledge only of its own instantaneous\nchannel and network slow fading coefficients. We then show that in TDD systems\nthese dimension reduction filters can be re-used as part of a two-stage reduced\ndimension downlink precoding scheme.

The SPICE circuit\nsimulation results for a 400 X 120 X 84 X 10 DNN model deployed on a\nfully-analog IMC circuit show that a 94.84% accuracy could be achieved for\nMNIST classification application with 16, 8, and 8 horizontal partitions, as\nwell as 8, 8, and 1 vertical partitions for first, second, and third layers of\nthe DNN, respectively, which is comparable to the ~97% accuracy realized by\ndigital implementation on CPU. It is shown that accuracy benefits are achieved\nat the cost of higher power consumption due to the extra circuitry required for\nhandling partitioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 02:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

It is assumed in these studies that the communication graph\nshould be complete or well-structured, whereas such an assumption is not always\nvalid in practice. Furthermore, limited memorization and communication\nbandwidth also restrict the collaborations of the agents, since the agents\nmemorize and communicate very few experiences. Additionally, an agent may be\ncorrupted to share falsified experiences to its peers, while the resource limit\nin terms of memorization and communication may considerably restrict the\nreliability of the learning process. To address the above issues, we propose a\nthree-staged collaborative learning algorithm. In each step, the agents share\ntheir latest experiences with each other through light-weight random walks in a\ngeneral communication graph, and then make decisions on which arms to pull\naccording to the recommendations received from their peers. The agents finally\nupdate their adoptions (i.e., preferences to the arms) based on the reward\nobtained by pulling the arms.

It is concerned with finding a matching between two\ndisjoint sets of agents wherein no pair of agents prefer each other to their\nmatched partners. The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is an elegant\nprocedure that guarantees a stable matching for any input; however, its outcome\nmay be unfair as it always favors one side by returning a matching that is\noptimal for one side (say men) and pessimal for the other side (say women). A\ndesirable fairness notion is minimizing the sex-equality cost, i.e. the\ndifference between the total rankings of both sides. Computing such stable\nmatchings is a strongly NP-hard problem, which raises the question of what\ntractable algorithms to adopt in practice. We conduct a series of empirical\nevaluations on the properties of sex-equal stable matchings when preferences of\nagents on both sides are correlated. Our empirical results suggest that under\ncorrelated preferences, the DA algorithm returns stable matchings with low\nsex-equality cost, which further confirms its broad use in many practical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 03:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

The above properties enable a linear layer\ntrained on such representations to effectively learn the clean labels without\noverfitting the noise.} We further show that the low-rank structure of the\nJacobian of deep networks pre-trained with contrastive learning allows them to\nachieve a superior performance initially, when fine-tuned on noisy labels.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the initial robustness provided by contrastive\nlearning enables robust training methods to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance under extreme noise levels, e.g., an average of 27.18\\% and 15.58\\%\nincrease in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with 80\\% symmetric noisy\nlabels, and 4.11\\% increase in accuracy on WebVision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 05:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 20:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 22:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 06:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

To solve this problem, we\npropose to rectify LF to obtain a large baseline. Specifically, the proposed\nmethod aligns two LFs captured by two hand-held LF cameras with a random\nrelative pose, and extracts the corresponding row-aligned sub-aperture images\n(SAIs) to obtain an LF with a large baseline.

First, it allows users to freely revoke granted\npermissions. Hence, developers cannot assume that the permissions granted to an\napp would keep being granted. Instead, they should make their apps carefully\ncheck the permission status before invoking dangerous APIs. Second, the\npermission specification keeps evolving, bringing new types of compatibility\nissues into the ecosystem. To understand the impact of the challenges, we\nconducted an empirical study on 13,352 popular Google Play apps. We found that\n86.0% apps used dangerous APIs asynchronously after permission management and\n61.2% apps used evolving dangerous APIs. If an app does not properly handle\npermission revocations or platform differences, unexpected runtime issues may\nhappen and even cause app crashes. We call such Android Runtime Permission\nissues as ARP bugs. Unfortunately, existing runtime permission issue detection\ntools cannot effectively deal with the ARP bugs induced by asynchronous\npermission management and permission specification evolution. To fill the gap,\nwe designed a static analyzer, Aper, that performs reaching definition and\ndominator analysis on Android apps to detect the two types of ARP bugs. To\ncompare Aper with existing tools, we built a benchmark, ARPfix, from 60 real\nARP bugs.

The main issue of BN in CIL is\nthe imbalance of training data between current and past tasks in a mini-batch,\nwhich makes the empirical mean and variance as well as the learnable affine\ntransformation parameters of BN heavily biased toward the current task --\ncontributing to the forgetting of past tasks.

As a promising solution, mobile crowd sensing enables controllable\nsensing and transmission processes for multiple types of data in a single\ndevice. In this paper, a typical user is considered that is required to sense\nand transmit data to a server, while it is assumed to remain busy and incapable\nof sensing data during an interval. An optimization problem is formulated to\nminimize the energy consumption of data sensing and transmission by controlling\nthe sensing and transmission rates over time, subject to the constraints on the\nsensing data sizes, transmission data sizes, data casualty, and sensing busy\ntime. This problem is highly challenging, due to the coupling between the rates\nas well as the existence of the busy time. To deal with this problem, we first\nshow that it can be equivalently decomposed into two subproblems, corresponding\nto a search for the amount of data size that needs to be sensed before the busy\ntime (referred to as the height), as well as the sensing and transmission rate\ncontrol given the height. Next, we show that the latter problem can be\nefficiently solved by using the classical string-pulling method, while an\nefficient algorithm is proposed to progressively find the optimal height\nwithout the exhaustive search. Moreover, the solution approach is extended to a\nmore complex scenario where there is a finite-size buffer at the server for\nreceiving data.

To study node importance\nbased on network flows from a mesoscopic perspective, we analytically derive a\ncommunity-aware information-theoretic centrality score based on network flow\nand the coding principles behind the map equation: map equation centrality. Map\nequation centrality measures how much further we can compress the network's\nmodular description by not coding for random walker transitions to the\nrespective node, using an adapted coding scheme and determining node importance\nfrom a network flow-based point of view. The information-theoretic centrality\nmeasure can be determined from a node's local network context alone because\nchanges to the coding scheme only affect other nodes in the same module. Map\nequation centrality is agnostic to the chosen network flow model and allows\nresearchers to select the model that best reflects the dynamics of the process\nunder study. Applied to synthetic networks, we highlight how our approach\nenables a more fine-grained differentiation between nodes than node-local or\nnetwork-global measures.

Sociodemographic attributes, current travel behavior and\ntransportation mode preference in an 8 km trip scenario using RH service and\nits similar modes (auto and transit), were collected. A multinomial logit model\nwas used to estimate the time and cost coefficients for using RH services\nacross income groups, which was then used to estimate the value of time (VOT)\nfor RH. The model results indicate RH services popularity among those aged 18\nto 39, larger households and households with fewer autos. Higher income groups\nare also willing to pay more for using RH services. To examine the impact of RH\nservices on modal split in the city of Munich, we incorporated RH as a new mode\ninto an existing nested logit mode choice model using an incremental logit.\nTravel time, travel cost and VOT were used as measures for the choice commuters\nmake when choosing between RH and its closest mode, metro. A total of 20\nscenarios were evaluated at four different congestion levels and four price\nlevels to reflect the demand in response to acceptable costs and time\ntradeoffs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 16:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Despite the publication of many research papers reporting CPI\npredictors in the recent years, we have observed a number of fundamental issues\nin experiment design that lead to over optimistic estimates of model\nperformance. Results: In this paper, we analyze the impact of several important\nfactors affecting generalization perfor-mance of CPI predictors that are\noverlooked in existing work: 1. Similarity between training and test examples\nin cross-validation 2. The strategy for generating negative examples, in the\nabsence of experimentally verified negative examples. 3. Choice of evaluation\nprotocols and performance metrics and their alignment with real-world use of\nCPI predictors in screening large compound libraries. Using both an existing\nstate-of-the-art method (CPI-NN) and a proposed kernel based approach, we have\nfound that assessment of predictive performance of CPI predictors requires\ncareful con-trol over similarity between training and test examples.

In recent years, convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) have been widely used to delineate the bronchial tree. However, the\nsegmentation results of the CNN-based methods usually include many\ndiscontinuous branches, which need manual repair in clinical use. A major\nreason for the breakages is that the appearance of the airway wall can be\naffected by the lung disease as well as the adjacency of the vessels, while the\nnetwork tends to overfit to these special patterns in the training set. To\nlearn robust features for these areas, we design a multi-branch framework that\nadopts the geodesic distance transform to capture the intensity changes between\nairway lumen and wall. Another reason for the breakages is the intra-class\nimbalance. Since the volume of the peripheral bronchi may be much smaller than\nthe large branches in an input patch, the common segmentation loss is not\nsensitive to the breakages among the distal branches. Therefore, in this paper,\na breakage-sensitive regularization term is designed and can be easily combined\nwith other loss functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly\navailable datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our framework can\ndetect more branches while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 09:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

However, labeling, storing, and\nprocessing a large number of textual data points, e.g., tweets, has remained\nchallenging. On top of that, in applications such as hate speech detection,\nlabeling a sufficiently large dataset containing offensive content can be\nmentally and emotionally taxing for human annotators. Thus, NLP methods that\ncan make the best use of significantly less labeled data points are of great\ninterest. In this paper, we present a novel pool-based active learning method\nthat can be used for the training of large unlabeled corpus with minimum\nannotation cost. For that, we propose to find the dominant sets of local\nclusters in the feature space. These sets represent maximally cohesive\nstructures in the data. Then, the samples that do not belong to any of the\ndominant sets are selected to be used to train the model, as they represent the\nboundaries of the local clusters and are more challenging to classify. Our\nproposed method does not have any parameters to be tuned, making it\ndataset-independent, and it can approximately achieve the same classification\naccuracy as full training data, with significantly fewer data points.\nAdditionally, our method achieves a higher performance in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art active learning strategies. Furthermore, our proposed\nalgorithm is able to incorporate conventional active learning scores, such as\nuncertainty-based scores, into its selection criteria.

Then, each method listed was analyzed, taking various factors\ninto consideration, such as technological requirements, computational ability,\nand adequacy to the requirements. It was concluded that while there are various\nmethods to achieve AGI that could work, such as Human Brain Emulation and\nIntegrated Cognitive Architectures, the most promising method to achieve AGI is\nIntegrated Cognitive Architectures. This is because Human Brain Emulation was\nfound to require scanning technologies that will most likely not be available\nuntil the 2030s, making it unlikely to be created before then. Moreover,\nIntegrated Cognitive Architectures has reduced computational requirements and a\nsuitable functionality for General Intelligence, making it the most likely way\nto achieve AGI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 05:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

Recently, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Ruszink\\'{o} and S\\'{a}rk\\''{o}zy initiated\nthe study of the linear Tur\\'{a}n numbers of acyclic linear triple systems. In\nthis paper, we extend their results to linear quadruple systems. Here, we\nconcentrate on small trees, paths and matchings. For the case of small trees,\nwe find that for a linear tree $T$, $ex^{lin}_{4}(n,T)$ relates to difficult\nproblems on Steiner system $S(2,4,n)$ For example, we show that\n$ex^{lin}_{4}(n, P_4)\\le \\frac{5n}{4}$ with equality holds if and only if the\nlinear quadruple system is the disjoint union of $S(2,4,16)$. Denote by\n$E^{+}_{4}$ the linear tree consisting of three pairwise disjoint quadruples\nand a fourth one intersecting all of them. We prove that\n$12\\lfloor\\frac{n-4}{9}\\rfloor\\le ex^{lin}_{4}(n, E^{+}_4)\\le\n\\frac{14(n-s)}{9}$, where $s$ is the number of vertices in $G$ with degree at\nleast 8. Denote by $M_k$ and $P_k$ the set of $k$ pairwise disjoint quadruples\nand the linear path with $k$ quadruples, respectively. For the case of paths,\nwe show that $ex^{lin}_{4}(n, P_k)\\le 2.5kn$. For the case of matchings, we\nprove that for fixed $k$ and sufficiently large $n$, $ex^{lin}_{4}(n,\nM_k)=g(n,k)$ where $g(n,k$) denotes the maximum number of quadruples that can\nintersect $k-1$ vertices in a linear quadruple system on $n$ vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 14:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 14:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Since OAM requires precise alignment of the\ntransmit and the receive antennas, the electronic beam steering approach has\nbeen proposed for the uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM communication\nsystem to circumvent large performance degradation induced by small antenna\nmisalignment in practical environment. However, in the case of large-angle\nmisalignment, the OAM channel capacity can not be effectively compensated only\nby the electronic beam steering. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid\nmechanical and electronic beam steering scheme, in which mechanical rotating\ndevices controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals as the execution\nunit are utilized to eliminate the large misalignment angle, while electronic\nbeam steering is in charge of the remaining small misalignment angle caused by\nperturbations. Furthermore, due to the interferometry, the receive\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are not uniform at the elements of the receive\nUCA. Therefore, a rotatable UCA structure is proposed for the OAM receiver to\nmaximize the channel capacity, in which the simulated annealing algorithm is\nadopted to obtain the optimal rotation angle at first, then the servo system\nperforms mechanical rotation, at last the electronic beam steering is adjusted\naccordingly. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results validate that\nthe proposed hybrid mechanical and electronic beam steering scheme can\neffectively eliminate the effect of diverse misalignment errors of any\npractical OAM channel and maximize the OAM channel capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 01:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 06:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

Domain experts cannot gain a complete understanding of the\nimplementation of a scientific model if they are not familiar with the code.\nFurthermore, rapid research and development iterations make it challenging to\nkeep up with constantly evolving scientific model codebases.

Our system uses knowledge-driven as well as data-driven\napproaches to identify and extract relevant concepts from code and equations\nfrom textual documents to semantically annotate models using domain\nterminology.

We also\nconducted measurements with a flute, a clarinet, a tuba, and only the tuba's\nmouthpiece. To be able to image and track droplets, we have developed and built\na portable measurement set-up. We have detected droplets with diameters of\napproximately 50 micrometre and above. We found that for a single subject, the\nlargest amount of droplets are produced during singing, but that laughing can\nproduce a comparable number of droplets. Speaking and recitation of poetry do\nnot produce as many droplets. We repeated exercises at varying distances and\nfound that the number of detected droplets decreased rapidly with increasing\ndistance. Most droplets we detected follow a ballistic trajectory, and hit the\nground after a distance of approximately 1 m. In case of the musical\ninstruments, we did not detect droplets exiting a tuba and only few single\ndroplets from a flute and a clarinet. A clarinet usually points downwards, such\nthat droplets follow a downward trajectory and hit the ground after a short\ndistance. The situation was different when the tubist used only the mouthpiece\n(that is, detached from the tuba) during warm-up while partially blocking the\nopening with a finger: in this case, many droplets were ejected from the\nmouthpiece. These followed ballistic trajectories at different speeds, with\nsome droplets exiting the measurement volume. Two important limitations of this\nstudy are that (i) the sample size is very small, such that a statistical\nanalysis is beyond our scope; and (ii) that we cannot draw conclusions about a\npossible risk of infection with COVID-19 when performing any of the said\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 21:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}
