Despite using the native human interface (mouse and keyboard at 20Hz),\nwe show that this behavioral prior has nontrivial zero-shot capabilities and\nthat it can be fine-tuned, with both imitation learning and reinforcement\nlearning, to hard-exploration tasks that are impossible to learn from scratch\nvia reinforcement learning.

The conditions of\npair confinement seem extreme compared to what can be achieved in recent\ntheoretical models. We searched for scenarios minimizing as much as possible\nthe extent and magnitude of diffusion suppression in the halos in J0633+1746\nand B0656+14, and explored the implications on the local positron flux if they\nare applied to all nearby middle-aged pulsars.

While strong diffusion suppression by 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at ~100TeV is required by the data, it is possible to find solutions\nwith diffusion suppression extents as small as 30pc for both objects. If all\nnearby middle-aged pulsars develop such halos, their combined positron flux\nincluding the contribution from Geminga would saturate the >100GeV AMS-02\nmeasurement for injection efficiencies that are much smaller than those\ninferred for the canonical halos in J0633+1746 and B0656+14, and more generally\nwith the values typical of younger pulsar wind nebulae.

Specifically in robotic\nsurgery, data scarcity and imbalance have heavily affected the model accuracy\nand limited the design and deployment of deep learning-based surgical\napplications such as surgical instrument segmentation. Considering this, we\nrethink the surgical instrument segmentation task and propose a one-to-many\ndata generation solution that gets rid of the complicated and expensive process\nof data collection and annotation from robotic surgery. In our method, we only\nutilize a single surgical background tissue image and a few open-source\ninstrument images as the seed images and apply multiple augmentations and\nblending techniques to synthesize amounts of image variations. In addition, we\nalso introduce the chained augmentation mixing during training to further\nenhance the data diversities.

The\nlatter establishes that there is only one non-contextual classical model\ncompatible with quantum theory, the one that trivially identifies the quantum\nstate with the classical state. However, this model requires a breaking of the\nunitary evolution to account for macroscopic realism. Thus, a causal classical\nmodel compatible with the unitary evolution of the quantum state is necessarily\ncontextual at some extent.

This scalability\nissue is mostly caused by the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the\ntotal order of the chain of blocks (and of the operations within each block).\nHowever, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced\napplications of smart-contracts do not require a total order of all the\noperations. Hence, if a more relaxed partial order (instead of a total order)\nis allowed under certain safety conditions, a much higher scalability can be\nachieved. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called\nSetchain, that allows implementing this partial order and increases\nsignificantly blockchain scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set\nobject whose elements are not totally ordered, unlike conventional blockchain\noperations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization\nbarrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest\nelements added. With the Setchain, operations in the same epoch are not\nordered, while operations in different epochs are. We present different\nByzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and\nreport on an empirical evaluation of a direct implementation.

In this\nmanuscript, to simultaneously address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a\nresampling-based procedure that not only lifts the winner's curse in evaluating\nthe best policies observed in a random sample, but also is robust to the\npresence of many covariates. The proposed inference procedure yields accurate\npoint estimates and valid frequentist confidence intervals that achieve the\nexact nominal level as the sample size goes to infinity for multiple best\npolicy effect sizes. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of our\napproach through Monte Carlo experiments and two empirical studies, evaluating\nthe most effective policies in charitable giving and the most beneficial group\nof workers in the National Supported Work program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 17:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 23:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 01:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-25"}

The corresponding coefficients are calculated using linear\nresponse theory up to the order of one loop, and turns out sensitive to the\nin-medium spectral properties of vector bosons, e.g., the width and in-medium\nmass-shift.

The first version to show this potential was the S4\nmodel, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range\ndependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While\nthis has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long\ndependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be\ndifficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS\nshowed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still\npreserve the performance of the original model when using a specific\ninitialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to\nsystematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal\nstate space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all\nSSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is\ncritical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing\nthat the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same\nkernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically\ndescribe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs,\nand perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\nOur final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation\nrequires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all\nsettings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical\ntime-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 17:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2022 17:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

We complement his result by\nshowing that it is NP-complete to decide whether an edge-colored graph contains\ntwo disjoint rainbow spanning trees. Our complexity result holds even for the\nvery special case when the graph is the union of two spanning trees and each\ncolor class contains exactly two edges. As a corollary, we give a negative\nanswer to a question on the decomposition of oriented $k$-partition-connected\ndigraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 18:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

The process of\nconducting SLR is rigorous and well-known; however, most SLR have not followed\nthis process systematically, leading to various problems, including poor\ndocumentation, lack of quality, and difficulty to be reproduced. These problems\nare added to the inherent difficulties in conducting SLR, especially regarding\neffort and time consumption. Several practices (including methods, techniques,\nand tools) have already been experimented with to mitigate such problems.\nStill, it is unclear which practices should be prioritized to reduce such\nproblems and difficulties. Aims: The main goal of this paper is to contribute\nto improving the SLR process being adopted by the community. For that, we\nintroduce the idea of the Maturity Model for SLR process (MM4SLR). Method: We\nsystematically examined the literature searching for practices destined to\nsupport or improve the SLR process. After collecting 84 practices, we analyzed,\ngrouped, and synthesized them into 46 key practices further distributed into 15\nspecific goals. Inspired by the maturity model for software development\nprocess, we also propose five process areas and an initial version of MM4SLR\ncontaining four maturity levels. Results: MM4SLR provides a new view on those\npractices that could be progressively adopted to improve the SLR process.\nMM4SLR could define a pragmatic pathway that guides the adoption of those\npractices, which better fit the reality of who conducts SLR. Conclusion: The\nSLR process is very complex and should be more investigated. We argue that ways\nto better select and adopt the various existing practices are necessary.

Recent advances improve the inference time\nby using complementary data structures yet these methods are ill-suited for\ndynamic scenes and often increase memory consumption. Little has been done to\nreduce the resources required at training time. We propose a method to exploit\nthe redundancy of NeRF's sample-based computations by partially sharing\nevaluations across neighboring sample points.

It is\nespecially important for fracton phases where a combination of topology and\nfractionalization leads to exotic features not seen in other known quantum\nphases. In this paper, we consider the above problem by studying phase\ntransition in the X-cube model in the presence of a non-linear perturbation.\nUsing an analysis of the ground state fidelity and identifying a discontinuity\nin the global entanglement, we show there is a first order quantum phase\ntransition from a type I fracton phase with a highly entangled nature to a\nmagnetized phase. Accordingly, we conclude that the global entanglement, as a\nmeasure of the total quantum correlations in the ground state, can well capture\ncertain features of fracton phase transitions.

It formulates the feedforward control input to\na system as a linear combination of a set of basis functions whose coefficients\nare selected to minimize tracking errors. The basis functions are filtered\nusing a combination of two linear models to predict and minimize the tracking\nerrors. The first model is physics-based and remains unaltered during the\nexecution of the controller, while the second is data-driven and is\ncontinuously updated during the execution of the controller. To ensure its\npracticality and safe learning, the proposed hybrid FBF controller is equipped\nwith the ability to handle delays in data acquisition and to detect impending\ninstability due to its inherent data-driven feedback loop. Its effectiveness is\ndemonstrated via application to vibration compensation of a 3D printer with\nunmodeled linear and nonlinear dynamics.

The main reason can be attributed to the vast generalization gap\nbetween meta-training and meta-test due to the task variance caused by\ndifferent node/class distributions in meta-tasks (i.e., node-level and\nclass-level variance). Therefore, to effectively alleviate the impact of task\nvariance, we propose a task-adaptive node classification framework under the\nfew-shot learning setting.

Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables\nsystems to learn from data and make decisions on new data based on models to\nachieve a given goal. The stochastic nature of AI models makes verification and\nvalidation tasks challenging. Moreover, there are intrinsic biaises in AI\nmodels such as reproductibility bias, selection bias (e.g., races, genders,\ncolor), and reporting bias (i.e., results that do not reflect the reality).\nIncreasingly, there is also a particular attention to the ethical, legal, and\nsocietal impacts of AI.

They also appear to be vulnerable to threats; AI\nsystems can misbehave when untrusted data are given, making them insecure and\nunsafe.

We prove that in\nthe limit, the choice-based Borda count algorithm produces the same top-$K$\nestimate as the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimate method but the\nformer's speed and simplicity brings considerable advantages in practice.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that the counting\nalgorithm is competitive with commonly used ranking algorithms in terms of\naccuracy while being several orders of magnitude faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 22:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

One such carbon-free fuel source that can be\nused for power generation in a gas turbine-based system is ammonia. Ammonia\ncombustion poses challenges due to reduced flame speed and reactivity, which\ncan be alleviated by addition of methane or natural gas. However, NOx emission\nis an important issue, which needs resolution before practical consideration of\nammonia. One of the potential solutions that has been proposed is a two-stage,\nrich-lean combustion process to minimize NOx while ensuring complete reactant\nconsumption. This work evaluates the use of two strategies to widen stability\nlimits for swirl combustors operating on premixed methane-ammonia-air mixtures,\nwhich would facilitate the two-stage combustion approach. The first strategy\ninvolves the use of a distributed fuel injection approach utilizing a novel\nmicro fuel injection swirler while preventing flashback concerns. The second\nstrategy involves use of inlet air preheating to increase flame stability and\ndelay blow-off. Experiments and reactor network simulations are carried out to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the two strategies in expanding combustor\noperability limits. The influence of the proposed strategies on NOx emissions\nare studied and underlying reaction pathways leading to NOx production are\nanalyzed. Results of the study indicate that a distributed fuel injection\nstrategy significantly expands stability limits of a swirl combustor operating\non methane-ammonia-air mixtures. Inlet air preheating provides additional\nexpansion of stability limits; however, this increases NOx production, which is\nundesirable from an emissions standpoint. NOx is found to be significantly\nlower for rich fuel-air mixtures primarily through the effect of NHi reaction\npathways responsible for NO consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 23:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Energies, entropies, critical temperatures, and an\nexcitation frequency are studied and compared to existing results in the\nliterature. These normal modes have been derived analytically for N identical,\nconfined particles from a first-order L=0 group theoretic solution of a\nthree-dimensional Hamiltonian with a general two-body interaction. In previous\nstudies, normal modes were able to describe the unitary regime obtaining ground\nstate energies comparable to benchmark results and thermodynamics quantities in\nexcellent agreement with experiment.

This paper proposes a multimodel-based\ndeep learning framework for short-text multiclass classification with an\nimbalanced and extremely small data set. Our framework mainly includes five\nlayers: The encoder layer uses DISTILBERT to obtain context-sensitive dynamic\nword vectors that are difficult to represent in traditional feature engineering\nmethods. Since the transformer part of this layer is distilled, our framework\nis compressed. Then, we use the next two layers to extract deep semantic\ninformation. The output of the encoder layer is sent to a bidirectional LSTM\nnetwork, and the feature matrix is extracted hierarchically through the LSTM at\nthe word and sentence level to obtain the fine-grained semantic representation.\nAfter that, the max-pooling layer converts the feature matrix into a\nlower-dimensional matrix, preserving only the obvious features. Finally, the\nfeature matrix is taken as the input of a fully connected softmax layer, which\ncontains a function that can convert the predicted linear vector into the\noutput value as the probability of the text in each classification. Extensive\nexperiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approach on an extremely small data set. It retains the\nstate-of-the-art baseline performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy,\nand F1 score, and through the model size, training time, and convergence epoch,\nwe can conclude that our method can be deployed faster and lighter on mobile\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 00:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Current mainstream 3D MHD codes modelling SPIs mostly assume\ninstantaneous thermalization between the previously hot ambient electrons and\nthe newly released cold electrons, which results in underestimation of the\nablation rate if the hot electron thermalization time is comparable or even\nlonger than the fragment flying time. To resolve this doubt, we hereby\ninvestigate the thermalization dynamics and the overall hot-electron impact.\nThe finite-time collisional thermalization of hot-tail electrons in a rapidly\ncooling plasma, as well as the so-called ``self-limiting'' effect are\nconsidered. The former effect tends to deplete the colder population within a\nhot-tail species, while the latter is found to preferentially deplete the\nhigher energy population. The combined result is found to cause an almost\nself-similar decay of the hot electron distribution function, while its shape\ndoes not deviate much from that of Maxwellian distribution and the mean energy\ndoes not change much during the thermalization process. Based on this\nobservation, axisymmetric JOREK D2 SPI simulations were carried out with\nadditional hot-tail contribution to evaluate their overall impact onto the\ninjection assimilation and penetration. It is found that the hot-tail effect\nindeed causes enhanced assimilation and shallower penetration, although the\noverall effect depends on the exact injection configuration, with the slow\ninjection showing negligible hot-tail effect while the fast single\nnon-shattered pellet case shows drastic hot-tail ablation enhancement. For\nITER-like SPI parameters, there is no significant deviation in the total\nassimilation, but some deviation in the injection penetration is observed for\nthe fast injection velocity cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 01:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Chambolle and Pock method)\nis a well-studied algorithm for minimax optimization problems with a bilinear\ninteraction term. Recently, PDHG is used as the base algorithm for a new LP\nsolver PDLP that aims to solve large LP instances by taking advantage of modern\ncomputing resources, such as GPU and distributed system. Most of the previous\nconvergence results of PDHG are either on duality gap or on distance to the\noptimal solution set, which are usually hard to compute during the solving\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a new progress metric for analyzing PDHG,\nwhich we dub infimal sub-differential size (IDS), by utilizing the geometry of\nPDHG iterates. IDS is a natural extension of the gradient norm of smooth\nproblems to non-smooth problems, and it is tied with KKT error in the case of\nLP. Compared to traditional progress metrics for PDHG, IDS always has a finite\nvalue and can be computed only using information of the current solution. We\nshow that IDS monotonically decays, and it has an $\\mathcal O(\\frac{1}{k})$\nsublinear rate for solving convex-concave primal-dual problems, and it has a\nlinear convergence rate if the problem further satisfies a regularity condition\nthat is satisfied by applications such as linear programming, quadratic\nprogramming, TV-denoising model, etc. The simplicity of our analysis and the\nmonotonic decay of IDS suggest that IDS is a natural progress metric to analyze\nPDHG.

Our images\ngenerically display a \"wedding cake\" structure composed of discrete, narrow\nphoton rings (n=1,2,...) stacked on top of broader primary emission that\nsurrounds a central brightness depression of model-dependent size. We find that\nthe \"black hole shadow\" is a model-dependent phenomenon -- even for diffuse,\noptically thin sources -- and should not be regarded as a generic prediction of\ngeneral relativity. At 230 GHz, the n=1 ring is always visible, but the n=2\nring is sometimes suppressed due to absorption. At 345 GHz, the medium is\noptically thinner and the n=2 ring displays clear signatures in both the image\nand visibility domains, identifying this frequency as more promising for future\nspace-VLBI measurements of the photon ring shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 04:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 05:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Referenced\nas one of the most difficult optimization problems, Golay wrote that it is a\n\"challenging and charming problem\". His publications on this problem spanned\nmore than 20 years. Golay himself introduced one beneficial class of sequences,\ncalled skew-symmetric sequences, or finite binary sequences with odd lengths\nwith alternate autocorrelation values equal to 0. Their sieving construction\ngreatly reduces the computational efforts of finding binary sequences with odd\nlengths and high MF. Having this in mind, the majority of papers to be found in\nthe literature are focused solely on this class, preferring them over binary\nsequences with even lengths. In this work, a new class of finite binary\nsequences with even lengths with alternate autocorrelation absolute values\nequal to 1 is presented. We show that the MF values of the new class are\nclosely related to the MF values of adjacent classes of skew-symmetric\nsequences.

One\nof the major factors which limits the throughput in wireless communications\nnetworks is the accuracy of the time synchronization between the nodes in the\nnetwork, as a higher throughput requires higher synchronization accuracy.\nExisting time synchronization schemes, and particularly, methods based on\npulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs), which are the focus of the current work, have\nthe advantage of simple implementation and achieve high accuracy when the nodes\nare closely located, yet tend to achieve poor synchronization performance for\ndistant nodes. In this study, we propose a robust PCO-based time\nsynchronization algorithm which retains the simple structure of existing\napproaches while operating reliably and converging quickly for both distant and\nclosely located nodes. This is achieved by augmenting PCO-based synchronization\nwith deep learning tools that are trainable in a distributed manner, thus\nallowing the nodes to train their neural network component of the\nsynchronization algorithm without requiring additional exchange of information\nor central coordination. The numerical results show that our proposed deep\nlearning-aided scheme is notably robust to propagation delays resulting from\ndeployments over large areas, and to relative clock frequency offsets. It is\nalso shown that the proposed approach rapidly attains full (i.e., clock\nfrequency and phase) synchronization for all nodes in the wireless network,\nwhile the classic model-based implementation does not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 06:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In this paper, we propose a Cross-channel Feedback\nmemOry Network (CFO-Net) to leverage the emotional feedback to iteratively\nmeasure the potential benefits of strategies and incorporate them into the\ncontextual-aware dialogue information. Specifically, CFO-Net designs a feedback\nmemory module, including strategy pool and feedback pool, to obtain\nemotion-aware strategy representation. The strategy pool aims to store\nhistorical strategies and the feedback pool is to obtain updated strategy\nweight based on feedback emotional information. Furthermore, a cross-channel\nfusion predictor is developed to make a mutual interaction between the\nemotion-aware strategy representation and the contextual-aware dialogue\ninformation for strategy recognition.

Some recent works have\nempirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a\nsignificant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have\nsystematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to\nbiased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the\nstructure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely\nlimits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In\nthis paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias\nin GNNs.

Water maser\nflares provide an invaluable insight into ejection events associated with\naccretion bursts. Although the short timescale of the 22 GHz water maser flare\nmade it impossible to carry out a very long baseline interferometry\nobservation, we could track it with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).\nThe evolution of the spatial structure of the 22 GHz water masers and their\nassociation with the continuum sources in the region is studied with the VLA\nduring two epochs, pre- and post-H2O maser flare. A drastic change in the\ndistribution of the water masers is revealed: in contrast to the four maser\ngroups detected during epoch I, only two newly formed clusters are detected\nduring epoch II. The 22 GHz water masers associated with the bursting source\nMM1 changed in morphology and emission velocity extent. Clear evidence of the\ninfluence of the accretion burst on the ejection from G358.93-0.03-MM1 is\npresented. The accretion event has also potentially affected a region with a\nradius of ~2'' (~13 500 AU at 6.75 kpc), suppressing water masers associated\nwith other point sources in this region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 07:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

This article offers a multi-output\nGaussian process (MoGP) model that infers functions for attributes using\nmultiple aggregate datasets of respective granularities. In the proposed model,\nthe function for each attribute is assumed to be a dependent GP modeled as a\nlinear mixing of independent latent GPs. We design an observation model with an\naggregation process for each attribute; the process is an integral of the GP\nover the corresponding support. We also introduce a prior distribution of the\nmixing weights, which allows a knowledge transfer across domains (e.g., cities)\nby sharing the prior. This is advantageous in such a situation where the\nspatially aggregated dataset in a city is too coarse to interpolate; the\nproposed model can still make accurate predictions of attributes by utilizing\naggregate datasets in other cities. The inference of the proposed model is\nbased on variational Bayes, which enables one to learn the model parameters\nusing the aggregate datasets from multiple domains.

Inquiry-based learning is characterized by the\nfundamental premise that learners should be allowed to learn 'new to them'\nmathematics without being taught.

Models with interactive fixed effects are well\nstudied in the low-dimensional case where the number of parameters to be\nestimated is small.

In this paper, we develop new econometric\nmethods for the estimation of high-dimensional panel data models with\ninteractive fixed effects. Our estimator is based on similar ideas as the very\npopular common correlated effects (CCE) estimator which is frequently used in\nthe low-dimensional case. We thus call our estimator a high-dimensional CCE\nestimator. We derive theory for the estimator both in the large-T-case, where\nthe time series length T tends to infinity, and in the small-T-case, where T is\na fixed natural number. The theoretical analysis of the paper is complemented\nby a simulation study which evaluates the finite sample performance of the\nestimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 08:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Dual-unitary models are\nexamples in one spatial dimension where this is possible. These brick-wall\nquantum circuits consist of local gates, which remain unitary not only in time,\nbut also when interpreted as evolutions along the spatial directions. However,\nthis setting of unitary dynamics does not directly apply to real-world systems\ndue to their imperfect isolation, and it is thus imperative to consider the\nimpact of noise to dual-unitary dynamics and its exact solvability.\n  In this work we generalise the ideas of dual-unitarity to obtain exact\nsolutions in noisy quantum circuits, where each unitary gate is substituted by\na local quantum channel. Exact solutions are obtained by demanding that the\nnoisy gates yield a valid quantum channel not only in time, but also when\ninterpreted as evolutions along one or both of the spatial directions and\npossibly backwards in time. This gives rise to new families of models that\nsatisfy different combinations of unitality constraints along the space and\ntime directions. We provide exact solutions for the spatio-temporal correlation\nfunctions, spatial correlations after a quantum quench, and the structure of\nsteady states for these families of models. We show that noise unbiased around\nthe dual-unitary family leads to exactly solvable models, even if\ndual-unitarity is strongly violated. We prove that any channel unital in both\nspace and time directions can be written as an affine combination of a\nparticular class of dual-unitary gates.

Existing studies of adversarial training have made great progress\nagainst this challenge. As a typical trait, they often assume that the class\ndistribution is overall balanced. However, long-tail datasets are ubiquitous in\na wide spectrum of applications, where the amount of head class instances is\nlarger than the tail classes. Under such a scenario, AUC is a much more\nreasonable metric than accuracy since it is insensitive toward class\ndistribution. Motivated by this, we present an early trial to explore\nadversarial training methods to optimize AUC. The main challenge lies in that\nthe positive and negative examples are tightly coupled in the objective\nfunction. As a direct result, one cannot generate adversarial examples without\na full scan of the dataset. To address this issue, based on a concavity\nregularization scheme, we reformulate the AUC optimization problem as a saddle\npoint problem, where the objective becomes an instance-wise function. This\nleads to an end-to-end training protocol. Furthermore, we provide a convergence\nguarantee of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis differs from the existing\nstudies since the algorithm is asked to generate adversarial examples by\ncalculating the gradient of a min-max problem. Finally, the extensive\nexperimental results show the performance and robustness of our algorithm in\nthree long-tail datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 09:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

We\ndescribe the processing of the Gaia spectral data of SSOs, explaining both the\ncriteria used to select the subset of asteroid spectra published in Gaia DR3,\nand the different steps of our internal validation procedures. In order to\nfurther assess the quality of Gaia SSO reflectance spectra, we carried out\nexternal validation against SSO reflectance spectra obtained from ground-based\nand space-borne telescopes and available in the literature. For each selected\nSSO, an epoch reflectance was computed by dividing the calibrated spectrum\nobserved by the BP/RP at each transit on the focal plane by the mean spectrum\nof a solar analogue. The latter was obtained by averaging the Gaia spectral\nmeasurements of a selected sample of stars known to have very similar spectra\nto that of the Sun. Finally, a mean of the epoch reflectance spectra was\ncalculated in 16 spectral bands for each SSO. The agreement between Gaia mean\nreflectance spectra and those available in the literature is good for bright\nSSOs, regardless of their taxonomic spectral class. We identify an increase in\nthe spectral slope of S-type SSOs with increasing phase angle. Moreover, we\nshow that the spectral slope increases and the depth of the 1 um absorption\nband decreases for increasing ages of S-type asteroid families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 09:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel architecture MULTI-FLGAN to solve the problem of low-quality\nimages, mode collapse and instability for non-iid datasets. Our results show\nthat MULTI-FLGAN is four times as stable and performant (i.e. high inception\nscore) on average over 20 clients compared to baseline FLGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 09:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

K-medoids or\nPartitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is commonly used to cluster sequences since\nit supports alignment-based distances, and the k-centers being actual data\nitems helps with cluster interpretability. However, offline k-medoids has no\nsupport for concept drift, while also being prohibitively expensive for\nclustering data streams. We therefore propose SECLEDS, a streaming variant of\nthe k-medoids algorithm with constant memory footprint. SECLEDS has two unique\nproperties: i) it uses multiple medoids per cluster, producing stable\nhigh-quality clusters, and ii) it handles concept drift using an intuitive\nMedoid Voting scheme for approximating cluster distances. Unlike existing\nadaptive algorithms that create new clusters for new concepts, SECLEDS follows\na fundamentally different approach, where the clusters themselves evolve with\nan evolving stream. Using real and synthetic datasets, we empirically\ndemonstrate that SECLEDS produces high-quality clusters regardless of drift,\nstream size, data dimensionality, and number of clusters.

Our\nsecond result ventures into significantly sparser graphs $G$; it delivers an\nalmost tight bound on the size of the random perturbation required to ensure\npancyclicity a.a.s., assuming $\\delta(G) = \\Omega \\left((\\alpha(G) \\log n)^2\n\\right)$ and $\\alpha(G) \\delta(G) = O(n)$.\n  Assuming the correctness of Chv\\'atal's toughness conjecture, allows for the\nmitigation of the condition $\\alpha(G) = O \\left(\\delta^2 n \\right)$ imposed\nabove, by requiring $\\alpha(G) = O(\\delta(G))$ instead; our third result\ndetermines, for a wide range of values of $\\delta(G)$, the correct order of\nmagnitude of the size of the random perturbation required to ensure the a.a.s.\npancyclicity of $G$.\n  For the emergence of nearly spanning cycles, our fourth result determines,\nunder milder conditions, the correct order of magnitude of the size of the\nrandom perturbation required to ensure that a.a.s. $G$ contains such a cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 10:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

However, the Gaia-RVS\nspectral window between 846 and 870 nm contains few DIBs, the strong DIB at 862\nnm being the only convincingly confirmed one. Here we attempt to confirm the\nexistence of a broad DIB around 864.8 nm and estimate its characteristics using\nthe stacked Gaia-RVS spectra of a large number of stars. We study the\ncorrelations between the two DIBs at 862 nm and 864.8 nm, as well as the\ninterstellar extinction. We obtained spectra of the interstellar medium\nabsorption by subtracting the stellar components using templates constructed\nfrom real spectra at high Galactic latitudes with low extinctions. We then\nstacked the ISM spectra in Galactic coordinates, pixelized by the HEALPix\nscheme, to measure the DIBs. The stacked spectrum is modeled by the profiles of\nthe two DIBs, Gaussian for $\\lambda$862 and Lorentzian for $\\lambda$864.8, and\na linear continuum.

Perhaps surprisingly, our arguments involve\nthe construction of suitable quasimorphisms on the Seifert pieces, in order to\nconstruct actions on quasi-lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 12:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

This encompasses uniform demands such as the\nMinimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem ($k$-ECSS), as well as\nnonuniform demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem. A weakness of\nthese formulations, though, is that we are not able to ask for fault-tolerance\nlarger than the connectivity. We introduce and study new variants of these\nproblems under a notion of relative fault-tolerance. Informally, we require not\nthat two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults (as in the\nclassical setting), but that two nodes are connected if there are a bounded\nnumber of faults and the two nodes are connected in the underlying graph\npost-faults. That is, the subgraph we build must \"behave\" identically to the\nunderlying graph with respect to connectivity after bounded faults.\n  We define and introduce these problems, and provide the first approximation\nalgorithms: a $(1+4/k)$-approximation for the unweighted relative version of\n$k$-ECSS, a $2$-approximation for the weighted relative version of $k$-ECSS,\nand a $27/4$-approximation for the special case of Relative Survivable Network\nDesign with only a single demand with a connectivity requirement of $3$. To\nobtain these results, we introduce a number of technical ideas that may of\nindependent interest. First, we give a generalization of Jain's iterative\nrounding analysis that works even when the cut-requirement function is not\nweakly supermodular, but instead satisfies a weaker definition we introduce and\nterm local weak supermodularity. Second, we prove a structure theorem and\ndesign an approximation algorithm utilizing a new decomposition based on\nimportant separators, which are structures commonly used in fixed-parameter\nalgorithms that have not commonly been used in approximation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 12:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Nucleosynthesis\ntypically requires physical conditions of high temperatures and densities.\nThese are found in the Big Bang, in the interiors of stars, and in explosions\nwith their compressional shocks and high neutrino and neutron fluxes. Many\ndifferent tools are available to disentangle the composition of cosmic matter,\nin material of extraterrestrial origins such as cosmic rays, meteorites,\nstardust grains, lunar and terrestrial sediments, and through astronomical\nobservations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding cosmic\nabundances and their evolution requires combining such measurements with\napproaches of astrophysical, nuclear theories and laboratory experiments, and\nexploiting additional cosmic messengers, such as neutrinos and gravitational\nwaves. Recent years have seen significant progress in almost all these fields;\nthey are presented in this review. Models are required to explore nuclear\nfusion of heavier elements. These have been confirmed by observations of\nnucleosynthesis products in the ejecta of stars and supernovae, as captured by\nstardust grains and by characteristic lines in spectra seen from these objects,\nand also by ejecta material captured by Earth over millions of years in\nsediments. All these help to piece together how cosmic materials are\ntransported in interstellar space and re-cycled into and between generations of\nstars. Our description of cosmic compositional evolution needs observational\nsupport, as it rests on several assumptions that appear challenged.

A recent development in this direction is a declarative probabilistic\nprogramming language, proposed by Barany et al. in 2017, which operates on\nstandard relational databases. In particular, Barany et al. proposed generative\nDatalog, a probabilistic extension of Datalog that allows sampling from\ndiscrete probability distributions. Intuitively, the output of a generative\nDatalog program P on an input database D is a probability space over the\nminimal models of D and P, the so-called possible outcomes. This is a natural\ngeneralization of the (deterministic) semantics of Datalog, where the output of\na program on a database is their unique minimal model. A natural question to\nask is how generative Datalog can be enriched with the useful feature of\nnegation, which in turn leads to a strictly more expressive declarative\nprobabilistic programming language. In particular, the challenging question is\nhow the probabilistic semantics of generative Datalog with negation can be\nrobustly defined. Our goal is to provide an answer to this question by\ninterpreting negation according to the stable model semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 12:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

This work aims at constraining the masses and separations of potential\nsubstellar companions to five accelerating stars (HIP 1481, HIP 88399, HIP\n96334, HIP 30314 and HIP 116063) using multiple data sets acquired with\ndifferent techniques. Methods. Our targets were originally observed as part of\nthe SPHERE/SHINE survey, and radial velocity (RV) archive data were also\navailable for four of the five objects. No companions were originally detected\nin any of these data sets, but the presence of significant proper motion\nanomalies (PMa) for all the stars strongly suggested the presence of a\ncompanion. Combining the information from the PMa with the limits derived from\nthe RV and SPHERE data, we were able to put constraints on the characteristics\nof the unseen companions. Results. Our analysis led to relatively strong\nconstraints for both HIP 1481 and HIP 88399, narrowing down the companion\nmasses to 2-5 M_Jup and 3-5 M_Jup and separations within 2-15 au and 3-9 au,\nrespectively. Because of the large age uncertainties for HIP 96334, the poor\nobserving conditions for the SPHERE epochs of HIP 30314 and the lack of RV data\nfor HIP 116063, the results for these targets were not as well defined, but we\nwere still able to constrain the properties of the putative companions within a\nreasonable confidence level. Conclusions. For all five targets, our analysis\nhas revealed that the companions responsible for the PMa signal would be well\nwithin reach for future instruments planned for the ELT (e.g., MICADO), which\nwould easily achieve the required contrast and angular resolution. Our results\ntherefore represent yet another confirmation of the power of multi-technique\napproaches for both the discovery and characterisation of planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 13:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

A ROM captures an invariant subset of the observed dynamics.\nWe find that there are four ways a physical system can be related to a\nmathematical model: invariant foliations, invariant manifolds, autoencoders and\nequation-free models. Identification of invariant manifolds and equation-free\nmodels require closed-loop manipulation of the system. Invariant foliations and\nautoencoders can also use off-line data. Only invariant foliations and\ninvariant manifolds can identify ROMs, the rest identify complete models.\nTherefore, the common case of identifying a ROM from existing data can only be\nachieved using invariant foliations.\n  Finding an invariant foliation requires approximating high-dimensional\nfunctions. For function approximation, we use polynomials with compressed\ntensor coefficients, whose complexity increases linearly with increasing\ndimensions. An invariant manifold can also be found as the fixed leaf of a\nfoliation. This only requires us to resolve the foliation in a small\nneighbourhood of the invariant manifold, which greatly simplifies the process.\nCombining an invariant foliation with the corresponding invariant manifold\nprovides an accurate ROM. We analyse the ROM in case of a focus type\nequilibrium, typical in mechanical systems. The nonlinear coordinate system\ndefined by the invariant foliation or the invariant manifold distorts\ninstantaneous frequencies and damping ratios, which we correct. Through\nexamples we illustrate the calculation of invariant foliations and manifolds,\nand at the same time show that Koopman eigenfunctions and autoencoders fail to\ncapture accurate ROMs under the same conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 13:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 01:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 10:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Submitted to Statistical Methods in Medical Research in\n  October 2021","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"stat.ME","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"  Background: Existing guidelines for handling missing data are generally not\nconsistent with the goals of prediction modelling, where missing data can occur\nat any stage of the model pipeline. Multiple imputation (MI), often heralded as\nthe gold standard approach, can be challenging to apply in the clinic. Clearly,\nthe outcome cannot be used to impute data at prediction time. Regression\nimputation (RI) may offer a pragmatic alternative in the prediction context,\nthat is simpler to apply in the clinic. Moreover, the use of missing indicators\ncan handle informative missingness, but it is currently unknown how well they\nperform within CPMs. Methods: We performed a simulation study where data were\ngenerated under various missing data mechanisms to compare the predictive\nperformance of CPMs developed using both imputation methods. We consider\ndeployment scenarios where missing data is permitted/prohibited, and develop\nmodels that use/omit the outcome during imputation and include/omit missing\nindicators. Results: When complete data must be available at deployment, our\nfindings were in line with widely used recommendations; that the outcome should\nbe used to impute development data under MI, yet omitted under RI. When\nimputation is applied at deployment, omitting the outcome from the imputation\nat development was preferred. Missing indicators improved model performance in\nsome specific cases, but can be harmful when missingness is dependent on the\noutcome. Conclusion: We provide evidence that commonly taught principles of\nhandling missing data via MI may not apply to CPMs, particularly when data can\nbe missing at deployment. In such settings, RI and missing indicator methods\ncan (marginally) outperform MI. As shown, the performance of the missing data\nhandling method must be evaluated on a study-by-study basis, and should be\nbased on whether missing data are allowed at deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 13:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In waterfall RS, when a user finishes\nbrowsing a page, the edge (e.g., mobile phones) would send a request to the\ncloud server to get a new page of recommendations, known as the paging request\nmechanism. RSs typically put a large number of items into one page to reduce\nexcessive resource consumption from numerous paging requests, which, however,\nwould diminish the RSs' ability to timely renew the recommendations according\nto users' real-time interest and lead to a poor user experience. Intuitively,\ninserting additional requests inside pages to update the recommendations with a\nhigher frequency can alleviate the problem. However, previous attempts,\nincluding only non-adaptive strategies (e.g., insert requests uniformly), would\neventually lead to resource overconsumption.

Hence it is usually crucial\nto identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion\nobservations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice,\nsource localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely\nchallenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph\ndiffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization\nmethods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the\nuncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming\nchallenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization\nis hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion\nsources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the\ngeneralization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed.\nTo solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source\nLocalization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion\nsources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a\nprobabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along\nwith deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution\nfor quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the\nsource-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion\nsources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that\nintegrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the\nmodel to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns.

These experiments are based on the assumption that\nunder magnetic field, ballistic current can have a Hall effect while the shift\ncurrent cannot, which is from some energy-scale arguments and has never been\nproven. A recent work [Phys. Rev. B 103, 195203 (2021)] using quantum transport\nformalism achieves a conclusion that shift current indeed has a Hall current,\nseemingly contradicting the previous assumption and making the situation more\nconfusing. Moreover, the behavior of BPVE under strong magnetic field is still\nunexplored. In this Letter, using a minimal 2D tight-binding model, we carry\nout a systematic numerical study of the BPVE under weak and strong magnetic\nfield by treating the field in a non-perturbative way. Our model clearly shows\nthe appearance of the magnetically-induced ballistic current along the\ntransverse direction, which agrees with the previous predictions, and\ninterestingly a sizable longitudinal response of the shift current is also\nobserved, a phenomenon that is not captured by any existing theories where the\nmagnetic field is treated perturbatively. More surprisingly, drastically\ndifferent shift current is found in the strong-field regime, and the evolution\nfrom weak to strong field resembles a phase transition. We hope that our work\ncould resolve the debate over the behavior of BPVE under magnetic field, and\nthe strong-field behavior of shift current is expected to inspire more studies\non the relation between nonlinear optics and quantum geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 14:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

This work proposes a framework for\ndecentralized multi-agent systems to improve the implicit coordination\ncapabilities in search and pursuit. We model a self-organizing system as a\npartially observable Markov game (POMG) featured by large-scale,\ndecentralization, partial observation, and noncommunication. The proposed\ndistributed algorithm: fuzzy self-organizing cooperative coevolution (FSC2) is\nthen leveraged to resolve the three challenges in multi-target SOP: distributed\nself-organizing search (SOS), distributed task allocation, and distributed\nsingle-target pursuit. FSC2 includes a coordinated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (MARL) method that enables homogeneous agents to learn\nnatural SOS patterns. Additionally, we propose a fuzzy-based distributed task\nallocation method, which locally decomposes multi-target SOP into several\nsingle-target pursuit problems. The cooperative coevolution principle is\nemployed to coordinate distributed pursuers for each single-target pursuit\nproblem. Therefore, the uncertainties of inherent partial observation and\ndistributed decision-making in the POMG can be alleviated. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that by decomposing the SOP task, FSC2 achieves superior\nperformance compared with other implicit coordination policies fully trained by\ngeneral MARL algorithms. The scalability of FSC2 is proved that up to 2048 FSC2\nagents perform efficient multi-target SOP with almost 100 percent capture\nrates.

In this paper, we investigate how to allocate limited resources\nto {locally interacting} communities in a way to maximize a pertinent notion of\nequitability. In particular, we look at the dynamic setting where the\nallocation is repeated across multiple periods (e.g., yearly), the local\ncommunities evolve in the meantime (driven by the provided allocation), and the\nallocations are modulated by feedback coming from the communities themselves.\nWe employ recent mathematical tools stemming from data-driven feedback online\noptimization, by which communities can learn their (possibly unknown)\nevolution, satisfaction, as well as they can share information with the\ndeciding bodies. We design dynamic policies that converge to an allocation that\nmaximize equitability in the long term.

One of the key empirical takeaways from our\nsetting is that long-term equitability is fragile, in the sense that it can be\neasily lost when deciding bodies weigh in other factors (e.g., equality in\nallocation) in the allocation strategy. Moreover, a naive compromise, while not\nproviding significant advantage to the communities, can promote inequality in\nsocial outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Accurately segmented organ templates are also hard to\nobtain, particularly in cardiac SPECT imaging, due to the lack of hybrid\nSPECT/CT scanners with high-end CT and associated motion artifacts. Slight\nmis-registration/mis-segmentation would result in severe degradation in image\nquality after PVC. In this work, we develop a deep-learning-based method for\nfast cardiac SPECT PVC without anatomical information and associated organ\nsegmentation. The proposed network involves a densely-connected\nmulti-dimensional dynamic mechanism, allowing the convolutional kernels to be\nadapted based on the input images, even after the network is fully trained.\nIntramyocardial blood volume (IMBV) is introduced as an additional\nclinical-relevant loss function for network optimization. The proposed network\ndemonstrated promising performance on 28 canine studies acquired on a GE\nDiscovery NM/CT 570c dedicated cardiac SPECT scanner with a 64-slice CT using\nTechnetium-99m-labeled red blood cells. This work showed that the proposed\nnetwork with densely-connected dynamic mechanism produced superior results\ncompared with the same network without such mechanism. Results also showed that\nthe proposed network without anatomical information could produce images with\nstatistically comparable IMBV measurements to the images generated by\nanatomical-guided PVC methods, which could be helpful in clinical translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 17:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

It can adjust the number of layers in each\nblock at different curve positions, so it can focus on important positions of\nthe curve (e.g.: Raman peak), and accurately allocate the appropriate\ncomputational budget based on task performance and computing resources. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to conduct optimization\nby adaptive inference for spectral detection under the IoT platform. We\nconducted many experiments, the experimental results show that our proposed\nmethod can achieve higher performance with less computational budget than\nexisting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 09:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

In particular, servers use automatic Density-based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) combined with S2PC to cluster\nthe benign majority without acquiring sensitive personal information.\nMeanwhile, clients build dual models and perform test-based distance\ncontrolling to adjust their local models toward the global one to achieve\npersonalizing. Our framework is automatic and adaptive that servers/clients\ndon't need to tune the parameters during the training. In addition, our\nframework leverages Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC) operations, including\nmultiplications, additions, and comparison, where costly operations, like\ndivision and square root, are not required. Evaluations are carried out on some\nconventional datasets from the image classification field. The result shows\nthat FLVoogd can effectively reject malicious uploads in most scenarios;\nmeanwhile, it avoids data leakage from the server-side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 08:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

While physicians have always\nhad to carefully consider the ethical background and implications of their\nactions, detailed deliberations around fast-moving technological progress may\nnot have kept up. We use a common but key challenge in healthcare interactions,\nthe disclosure of bad news (likely imminent death), to illustrate how the\nphilosophical framework of the 'Felicific Calculus' developed in the 18th\ncentury by Jeremy Bentham, may have a timely quasi-quantitative application in\nthe age of AI.

The theories we study are modelled on (co)\ntangent Lorentz bundles (i.e. eight dimensional phase spaces) with a star\nproduct structure determined by R-flux deformations in string theory. The\nnonassociative vacuum Einstein equations involve real and complex effective\nsources with coefficients which are proportional to the Planck and string\nconstants or their products. We develop the anholonomic frame and connection\ndeformation method and prove that such systems of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations can be decoupled and integrated in general form for a\ngeneric off-diagonal ansatz for symmetric and non-symmetric metrics. The\ncoefficients of such metrics may depend on all phase space coordinates\n(space-time coordinates plus energy-momentum). Conditions are given when the\ngenerating and integration functions and effective sources define two classes\nof physically important exact and parametric solutions with R-flux sources\nrelated via nonlinear symmetries to effective cosmological constants: (1) 6D\nTangherlini BHs, which are star product and R-flux distorted to\nquasi-stationary configurations and 8D black ellipsoids (BEs) and BHs; (2)\nnonassocitative space-time and co-fiber space double BH and/or BE\nconfigurations generalizing Schwarzschild - de Sitter metrics. We argue that\nthe concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is applicable only for very special\nclasses of nonassociative BHs encoding conventional horizons and (anti) de\nSitter configurations. Finally, we show how analogs of the relativistic G.\nPerelman geometric thermodynamic variables can be defined and computed for\ngeneral classes of off-diagonal solutions encoding nonassociative R-flux\ndeformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 04:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

It is not possible to\ncapture the terrain pattern and requires interpolation and extrapolation for\nconformal mapping of spatial coordinates for generation of terrain model. The\ndiscrete data is mapped through a function set whose domain returns the\nanalytic test in Riemann map. The algorithm adopted in analysis for such\nmapping does not have a certainty score or probability of degree of correctness\nconforming to the physical landscape of shadow zones. The aim of the paper is\nto establish a generator of certainty degree of the mapping along with a\ncontinuous terrain model generator. The confirmed mapping of terrain presents a\ncontinuous spatial coordinate set which form the boundary of the shadow zone\nwith discrete spatial coordinates. The discrete set is normalized in Gaussian\ndistribution through a Poisson distribution transition. The continuous data set\nis represented by Laurentian series in which the function will be analytic and\ncan be mapped to Riemann surface with singularities within the annulus and\noutside the annulus of approximate space sub set (Euclidean space).The\nsingularities will be discarded through Picard's theorem and analytic test at\npoles with Cauchy's residual theorem is done. The resulting set of spatial\ncoordinates will restructure within Riemann number sphere which will be mapped\non the plane as stereographic projection. The Gaussian distribution which forms\nthe basis of analysis will provide with the tool for generating the probability\nof certainty of every terrain model idealised to conform to the physical\nlandscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 21:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Various\nservices such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service\n(PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) are offered by cloud computing to\nprovide compute, network, and storage capabilities to the cloud users utilizing\nthe pay-per-usage approach. Resource allocation is a prior solution to address\nvarious demanding situations like the under/overload handling, resource\nwastage, load balancing, Quality-of-Services (QoS) violations, VM migration and\nmany more. The primary aim of Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is mapping of\nVirtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines (PMs), such that the PMs may be\nutilized to their maximum efficiency, where the already active VMs are not to\nbe interrupted. It provides a list of live VM migrations that must be\naccomplished to get the optimum solution and reduces energy consumption to a\nlarger extent. The inefficient VMP leads to wastage of resources, excessive\nenergy consumption and also increase overall operational cost of the data\ncenter. On this context, this article provides an extensive survey of resource\nmanagement schemes in cloud environment. A conceptual scheme for resource\nmanagement, grouping of current machine learning based resource allocation\nstrategies, and fundamental problems of ineffective distribution of physical\nresources are analyzed. Thereafter, a complete survey of existing techniques in\nmachine learning based mechanisms in the field of cloud resource management are\nexplained. Ultimately, the paper explores and concludes distinct approaching\nchallenges and future research guidelines associated to resource management in\ncloud environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 13:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-26"}
