Although 5G\ncan offer numerous benefits, security and privacy issues still need to be\naddressed. For example, the inclusion of small cell networks (SCN) into 5G\nbrings the network closer to the connected users, providing a better quality of\nservices (QoS), resulting in a significant increase in the number of Handover\nprocedures (HO), which will affect the security, latency and efficiency of the\nnetwork. It is then crucial to design a scheme that supports seamless handovers\nthrough secure authentication to avoid the consequences of SCN. To address this\nissue, this article proposes a secure region-based handover scheme with user\nanonymity and an efficient revocation mechanism that supports seamless\nconnectivity for SCNs in 5G. In this context, we introduce three\nprivacy-preserving authentication protocols, i.e., initial authentication\nprotocol, intra-region handover protocol and inter-region handover protocol,\nfor dealing with three communication scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first paper to consider the privacy and security in both the\nintra-region and inter-region handover scenarios in 5G communication.

While the field of algorithmic fairness has developed primarily around\nnotions of treating like individuals alike, we instead explore the concept of\nvertical equity -- appropriately accounting for relevant differences across\nindividuals -- which is a central component of fairness in many public policy\nsettings. Applied to the design of the U.S. individual income tax system,\nvertical equity relates to the fair allocation of tax and enforcement burdens\nacross taxpayers of different income levels. Through a unique collaboration\nwith the Treasury Department and IRS, we use access to anonymized individual\ntaxpayer microdata, risk-selected audits, and random audits from 2010-14 to\nstudy vertical equity in tax administration. In particular, we assess how the\nuse of modern machine learning methods for selecting audits may affect vertical\nequity. First, we show how the use of more flexible machine learning\n(classification) methods -- as opposed to simpler models -- shifts audit\nburdens from high to middle-income taxpayers. Second, we show that while\nexisting algorithmic fairness techniques can mitigate some disparities across\nincome, they can incur a steep cost to performance. Third, we show that the\nchoice of whether to treat risk of underreporting as a classification or\nregression problem is highly consequential. Moving from classification to\nregression models to predict underreporting shifts audit burden substantially\ntoward high income individuals, while increasing revenue. Last, we explore the\nrole of differential audit cost in shaping the audit distribution. We show that\na narrow focus on return-on-investment can undermine vertical equity.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a new self-supervised masked learning method named\nOccupancy-MAE, specifically designed for large-scale outdoor LiDAR points. We\nleverage the gradually sparse occupancy structure of large-scale outdoor LiDAR\npoint clouds and introduce a range-aware random masking strategy and a pretext\ntask of occupancy prediction.

The success of this task hinges on the ability to correlate changes\nin the parameter to changes in the system response $\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$ (i.e.,\nchanges in the measurement outcomes). For simple cases the form of\n$\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$ is known, but the same cannot be said for realistic\nscenarios, as no general closed-form expression exists. In this work we present\nan inference-based scheme for QS. We show that, for a general class of unitary\nfamilies of encoding, $\\mathcal{R}(\\theta)$ can be fully characterized by only\nmeasuring the system response at $2n+1$ parameters. In turn, this allows us to\ninfer the value of an unknown parameter given the measured response, as well as\nto determine the sensitivity of the sensing scheme, which characterizes its\noverall performance. We show that inference error is, with high probability,\nsmaller than $\\delta$, if one measures the system response with a number of\nshots that scales only as $\\Omega(\\log^3(n)/\\delta^2)$. Furthermore, the\nframework presented can be broadly applied as it remains valid for arbitrary\nprobe states and measurement schemes, and, even holds in the presence of\nquantum noise. We also discuss how to extend our results beyond unitary\nfamilies. Finally, to showcase our method we implement it for a QS task on real\nquantum hardware, and in numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 17:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

One is completely\ncloud/haze free spanning a wide temperature range, while the other population,\nidentified as ``Partial cloud/hazes'', follows a trend from mostly cloudy/hazy\naround 500~K to mostly clear at $\\sim$1500~K. We also find that a partially\ntransparent aerosol component is frequently present and that it is typically\nvertically distributed throughout the atmospheric column. Our findings also\nsuggest that while clouds and hazes are common in exoplanet atmospheres, the\nmajority of planets have some level of detectable spectral modulation.\nAdditionally, the empirical trend that clouds and hazes are minimized at\n1460.86K$^{+316}_{-405}$ revealed in our catalog has predictive utility for\nmodelling the performance of large-scale transiting exoplanets survey, such as\nplanned with the Ariel mission. This trend can also be used for making a\nprobability-based forecast of spectral modulation for a given source in the\ncontext of future JWST observations. Future observations including the optical\nand/or a broader spectral coverage may be useful to further quantify the trend\nreported here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 16:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

The most important\nquestion in this field concerns the relative contributions of bulk and surface\nstates to the spin torque, a matter that remains incompletely understood.\nWhereas the surface state contribution has been extensively studied, the\ncontribution due to the bulk states has received comparatively little\nattention. Here we study spin torques due to TI bulk states and show that: (i)\nThere is no spin-orbit torque due to the bulk states on a homogeneous\nmagnetisation, in contrast to the surface states, which give rise to a\nspin-orbit torque via the well-known Edelstein effect. (ii) The bulk states\ngive rise to a spin transfer torque (STT) due to the inhomogeneity of the\nmagnetisation in the vicinity of the interface. This spin transfer torque,\nwhich has not been considered in TIs in the past, is somewhat unconventional\nsince it arises from the interplay of the bulk TI spin-orbit coupling and the\ngradient of the monotonically decaying magnetisation inside the TI. Whereas we\nconsider an idealised model in which the magnetisation gradient is small and\nthe spin transfer torque is correspondingly small, we argue that in real\nsamples the spin transfer torque should be sizable and may provide the dominant\ncontribution due to the bulk states. We show that an experimental smoking gun\nfor identifying the bulk states is the fact that the field-like component of\nthe spin transfer torque generates a spin density with the same size but\nopposite sign for in-plane and out-of-plane magnetisations. This distinguishes\nthem from the surface states, which are expected to give a spin density of a\nsimilar size and the same sign for both an in-plane and out-of-plane\nmagnetisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 18:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 00:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

The most common approach takes a data-driven\nmotivation, where the underlying knowledge is incorporated in the form of\ndomain-inspired input features.

An alternative approach involves\nleveraging mechanistic models, where the domain knowledge is incorporated in a\npredefined functional form. These mechanistic models are meticulously\nformulated through observations to validate specific hypotheses, and\nincorporate elements of causality missing from data-driven ML approaches.

In order to fully exploit the experimental information, theory is\nneeded for the description of both the structure of the nuclei involved, and\nthe dynamics associated with the nucleon removal mechanisms. The standard\napproach, using theoretical shell-model spectroscopic factors for the structure\ndescription coupled with an eikonal model of reaction, has been successful when\nused in the context of the removal of valence nucleons in nuclei close to\nstability.

We subsequently implement our network\nonto analog crossbar arrays comprising Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)\ndevices, and provide a comprehensive benchmark by simulating, laying out, and\ndetermining hardware requirements of the CNN component of our system.

Finally, we propose a\nstuck weight offsetting methodology to mitigate performance degradation due to\nstuck RON/ROFF memristor weights, recovering up to 32% accuracy, without\nrequiring retraining.

The millimeter observations from ALMA\n(resolution of 0.06''$\\times$0.04'') mainly show an asymmetric ring located at\n110au from the star. In addition to this asymmetry, there are two faint\nsymmetric rings at 60au and 200au.

However, online educational\nmaterials in terms of possible gender bias and stereotypes which may appear in\ndifferent forms are yet to be investigated in the context of search bias in a\nwidely-used search platform. As a first step towards measuring possible gender\nbias in online platforms, we have investigated YouTube educational videos in\nterms of the perceived gender of their narrators. We adopted bias measures for\nranked search results to evaluate educational videos returned by YouTube in\nresponse to queries related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and\nMathematics) and NON-STEM fields of education. Gender is a research area by\nitself in social sciences which is beyond the scope of this work. In this\nrespect, for annotating the perceived gender of the narrator of an\ninstructional video we used only a crude classification of gender into Male,\nand Female. Then, for analysing perceived gender bias we utilised bias measures\nthat have been inspired by search platforms and further incorporated rank\ninformation into our analysis. Our preliminary results demonstrate that there\nis a significant bias towards the male gender on the returned YouTube\neducational videos, and the degree of bias varies when we compare STEM and\nNON-STEM queries.

The\nvalley nature of the spin torque gives rise to out-of-plane damping-like\ntorques in a current-in-plane configuration, vanishing charge transport\nperpendicular-to-the-plane as well as torque efficiency tunable through gating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 20:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Recent DRAM chips are more vulnerable to RowHammer: with\ntechnology node scaling, the minimum number of activate-precharge cycles to\ninduce a RowHammer bit flip reduces and the RowHammer bit error rate increases.\nTherefore, it is critical to develop effective and scalable approaches to\nprotect modern DRAM systems against RowHammer. To enable such solutions, it is\nessential to develop a deeper understanding of the RowHammer vulnerability of\nmodern DRAM chips. However, even though the voltage toggling on a wordline is a\nkey determinant of RowHammer vulnerability, no prior work experimentally\ndemonstrates the effect of wordline voltage (VPP) on the RowHammer\nvulnerability. Our work closes this gap in understanding.\n  This is the first work to experimentally demonstrate on 272 real DRAM chips\nthat lowering VPP reduces a DRAM chip's RowHammer vulnerability. We show that\nlowering VPP 1) increases the number of activate-precharge cycles needed to\ninduce a RowHammer bit flip by up to 85.8% with an average of 7.4% across all\ntested chips and 2) decreases the RowHammer bit error rate by up to 66.9% with\nan average of 15.2% across all tested chips. At the same time, reducing VPP\nmarginally worsens a DRAM cell's access latency, charge restoration, and data\nretention time within the guardbands of system-level nominal timing parameters\nfor 208 out of 272 tested chips. We conclude that reducing VPP is a promising\nstrategy for reducing a DRAM chip's RowHammer vulnerability without requiring\nmodifications to DRAM chips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 20:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

The imaging session consisted of (a) two MRI\nspin-echo-based scans, T1- and T2-weighted; (b) a diffusion weighted (DW)\nspin-echo-based scan using an echo planar acquisition with fat suppression. The\nthigh muscles were auto-segmented using CNN. DT-MRI data was used as a geometry\nencoding input to solve the anisotropic Eikonal equation with Hamiltonian\nFast-Marching method.

In reality, however, this case identifier may not\nalways be present, especially when logs are acquired from different systems or\nextracted from non-process-aware information systems.

The cooling time of these stars is\nincreased by stable thermonuclear hydrogen burning in their residual envelope.\nThese WDs are thought to be originated by horizontal branch (HB) stars\npopulating the HB blue tail, which skipped the asymptotic giant branch phase.\nTo further explore this phenomenon, we took advantage of deep photometric data\nacquired with the Hubble Space Telescope in the near-ultraviolet and\ninvestigate the bright portion of the WD cooling sequence in NGC 6752, another\nGalactic globular cluster with metallicity, age and HB morphology similar to\nM13. The normalized WD luminosity function derived in NGC 6752 turns out to be\nimpressively similar to that observed in M13, in agreement with the fact that\nthe stellar mass distribution along the HB of these two systems is almost\nidentical. As in the case of M13, the comparison with theoretical predictions\nis consistent with $\\sim 70\\%$ of the investigated WDs evolving at slower rates\nthan standard, purely cooling WDs. Thanks to its relatively short distance from\nEarth, NGC 6752 photometry reaches a luminosity one order of a magnitude\nfainter than the case of M13, allowing us to sample a regime where the cooling\ntime delay, with respect to standard WD models, reaches $\\sim 300$ Myr.

Most existing methods model the coherence through the topic\ntransition that dynamically infers a topic vector from preceding sentences.\nHowever, these methods still suffer from immediate or delayed repetitions in\ngenerated paragraphs because (i) the entanglement of syntax and semantics\ndistracts the topic vector from attending pertinent visual regions; (ii) there\nare few constraints or rewards for learning long-range transitions. In this\npaper, we propose a bypass network that separately models semantics and\nlinguistic syntax of preceding sentences. Specifically, the proposed model\nconsists of two main modules, i.e. a topic transition module and a sentence\ngeneration module. The former takes previous semantic vectors as queries and\napplies attention mechanism on regional features to acquire the next topic\nvector, which reduces immediate repetition by eliminating linguistics. The\nlatter decodes the topic vector and the preceding syntax state to produce the\nfollowing sentence. To further reduce delayed repetition in generated\nparagraphs, we devise a replacement-based reward for the REINFORCE training.\nComprehensive experiments on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed model over the state of the art for coherence while\nmaintaining high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Research for both modeling and simulating sea ice dynamics is\nongoing, with the most widely accepted model based on the viscous-plastic (VP)\nformulation introduced by Hibler in 1979. Due to its highly nonlinear features,\nthis model is intrinsically challenging for computational solvers. In\nparticular, sea ice simulations often significantly differ from satellite\nobservations. This study therefore focuses on improving the numerical accuracy\nof the VP sea ice model. Since the poor convergence observed in existing\nnumerical simulations stems from the nonlinear nature of the VP formulation,\nthis investigation proposes using the celebrated weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) scheme -- as opposed to the frequently employed centered\ndifference (CD) scheme -- for the spatial derivatives in the VP sea ice model.\nWe then proceed to numerically demonstrate that WENO yields higher-order\nconvergence for smooth solutions, and that furthermore it is able to resolve\nthe discontinuities in the sharp features of sea ice covers -- something that\nis not possible using CD methods. Finally, our proposed framework integrates a\npotential function method that utilizes the phase field method to naturally\nincorporates the physical restrictions of ice thickness and ice concentration\nin transport equations, resulting in a modified transport equations which\nincludes additional forcing terms. Our method does not require post-processing,\nthereby avoiding the possible introduction of discontinuities and corresponding\nnegative impact on the solution behavior.

We\nrefine this result by analysing the spin distributions of gas and DM in\n$\\sim$50,000 well-resolved haloes in a non-radiative cosmological simulation\nfrom the SURFS suite. The sAM of the halo gas on average ends up $\\sim$40\\%\nabove that of the DM. This can be pinned down to an excess AM in the inner halo\n($<$50\\% virial radius), paralleled by a more coherent rotation pattern in the\ngas. We uncover the leading driver for this AM difference through a series of\ncontrol simulations of a collapsing ellipsoidal top-hat, where gas and DM are\ninitially well mixed. These runs reveal that the pressurised inner gas shells\ncollapse more slowly, causing the DM ellipsoid to spin ahead of the gas\nellipsoid. The arising torque generally transfers AM from the DM to the gas.\nThe amount of AM transferred via this mode depends on the initial spin, the\ninitial axes ratios and the collapse factor. These quantities can be combined\nin a single dimensionless parameter, which robustly predicts the AM transfer of\nthe ellipsoidal collapse. This simplistic model can quantitatively explain the\naverage AM excess of the gas found in the more complex non-radiative\ncosmological simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 02:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

During this phase of evolution, the planet gains the majority\nof its final mass through gas accretion at a rapid rate. This work determines\nthe density and velocity fields for material falling onto the central planet\nand its circumplanetary disk, and finds the corresponding column density of\nthis infalling envelope. We derive a steady-state solution for the surface\ndensity of the disk as a function of its viscosity (including the limiting case\nwhere no disk accretion occurs). Planetary magnetic fields truncate the inner\nedge of the disk and determine the boundary conditions for mass accretion onto\nthe planet from both direct infall and from the disk. The properties of the\nforming planet and its circumplanetary disk are determined, including the\nluminosity contributions from infall onto the planet and disk surfaces, and\nfrom disk viscosity. The radiative signature of the planet formation process is\nexplored using a quasi-spherical treatment of the emergent spectral energy\ndistributions. The analytic solutions developed herein show how the protoplanet\nproperties (envelope density distribution, velocity field, column density, disk\nsurface density, luminosity, and radiative signatures) vary with input\nparameters (instantaneous mass, orbital location, accretion rate, and planetary\nmagnetic field strength).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 03:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

In this work, we present a novel framework to detect the\ndensepose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method, which we refer\nto Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), tackles two main problems: 1) how to\nrefine image representation for alleviating incomplete estimations, and 2) how\nto reduce false estimation caused by the low-quality training labels (i.e.,\nlimited annotations and class-imbalance labels). Unlike existing works directly\npropagating the pyramidal features of regions for densepose estimation, the KTN\nuses a refinement of pyramidal representation, where it simultaneously\nmaintains feature resolution and suppresses background pixels, and this\nstrategy results in a substantial increase in accuracy. Moreover, the KTN\nenhances the ability of 3D based body parsing with external knowledges, where\nit casts 2D based body parsers trained from sufficient annotations as a 3D\nbased body parser through a structural body knowledge graph. In this way, it\nsignificantly reduces the adverse effects caused by the low-quality\nannotations. The effectiveness of KTN is demonstrated by its superior\nperformance to the state-of-the-art methods on DensePose-COCO dataset.\nExtensive ablation studies and experimental results on representative tasks\n(e.g., human body segmentation, human part segmentation and keypoints\ndetection) and two popular densepose estimation pipelines (i.e., RCNN and\nfully-convolutional frameworks), further indicate the generalizability of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 03:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

In this paper, we propose\na novel Pyramid Region-based Slot Attention (PRSlot) module to address these\nissues. Instead of using the similarity computation, our PRSlot module directly\nlearns the local relations in an encoder-decoder manner and generates the\nrepresentation of a local region enhanced based on the attention over input\nfeatures called \\textit{slot}.

This motivates us to\nleverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture\nlong-range relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one\nexamination. For this purpose, we employ local Transformer blocks to separately\nlearn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view\n(CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and\nsides are concatenated and fed into global Transformer blocks, to jointly learn\npatch relationships between four images representing two different views of the\nleft and right breasts.

We\nshow that while voter shares form a martingale process, their voting powers\nfollow a super-martingale that decays to zero over time. This prevents any\nvoter from controlling the voting process, and thus enhances decentralization.\nWhen the initial total volume of votes (or stakes) is large, we show a phase\ntransition in share stability (or the lack thereof), corresponding to the\nvoter's initial share relative to the total. We also study the scenario in\nwhich trading (of votes/stakes) among the voters is allowed, and quantify the\nlevel of risk sensitivity (or risk averse) that will remove any incentive for a\nvoter to trade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 04:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 23:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 17:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Differential abundance\nanalysis aims to identify microbial taxa associated with two or more sample\ngroups defined by attributes such as disease subtype, geography, or\nenvironmental condition. The results, in turn, help clinical practitioners and\nresearchers diagnose disease and develop new treatments more effectively.\nHowever, detecting differential abundance is uniquely challenging due to the\nhigh dimensionality, collinearity, sparsity, and compositionality of microbiome\ndata. Further, there is a critical need for unified statistical approaches that\ncan directly compare more than two groups and appropriately adjust for\ncovariates. We develop a zero-inflated Bayesian nonparametric (ZIBNP)\nmethodology that meets the multipronged challenges posed by microbiome data and\nidentifies differentially abundant taxa in two or more groups, while also\naccounting for sample-specific covariates.

Unlike traditional retrieval architectures where index and retrieval\nare two different and separate components, DSI uses a single transformer model\nto perform both indexing and retrieval.\n  In this paper, we identify and tackle an important issue of current DSI\nmodels: the data distribution mismatch that occurs between the DSI indexing and\nretrieval processes. Specifically, we argue that, at indexing, current DSI\nmethods learn to build connections between the text of long documents and the\nidentifier of the documents, but then retrieval of document identifiers is\nbased on queries that are commonly much shorter than the indexed documents.\nThis problem is further exacerbated when using DSI for cross-lingual retrieval,\nwhere document text and query text are in different languages.\n  To address this fundamental problem of current DSI models, we propose a\nsimple yet effective indexing framework for DSI, called DSI-QG. When indexing,\nDSI-QG represents documents with a number of potentially relevant queries\ngenerated by a query generation model and re-ranked and filtered by a\ncross-encoder ranker. The presence of these queries at indexing allows the DSI\nmodels to connect a document identifier to a set of queries, hence mitigating\ndata distribution mismatches present between the indexing and the retrieval\nphases.

The modulational instability in the quasi crystalline or\namorphous phase of a strongly coupled system, uniquely accessed under the\nquasi-localized charge approximation (QLCA), generates a narrower instability\nregime for entire spectral range. In comparison to the linear one dimensional\nchains of strongly coupled dust grains, the longitudinal modes for\nquasicrystalline phase show finite distinction in terms of the instability\nregime.

The six orders of magnitude\nextrapolation of the electron bunch length in an SSMB storage ring compared to\nthat of a conventional ring provides tremendous opportunities for accelerator\nphysics research.\n  This dissertation is devoted to the theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations of SSMB, with important results achieved. The work presented can\nbe summarized as: first, how to realize SSMB; second, what radiation\ncharacteristics can we obtain from the formed SSMB; and third, experimentally\ndemonstrate the working mechanism of SSMB in a real machine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 06:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, they follow the\ntraditional structure-aware propagation strategy of GCNs, making it hard to\ncapture the attribute correlation of nodes and sensitive to the structure noise\ndescribed by edges whose two endpoints belong to different categories.

Most existing approaches address this problem by adding a\nregional convolutional neural network (RCNN) with an attribute prediction head\nto a two-stage detector, in which attributes of body parts are identified from\nlocal-wise part boxes. However, local-wise part boxes with limit visual clues\n(i.e., part appearance only) lead to unsatisfying parsing results, since\nattributes of body parts are highly dependent on comprehensive relations among\nthem. In this article, we propose a Knowledge Embedded RCNN (KE-RCNN) to\nidentify attributes by leveraging rich knowledges, including implicit knowledge\n(e.g., the attribute ``above-the-hip'' for a shirt requires visual/geometry\nrelations of shirt-hip) and explicit knowledge (e.g., the part of ``shorts''\ncannot have the attribute of ``hoodie'' or ``lining''). Specifically, the\nKE-RCNN consists of two novel components, i.e., Implicit Knowledge based\nEncoder (IK-En) and Explicit Knowledge based Decoder (EK-De). The former is\ndesigned to enhance part-level representation by encoding part-part relational\ncontexts into part boxes, and the latter one is proposed to decode attributes\nwith a guidance of prior knowledge about \\textit{part-attribute} relations. In\nthis way, the KE-RCNN is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any\ntwo-stage detectors, e.g., Attribute-RCNN, Cascade-RCNN, HRNet based RCNN and\nSwinTransformer based RCNN. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging\nbenchmarks, e.g., Fashionpedia and Kinetics-TPS, demonstrate the effectiveness\nand generalizability of the KE-RCNN. In particular, it achieves higher\nimprovements over all existing methods, reaching around 3% of AP on\nFashionpedia and around 4% of Acc on Kinetics-TPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In recent years, spin current\ntransports in bismuth have also attracted considerable attention. In this\npaper, we theoretically study both spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst\neffect (SNE) in bismuth, based on relativistic band structure calculations.\nFirst, we find that there are three independent tensor elements of spin Hall\nconductivity (SHC) and spin Nernst conductivity (SNC), namely, $Z_{yx}^z$,\n$Z_{xz}^y$, and $Z_{zy}^x$. We calculate all the elements as a function of the\nFermi energy. Second, we find that all SHC tensor elements are large, being\n$\\sim$1000 ($\\hbar$/e)(S/cm) and comparable to that of platinum. Furthermore,\nbecause of its low electrical conductivity, the corresponding spin Hall angles\nare gigantic, being $\\sim$20%. Third, all the calculated SNC tensor elements\nare also pronounced, being comparable to that [$\\sim$0.13 ($\\hbar$/e)(A/m-K)]\nof gold, although they are several times smaller than platinum and $\\beta$-Ta.\nFinally, in contrast to Pt and Au where $Z_{yx}^z = Z_{xz}^y = Z_{zy}^x$, the\nSHE and SNE in bismuth are strongly anisotropic, i.e., $Z_{yx}^z$, $Z_{xz}^y$\nand $Z_{zy}^x$ differ significantly. Consequently, the Hall voltages due to the\ninverse SHE and SNE from the different conductivity elements could cancel each\nother and thus result in a small spin Hall angle if polycrystalline samples are\nused, which may explain why the measured spin Hall angles ranging from nearly 0\nto 25% have been reported. We hope that these interesting findings would\nstimulate further spin current experiments on bismuth using highly oriented\nsingle crystal specimens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 13:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In this paper, these two challenges are tackled by not only\nenriching intra-modality and cross-modality relations for representation\nmodeling but also shaping the features in a discriminative manner. Our proposed\nmethod mainly leverages the intra-modality encoding and cross-modality\nco-occurrence encoding for fully representation modeling. Specifically,\nintra-modality encoding augments the modality-wise features and dampens\nirrelevant modality via within-modality relation learning in both audio and\nvisual signals. Meanwhile, cross-modality co-occurrence encoding focuses on the\nco-occurrence inter-modality relations and selectively captures effective\ninformation among multi-modality. The multi-modal representation is further\nenhanced by the global information abstracted from the local context. In\naddition, we enlarge the discriminative power of feature embedding with a\nhard-pairs guided contrastive learning (HPCL) scheme.

However, when\ndeploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise\nand potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies\nbecomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication\nmessages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on\nuntrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic\nconsequences. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that agents will not be misled\nby corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication.\nIn this work, we consider an environment with $N$ agents, where the attacker\nmay arbitrarily change the communication from any $C<\\frac{N-1}{2}$ agents to a\nvictim agent.

Using the Hirota bilinear method, the general $N$-bright and\n$N$-dark soliton solutions are deduced and their Gram determinant forms are\nobtained. A special feature of the fundamental bright soliton solution is that,\nin general, it behaves like the Korteweg-deVries soliton. However, under a\nspecial condition, it also behaves akin to the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nsoliton when it loses the amplitude dependent velocity property. The\nfundamental dark-soliton solution admits anti-dark, grey, and completely black\nsoliton profiles, in the short-wave component, depending on the choice of wave\nparameters. On the other hand, a bright soliton like profile always occurs in\nthe long-wave component. The asymptotic analysis shows that both the bright and\ndark solitons undergo an elastic collision with a finite phase shift. In\naddition to these, by tuning the phase shift regime, we point out the existence\nof resonance interactions among the bright solitons. Furthermore, under a\nspecial velocity resonance condition, we bring out the various types of bright\nand dark soliton bound states. Also, by fixing the phase factor and the system\nparameter $\\beta$, corresponding to the interaction between long and short wave\ncomponents, the different types of profiles associated with the obtained\nbreather solution are demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

The HEIDIH model consists of a one-dimensional stochastic advection\nequation coupled with a stochastic volatility process, defined as a\nCholesky-type decomposition of the tensor product of a Hilbert-space valued\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, the mild solution to the stochastic heat equation\non the real half-line.

It is also a crucial seed species for the building-up of the chemical\ncomplexity in star forming regions. Thus, understanding how its abundance\nevolves during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging\nplanetary system is of paramount importance. We used new data from the ALMA\nLarge Program FAUST (Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope\nsystem of Solar-like protostars) to study the methanol line emission towards\nthe [BHB2007] 11 protobinary system (sources A and B), where a complex\nstructure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary\ndisk has been previously detected. Twelve methanol lines have been detected\nwith upper energies in the range [45-537] K along with one 13CH3OH transition.\nThe methanol emission is compact and encompasses both protostars, separated by\nonly 28 au and presents three velocity components, not spatially resolved by\nour observations, associated with three different spatial regions, with two of\nthem close to 11B and the third one associated with 11A. A non-LTE radiative\ntransfer analysis of the methanol lines concludes that the gas is hot and dense\nand highly enriched in methanol with an abundance as high as 1e-5. Using\nprevious continuum data, we show that dust opacity can potentially completely\nabsorb the methanol line emission from the two binary objects. Although we\ncannot firmly exclude other possibilities, we suggest that the detected hot\nmethanol is resulting from the shocked gas from the incoming filaments\nstreaming towards [BHB2007] 11 A and B, respectively. Higher spatial resolution\nobservations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 08:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However, unlike words in NLP, the lack of\nsemantic decomposition of images still makes masked autoencoding (MAE)\ndifferent between vision and language. In this paper, we explore a potential\nvisual analogue of words, i.e., semantic parts, and we integrate semantic\ninformation into the training process of MAE by proposing a Semantic-Guided\nMasking strategy. Compared to widely adopted random masking, our masking\nstrategy can gradually guide the network to learn various information, i.e.,\nfrom intra-part patterns to inter-part relations. In particular, we achieve\nthis in two steps. 1) Semantic part learning: we design a self-supervised part\nlearning method to obtain semantic parts by leveraging and refining the\nmulti-head attention of a ViT-based encoder. 2) Semantic-guided MAE (SemMAE)\ntraining: we design a masking strategy that varies from masking a portion of\npatches in each part to masking a portion of (whole) parts in an image.\nExtensive experiments on various vision tasks show that SemMAE can learn better\nimage representation by integrating semantic information. In particular, SemMAE\nachieves 84.5% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1k, which outperforms the\nvanilla MAE by 1.4%. In the semantic segmentation and fine-grained recognition\ntasks, SemMAE also brings significant improvements and yields the\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 09:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 14:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 17:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

The main goal of the proposed\nalgorithm (which we call FEAT) is to get close to the optimal, while keeping a\ndecent level of fairness. The key idea within FEAT is to minimize the ratio\nbetween the best and the worst utilities of the users. This is done by ensuring\nthat, at each iteration (channel assignment), a user is satisfied with this\nassignment as long as he does not loose much more than other users in the\nsystem. It has been shown that FEAT outperforms most related algorithms in many\naspects, especially in interference-limited systems.

It is an ecosystem, composed of several species, competing for resources\nand interacting with the skin cells. Imbalance in the cutaneous microbiome,\nalso called dysbiosis, has been correlated with several skin conditions,\nincluding acne and atopic dermatitis. Generally, dysbiosis is linked to\ncolonization of the skin by a population of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria\n(for example C. acnes in acne or S. aureus in atopic dermatitis). Treatments\nconsisting in non-specific elimination of cutaneous microflora have shown\nconflicting results. It is therefore necessary to understand the factors\ninfluencing shifts of the skin microbiome composition. In this work, we\nintroduce a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations, with 2\ntypes of bacteria populations (skin commensals and opportunistic pathogens) to\nstudy the mechanisms driving the dominance of one population over the other. By\nusing published experimental data, assumed to correspond to the observation of\nstable states in our model, we derive constraints that allow us to reduce the\nnumber of parameters of the model from 13 to 5. Interestingly, a meta-stable\nstate settled at around 2 days following the introduction of bacteria in the\nmodel, is followed by a reversed stable state after 300 hours. On the time\nscale of the experiments, we show that certain changes of the environment, like\nthe elevation of skin surface pH, create favorable conditions for the emergence\nand colonization of the skin by the opportunistic pathogen population. Such\npredictions help identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of\nskin conditions involving dysbiosis of the microbiome, and question the\nimportance of meta-stable states in mathematical models of biological\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 09:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, this form of univariate\npost-processing may ignore the prevailing spatial and/or temporal correlation\nstructures among different dimensions.

On the one hand, we construct examples where $K$ has the same\nprojections as some subgroup of $H$ but is not conjugate to any subgroup of\n$H$. On the other hand, we prove that if $K$ normalizes the projections of a\nsubgroup $H$, then $K$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $H$ even in the more\ngeneral case when $H$ is a submaximal $\\mathfrak{X}$-subgroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 11:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

However, existing\nactive-vision algorithms cannot perform well on targeted perception objectives,\nsuch as the 3D reconstruction of leaf nodes, because they do not distinguish\nbetween the plant-parts that need to be reconstructed and the rest of the\nplant. In this paper, we propose an attention-driven active-vision algorithm\nthat considers only the relevant plant-parts according to the task-at-hand. The\nproposed approach was evaluated in a simulated environment on the task of 3D\nreconstruction of tomato plants at varying levels of attention, namely the\nwhole plant, the main stem and the leaf nodes. Compared to pre-defined and\nrandom approaches, our approach improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction by\n9.7% and 5.3% for the whole plant, 14.2% and 7.9% for the main stem, and 25.9%\nand 17.3% for the leaf nodes respectively within the first 3 viewpoints. Also,\ncompared to pre-defined and random approaches, our approach reconstructs 80% of\nthe whole plant and the main stem in 1 less viewpoint and 80% of the leaf nodes\nin 3 less viewpoints. We also demonstrated that the attention-driven NBV\nplanner works effectively despite changes to the plant models, the amount of\nocclusion, the number of candidate viewpoints and the resolutions of\nreconstruction. By adding an attention mechanism to active-vision, it is\npossible to efficiently reconstruct the whole plant and targeted plant parts.\nWe conclude that an attention mechanism for active-vision is necessary to\nsignificantly improve the quality of perception in complex agro-food\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 11:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

For the latter case, the tunable RF\ncomponent, such as a multi-tap circuit, reproduces and subtracts the SI.

Thus, it is necessary to propose an effective\nautomatic cartilage segmentation model for longitudinal research on\nosteoarthritis. In this research, to relieve the problem of inaccurate\ndiscontinuous segmentation caused by the limited receptive field in\nconvolutional neural networks, we proposed a novel position-prior\nclustering-based self-attention module (PCAM). In PCAM, long-range dependency\nbetween each class center and feature point is captured by self-attention\nallowing contextual information re-allocated to strengthen the relative\nfeatures and ensure the continuity of segmentation result. The clutsering-based\nmethod is used to estimate class centers, which fosters intra-class consistency\nand further improves the accuracy of segmentation results. The position-prior\nexcludes the false positives from side-output and makes center estimation more\nprecise. Sufficient experiments are conducted on OAI-ZIB dataset. The\nexperimental results show that the segmentation performance of combination of\nsegmentation network and PCAM obtains an evident improvement compared to\noriginal model, which proves the potential application of PCAM in medical\nsegmentation tasks.

One important\nfocus lies on the design of mechanisms for the matching process aiming at\nmaximizing the quality of the produced matchings or at minimizing waiting\ncosts.\n  We study a dynamic matching procedure where homogeneous agents arrive at\nrandom according to a Poisson process and form edges at random yielding a\nsparse market.

We address this by providing an algorithmic\nframework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it\nis possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly\nindistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian\nrandom designs.

In this work we evidence that the growth of staggered QWs\nhas also another beneficial effect as it allows to reduce the formation of\ndefects, responsible for nonradiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, at the\nbottom interface of the QW. Staggered QWs comprised an InGaN layer of an\nintermediate In content between the barrier and the QW.

In these natural environments,\ncarrier fluids such as mucus or reproductive fluids show complex structure\nassociated with non-Newtonian rheology. Many fundamental questions concerning\nthe the ability to navigate in such environments remain unsolved due to the\ninherent complexity of the natural surroundings. Recently, the interaction of\nswimming bacteria with nematic liquid crystals has attracted lot of attention.\nIn these structured fluids, the kinetics of bacterial motion is constrained by\nthe orientational molecular order of the liquid crystal (or director field) and\nnovel spatio-temporal patterns arise from this orientational constraint, as\nwell as from the interactions with topological defects. A question unaddressed\nso far is how bacteria are able to change swimming direction in such an\nenvironment. In this work, we study the swimming mechanism of a single\nbacterium, E. coli, constrained to move along the director field of a lyotropic\nchromonic liquid crystal (LCLC) that is confined to a planar cell. In such an\nenvironment, the spontaneous run and tumble motion of the bacterium gets\nfrustrated: the elasticity of the liquid crystal prevents flagella from\nunbundling. Interestingly, in order to change direction, bacteria execute a\nreversal motion along the director field, driven by the relocation of a single\nflagellum to the other side of the bacterial body, coined as a frustrated\ntumble. We present a detailed experimental characterization of this phenomenon,\nexploiting exceptional spatial and temporal resolution of bacteria and flagella\ndynamics during swimming, obtained using a two color Lagrangian tracking\ntechnique. We suggest a possible mechanism behind the frustrated run and tumble\nmotion, accounting for these observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 12:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

A related\napproach, called \"model-based forests\", that is geared towards randomized\ntrials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive\nvariables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (2018) along with a\nmodular implementation in the R package model4you.\n  Here, we present a unifying view that goes beyond the theoretical motivations\nand investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful\nand how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests.

To tackle this problem, an online\nprogressive instance-balanced sampling (OPIS) algorithm based on hard sampling\nand soft sampling is proposed in this paper. The algorithm includes two\nmodules: a progressive instance balance (PIB) module and a progressive instance\nreweighting (PIR) module.

One way of doing this is by calculating $m_n(t)$ [or $\\kappa_n(t)$]\nfor each sample and then carrying out an average of them for the $N$\ninterfaces, with $S$ and $K$ being calculated only at the end. Another approach\nconsists in directly calculating the ratios for each interface and, then,\naveraging the $N$ values. It turns out, however, that $S$ and $K$ for the\ngrowth regime HDs display strong finite-size and -time effects when estimated\nfrom these \"interface statistics\", as already observed in some previous works\nand clearly shown here, through extensive simulations of several discrete\ngrowth models belonging to the EW and KPZ classes on 1D and 2D substrates of\nsizes $L=const.$ and $L \\sim t$.

This decay of the\nparticle states leads to an exponential damping term in the probabilities of\nsingle nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair\nproduction. In this paper we investigate analytically and numerically the\nprobabilities of nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair\nproduction including the particle states' decay. For this we first compute\nspin- and polarization-resolved expressions of the probabilities, provide some\nof their asymptotic behaviors and show that the results of the total\nprobabilities are independent of the spin and polarization bases. Then, we\npresent several plots of the total and differential probabilities for different\npulse lengths and for different spin and polarization quantum numbers. We\nobserve that it is crucial to take into account the damping of the states in\norder for the probabilities to stay always below unity and we show that the\ndamping factors also scale with the intensity and pulse duration of the\nbackground field. In the case of nonlinear Compton scattering we show\nnumerically that the total probability behaves like a Poissonian distribution\nin the regime where the photon recoil is negligible. In all considered cases,\nthe kinematic conditions are such that the final particles momenta transverse\nto the propagation direction of the plane wave are always much smaller than the\nparticles longitudinal momenta and the main spread of the momentum distribution\non the transverse plane is along the direction of the plane-wave electric\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 13:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Considering that acoustic scenes and\nsound events are closely related to each other, the joint analysis of acoustic\nscenes and sound events using multitask learning (MTL)-based neural networks\nwas proposed in some previous works. Conventional methods train MTL-based\nmodels using a linear combination of ASC and SED loss functions with constant\nweights. However, the performance of conventional MTL-based methods depends\nstrongly on the weights of the ASC and SED losses, and it is difficult to\ndetermine the appropriate balance between the constant weights of the losses of\nMTL of ASC and SED. In this paper, we thus propose dynamic weight adaptation\nmethods for MTL of ASC and SED based on dynamic weight average and multi--focal\nloss to adjust the learning weights automatically.

First, the stereo matching technique used in traditional stereo\ndepth estimation is revamped. For the stereo depth estimation component of our\narchitecture, a mono-to-stereo transfer learning approach is deployed. The\nproposed formulation circumvents the cost volume construction requirement,\nwhich is replaced by a ResNet based dual-encoder single-decoder CNN with\ndifferent weights for feature fusion.

The final\npredicted disparity map obtained is more robust and retains best features that\npreserve the depth discontinuities.

In this paper, we propose\na neural moving horizon estimator (NeuroMHE) that can automatically tune the\nkey parameters modeled by a neural network and adapt to different flight\nscenarios. We achieve this by deriving the analytical gradients of the MHE\nestimates with respect to the weighting matrices, which enables a seamless\nembedding of the MHE as a learnable layer into neural networks for highly\neffective learning. Interestingly, we show that the gradients can be computed\nefficiently using a Kalman filter in a recursive form.

The effectiveness of NeuroMHE is verified extensively via\nboth simulations and physical experiments on quadrotors in various challenging\nflights. Notably, NeuroMHE outperforms the state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork-based estimator with estimation error reductions of up to about 49.4%\nby using only a 2.5% amount of the neural network parameters.

However, developing an efficient\nintrusion detection method for massive network traffic data is still difficult.\nSince Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have powerful modeling\ncapabilities for complex high-dimensional data, they provide new ideas for\naddressing this problem. In this paper, we put forward an EBGAN-based intrusion\ndetection method, IDS-EBGAN, that classifies network records as normal traffic\nor malicious traffic. The generator in IDS-EBGAN is responsible for converting\nthe original malicious network traffic in the training set into adversarial\nmalicious examples. This is because we want to use adversarial learning to\nimprove the ability of discriminator to detect malicious traffic. At the same\ntime, the discriminator adopts Autoencoder model. During testing, IDS-EBGAN\nuses reconstruction error of discriminator to classify traffic records.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 13:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this case, this paper aims to\nresolve the problem of travel time estimation (TTE) and route recovery in\nsparse scenarios, which often leads to the uncertain label of travel time and\nroute between continuously sampled GPS points. We formulate this problem as an\ninexact supervision problem in which the training data has coarsely grained\nlabels and jointly solve the tasks of TTE and route recovery. And we argue that\nboth two tasks are complementary to each other in the model-learning procedure\nand hold such a relation: more precise travel time can lead to better inference\nfor routes, in turn, resulting in a more accurate time estimation). Based on\nthis assumption, we propose an EM algorithm to alternatively estimate the\ntravel time of inferred route through weak supervision in E step and retrieve\nthe route based on estimated travel time in M step for sparse trajectories.

First, it is highly desirable to be\nable to learn and perform knowledge discovery and analytics (LKD) tasks without\nthe need to access raw-data tables. This may be due to organizations finding it\nincreasingly frustrating and costly to manage and maintain ever-growing tables,\nor for privacy reasons. Hence, compact models can be developed from the raw\ndata and used instead of the tables. Second, oftentimes, LKD tasks are to be\nperformed on a (potentially very large) table which is itself the result of\njoining separate (potentially very large) relational tables. But how can one do\nthis, when the individual to-be-joined tables are absent? Here, we pose the\nfollowing fundamental questions: Q1: How can one \"join models\" of\n(absent/deleted) tables or \"join models with other tables\" in a way that\nenables LKD as if it were performed on the join of the actual raw tables? Q2:\nWhat are appropriate models to use per table? Q3: As the model join would be an\napproximation of the actual data join, how can one evaluate the quality of the\nmodel join result? This work puts forth a framework, Model Join, addressing\nthese challenges. The framework integrates and joins the per-table models of\nthe absent tables and generates a uniform and independent sample that is a\nhigh-quality approximation of a uniform and independent sample of the actual\nraw-data join. The approximation stems from the models, but not from the Model\nJoin framework. The sample obtained by the Model Join can be used to perform\nLKD downstream tasks, such as approximate query processing, classification,\nclustering, regression, association rule mining, visualization, and so on. To\nour knowledge, this is the first work with this agenda and solutions. Detailed\nexperiments with TPC-DS data and synthetic data showcase Model Join's\nusefulness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 14:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this work, we\nintroduce a new approach for n-way equi-join processing, the Graphical Join\n(GJ).

Second, and most importantly, to show\nthat a join algorithm, like GJ, which produces the above join-result summary\nand then desummarizes it, can introduce large performance benefits in time and\nspace.

Reactions with ground-state neutral\ncarbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are very endoergic and have high\nenergy barriers because the H2 molecule has to be fragmented before a hydride\nbond is formed. In cold interstellar clouds, these barriers exclude the\nformation of CH, OH, NH, and SH radicals through hydrogen abstraction\nreactions. Here we study a very energetically unfavorable process, the reaction\nof N(4S) atoms with H2 molecules. We calculated the reaction rate coefficient\nfor H2 in different vibrational levels, using quantum methods for v=0-7 and\nquasi-classical methods up to v=12. Owing to the high energy barrier, these\nrate coefficients increase with v and also with the gas temperature. We\nimplemented the new rates in the Meudon PDR code and studied their effect on\nmodels with different ultraviolet (UV) illumination conditions. In strongly\nUV-irradiated dense gas (Orion Bar conditions), the presence of H2 in highly\nvibrationally excited levels (v>7) enhances the NH abundance by two orders of\nmagnitude (at the PDR surface) compared to models that use the thermal rate\ncoefficient for reaction N(4S) + H2 -> NH + H. The increase in NH column\ndensity across the PDR is a factor of ~25. We explore existing Herschel/HIFI\nobservations of the Orion Bar and Horsehead PDRs. We report a 3-sigma emission\nfeature at the ~974 GHz frequency of the NH N_J=1_2-0_1 line toward the Bar.\nThe emission level implies N(NH)~10^13 cm^-2, which is consistent with PDR\nmodels using the new rate coefficients for reactions between N and UV-pumped\nH2. This formation route dominates over hydrogenation reactions involving the\nless abundant N+ ion. JWST observations will soon quantify the amount and\nreactivity of UV-pumped H2 in many interstellar and circumstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 14:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

However, unless the model being trained is\noverparameterized, there is no a-priori reason for the vectors we wish to\ncompress to approach zero during the iterations of classical methods such as\ndistributed compressed {\\sf SGD}, which has adverse effects on the convergence\nspeed. Due to this issue, several more elaborate and seemingly very different\nalgorithms have been proposed recently, with the goal of circumventing this\nissue. These methods are based on the idea of compressing the {\\em difference}\nbetween the vector we would normally wish to compress and some auxiliary vector\nwhich changes throughout the iterative process. In this work we take a step\nback, and develop a unified framework for studying such methods, conceptually,\nand theoretically. Our framework incorporates methods compressing both\ngradients and models, using unbiased and biased compressors, and sheds light on\nthe construction of the auxiliary vectors. Furthermore, our general framework\ncan lead to the improvement of several existing algorithms, and can produce new\nalgorithms. Finally, we performed several numerical experiments which\nillustrate and support our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 15:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Learning optimal policies from\nobserved data requires a careful formulation of the utility function whose\nexpected value is maximized across a population. Although researchers typically\nuse utilities that depend on observed outcomes alone, in many settings the\ndecision maker's utility function is more properly characterized by the joint\nset of potential outcomes under all actions. For example, the Hippocratic\nprinciple to ``do no harm'' implies that the cost of causing death to a patient\nwho would otherwise survive without treatment is greater than the cost of\nforgoing life-saving treatment.

Electromagnetic (EM)\ntracking is one technology that allows localizing such surgical instruments.\nFor localizing intra-operatively EM-tracked instruments with respect to\npreoperative volume data, it is necessary to bring pre- and intraoperative\nimaging into the same coordinate frame. In most existing solutions, such\nregistration requires additional interactions, modifying the procedure's\noriginal workflow. We propose a new method taking advantage of Bioelectric\nsignals to initialize and register preoperative volumes to the EM tracking\nsystem without significantly changing the interventional workflow. We envision\nthe most natural use-case of our concept in cardiac electrophysiology (EP)\nprocedures, in which EP catheters are already equipped with all the necessary\nsensing, including electric sensing for the measurement of electrophysiological\nsignals and EM tracking for catheter localization. We use EP catheters for\nBioelectric sensing to detect local features of the vasculature while advancing\nthe catheter inside the human body. Such features can be automatically labeled\nbefore the procedure within the preoperative data. The combination of\nBioelectric and EM tracking can localize vascular features such as bifurcations\nand stenosis within the EM tracking space. Mapping them to preoperative data\nautomatically registers patients' CT space to EM tracking. The proposed\nregistration process is entirely based on Bioelectric sensed features, with no\nneed for external markers or other interventional imaging devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 21:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

However, a major problem is that many leading\nlearned schemes cannot maintain a good trade-off between performance and\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose an effcient and effective image coding\nframework, which achieves similar R-D performance with lower complexity than\nthe state of the art. First, we develop an improved multi-scale residual block\n(MSRB) that can expand the receptive feld and is easier to obtain global\ninformation. It can further capture and reduce the spatial correlation of the\nlatent representations. Second, a more advanced importance map network is\nintroduced to adaptively allocate bits to different regions of the image.\nThird, we apply a 2D post-quantization flter (PQF) to reduce the quantization\nerror, motivated by the Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) flter in video coding.\nMoreover, We fnd that the complexity of encoder and decoder have different\neffects on image compression performance. Based on this observation, we design\nan asymmetric paradigm, in which the encoder employs three stages of MSRBs to\nimprove the learning capacity, whereas the decoder only needs one stage of MSRB\nto yield satisfactory reconstruction, thereby reducing the decoding complexity\nwithout sacrifcing performance. Experimental results show that compared to the\nstate-of-the-art method, the encoding and decoding time of the proposed method\nare about 17 times faster, and the R-D performance is only reduced by less than\n1% on both Kodak and Tecnick datasets, which is still better than\nH.266/VVC(4:4:4) and other recent learning-based methods.

In the SL paradigm,\nmodels are trained based on a dataset, which is typically computed a priori\nfrom a high-fidelity solution by applying the respective filter function, which\nseparates the resolved and the unresolved flow scales. For implicitly filtered\nlarge eddy simulation (LES), this approach is infeasible, since here, the\nemployed discretization itself acts as an implicit filter function. As a\nconsequence, the exact filter form is generally not known and thus, the\ncorresponding closure terms cannot be computed even if the full solution is\navailable. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can be used to avoid this\ninconsistency by training not on a previously obtained training dataset, but\ninstead by interacting directly with the dynamical LES environment itself. This\nallows to incorporate the potentially complex implicit LES filter into the\ntraining process by design. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning\nframework to find an optimal eddy-viscosity for implicitly filtered large eddy\nsimulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For this, we formulate\nthe task of turbulence modeling as an RL task with a policy network based on\nconvolutional neural networks that adapts the eddy-viscosity in LES dynamically\nin space and time based on the local flow state only. We demonstrate that the\ntrained models can provide long-term stable simulations and that they\noutperform established analytical models in terms of accuracy. In addition, the\nmodels generalize well to other resolutions and discretizations. We thus\ndemonstrate that RL can provide a framework for consistent, accurate and stable\nturbulence modeling especially for implicitly filtered LES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 11:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

As most PBMs of interest cannot be solved analytically,\ncomputationally expensive high-order finite difference or finite volume methods\nare frequently used to obtain an accurate numerical solution. We propose a\nfinite difference scheme based on operator splitting and solving each\nsub-problem at the limit of numerical stability that achieves a discretization\nerror that is zero for certain classes of PBMs and low enough to be acceptable\nfor other classes. In conjunction to employing specially constructed meshes and\nvariable transformations, the scheme exploits the commutative property of the\ndifferential operators present in many classes of PBMs. The scheme has very low\ncomputational cost -- potentially as low as just memory reallocation.

This has been the enabling technology for the\ntransition from the 90 nm node to the 45 nm node, allowing us to shrink our\ntransistors further without losing additional gate control. The fundamental\nreason for using a high-k gate dielectric compared to SiO2 is that shrinking\nour gate oxide further, which is already at a few angstroms, is no longer a\nfeasible option to gain additional gate control. High-k dielectric overcome\nthis by exploiting the fundamental physics of capacitors and the materials\nscience of dielectrics to provide a viable option to increase gate control\nwithout the need for successively thinner gate oxides. Hafnium Oxide is the\nmost studied and popular of such materials.
