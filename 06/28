To tackle this\nissue, in this paper, we propose a blind stripe artifact removal algorithm in\nLSFM, called DeStripe, which combines a self-supervised spatio-spectral graph\nneural network with unfolded Hessian prior. Specifically, inspired by the\ndesirable properties of Fourier transform in condensing striping information\ninto isolated values in the frequency domain, DeStripe firstly localizes the\npotentially corrupted Fourier coefficients by exploiting the structural\ndifference between unidirectional stripe artifacts and more isotropic\nforeground images.

Recently, the usage of multi-rotor unmanned autonomous vehicles\n(UAV) for marine applications is receiving more attention in the literature.\nUsually, both platforms employ an inertial navigation system (INS), and aiding\nsensors for an accurate navigation solution. In AUV navigation, Doppler\nvelocity log (DVL) is mainly used to aid the INS, while for UAVs, it is common\nto use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers. The fusion between\nthe aiding sensor and the INS requires a definition of step size parameter in\nthe estimation process. It is responsible for the solution frequency update\nand, eventually, its accuracy. The choice of the step size poses a tradeoff\nbetween computational load and navigation performance. Generally, the aiding\nsensors update frequency is considered much slower compared to the INS\noperating frequency (hundreds Hertz). Such high rate is unnecessary for most\nplatforms, specifically for low dynamics AUVs. In this work, a supervised\nmachine learning based adaptive tuning scheme to select the proper INS step\nsize is proposed.

However, two issues related to gravitino\npropagation were recently uncovered in specific supergravities with nonlinear\nsupersymmetry. One of them concerns potential acausality/superluminality,\nwhereas the second one arises from the vanishing of the sound speed at specific\npoints during inflation. The former is famously related to positivity\nconstraints on specific EFT operators, derived from dispersion relations on the\nenergy-growing part of scattering amplitudes, and indeed we show that\nsubluminality constraints for the gravitino are related via the equivalence\ntheorem to positivity bounds in low-energy goldstino actions. However, the\nformer are stronger, in the sense that they apply to functions of the scalar\nfields not only in the ground state, but for any field values such as those\nscanned by time-dependent solutions, unlike bounds derived from $2\\to 2$\nscattering amplitudes in the vacuum. We also argue that nontrivial causality\nconstraints arise only in the case where nonlinear supersymmetry in the matter\nsector is encoded into superfield constraints which do not seem to arise from\nmicroscopic two-derivative lagrangians, in particular for the orthogonal\nconstraint used to build minimal models of inflation in supergravity. This\nallows us to propose simple alternatives which maintain the minimality of the\nspectra and are causal in all points of the theory parameter space.

We investigate the potential of gas flow induced by\nlow-mass planets to sculpt the rings and gaps in the dust profiles. We first\nperform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, which resolve the local\ngas flow past a planet. We then calculate the trajectories of dust influenced\nby the planet-induced gas flow.

The outflow of the gas\ntoward the outside of the planetary orbit inhibits the radial drift of dust,\nleading to dust accumulation (the dust ring).

This work focusses on the\nnano-diamonds observed in circumstellar discs and is an attempt to derive\ncritical information about their possible sizes, compositions, and evolution\nusing a recently-derived set of optical constants. The complex indices of\nrefraction of nano-diamonds and their optical properties (the efficiency\nfactors Qext, Qsca, Qabs, and Qpr) were used to determine their temperatures,\nlifetimes, and drift velocities as a function of their radii (0.5-100 nm),\ncomposition (surface hydrogenation and irradiated states), and distance from\nthe central stars in circumstellar regions. The nano-diamond temperature\nprofiles were determined for the stars HR 4049, Elias 1, and HD 97048 in the\noptically-thin limit. The results indicate that large nano-diamonds (a = 30 -\n100 nm) are the hottest and therefore the least resistant in the inner disc\nregions (~ 10-50 AU), while small (a < 10 nm) fully-hydrogenated nano-diamonds\nremain significantly cooler in these same regions.

In a monotone subset minimization\nproblem the input implicitly describes a non-empty set family over a universe\nof size $n$ which is closed under taking supersets. The task is to find a\nminimum cardinality set in this family. Broadly speaking, we use approximate\nmonotone local search to show that a parameterized $\\alpha$-approximation\nalgorithm that runs in $c^k \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k$ is the solution\nsize, can be used to derive an $\\alpha$-approximation randomized algorithm that\nruns in $d^n \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $d$ is the unique value in $d \\in\n(1,1+\\frac{c-1}{\\alpha})$ such that\n$\\mathcal{D}(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\|\\frac{d-1}{c-1})=\\frac{\\ln c}{\\alpha}$ and\n$\\mathcal{D}(a \\|b)$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Producers seek to create\ncontent that will be shown by the recommendation algorithm, which can impact\nboth the diversity and quality of their content. In this work, we investigate\nthe resulting supply-side equilibria in personalized content recommender\nsystems. We model users and content as $D$-dimensional vectors, the\nrecommendation algorithm as showing each user the content with highest dot\nproduct, and producers as maximizing the number of users who are recommended\ntheir content minus the cost of production. Two key features of our model are\nthat the producer decision space is multi-dimensional and the user base is\nheterogeneous, which contrasts with classical low-dimensional models.\n  Multi-dimensionality and heterogeneity create the potential for\nspecialization, where different producers create different types of content at\nequilibrium. Using a duality argument, we derive necessary and sufficient\nconditions for whether specialization occurs: these conditions depend on the\nextent to which users are heterogeneous and to which producers can perform well\non all dimensions at once without incurring a high cost. Then, we characterize\nthe distribution of content at equilibrium in concrete settings with two\npopulations of users. Lastly, we show that specialization can enable producers\nto achieve positive profit at equilibrium, which means that specialization can\nreduce the competitiveness of the marketplace.

Inspired by the recent discovery of\nthe periodic nuclear transient ASASSN-14ko, a promising candidate for a\nrepeating tidal disruption event (TDE), we study the tidal deformation of stars\napproaching SMBHs on eccentric orbits. With both analytical and hydrodynamics\nmethods, we show the overall tidal deformation of a star is similar to that in\na parabolic orbit provided that the eccentricity is above a critical value.\nThis allows one to make use of existing simulation libraries from parabolic\nencounters to calculate the mass fallback rate in eccentric TDEs. We find the\nflare structures of eccentric TDEs show a complicated dependence on both the\nSMBH mass and the orbital period. For stars orbiting SMBHs with relatively\nshort periods, we predict significantly shorter-lived duration flares than\nthose in parabolic TDEs, which can be used to predict repeating events if the\nmass of the SMBH can be independently measured. Using an adiabatic mass loss\nmodel, we study the flare evolution over multiple passages, and show the\nevolved stars can survive many more passages than main sequence stars.

The E-ADARP differs from\nthe classical DARP in two aspects: (i) a weighted-sum objective that minimizes\nboth total travel time and total excess user ride time; (ii) the employment of\nelectric autonomous vehicles and a partial recharging policy. This paper\npresents a highly-efficient labeling algorithm, which is integrated into Column\nGeneration (CG) to solve the E-ADARP. To handle (i), we introduce a\nfragment-based representation of paths. A novel approach is invoked to abstract\nfragments to arcs while ensuring excess-user-ride-time optimality. We then\nconstruct a new graph that preserves all feasible routes of the original graph\nby enumerating all feasible fragments, abstracting them to arcs, and connecting\nthem with each other, depots, and recharging stations in a feasible way. On the\nnew graph, partial recharging (ii) is tackled exactly by tailored Resource\nExtension Functions (REFs). We apply strong dominance rules and constant-time\nfeasibility checks to compute the shortest paths efficiently.

This cosmological application is based on the\nassumption of independence of the relation on redshift and luminosity. We want\nto test the reliability of this hypothesis by studying the spectroscopic\nproperties of high-redshift quasars in the X-ray and UV bands. We performed a\none-by-one analysis of a sample of 130 quasars at $z>$ 2.5 with high-quality\nX-ray and UV spectroscopic observations. We found that not only the X-ray to UV\ncorrelation still holds at these redshifts, but its intrinsic dispersion is as\nlow as 0.12 dex (previous works reached 0.20$-$0.22 dex). For a sample of\nquasars at $z\\sim$ 3 with particularly high-quality observations the dispersion\nfurther drops to 0.09 dex, a value entirely accountable for by intrinsic\nvariability and source geometry effects. The composite spectra of these\nquasars, in both the X-rays and the UV, do not show any difference with respect\nto the average spectra of quasars at lower redshifts. The absence of any\nspectral difference between high- and low-$z$ quasars and the tightness of the\nX-ray to UV relation suggests that no evolutionary effects are present in the\nrelation.

Other\nmotivations include creating engaging multi-sensory resources, for education\nand public engagement, and making astronomy more accessible to people who are\nblind or have low vision, promoting their participation in science and related\ncareers. We describe potential benefits of sound within these contexts and\nprovide an overview of the nearly 100 sound-based astronomy projects that we\nidentified.

The latter involves exciting\nhigh orbital eccentricity, allowing sufficiently close passages with the host\nstar to raise circularising tides in the planet. We present an analytic\nframework for quantifying the role of dynamical encounters in high density\nenvironments during HEM. We show that encounters can enhance or suppress HEM,\ndepending on the local stellar density and the initial semi-major axis $a_0$.\nFor moderate densities, external perturbations can excite large eccentricities\nthat allow a planet to circularise over the stellar lifetime.

To understand it in such a system, we carry out theory\nand simulations of a tagged particle moving on a two-dimensional periodic\npotential energy surface, both in the presence and absence of noise. Langevin\ndynamics simulations at multiple temperatures are carried out to obtain the\ndiffusion coefficient of a solute particle. Friction is varied from zero to\nlarge values. Diffusive motion emerges in the limit of long times, even in the\nabsence of noise, although the trajectory is found to remain correlated over a\nlong time. This correlation is manifested in correlated returns to the starting\nminima following a scattering by surrounding maxima. Noise destroys this\ncorrelation, induces chaos, and increases diffusion at small friction.\nDiffusion thus exhibits a non-monotonic friction dependence at the intermediate\nvalue of the damping, ultimately converging to our theoretically predicted\nvalue. The latter is obtained by using the well-established relation between\ndiffusion and random walk. An excellent agreement is obtained between theory\nand simulations in the high friction limit, but not so in the intermediate\nregime. The rate of escape from one cell to another is obtained from the\nmultidimensional rate theory of Langer. We find that enhanced dimensionality\nplays an important role.

In this work, we aim to make a differential comparison of the\nneutron-capture and p-process element molybdenum (Mo) in the stellar\npopulations in the local disk(s) and the bulge, focusing on minimising possible\nsystematic effects in the analysis. Methods. The stellar sample consists of 45\nbulge and 291 local disk K-giants, observed with high-resolution optical\nspectra. The abundances are determined by fitting synthetic spectra using the\nSME-code. The disk sample is separated into thin- and thick-disk components\nusing a combination of abundances and kinematics. The cosmic origin of Mo is\ninvestigated and discussed by comparing with previous published abundances of\nMo and the neutron-capture elements cerium (Ce) and europium (Eu). Results. We\ndetermine reliable Mo abundances for 35 bulge and 282 disk giants with a\ntypical uncertainty of [Mo/Fe]~0.2 and ~0.1 dex for the bulge and disk,\nrespectively. Conclusions. We find that the bulge possibly is enhanced in\n[Mo/Fe] compared to the thick disk, which we do not observe in either [Ce/Fe]\nnor [Eu/Fe].

Hence, the larger\nthe cluster the less we know about where activation in the cluster is.\nRosenblatt et al. (2018) proposed a post-hoc inference method, All-resolutions\nInference (ARI), that addresses this paradox by estimating the number of active\nvoxels of any brain region. ARI allows users to choose arbitrary brain regions\nand returns a simultaneous lower confidence bound of the true discovery\nproportion (TDP) for each of them, retaining control of the family-wise error\nrate. ARI does not, however, guide users to regions with high enough TDP. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that outputs all maximal\nsupra-threshold clusters, for which ARI gives a TDP lower confidence bound that\nis at least a chosen threshold, for any number of thresholds that need not be\nchosen a priori nor all at once. After a preprocessing step in linearithmic\ntime, the algorithm only takes linear time in the size of its output. We\ndemonstrate the algorithm with an application to two fMRI datasets.

A long standing problem is that flat density profiles, indicative of the\nISM, are often found at lower radii than expected for a massive star\nprogenitor. Furthermore, the presence of both wind-like environments at high\nradii and ISM-like environments at low radii remains a mystery.

Among them, the so-called elastocaloric effect\n(eC) consists of the thermal response, $\\Delta T$, of a material under strain\ndeformation. In this work, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of\nthe eC in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are presented over a large temperature span.\nThe efficiency of the CNTs as solid refrigerators is investigated by simulating\ntheir eC in a model of refrigerator machine running under Otto-like\nthermodynamic cycles (two adiabatic expansion/contraction plus two isochoric\nheat exchange processes) operating at temperatures, $T_\\mbox{O}$, ranging from\n300 to 2000 K. The coefficient-of-performance (COP), defined as the ratio of\nheat removed from the cold region to the total work performed by the system per\nthermodynamic cycle, is calculated for each value of $T_\\mbox{O}$. Our results\nshow a non-linear dependence of $\\Delta T$ on $T_\\mbox{O}$, reaching a minimum\nvalue of about 30 K for $T_\\mbox{O}$ between 500 and 600 K, then growing and\nconverging to a linear dependence on $T_\\mbox{O}$ for large temperatures. The\nCOP of CNTs is shown to remain about the same and approximately equal to 8.\nThese results are shown to be weakly depend on CNT diameter and chirality but\nnot on length. The isothermal entropy change of the CNTs due to the eC is also\nestimated and shown to depend non-linearly on $T_\\mbox{O}$ values. These\nresults predict that CNTs can be considered versatile nanoscale solid\nrefrigerators able to efficiently work over a large temperature span.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 19:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

We present a\ntime-dependent Comptonisation model that fits the energy-dependent\nrms-amplitude and phase-lag spectra of low-frequency QPOs in black-hole (BH)\nLMXBs. We model the accretion disc as a multi-temperature blackbody source\nemitting soft photons which are then Compton up-scattered in a spherical\ncorona, including feedback of Comptonised photons that return to the disc. We\ncompare our results with those obtained with a model in which the seed-photons\nsource is a spherical blackbody: at low energies the time-averaged, rms and\nphase-lag spectra are smoother for the disk-blackbody than for a blackbody,\nwhile at high energies both models give similar spectra.

Here, we mimic these\nstrategies to design efficient soft-hard interfaces using voxel-based\nmulti-material 3D printing. We designed several types of soft-hard interfaces\nwith interfacial functional gradients and various types of bio-inspired\ninterlocking mechanisms. The geometrical designs were based on triply periodic\nminimal surfaces (i.e., octo, diamond, and gyroid), collagen-like triple\nhelices, and randomly distributed particles.

Increasing the gradient\nlength was only beneficial when the resulting interface geometry reduced strain\nconcentrations (e.g., in collagen and particles).

For example, on a\nwhole slide image (WSI), the cross-sectional areas of glomeruli can be 64 times\nlarger than that of the peritubular capillaries, making it impractical to\nsegment both objects on the same patch, at the same scale. To handle this\nscaling issue, prior studies have typically trained multiple segmentation\nnetworks in order to match the optimal pixel resolution of heterogeneous tissue\ntypes. This multi-network solution is resource-intensive and fails to model the\nspatial relationship between tissue types. In this paper, we propose the\nOmni-Seg+ network, a scale-aware dynamic neural network that achieves\nmulti-object (six tissue types) and multi-scale (5X to 40X scale) pathological\nimage segmentation via a single neural network. The contribution of this paper\nis three-fold: (1) a novel scale-aware controller is proposed to generalize the\ndynamic neural network from single-scale to multi-scale; (2) semi-supervised\nconsistency regularization of pseudo-labels is introduced to model the\ninter-scale correlation of unannotated tissue types into a single end-to-end\nlearning paradigm; and (3) superior scale-aware generalization is evidenced by\ndirectly applying a model trained on human kidney images to mouse kidney\nimages, without retraining. By learning from ~150,000 human pathological image\npatches from six tissue types at three different resolutions, our approach\nachieved superior segmentation performance according to human visual assessment\nand evaluation of image-omics (i.e., spatial transcriptomics).

Generalizing ordinary graph minors\nto hypergraphs, we say that a hypergraph $H_1$ is a minor of a hypergraph\n$H_2$, if a hypergraph isomorphic to $H_1$ can be obtained from $H_2$ via a\nfinite sequence of vertex- and hyperedge-deletions, and hyperedge contractions.\nWe first show that a weak extension of Hadwiger's conjecture to hypergraphs\nholds true: For every $t \\ge 1$, there exists a finite (smallest) integer\n$h(t)$ such that every hypergraph with no $K_t$-minor is $h(t)$-colorable, and\nwe prove $$\\left\\lceil\\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\\right\\rceil \\le h(t) \\le 2g(t)$$ where\n$g(t)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of graphs with no $K_t$-minor.\nUsing the recent result by Delcourt and Postle that $g(t)=O(t \\log \\log t)$,\nthis yields $h(t)=O(t \\log \\log t)$.

This result motivates a\ngeneralization of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with this structure on the\nagent's returns, which we call Affine-Reward MDPs. A stronger constraint on\npreferences is needed to recover the commonly used cumulative sum of scalar\nrewards in MDPs. A yet stronger constraint simplifies the utility function for\ngoal-seeking agents in the form of a difference in some function of states that\nwe call potential functions. Our necessary and sufficient conditions demystify\nthe reward hypothesis that underlies the design of rational agents in\nreinforcement learning by adding an axiom to the VNM rationality axioms and\nmotivates new directions for AI research involving sequential decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 21:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Because synthesis algorithms are limited in scalability by their\nexponentially growing run time and memory requirements, application to circuits\nwider than 5 qubits requires divide-and-conquer partitioning of circuits into\nsmaller components. In this work, we will explore methods to reduce the depth\n(program run time) and multi-qubit gate instruction count of wide (16-100\nqubit) mapped quantum circuits optimized with synthesis. Reducing circuit depth\nand gate count directly impacts program performance and the likelihood of\nsuccessful execution for quantum circuits on parallel quantum machines.\n  We present TopAS, a topology aware synthesis tool built with the\n\\emph{BQSKit} framework that preconditions quantum circuits before mapping.\nPartitioned subcircuits are optimized and fitted to sparse qubit subtopologies\nin a way that balances the often opposing demands of synthesis and mapping\nalgorithms. This technique can be used to reduce the depth and gate count of\nwide quantum circuits mapped to the sparse qubit topologies of Google and IBM.\nCompared to large scale synthesis algorithms which focus on optimizing quantum\ncircuits after mapping, TopAS is able to reduce depth by an average of 35.2%\nand CNOT gate count an average of 11.5% when targeting a 2D mesh topology. When\ncompared with traditional quantum compilers using peephole optimization and\nmapping algorithms from the Qiskit or $t|ket\\rangle$ toolkits, our approach is\nable to provide significant improvements in performance, reducing CNOT counts\nby 30.3% and depth by 38.2% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 21:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 21:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In this letter, we explore the distinctiveness of event streams from\na small subset of pixels (in the tens or hundreds).

Our results show that our approach achieves\ncompetitive performance when compared to several baseline methods on those\ndatasets, and is particularly well suited for compute- and energy-constrained\nplatforms such as interplanetary rovers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 06:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 01:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-17"}

For\nsuperconductors, the quantum geometry is clarified to appear in the superfluid\nweight, an essential quantity of superconductivity. Although the superfluid\nweight was considered to be determined by the Fermi-liquid contribution for a\nlong time, the geometric contribution is not negligible in some superconductors\nsuch as artificial flat-band systems and monolayer FeSe. While the superfluid\nweight is essential for many superconducting phenomena related to the center of\nmass momenta of Cooper pairs (CMMCP), the full scope of the quantum geometric\neffect on superconductivity remains unresolved.

In order to\ndetermine the optimal thrusting structure, a recently developed bang-bang and\nsingular optimal control (BBSOC) method is employed together with\nmultiple-domain Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature collocation. Key results\nobtained in this study include not only the number of switches in the optimized\nthrust, but also the total impulse. Furthermore, it is found that, as the\nmaximum allowable thrust acceleration decreases, the total impulse is less than\nthe total impulse obtained from a previous study where a burn-coast-burn\nthrusting structure was assumed a priori. For each type of transfer a\nparticular value of maximum allowable thrust acceleration is chosen to\nhighlight in more detail the key features of the optimal solutions. This study\nprovides improved results over previous studies and provides improved insight\ninto the optimal thrusting structure required in order to accomplish each type\nof orbital transfer using the least amount of fuel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 01:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The dependence of slip length for water on\nthe types of supporting substrates and thickness of carbonous layer, which is\ncritical for applications such as sustainable cooling of electronic devices,\nremains unknown. In this paper, using colloidal probe atomic force microscope,\nwe measured the slip length of water on graphene ls supported by hydrophilic\nand hydrophobic substrates, i.e., SiO2 and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS). The\nls on single-layer graphene supported by SiO2 is found to be 1.6~1.9 nm, and by\nOTS is 8.5~0.9 nm. With the thickness of few-layer graphene increases to 3~4\nlayers, both ls gradually converge to the value of graphite (4.3~3.5 nm). Such\nthickness dependence is termed slip length translucency. Further, ls is found\nto decrease by about 70% with the temperature increases from 300 K to 350 K for\n2-layer graphene supported by SiO2. These observations are explained by\nanalysis based on Green-Kubo relation and McLachlan theory. Our results provide\nthe first set of reference values for the slip length of water on supported\nfew-layer graphene.

In this sense, cosmological\napplications of supergravity can be the arena for probing outcomes of\nsupergravity. It is also attractive that supergravity can appear as a\nlow-energy effective theory of superstrings, a possible candidate of quantum\ngravity. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to build inflationary models in\nsupergravity due to difficulties arising mainly from the extremely constrained\nform of supergravity scalar potentials, complicated structure of interaction\nterms, and excessive scalar degrees of freedom. These obstructions generally\nmake it challenging to contrive a desirable inflationary trajectory, perform\nthe moduli stabilization to obtain the stable de-Sitter phase, and make extra\nscalars to be much heavier than the Hubble scale to get single field inflation.\nBesides, supergravity predicts many non-renormalizable interactions. It thus\narises as effective field theory (EFT) which can be valid only up to typical\nenergies $E$ below its ultraviolet cutoff scale $\\Lambda_{cut}$, and up to some\naccuracy of $(E/\\Lambda_{cut})^n$ that we desire. We note that these\nnon-renormalizable terms may affect physics during and/or after inflation. From\nsuch points of view, it is very important in supergravity to find the method\nfor relaxing the scalar potentials, and flexible scalar field dynamics\n(particularly for inflaton), and examine self-consistency at the quantum level.\nIn this thesis, therefore, we construct locally supersymmetric effective field\ntheories of inflation (with KKLT string background) by taking into account\nrecently-proposed reformulations of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity that can\nenlarge the space of scalar potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 03:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

These observations allowed us to compare the\nspatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission,\nmodel the [C II] line data-cube using 3DBarolo, and measure the [C II]\nluminosity and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities in the galaxy\nsubregions. The system is found to be composed of a main central source, a\nfainter north extension, and candidate [C II] companions located 10-kpc away.\nWe find similar rest-frame UV and [C II] spatial distributions, suggesting that\nthe [C II] emission emerges from the star-forming regions.

It is challenging to measure the\nproperties of the small-scale ISM magnetic fields (magnetic fields at scales\nsmaller than the turbulence driving scale).

Two common issues in FL,\nnamely data heterogeneity from the local perspective and class imbalance from\nthe global perspective have limited FL's performance. These two coupling\nproblems are under-explored, and existing few studies may not be sufficiently\nrealistic to model data distributions in practical sceneries (e.g. medical\nsceneries). One common observation is that the overall class distribution\nacross clients is imbalanced (e.g. common vs. rare diseases) and data tend to\nbe agglomerated to those more advanced clients (i.e., the data agglomeration\neffect), which cannot be modeled by existing settings. Inspired by real medical\nimaging datasets, we identify and formulate a new and more realistic data\ndistribution denoted as L2 distribution where global class distribution is\nhighly imbalanced and data distributions across clients are imbalanced but\nforming a certain degree of data agglomeration. To pursue effective FL under\nthis distribution, we propose a novel privacy-preserving framework named FedIIC\nthat calibrates deep models to alleviate bias caused by imbalanced training. To\ncalibrate the feature extractor part, intra-client contrastive learning with a\nmodified similarity measure and inter-client contrastive learning guided by\nshared global prototypes are introduced to produce a uniform embedding\ndistribution of all classes across clients. To calibrate the classification\nheads, a softmax cross entropy loss with difficulty-aware logit adjustment is\nconstructed to ensure balanced decision boundaries of all classes. Experimental\nresults on publicly-available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of\nFedIIC in dealing with both the proposed realistic modeling and the existing\nmodeling of the two coupling problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 07:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 06:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

Classical speaker verification (SV) approaches estimate a\nfixed-dimensional embedding from a speech utterance that encodes the speaker's\nvoice characteristics. A speaker is verified if his/her voice embedding is\nsufficiently similar to the embedding of the claimed speaker. However, such\napproaches assume that only a single speaker exists in the input. The presence\nof concurrent speakers is likely to have detrimental effects on the\nperformance. To address SV in a multi-speaker environment, we propose an\nend-to-end deep learning-based SV system that detects whether the target\nspeaker exists within an input or not. First, an embedding is estimated from a\nreference utterance to represent the target's characteristics. Second,\nframe-level features are estimated from the input mixture. The reference\nembedding is then fused frame-wise with the mixture's features to allow\ndistinguishing the target from other speakers on a frame basis. Finally, the\nfused features are used to predict whether the target speaker is active in the\nspeech segment or not. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method\noutperforms the x-vector in multi-speaker conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 07:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

We provide a\nlocal clustering oracle for signed graphs with such a clear community\nstructure, that can answer membership queries, i.e., \"Given a vertex $v$, which\ncommunity does $v$ belong to?\", in sublinear time by reading only a small\nportion of the graph.

Along this line, existing methods usually assume that the graph\nstructure (or the adjacency matrix), which determines the aggregation manner of\ngraph neural network, is fixed either by definition or self-learning. However,\nthe interactions of variables can be dynamic and evolutionary in real-world\nscenarios. Furthermore, the interactions of time series are quite different if\nthey are observed at different time scales. To equip the graph neural network\nwith a flexible and practical graph structure, in this paper, we investigate\nhow to model the evolutionary and multi-scale interactions of time series. In\nparticular, we first provide a hierarchical graph structure cooperated with the\ndilated convolution to capture the scale-specific correlations among time\nseries. Then, a series of adjacency matrices are constructed under a recurrent\nmanner to represent the evolving correlations at each layer. Moreover, a\nunified neural network is provided to integrate the components above to get the\nfinal prediction. In this way, we can capture the pair-wise correlations and\ntemporal dependency simultaneously.

In the transition regime, the UGKWP can achieve\na smooth transition between the Eulerian and Lagrangian limiting formulation.\nMore importantly, the weights of mass distributions from analytical wave and\ndiscrete particle are related to the local $Kn$ by $\\exp(-1/Kn)$ for wave and\n$(1-\\exp(-1/Kn))$ for discrete particle. As a result, the UGKWP provides an\noptimal modeling for capturing the particle phase in terms of physical accuracy\nand numerical efficiency. In the numerical simulation, the UGKWP does not need\nany prior division of dilute/dense regions, which makes it suitable for the\nfluidized bed problem, where the dilute/transition/dense regions\ninstantaneously coexist and are dynamically interconvertible. In this paper,\nbased on the GKS-UGKWP formulation two lab-scale fluidization cases are\nsimulated in 3D and the simulation results are compared with the experimental\nmeasurements. The typical heterogeneous flow features of the fluidized bed are\nwell captured and the statistics are in good agreement with experiment data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

One challenge is that\nexisting approaches use coverage to guide generation, but native libraries run\nas black boxes to Python code with no execution information. Another is that\ndynamic binary instrumentation reduces testing performance as it needs to\nmonitor both native libraries and the Python virtual machine.\n  To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an automated test case\ngeneration approach that works at the Python code layer. Our insight is that\nmany path conditions in native libraries are for processing input data\nstructures through interacting with the VM. In our approach, we instrument the\nPython Interpreter to monitor the interactions between native libraries and VM,\nderive constraints on the structures, and then use the constraints to guide\ntest case generation. We implement our approach in a tool named PyCing and\napply it to six widely-used Python projects. The experimental results reveal\nthat with the structure constraint guidance, PyCing can cover more execution\npaths than existing test cases and state-of-the-art tools. Also, with the\ncheckers in the testing framework Pytest, PyCing can identify segmentation\nfaults in 10 Python interfaces and memory leaks in 9.

In some languages,\nthe types are unreliable; in others, communication across type boundaries can\nbe extremely expensive; and still others allow only limited forms of\ninteroperability. The research community is actively seeking a sound, fast, and\nexpressive approach to gradual typing.\n  Inquiry: This paper describes Static Python, a language developed by\nengineers at Instagram that has proven itself sound, fast, and reasonably\nexpressive in production. Static Python's approach to gradual types is\nessentially a programmer-tunable combination of the concrete and transient\napproaches from the literature. Concrete types provide full soundness and low\nperformance overhead, but impose nonlocal constraints. Transient types are\nsound in a shallow sense and easier to use; they help to bridge the gap between\nuntyped code and typed concrete code.\n  Approach: We evaluate the language in its current state and develop a model\nthat captures the essence of its approach to gradual types. We draw upon\npersonal communication, bug reports, and the Static Python regression test\nsuite to develop this model.\n  Knowledge: Our main finding is that the gradual soundness that arises from a\nmix of concrete and transient types is an effective way to lower the\nmaintenance cost of the concrete approach. We also find that method-based JIT\ntechnology can eliminate the costs of the transient approach. On a more\ntechnical level, this paper describes two contributions: a model of Static\nPython and a performance evaluation of Static Python. The process of\nformalization found several errors in the implementation, including fatal\nerrors.\n  Grounding: Our model of Static Python is implemented in PLT Redex and tested\nusing property-based soundness tests and 265 tests from the Static Python\nregression suite. This paper includes a small core of the model to convey the\nmain ideas of the Static Python approach and its soundness. Our performance\nclaims are based on production experience in the Instagram web server.\nMigrations to Static Python in the server have caused a 3.7\\% increase in\nrequests handled per second at maximum CPU load.\n  Importance: Static Python is the first sound gradual language whose\npiece-meal application to a realistic codebase has consistently improved\nperformance. Other language designers may wish to replicate its approach,\nespecially those who currently maintain unsound gradual languages and are\nseeking a path to soundness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Baldom\\'a, Castej\\'on\nand Seara [BCS13] gave an asymptotic formula for the distance between the one\ndimensional invariant manifolds in a suitable transverse section. This distance\nis exponentially small with respect to the perturbative parameter, and it\ndepends on what is usually called a Stokes constant. The non-vanishing of this\nconstant implies that the distance between the invariant manifolds at the\nsection is not zero. However, up to now there do not exist analytic techniques\nto check that condition.

This propagation is found to be stochastic, i.e.\nevery coalescence event does not necessarily trigger another. To study how the\nlocal probabilistic propagation affects the dynamics of the avalanche, as a\nwhole, a stochastic agent based model is used. Taking as input, i) how the\ndroplets are packed (configuration) and ii) a measure of local probabilistic\npropagation (experimentally derived; function of fluid and other system\nparameters), the model predicts the expected size distribution of avalanches.\nIn this article, we investigate how droplet configuration affects the avalanche\ndynamics.

Large variations in the avalanche dynamics\nare observed when droplet packing are different, even when the other system\nproperties (number of droplets, fluid properties, channel geometry, etc.) are\nkept constant. Bidisperse emulsions show less variation in the dynamics and\nthey are surprisingly more stable than monodisperse emulsions.

However,\ncurrent researches exclusively focus on pushing the accuracy improvement of\nPseudo-Lidar by taking the advantage of complex and time-consuming neural\nnetworks. Seldom explore the profound characteristics of Pseudo-Lidar\nrepresentation to obtain the promoting opportunities. In this paper, we dive\ndeep into the pseudo Lidar representation and argue that the performance of 3D\nobject detection is not fully dependent on the high precision stereo depth\nestimation. We demonstrate that even for the unreliable depth estimation, with\nproper data processing and refining, it can achieve comparable 3D object\ndetection accuracy. With this finding, we further show the possibility that\nutilizing fast but inaccurate stereo matching algorithms in the Pseudo-Lidar\nsystem to achieve low latency responsiveness. In the experiments, we develop a\nsystem with a less powerful stereo matching predictor and adopt the proposed\nrefinement schemes to improve the accuracy. The evaluation on the KITTI\nbenchmark shows that the presented system achieves competitive accuracy to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches with only 23 ms computing, showing it is a suitable\ncandidate for deploying to real car-hold applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 09:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

These large\nfluctuations are termed as Extreme Events (EE). The EEs may be positive or\nnegative depending on the impact of these factors. During such events, the\nstock price time series is found to be nonstationary. Hence, the Hilbert-Huang\ntransformation (HHT) is used to identify EEs based on their high instantaneous\nenergy ($IE$) concentration. The analysis shows that the $IE$ concentration in\nthe stock price is very high during both positive and negative EE with\n$IE>E_{\\mu}+4\\sigma,$ where $E_{\\mu}$ and $\\sigma$ are the mean energy and\nstandard deviation of energy, respectively.

When\naccounting for the accretion luminosity of the planetary embryo from pebble\naccretion, the thermal feedback on the surrounding gas leads to the formation\nof an anticyclonic vortex. Since the vortex forms at the location of the\nplanet, this has significant consequences for the planet's growth: as dust\ndrifts towards the pressure maximum at the centre of the vortex, which is\ninitially co-located with the planet, a rapid accretion rate is achieved, in a\ndistinct phase of ``vortex-assisted'' pebble accretion. Once the vortex\nseparates from the planet due to interactions with the disc, it accumulates\ndust, shutting off accretion onto the planet.

Taking into account the\nsuppression of the heavy quark spin flips in the transitions between two vector\nand two pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium systems, the enhancements in the\ndi-$\\eta_c$ spectrum should be different from those seen in the di-$J/\\psi$\nchannel. Experimental study of the di-$\\eta_c$ channel should be useful for\ndisentangling the nature of the fully-heavy tetraquark systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 10:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Using the\nAnderson--Darling test, we compared the distributions of extra-Galactic\ndispersion measure ($DM_{\\rm E}$) of non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs and all\nFRBs. It was found that the $ DM_{\\rm E}$ values of three sub-samples are\nlog-normally distributed. The $DM_{\\rm E}$ of repeaters and non-repeaters were\ndrawn from a different distribution on basis of the Mann--Whitney--Wilcoxon\ntest. In addition, assuming that the non-repeating FRBs identified currently\nmay be potentially repeators, i.e., the repeating FRBs to be universal and\nrepresentative, one can utilize the averaged fluence of repeating FRBs as an\nindication from which to derive an apparent intensity distribution function\n(IDF) with a power-law index of $a_1=$ $1.10\\pm 0.14$ ($a_2=$ $1.01\\pm 0.16$,\nthe observed fluence as a statistical variant), which is in good agreement with\nthe previous IDF of 16 non-repeating FRBs found by Li et al.

Current state-of-the-art methods often\naddress these difficulties by replacing the posterior density with a smooth\napproximation that is amenable to efficient exploration by using Langevin\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. An alternative approach is based on\ndata augmentation and relaxation, where auxiliary variables are introduced in\norder to construct an approximate augmented posterior distribution that is\namenable to efficient exploration by Gibbs sampling. This paper proposes a new\naccelerated proximal MCMC method called latent space SK-ROCK (ls SK-ROCK),\nwhich tightly combines the benefits of the two aforementioned strategies.\nAdditionally, instead of viewing the augmented posterior distribution as an\napproximation of the original model, we propose to consider it as a\ngeneralisation of this model. Following on from this, we empirically show that\nthere is a range of values for the relaxation parameter for which the accuracy\nof the model improves, and propose a stochastic optimisation algorithm to\nautomatically identify the optimal amount of relaxation for a given problem. In\nthis regime, ls SK-ROCK converges faster than competing approaches from the\nstate of the art, and also achieves better accuracy since the underlying\naugmented Bayesian model has a higher Bayesian evidence.

The principal characteristic of\nintrospective models is the adversarial learning of VAE, where the encoder\nattempts to distinguish between the real and the fake (i.e., synthesized)\nimages. However, due to the unavailability of an effective metric to evaluate\nthe difference between the real and the fake images, the posterior collapse and\nthe vanishing gradient problem still exist, reducing the fidelity of the\nsynthesized images. In this paper, we propose a new variation of IntroVAE\ncalled Adversarial Similarity Distance Introspective Variational Autoencoder\n(AS-IntroVAE). We theoretically analyze the vanishing gradient problem and\nconstruct a new Adversarial Similarity Distance (AS-Distance) using the\n2-Wasserstein distance and the kernel trick. With weight annealing on\nAS-Distance and KL-Divergence, the AS-IntroVAE are able to generate stable and\nhigh-quality images. The posterior collapse problem is addressed by making\nper-batch attempts to transform the image so that it better fits the prior\ndistribution in the latent space. Compared with the per-image approach, this\nstrategy fosters more diverse distributions in the latent space, allowing our\nmodel to produce images of great diversity. Comprehensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AS-IntroVAE on image\ngeneration and reconstruction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 11:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 06:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 10:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

One of the proposed advantages of liquid democracy is that, in general,\nit is assumed that voters will delegate their vote to others that are better\ninformed, which leads to more informed and better decisions. Considering an\naudience from various knowledge domains, we provide an accessible high-level\nanalysis of a prominent critique of liquid democracy by Caragiannis and Micha.\nCaragiannis and Micha's critique contains three central topics: 1. Analysis\nusing their $\\alpha$-delegation model, which does not assume delegation to the\nmore informed; 2. Novel delegation network structures where it is advantageous\nto delegate to the less informed rather than the more informed; and 3. Due to\nNP hardness, the implied impracticability of a social network obtaining an\noptimal delegation structure. We show that in the real world, Caragiannis and\nMicha's critique of liquid democracy has little or no relevance. Respectively,\nour critique is based on: 1. The identification of incorrect\n$\\alpha$-delegation model assumptions; 2. A lack of novel delegation structures\nand their effect in a real-world implementation of liquid democracy, which\nwould be guaranteed with constraints that sensibly distribute voting power; and\n3. The irrelevance of an optimal delegation structure if the correct result is\nguaranteed regardless. We conclude that Caragiannis and Micha's critique has no\nsignificant negative relevance to the proposition of liquid democracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 11:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

We show that applying a multi-label one-vs-all loss reveals\nclassification ambiguity and reduces model overconfidence. The introduced SLOVA\n(Single Label One-Vs-All) model redefines typical one-vs-all predictive\nprobabilities to a single label situation, where only one class is the correct\nanswer. The proposed classifier is confident only if a single class has a high\nprobability and other probabilities are negligible. Unlike the typical softmax\nfunction, SLOVA naturally detects out-of-distribution samples if the\nprobabilities of all other classes are small. The model is additionally\nfine-tuned with exponential calibration, which allows us to precisely align the\nconfidence score with model accuracy. We verify our approach on three tasks.\nFirst, we demonstrate that SLOVA is competitive with the state-of-the-art on\nin-distribution calibration. Second, the performance of SLOVA is robust under\ndataset shifts. Finally, our approach performs extremely well in the detection\nof out-of-distribution samples.

Multiple probes\nare launched with a fixed launch infrastructure, and download of scientific\ndata occurs following target encounter and data collection. Assuming the\nprimary goal is to reliably recover a larger volume of collected scientific\ndata with a smaller data latency (elapsed time from launch to complete recovery\nof the data), it is shown that there is an efficient frontier where volume\ncannot be increased for a given latency and latency cannot be reduced for a\ngiven volume. For each probe launch, increasing the volume along this frontier\nis achieved by increasing the probe mass, which results in a reduced probe\nspeed. Thus choosing the highest feasible probe speed generally does not\nachieve an efficient tradeoff of volume and latency. Along this frontier the\ntotal distance traveled to the completion of data download does not vary\nsignificantly, implying that the download time duration is approximately a\nfixed fraction of the launch-to-target transit time. Due to longer propulsion\nduration when probe mass is increased, increasing data volume incurs a cost in\nthe total launch energy expended, but with favorable economies of scale. An\nimportant characteristic of any probe technology is the scaling law that\nrelates probe mass to transmit data rate, as this affects details of the\nefficient frontier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 17:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

The proposed approach integrates the random walk strategy with graph\nneural networks. The new method utilizes breadth-first random walk search to\ncapture homophily information and depth-first search to collect heterophily\ninformation. It replaces the conventional neighborhoods with path-based\nneighborhoods and introduces a new path-based aggregator based on Recurrent\nNeural Networks. These designs make RAW-GNN suitable for both homophily and\nheterophily graphs. Extensive experimental results showed that the new method\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of homophily and heterophily\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 12:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

As a result, many formalisms\nhave been proposed or adapted so as to consider non-monotonicity, with only a\nlimited number of works and researchers performing any sort of comparison among\nthem. A non-monotonic formalism is one that allows the retraction of previous\nconclusions or claims, from premises, in light of new evidence, offering some\ndesirable flexibility when dealing with uncertainty. This research article\nfocuses on evaluating the inferential capacity of defeasible argumentation, a\nformalism particularly envisioned for modelling non-monotonic reasoning. In\naddition to this, fuzzy reasoning and expert systems, extended for handling\nnon-monotonicity of reasoning, are selected and employed as baselines, due to\ntheir vast and accepted use within the AI community. Computational trust was\nselected as the domain of application of such models. Trust is an ill-defined\nconstruct, hence, reasoning applied to the inference of trust can be seen as\nnon-monotonic. Inference models were designed to assign trust scalars to\neditors of the Wikipedia project. In particular, argument-based models\ndemonstrated more robustness than those built upon the baselines despite the\nknowledge bases or datasets employed. This study contributes to the body of\nknowledge through the exploitation of defeasible argumentation and its\ncomparison to similar approaches. The practical use of such approaches coupled\nwith a modular design that facilitates similar experiments was exemplified and\ntheir respective implementations made publicly available on GitHub [120, 121].\nThis work adds to previous works, empirically enhancing the generalisability of\ndefeasible argumentation as a compelling approach to reason with quantitative\ndata and uncertain knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 12:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

We present a solution to\nhandling non-stationarity that is suitable for deployment at scale, to provide\nbusiness operators with automated adaptive optimisation. Our solution aims to\nprovide interpretable learning that can be trusted by humans, whilst responding\nto non-stationarity to minimise regret. To this end, we develop an adaptive\nBayesian learning agent that employs a novel form of dynamic memory. It enables\ninterpretability through statistical hypothesis testing, by targeting a set\npoint of statistical power when comparing rewards and adjusting its memory\ndynamically to achieve this power. By design, the agent is agnostic to\ndifferent kinds of non-stationarity. Using numerical simulations, we compare\nits performance against an existing proposal and show that, under multiple\nnon-stationary scenarios, our agent correctly adapts to real changes in the\ntrue rewards. In all bandit solutions, there is an explicit trade-off between\nlearning and achieving maximal performance. Our solution sits on a different\npoint on this trade-off when compared to another similarly robust approach: we\nprioritise interpretability, which relies on more learning, at the cost of some\nregret.

To this end, we propose a Face\nRestoration Searching Network (FRSNet) to adaptively search the suitable\nfeature extraction architecture within our specified search space, which can\ndirectly contribute to the restoration quality.

In this way,\nMFPSNet takes full advantage of semantic-level (parsing maps), geometric-level\n(facial heatmaps), reference-level (facial dictionaries) and pixel-level\n(degraded images) information and thus generates faithful and realistic images.\nQuantitative and qualitative experiments show that MFPSNet performs favorably\non both synthetic and real-world datasets against the state-of-the-art BFR\nmethods.

Specifically, we collect a large-scale unlabelled gait\ndataset GaitLU-1M consisting of 1.02M walking sequences and propose a\nconceptually simple yet empirically powerful baseline model GaitSSB.\nExperimentally, we evaluate the pre-trained model on four widely-used gait\nbenchmarks, CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D with or without transfer\nlearning. The unsupervised results are comparable to or even better than the\nearly model-based and GEI-based methods. After transfer learning, our method\noutperforms existing methods by a large margin in most cases. Theoretically, we\ndiscuss the critical issues for gait-specific contrastive framework and present\nsome insights for further study. As far as we know, GaitLU-1M is the first\nlarge-scale unlabelled gait dataset, and GaitSSB is the first method that\nachieves remarkable unsupervised results on the aforementioned benchmarks. The\nsource code of GaitSSB will be integrated into OpenGait which is available at\nhttps://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 12:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

To calculate the\nentropy, a new ordering of a two-dimensional data array (spiral ordering) is\nproposed, which makes it possible to obtain the entropy of a physical field\nsimultaneously for several spatial scales. In the second stage, the entropy of\nthe physical field is used to initialize the distribution of optimal sensor\nlocations.

It is found that the communication gain by exploiting the\ncorrelation between worker nodes is significant for SignSGD, and a high\ndistortion of gradient estimator can achieve low total communication cost in\ngradient compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 13:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Then, following the chronological order\nof fracton research, we will establish the gauged spin model picture of gapped\nfracton theories. Next (after introducing lattice gauge theory) we will cover\nthe developments on the tensor gauge theory front in describing gapless fracton\ntheories. We then explain how conservation of dipole moment is key in the\ndevelopment of field-theoretic descriptions of fracton models, and conclude by\nproviding future plans for work on gauging such field theories. Finally, we\npoint out two more future plans: one being an established theoretical advance\nwhich in fact inspired this work, and the other being exciting experimental\nadvances in ultracold atomic physics which could lead to the physical\nrealization of fracton physics.

The dynamic contact angle changes with the capillary number defined\nby the contact-line speed, and the correlation also depends on the equilibrium\ncontact angle measured at the static state. This correlation is usually\nrequired as an input to the traditional solvers based on the Navier-Stokes-like\nequations, but it is simulated as an output in the current study using the\nlattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in a displacement process of two-immiscible\nfluids. The macroscopic theory and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation had\nshown a linear scaling law for the cosine of dynamic contact angle, which is\nalso observed in the previous LBM study in a short range of small capillary\nnumbers and for two neutral wetting conditions. However, our study shows that\nthis linear scaling law holds in the whole range of capillary numbers and is\nuniversal for all wetting conditions. In a special case of complete wetting\n(spreading) with a zero equilibrium contact angle, a thin film of the wetting\nfluid occurs when the wettability is very strong, which leads to a hysteresis\nthat substantial capillary number is required to initiate the deviation of the\ndynamic contact angle from its equilibrium state. This observation is\nconsistent with the previous report on a new mechanism for the static contact\nangle hysteresis due to the presence of free liquid films. With an increasing\ncapillary number, the fluid-fluid interface starts oscillating before\nfingering. Different fingering patterns are observed for cases with different\nequilibrium contact angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 14:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Its key mechanism is that synapses have a state, propagated through\ntime by a self-recurrent connection-within-the-synapse.

While the primary goal of the\nexploration phase in RF-RL is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated model\nwith minimum number of trajectories, in practice, the agent often needs to\nabide by certain safety constraint at the same time. It remains unclear how\nsuch safe exploration requirement would affect the corresponding sample\ncomplexity in order to achieve the desired optimality of the obtained policy in\nplanning. In this work, we make a first attempt to answer this question. In\nparticular, we consider the scenario where a safe baseline policy is known\nbeforehand, and propose a unified Safe reWard-frEe ExploraTion (SWEET)\nframework. We then particularize the SWEET framework to the tabular and the\nlow-rank MDP settings, and develop algorithms coined Tabular-SWEET and\nLow-rank-SWEET, respectively. Both algorithms leverage the concavity and\ncontinuity of the newly introduced truncated value functions, and are\nguaranteed to achieve zero constraint violation during exploration with high\nprobability. Furthermore, both algorithms can provably find a near-optimal\npolicy subject to any constraint in the planning phase. Remarkably, the sample\ncomplexities under both algorithms match or even outperform the state of the\nart in their constraint-free counterparts up to some constant factors, proving\nthat safety constraint hardly increases the sample complexity for RF-RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 00:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 18:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

This\nphenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is often difficult to\nprevent due to practical constraints, such as the amount of data that can be\nstored or the limited computation sources that can be used. Moreover, training\nlarge neural networks, such as Transformers, from scratch is very costly and\nrequires a vast amount of training data, which might not be available in the\napplication domain of interest. A recent trend indicates that dynamic\narchitectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic\nforgetting efficiently in continual learning, but this needs complex tuning to\nbalance the growing number of parameters and barely share any information\nacross tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks\nwithout significant overhead.

However,\ndata-driven compiler optimizations based on machine learning models require\nlarge sets of quality data for training in order to match or even outperform\nexisting human-crafted heuristics. In static compilation setups, related work\nhas addressed this problem with iterative compilation.

We find that training on a diverse dataset with lots of\nvariation in the finite element meshes is a key ingredient for achieving good\ngeneralization results in all cases. With this, we believe that GNNs can be\nused to learn solution operators that generalize over a range of properties and\nproduce solutions much faster than a generic solver. Our dataset, which we make\npublicly available, can be used and extended to verify the robustness of these\nmodels under varying conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 15:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

In this paper we demonstrate ICR in micron sized\nconical channels in a thin silicon membrane with pore diameters comparable to\nthe membrane thickness but both much larger than the electrolyte screening\nlength. We show that for these pores the entrance resistance is not only key to\nOhmic conductance around 0 V, but also for understanding ICR, both of which we\nmeasure experimentally and capture within a single analytic theoretical\nframework. The only fit parameter in this theory is the membrane surface\npotential, for which we find that it is voltage dependent and its value is\nexcessively large compared to literature. From this we infer that surface\ncharge outside the pore strongly contributes to the observed Ohmic conductance\nand rectification by a different extent. We experimentally verify this\nhypothesis in a small array of pores and find that ICR vanishes due to\npore-pore interactions mediated through the membrane surface, while Ohmic\nconductance around 0 V remains unaffected. We find that the pore-pore\ninteraction for ICR is set by a long-ranged decay of the concentration which\nexplains the surprising finding that the ICR vanishes for even a sparsely\npopulated array with a pore-pore spacing as large as 7 $\\mu$m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 10:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 15:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

A security vulnerability in any of\nthese steps puts users at risk, and evidence shows that attacks on the supply\nchain are becoming more common. The consequences of an attack on the software\nsupply chain can be tragic in a society that relies on many interconnected\nsoftware systems, and this has led research interest as well as governmental\nincentives for supply chain security to rise.\n  GNU Guix is a software deployment tool and software distribution that\nsupports provenance tracking, reproducible builds, and reproducible software\nenvironments. Unlike many software distributions, it consists exclusively of\nsource code: it provides a set of package definitions that describe how to\nbuild code from source. Together, these properties set it apart from many\ndeployment tools that center on the distribution of binaries.\n  This paper focuses on one research question: how can Guix and similar systems\nallow users to securely update their software? Guix source code is distributed\nusing the Git version control system; updating Guix-installed software packages\nmeans, first, updating the local copy of the Guix source code. Prior work on\nsecure software updates focuses on systems very different from Guix -- systems\nsuch as Debian, Fedora, or PyPI where updating consists in fetching metadata\nabout the latest binary artifacts available -- and is largely inapplicable in\nthe context of Guix. By contrast, the main threats for Guix are attacks on its\nsource code repository, which could lead users to run inauthentic code or to\ndowngrade their system. Deployment tools that more closely resemble Guix, from\nNix to Portage, either lack secure update mechanisms or suffer from\nshortcomings.\n  Our main contribution is a model and tool to authenticate new Git revisions.\nWe further show how, building on Git semantics, we build protections against\ndowngrade attacks and related threats. We explain implementation choices. This\nwork has been deployed in production two years ago, giving us insight on its\nactual use at scale every day. The Git checkout authentication at its core is\napplicable beyond the specific use case of Guix, and we think it could benefit\nto developer teams that use Git.\n  As attacks on the software supply chain appear, security research is now\nlooking at every link of the supply chain. Secure updates are one important\naspect of the supply chain, but this paper also looks at the broader context:\nhow Guix models and implements the supply chain, from upstream source code to\nbinaries running on computers. While much recent work focuses on attestation --\ncertifying each link of the supply chain -- Guix takes a more radical approach:\nenabling independent verification of each step, building on reproducible\nbuilds, \"bootstrappable\" builds, and provenance tracking. The big picture shows\nhow Guix can be used as the foundation of secure software supply chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

For physics-based computational models, Verification,\nValidation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) have been very widely\ninvestigated and a lot of methodologies have been developed.

This\nwork aims at quantifying the prediction, or approximation uncertainties of DNNs\nwhen they are used as surrogate models for expensive physical models. Three\ntechniques for UQ of DNNs are compared, namely Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Deep\nEnsembles (DE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Two nuclear engineering\nexamples are used to benchmark these methods, (1) time-dependent fission gas\nrelease data using the Bison code, and (2) void fraction simulation based on\nthe BFBT benchmark using the TRACE code.

In these work, the attention mechanism is used to select the\nuser interested items in historical behaviors, improving the performance of the\nCTR predictor. Normally, these attentive modules can be jointly trained with\nthe base predictor by using gradient descents. In this paper, we regard user\ninterest modeling as a feature selection problem, which we call user interest\nselection.

In this research, three experiment sets were\nconducted with a U-Net architecture to improve the classification performance\nwhile enhancing the heatmaps corresponding to the model's focus through\nincorporating heatmap generators during training. All of the experiments used\nthe dataset that contained chest radiographs, associated labels from one of the\nthree conditions (\"normal\", \"congestive heart failure (CHF)\", and \"pneumonia\"),\nand numerical information regarding a radiologist's eye-gaze coordinates on the\nimages. The paper (A.

To compare the classification performances, the 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) of the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC) were measured. The best method achieved an AUC of\n0.913 (CI: 0.860-0.966). The greatest improvements were for the \"pneumonia\" and\n\"CHF\" classes, which the baseline model struggled most to classify, resulting\nin AUCs of 0.859 (CI: 0.732-0.957) and 0.962 (CI: 0.933-0.989), respectively.\nThe proposed method's decoder was also able to produce probability masks that\nhighlight the determining image parts in model classifications, similarly as\nthe radiologist's eye-gaze data. Hence, this work showed that incorporating\nheatmap generators and eye-gaze information into training can simultaneously\nimprove disease classification and provide explainable visuals that align well\nwith how the radiologist viewed the chest radiographs when making diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 13:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

While most\nresearch works in VFL focus on linear and tree models, deep models (e.g.,\nneural networks) are not well studied in VFL. In this paper, we focus on\nSplitNN, a well-known neural network framework in VFL, and identify a trade-off\nbetween data security and model performance in SplitNN. Briefly, SplitNN trains\nthe model by exchanging gradients and transformed data. On the one hand,\nSplitNN suffers from the loss of model performance since multiply parties\njointly train the model using transformed data instead of raw data, and a large\namount of low-level feature information is discarded. On the other hand, a\nnaive solution of increasing the model performance through aggregating at lower\nlayers in SplitNN (i.e., the data is less transformed and more low-level\nfeature is preserved) makes raw data vulnerable to inference attacks. To\nmitigate the above trade-off, we propose a new neural network protocol in VFL\ncalled Security Forward Aggregation (SFA). It changes the way of aggregating\nthe transformed data and adopts removable masks to protect the raw data.\nExperiment results show that networks with SFA achieve both data security and\nhigh model performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 03:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

The\nintegrate-and-fire (I&F) models are often adopted, with the simple Leaky I&F\n(LIF) being the most used. The reason for adopting such models is their\nefficiency and/or biological plausibility. Nevertheless, rigorous justification\nfor adopting LIF over other neuron models for use in artificial learning\nsystems has not yet been studied.
