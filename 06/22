Nevertheless, modeling\nsuch weakly visual-textual connection is not trivial due to query polysemy\n(i.e., many possible meanings for a query) and text isomorphism (i.e., same\nsyntactic structure of different text). In this paper, we introduce a new\ndesign of mutual calibration between query and text to boost weakly-supervised\nvideo representation learning. Specifically, we present Bi-Calibration Networks\n(BCN) that novelly couples two calibrations to learn the amendment from text to\nquery and vice versa. Technically, BCN executes clustering on all the titles of\nthe videos searched by an identical query and takes the centroid of each\ncluster as a text prototype. The query vocabulary is built directly on query\nwords. The video-to-text/video-to-query projections over text prototypes/query\nvocabulary then start the text-to-query or query-to-text calibration to\nestimate the amendment to query or text. We also devise a selection scheme to\nbalance the two corrections. Two large-scale web video datasets paired with\nquery and title for each video are newly collected for weakly-supervised video\nrepresentation learning, which are named as YOVO-3M and YOVO-10M, respectively.\nThe video features of BCN learnt on 3M web videos obtain superior results under\nlinear model protocol on downstream tasks. More remarkably, BCN trained on the\nlarger set of 10M web videos with further fine-tuning leads to 1.6%, and 1.8%\ngains in top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400, and Something-Something V2 datasets\nover the state-of-the-art TDN, and ACTION-Net methods with ImageNet\npre-training.

Due to the noisy environment and multiple\ninfluencing factors in the organism, current dynamical models cannot reach a\ncommon understanding of the molecular mechanism of HIV latency. In this work,\nthrough a new dynamical structure decomposition, the deterministic part of the\nequation can be separated from the stochastic noise. Thus, the fixed-point\nanalysis of ordinary differential equation is enough to obtain the different\nsteady states of the system. Methods: We established a dynamical model of HIV\ntranscription process by using continuous stochastic differential equations,\nwhich simplifies the dimensions of equations needed to describe the system and\nincreases the explorable space of the model. Different states between latency\nand activation of virus and their relations can be intuitively represented by\npotential functions and probability distribution functions. Results: Based on\nour model, the influence of different dynamical parameters on stability is\nquantitatively analyzed, the parameter ranges of the system in bistable and\nmonostable states are obtained respectively. The theoretical basis of this work\nis verified by comparing the effects of different factors on dynamic\nbifurcation with the results of biological experiments.

We use data from the muon beam exposure at CERN. The\ntime resolution of 0.97 ns was obtained for one readout channel after\nimplementing the time calibration with a correction for the time-walk effect.\nThe time resolution improves with energy deposited in a scintillator cube.\nAveraging two readout channels for one scintillator cube improves the time\nresolution to 0.68 ns which means that signals in different channels are not\nsynchronous. Therefore the contribution from the time recording step of 2.5 ns\nis averaged as well. Averaging time values from N channels improves the time\nresolution by $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$. Therefore a very good time resolution should\nbe achievable for neutrons since neutron recoils hit typically several\nscintillator cubes and in addition produce larger amplitudes than muons.\nMeasurements performed with a laser and a wide-bandwidth oscilloscope\ndemonstrated that the time resolution obtained with the muon beam is not far\nfrom its expected limit. The intrinsic time resolution of one channel is 0.67\nns for signals of 56 photo-electron typical for minimum ionizing particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 16:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

A standard method to mitigate the privacy\nrisks for location data is by adding noise to the true values to achieve\ngeo-indistinguishability. However, we argue that geo-indistinguishability alone\nis insufficient to cover all privacy concerns. In particular, isolated\nlocations are not protected by the state-of-the-art Laplace mechanism (LAP) for\ngeo-indistinguishability. We focus on a mechanism that is generated by the\nBlahut-Arimoto algorithm (BA) from rate-distortion theory. We show that BA, in\naddition to providing geo-indistinguishability, enforces an elastic metric that\nameliorates the issue of isolation. We then study the utility of BA in terms of\nthe statistical precision that can be derived from the reported data, focusing\non the inference of the original distribution. To this purpose, we apply the\niterative Bayesian update (IBU), an instance of the famous\nexpectation-maximization method from statistics, that produces the most likely\ndistribution for any obfuscation mechanism. We show that BA harbours a better\nstatistical utility than LAP for high privacy and becomes comparable as privacy\ndecreases.

Deploying such networks in use-cases constrained by\ncomputational requirements is often infeasible due to the large memory required\nby the full-precision model. Previous compact face recognition approaches\nproposed to design special compact architectures and train them from scratch\nusing real training data, which may not be available in a real-world scenario\ndue to privacy concerns. We present in this work the QuantFace solution based\non low-bit precision format model quantization. QuantFace reduces the required\ncomputational cost of the existing face recognition models without the need for\ndesigning a particular architecture or accessing real training data. QuantFace\nintroduces privacy-friendly synthetic face data to the quantization process to\nmitigate potential privacy concerns and issues related to the accessibility to\nreal training data. Through extensive evaluation experiments on seven\nbenchmarks and four network architectures, we demonstrate that QuantFace can\nsuccessfully reduce the model size up to 5x while maintaining, to a large\ndegree, the verification performance of the full-precision model without\naccessing real training datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 16:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

To induce the 3D bias, such models typically rely on\nvolumetric rendering, which is expensive to employ at high resolutions. During\nthe past months, there appeared more than 10 works that address this scaling\nissue by training a separate 2D decoder to upsample a low-resolution image (or\na feature tensor) produced from a pure 3D generator. But this solution comes at\na cost: not only does it break multi-view consistency (i.e. shape and texture\nchange when the camera moves), but it also learns the geometry in a low\nfidelity. In this work, we show that it is possible to obtain a high-resolution\n3D generator with SotA image quality by following a completely different route\nof simply training the model patch-wise. We revisit and improve this\noptimization scheme in two ways. First, we design a location- and scale-aware\ndiscriminator to work on patches of different proportions and spatial\npositions. Second, we modify the patch sampling strategy based on an annealed\nbeta distribution to stabilize training and accelerate the convergence. The\nresulted model, named EpiGRAF, is an efficient, high-resolution, pure 3D\ngenerator, and we test it on four datasets (two introduced in this work) at\n$256^2$ and $512^2$ resolutions.

Depending on the context, decisions may be biased towards\nevents that were most frequently experienced in the past, or be more\nexplorative. A particular type of decision making central to cognition is\nsequential memory recall in response to ambiguous cues. A previously developed\nspiking neuronal network implementation of sequence prediction and recall\nlearns complex, high-order sequences in an unsupervised manner by local,\nbiologically inspired plasticity rules. In response to an ambiguous cue, the\nmodel deterministically recalls the sequence shown most frequently during\ntraining.

In the presence of locally correlated noise, the averaging\neffect is avoided without impairing the model performance, and without the need\nfor large noise amplitudes. We investigate two forms of correlated noise\noccurring in nature: shared synaptic background inputs, and random locking of\nthe stimulus to spatiotemporal oscillations in the network activity.

In addition, the data\nheterogeneity incurs severe accuracy degradation of the global model in the FL\ntraining process. To address aforementioned issues, we propose a hierarchical\nsynchronous FL framework, i.e., FedHiSyn. FedHiSyn first clusters all available\ndevices into a small number of categories based on their computing capacity.\nAfter a certain interval of local training, the models trained in different\ncategories are simultaneously uploaded to a central server. Within a single\ncategory, the devices communicate the local updated model weights to each other\nbased on a ring topology.

Besides, the\ncombination of the synchronous update of multiple categories and the device\ncommunication within a single category help address the data heterogeneity\nissue while achieving high accuracy. We evaluate the proposed framework based\non MNIST, EMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets and diverse heterogeneous\nsettings of devices.

The system has six practically feasible equilibrium points where\nfour of them are disease-free, and the rest are endemic. We discuss the\nexistence and stability conditions for the equilibria. We find that when sexual\ntransmission of zika comes to a halt then in absence of mosquitoes infection\ncannot persist. Hence, one needs to eradicate mosquitoes to eradicate\ninfection. Moreover, we deduce that in the case of zika infection pushing the\nbasic reproduction number below unity is next to impossible. Therefore, O_0,\nthe mosquito survival threshold parameter, and O, the mosquito survival\nthreshold parameter with predation play a crucial role in getting rid of the\ninfection in respective cases since mosquitoes cannot survive when these are\nless than unity. Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of reducing mosquito\nbiting rate and mutual contact rates between vector and host. It exhibits the\nimportance of increasing the natural mortality rate of vectors to reduce the\nbasic reproduction number. Numerical simulation shows that when the basic\nreproduction number is close but greater than unity, the introduction of a\nsmall amount of predatory fish Gambusia Affinis can completely swipe off the\ninfection. In case of high transmission or high basic reproduction number, this\nfish increases the susceptible human population and keeps the infection under\ncontrol, hence, prohibiting it from becoming an epidemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 17:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this paper, we develop the first\nalgorithm that continuously checks if fair queuing is present on a path, with\nan accuracy of over 95%. When fair queuing is detected, a different congestion\ncontrol can be chosen, which can result in reduced latency. Also, each flow can\nthen specify how much queuing delay it allows, meaning that it can choose its\nown tradeoff between throughput and latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 17:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 17:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2022 00:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 19:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2022 19:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

The use of TT enables a compact\nparameterization of the embedding, rendering it small enough to fit entirely on\nmodern GPUs even for massive graphs. When combined with judicious schemes for\ninitialization and hierarchical graph partitioning, this approach can reduce\nthe size of node embedding vectors by 1,659 times to 81,362 times on large\npublicly available benchmark datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy\nand significant speedups on multi-GPU systems.

Strong gravitational lensing has been shown to be a useful\ntool for detecting dark low-mass (sub)halos through perturbations in lensing\narcs, therefore allowing the testing of different DM scenarios. However,\nmeasuring the total mass of a perturber from strong lensing data is\nchallenging. Over or underestimating perturber masses can lead to incorrect\ninferences about the nature of DM.

The timescales over which differential rotation is removed\nby internal angular-momentum transport processes (`viscosity') has key\nimplications for the remnant's long-term stability and the NS equation-of-state\n(EOS). Guided by a non-rotating model of a cooling proto-NS, we estimate the\ndominant sources of viscosity using an externally imposed angular velocity\nprofile $\\Omega(r)$. Although the magnetorotational instability provides the\ndominant source of effective viscosity at large radii, convection and/or the\nSpruit-Tayler dynamo dominate in the core of merger remnants where $d\\Omega/dr\n\\geq 0$. Furthermore, the viscous timescale in the remnant core is sufficiently\nshort that solid body rotation will be enforced faster than matter is accreted\nfrom rotationally-supported outer layers. Guided by these results, we develop a\ntoy model for how the merger remnant core grows in mass and angular momentum\ndue to accretion.

We show excellent agreement\nbetween MF and DMRG. When a phase twist is applied on the system, a phase\ndifference appears between pairing order parameters on different sublattices,\nand this plays a very important role in the SC density. The SC weight, $D_s$,\non the gapped topological, $W\\neq0$, flat band increases linearly with\ninteraction strength, $U$, for low values, and with a slope that depends on the\ndetails of the compact localized state at $U=0$. As $U\\to 0$ for the gapped\nnon-topological flat band ($W=0$), $D_s$ decays with a power law faster than\nquadratic but slower than exponential. This indicates that isolated\nnon-topological flat bands are less beneficial to SC.

Successful decoding of EEG and EMG signals into\nrespective control command is a pivotal step in the rehabilitation process.\nRecently, several Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architectures are\nproposed that directly map the raw time-series signal into decision space and\nthe process of meaningful features extraction and classification are performed\nsimultaneously. However, these networks are tailored to the learn the expected\ncharacteristics of the given bio-signal and are limited to single paradigm. In\nthis work, we addressed the question that can we build a single architecture\nwhich is able to learn distinct features from different HMI paradigms and still\nsuccessfully classify them. Approach: In this work, we introduce a single\nhybrid model called ConTraNet, which is based on CNN and Transformer\narchitectures that is equally useful for EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms.\nConTraNet uses CNN block to introduce inductive bias in the model and learn\nlocal dependencies, whereas the Transformer block uses the self-attention\nmechanism to learn the long-range dependencies in the signal, which are crucial\nfor the classification of EEG and EMG signals. Main results: We evaluated and\ncompared the ConTraNet with state-of-the-art methods on three publicly\navailable datasets which belong to EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms. ConTraNet\noutperformed its counterparts in all the different category tasks (2-class,\n3-class, 4-class, and 10-class decoding tasks). Significance: The results\nsuggest that ConTraNet is robust to learn distinct features from different HMI\nparadigms and generalizes well as compared to the current state of the art\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 18:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

While hydrogen is\nusually produced through SMR, it can also be produced through water\nelectrolysis which is cleaner. The relative cost and carbon intensity of\nhydrogen production through SMR and electrolysis vary throughout the United\nStates because of differences in the grid. While many hydrogen cost models\nexist, no regional hydrogen study has been conducted across the US. We studied\nhow the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) and carbon intensity for producing\nhydrogen vary across the US. We looked at electrolysis technologies (Alkaline,\nPEM, and SOEC) and compared them to SMR. In 2020, SMR with 90 percent CCUS has\na lower average LCOH and carbon intensity for hydrogen production than\nelectrolysis by SOEC. For states with cleaner grids, hydrogen produced through\nSOEC has a lower carbon intensity than hydrogen produced using SMR with 90\npercent CCUS.

Specifically,\nthe entanglement between the SRC orbitals and the rest of the system. It should\nbe stressed that this is a single nucleon not a pair entanglement entropy\nbetween the proton and neutron. The entanglement arises from the probability\nfor a nucleon to occupy a momentum state above the Fermi momentum. We separate\nthe momentum space of the nucleus into two parts such that nucleons can occupy\nthe meanfield part of the wave function, i.e. Fermi sea (FS) and separately the\nhigh-momentum SRC part. The orbital entropy we obtain is between these two\nparts where we essentially define two momentum subspaces, one containing all\nthe low momentum FS states and the other the high-momentum part as a SRC\n\"orbital\" state. For the calculation we employ the decoupling of low and\nhigh-momenta which was established by the similarity normalization group the\nSRC is viewed as a further \"orbital\" which can be multiply occupied. Since the\nprobability of the occupation of a single SRC is given by the nuclear contact\nwe are able to obtain a simple general expression of the orbital entanglement\nentropy for SRC by employing the generalized contact formalism. This general\nformula for the SRC orbital entanglement entropy of a nuclear structure in\nterms of the nuclear contact, allows us to obtain the scaling of the entropy in\nterms the mass number, $A$.

This paper\nexplores using LoRa radios in the ISM band for low-latency downlink\ncommunication from CubeSats, primarily due to the availability of extensive\nground LoRa infrastructure and minimal interference to terrestrial\ncommunication.

Depending on the efficient panoptic segmentation\narchitecture, we can improve 3.5-6.5% measured in Panoptic Quality (PQ) over\nnon-adapted models on our established Wild Panoramic Panoptic Segmentation\n(WildPPS) dataset. Furthermore, our efficient framework does not need access to\nthe images of the target domain, making it a feasible domain generalization\napproach suitable for a limited hardware setting. As additional contributions,\nwe publish WildPPS: The first panoramic panoptic image dataset to foster\nprogress in surrounding perception and explore a novel training procedure\ncombining supervised and contrastive training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 20:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 17:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

The optimal meta RL policy, a.k.a. the Bayes-optimal behavior, is\nwell defined, and guarantees optimal reward in expectation, taken with respect\nto the task distribution. The question we explore in this work is how many\ntraining tasks are required to guarantee approximately optimal behavior with\nhigh probability. Recent work provided the first such PAC analysis for a\nmodel-free setting, where a history-dependent policy was learned from the\ntraining tasks. In this work, we propose a different approach: directly learn\nthe task distribution, using density estimation techniques, and then train a\npolicy on the learned task distribution. We show that our approach leads to\nbounds that depend on the dimension of the task distribution. In particular, in\nsettings where the task distribution lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we\nextend our analysis to use dimensionality reduction techniques and account for\nsuch structure, obtaining significantly better bounds than previous work, which\nstrictly depend on the number of states and actions.

In this article, we bridge these two strands of\nliterature by defining interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a\ntreatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and marginal interventional\neffect (MIE) as its limit when the size of the intervention approaches zero.\nThe IE and MIE can be viewed as the unconditional counterparts of the\npolicy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) proposed in\nthe economics literature.

It has been suggested that low-power jets may\nexplain the observed radiation at sub-parsec scales. The mechanisms for jet\nformation at super-Eddington rates, however, are not well understood. On the\nsame scale, clouds from the broad-line region (BLR) propagating with supersonic\nvelocities in the wind launched by the accretion disk may lead to the\nproduction of nonthermal radiation. We aim to characterize the nonthermal\nemission produced by the propagation of clouds through the wind of the\naccretion disk in super-accreting AGNs and to estimate the relevance of such\ncontribution to the radio band of the electromagnetic spectrum. We determine\nthe conditions under which the BLR clouds are not destroyed by shocks or\nhydrodynamic instabilities when immersed in the powerful wind of the accretion\ndisk. These clouds form bowshocks that are suitable sites for particle\nacceleration. We develop a semianalytical model to calculate the distribution\nof relativistic particles in these bowshocks and the associated spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the emitted radiation. For typical parameters of\nsuper-accreting AGNs, we find that the cloud-wind interactions can produce\nnonthermal emission from radio up to a few tens of TeV, with slight absorption\neffects, if the processes occur outside the wind photosphere. Radio emission in\nAGNs without jets can be explained if the accretion rate is super-Eddington and\nthere is a broad-line region at sub-parsec scales around the central black\nhole. The accretion rate must not be extremely high so most of the clouds orbit\noutside of the wind photosphere and the radiation can escape to the observer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 21:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

In this work, we explore an alternative\napproach to splicing detection, which is potentially better suited for images\nin-the-wild, subject to strong compression and downsampling. Our proposal is to\nmodel the color formation of an image. The color formation largely depends on\nvariations at the scale of scene objects, and is hence much less dependent on\nhigh-frequency artifacts. We learn a deep metric space that is on one hand\nsensitive to illumination color and camera white-point estimation, but on the\nother hand insensitive to variations in object color.

Moreover, we show that the\nproposed DINO achieves significantly higher accuracy than neural operators\ntrained without derivative information, for both function approximation and\nderivative approximation (e.g., Gauss-Newton Hessian), especially when the\ntraining data are limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 21:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 15:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 23:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

Furthermore, many datasets, being\ntoo noisy or too small, are easily overfitted by complex models, such as deep\nneural networks. Here, we consider the problem of using FL regression on noisy,\nhierarchical and tabular datasets in which user distributions are significantly\ndifferent. Inspired by Latent Class Regression (LCR), we propose a novel\nprobabilistic model, Hierarchical Latent Class Regression (HLCR), and its\nextension to Federated Learning, FEDHLCR. FEDHLCR consists of a mixture of\nlinear regression models, allowing better accuracy than simple linear\nregression, while at the same time maintaining its analytical properties and\navoiding overfitting.

The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by\neffectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand,\nmodel-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact\ndynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical\nequivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and\nempirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further\nalleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and\nquasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both\nsmoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective\nfor contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show\nthat classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in\nglobal planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our\nmethod on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we\ndemonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results\ncomparable to RL with dramatically less computation.

We introduce a minimally dissipative controller model,\nillustrating the findings using a simple example. We find that the work\nrequired to run the controller must at least compensate for the decrease in\nentropy due to the control operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 01:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 20:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

This can cause major impacts on distribution\nnetworks and energy markets. As a result, there is a significant need for\nimproved forecasting of the power generation of these systems at different time\nresolutions and horizons. However, the performance of forecasting models\ndepends on the resolution and horizon. Forecast combinations (ensembles), that\ncombine the forecasts of multiple models into a single forecast may be robust\nin such cases. Therefore, in this paper, we provide comparisons and insights\ninto the performance of five state-of-the-art forecast models and existing\nforecast combinations at multiple resolutions and horizons. We propose a\nforecast combination approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that\nwill enable a forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for the task at hand by\nweighting the forecasts produced by individual models. Furthermore, we compare\nthe performance of the proposed combination approach with existing forecast\ncombination approaches. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using a\nreal-world residential PV power data set measured at 25 houses located in three\nlocations in the United States. The results across four different resolutions\nand four different horizons show that the PSO-based forecast combination\napproach outperforms the use of any individual forecast model and other\nforecast combination counterparts, with an average Mean Absolute Scaled Error\nreduction by 3.81% compared to the best performing individual model. Our\napproach enables a solar forecaster to produce accurate forecasts for their\napplication regardless of the forecast resolution or horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 01:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

The goal is to analyse and evaluate the\nperformance of distributed directional or axial-based sensors to observe\nspecific axes in task space as a function of joint configuration in serial\nrobot manipulators. For example, joint torque sensors are often used in serial\nrobot manipulators and assumed to be perfectly capable of estimating end\neffector forces, but certain joint configurations may cause one or more\ntask-space axes to be unobservable as a result of how the joint torque sensors\nare aligned. The proposed sensor observability provides a method to analyse the\nquality of the current robot configuration to observe the task space. Parallels\nare drawn between sensor observability and the traditional kinematic Jacobian\nfor the particular case of joint torque sensors in serial robot manipulators.\nAlthough similar information can be retrieved from kinematic analysis of the\nJacobian transpose in serial manipulators, sensor observability is shown to be\nmore generalizable in terms of analysing non-joint-mounted sensors and other\nsensor types. In addition, null-space analysis of the Jacobian transpose is\nsusceptible to false observability singularities.

As an essential component of an\nissue, title quality is an important aspect of issue quality. Moreover, issues\nare usually presented in a list view, where only the issue title and some\nmetadata are present. In this case, a concise and accurate title is crucial for\nreaders to grasp the general concept of the issue and facilitate the issue\ntriaging. Previous work formulated the issue title generation task as a\none-sentence summarization task. A sequence-to-sequence model was employed to\nsolve this task. However, it requires a large amount of domain-specific\ntraining data to attain good performance in issue title generation. Recently,\npre-trained models, which learned knowledge from large-scale general corpora,\nhave shown much success in software engineering tasks.\n  In this work, we make the first attempt to fine-tune BART, which has been\npre-trained using English corpora, to generate issue titles. We implemented the\nfine-tuned BART as a web tool named iTiger, which can suggest an issue title\nbased on the issue description. iTiger is fine-tuned on 267,094 GitHub issues.\nWe compared iTiger with the state-of-the-art method, i.e., iTAPE, on 33,438\nissues. The automatic evaluation shows that iTiger outperforms iTAPE by 29.7%,\n50.8%, and 34.1%, in terms of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L F1-scores. The manual\nevaluation also demonstrates the titles generated by BART are preferred by\nevaluators over the titles generated by iTAPE in 72.7% of cases. Besides, the\nevaluators deem our tool as useful and easy-to-use. They are also interested to\nuse our tool in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 02:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 07:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Diverse (or space-filling) subsampling is an appealing\nsubsampling approach when no prior knowledge of the data is available. In this\npaper, we propose a diversity subsampling approach that selects a subsample\nfrom the original data such that the subsample is independently and uniformly\ndistributed over the support of distribution from which the data are drawn, to\nthe maximum extent possible. We give an asymptotic performance guarantee of the\nproposed method and provide experimental results to show that the proposed\nmethod performs well for typical finite-size data. We also compare the proposed\nmethod with competing diversity subsampling algorithms and demonstrate\nnumerically that subsamples selected by the proposed method are closer to a\nuniform sample than subsamples selected by other methods. The proposed DS\nalgorithm is shown to be more efficient than known methods and takes only a few\nminutes to select tens of thousands of subsample points from a data set of size\none million. Our DS algorithm easily generalizes to select subsamples following\ndistributions other than uniform. We provide the FADS Python package to\nimplement the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 02:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

These\nadvantages can only be exploited however, if electron recoil backgrounds from\ngamma rays can be sufficiently suppressed. We introduce a deep learning-based\nrecoil event classifier that uses a 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) to\nidentify event species based on their recoil images. We compare electron\nbackground rejection performance of the 3DCNN both to the traditional\ndiscriminant of track length, as well as discriminants obtained from\nstate-of-the-art shallow learning methods.

Consistent with mainstream methods, we adopt the idea of\nbackground reconstruction; however, we innovatively utilize artificial\nsynthetic defects to enable the model to recognize anomalies, while traditional\nwisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module\nto obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a\ncontrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain\ndiscriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in\nthe latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast\nanomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement\nmodule (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual\ndefects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to\nreconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection\nperformance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect\nrestoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to\nachieve noise-robust defect localization.

This paper studies the impact of thermal throttling on\nmobile phones: when it occurs, the CPU clock frequency is reduced, and the\nmodel inference latency may increase dramatically. This unpleasant inconsistent\nbehavior has a substantial negative effect on user experience, but it has been\noverlooked for a long time. To counter thermal throttling, we propose to\nutilize dynamic networks with shared weights and dynamically shift between\nlarge and small ML models seamlessly according to their thermal profile, i.e.,\nshifting to a small model when the system is about to throttle. With the\nproposed dynamic shifting, the application runs consistently without\nexperiencing CPU clock frequency degradation and latency increase. In addition,\nwe also study the resulting accuracy when dynamic shifting is deployed and show\nthat our approach provides a reasonable trade-off between model latency and\nmodel accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 05:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 08:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

The elegant properties of Bregman\ndivergences allow us to maintain closed form updates in a simple and\ntransparent algorithm, and moreover lead to new theoretical arguments for\nestablishing finite sample bounds that relax the bounded support assumption\nmade in the existing state of the art. Additionally, we consider thorough\nempirical analyses on simulated experiments and a case study on rainfall data,\nfinding that the proposed method outperforms existing peer methods in a variety\nof non-Gaussian data settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 06:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

While current MIL methods apply variants of the attention mechanism to\nre-weight instance features with stronger models, scant attention is paid to\nthe properties of the data distribution.

To achieve this, unlike existing\nMIL methods that use single-batch training modes, we propose balanced-batch\nsampling to effectively use the feature loss i.e., (+/-) bags simultaneously.\nFurther, we employ a position encoding module (PEM) to model\nspatial/morphological information, and perform pooling by multi-head\nself-attention (PSMA) with a Transformer encoder.

The primary creep rate is observed to follow a\n(Omori-type) power-law decay in the strain rate, the number of acoustic\nemission events as well as the amplitudes of the ultrasonic beams, supporting a\nbrittle-creep mechanism. The main outcome is however the discovery of\nunexpected history effects that make the material less prone to creep when it\nhas been previously deformed and damaged under primary creep at a lower applied\nstress. With the help of a progressive damage model implementing thermal\nactivation, we interpret this as an aging-under-stress phenomenon: during an\ninitial creep step at relatively low applied stress, the easy-to-damage sites\nare exhausted first, depleting the excitation spectrum at low stress gap\nvalues. Consequently, upon reloading under a larger applied stress, although\npreviously damaged, the material creeps (and damages) less than it would under\nthe same stress but without pre-creeping. Besides shedding a new light on the\nfundamental physics of creep of disordered brittle materials, this has\nimportant practical consequences in the interpretation of some experimental\nprocedures, such as stress-stepping experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

Different from deterministic models,\nprobabilistic models such as Bayesian neural networks are relatively\nwell-calibrated and able to quantify uncertainty alongside their competitive\nprediction accuracy. Both of the approaches appear in the federated learning\nframework; however, the aggregation scheme of deterministic models cannot be\ndirectly applied to probabilistic models since weights correspond to\ndistributions instead of point estimates. In this work, we study the effects of\nvarious aggregation schemes for variational Bayesian neural networks.

One of the related questions\nleft open for a long time is whether we can reconstruct this Foldy-Lax field\nfrom the scattered field measured far away from the cluster of the small\ninhomogeneities. This is the Foldy-Lax approximation (or Foldy-Lax paradigm).\nIn this work, we show that this approximation is indeed valid as soon as the\ninhomogeneities enjoy critical scales between their sizes and contrasts. These\ncritical scales allow them to generate resonances which can be characterized\nand computed. The main result here is that exciting the cluster by incident\nfrequencies which are close to the real parts of these resonances allow us to\nreconstruct the Fold-Lax field from the scattered waves collected far away from\nthe cluster itself (as the farfields).

The new module is called the stated\nskein module.\n  The first main results concern non-injectivity of certain natural maps\ndefined when forming connected sums along a sphere or along a closed disk.\nThese maps are injective for surfaces, or for generic quantum parameter, but we\nshow that in general they are not injective when the quantum parameter is a\nroot of 1. The result applies to the classical skein modules as well. A\nparticular interesting result is that when the quantum parameter is a root of\n1, the empty skein is zero in a connected sum where each constituent manifold\nhas non-empty marking.\n  We also prove various non injectivity results for the Chebyshev-Frobenius map\nand the natural map induced by the deletion of marked balls.\n  We then consider the general case of gluing along a surface, showing that the\nstated skein module can be interpreted as a monoidal symmetric functor from a\ncategory of \"decorated cobordisms\" to a Morita category of algebras and their\nbimodules.

To tackle this issue, we\npropose a change-point detection framework named SoccerCPD that distinguishes\ntactically intended formation and role changes from temporary changes in soccer\nmatches. We first assign roles to players frame-by-frame and perform two-step\nchange-point detections: (1) formation change-point detection based on the\nsequence of role-adjacency matrices and (2) role change-point detection based\non the sequence of role permutations.

Each of these has pros and cons in practice. The collision term\nin the Boltzmann equation can be computed based on quantum field theory in the\nMinkowski spacetime, and thus many techniques have been developed so far. On\nthe other hand, the Bogoliubov approach may deal with the particle production\nbeyond the perturbation theory and is able to take into account the effect of\nthe curved spacetime, whereas in many cases one should rely on numerical\nmethods, such as lattice computation. We show by explicit numerical and\nanalytical computations of the purely gravitational production of a scalar that\nthese two approaches give consistent results for particle production with large\nmomenta during reheating, whereas the Boltzmann approach is not capable of\ncomputing particle production out of vacuum during inflation.

Here, these concepts are extended to\nthe realm of iterative methods by formally defining locally conservative and\nflux consistent iterations. These concepts are of both theoretical and\npractical importance: Based on recent work by the authors, it is shown that\npseudo-time iterations using explicit Runge-Kutta methods are locally\nconservative but not necessarily flux consistent. An extension of the\nLax-Wendroff theorem is presented, revealing convergence towards weak solutions\nof a temporally retarded system of conservation laws. Each equation is modified\nin the same way, namely by a particular scalar factor multiplying the spatial\nflux terms. A technique for enforcing flux consistency, and thereby recovering\nconvergence, is presented. Further, local conservation is established for all\nKrylov subspace methods, with and without restarts, and for Newton's method\nunder certain assumptions on the discretization. Thus it is shown that\nNewton-Krylov methods are locally conservative, although not necessarily flux\nconsistent. Numerical experiments with the 2D compressible Euler equations\ncorroborate the theoretical results. Further numerical investigations of the\nimpact of flux consistency on Newton-Krylov methods indicate that its effect is\ncase dependent, and diminishes as the number of iterations grow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

The species-specific convective heat\ntransfer coefficient was also considered. An analysis of the calculated\nsensible heat flux shows that both leaf area density and sky view factor are\nimportant factors in the production of cool air. According to the calculated\ndistributions of air temperature and velocity, even under the condition of a\ncertain degree of incident flow, the cooled air can flow down to the space\nunder the crown, accumulate, and then diverge when the wind speed is\nsufficiently low in the crown owing to the crown drag. Buildings contribute to\nboth the accumulation and dissipation of cool air. The findings of the present\nstudy suggest that cool spots can be produced during nighttime by trees planted\nnear streets by devising a suitable arrangement and morphology of trees and\nbuildings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 04:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Beneficial impacts of\nRIS include but are not limited to offering a new degree-of-freedom (DoF) for\nkey-less PLS optimization, and increasing channel randomness for physical layer\nsecret key generation (PL-SKG). However, there is a lack of research studying\nhow adversarial RIS can be used to attack and obtain legitimate secret keys\ngenerated by PL-SKG. In this work, we show an Eve-controlled adversarial RIS\n(Eve-RIS), by inserting into the legitimate channel a random and reciprocal\nchannel, can partially reconstruct the secret keys from the legitimate PL-SKG\nprocess. To operationalize this concept, we design Eve-RIS schemes against two\nPL-SKG techniques used: (i) the CSI-based PL-SKG, and (ii) the two-way cross\nmultiplication based PL-SKG. The channel probing at Eve-RIS is realized by\ncompressed sensing designs with a small number of radio-frequency (RF) chains.\nThen, the optimal RIS phase is obtained by maximizing the Eve-RIS inserted\ndeceiving channel. Our analysis and results show that even with a passive RIS,\nour proposed Eve-RIS can achieve a high key match rate with legitimate users,\nand is resistant to most of the current defensive approaches. This means the\nnovel Eve-RIS provides a new eavesdropping threat on PL-SKG, which can spur new\nresearch areas to counter adversarial RIS attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 00:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

However, it was recently observed that one\ncan construct MACs from two-player non-local games while relating the winning\nprobability of the game to the capacity of the MAC. By considering games for\nwhich entanglement (a special kind of non-signaling correlation) increases the\nwinning probability (e.g., the Magic Square game), this shows that for some\nspecific kinds of channels, entanglement between the senders can increase the\ncapacity.\n  In this work, we make several contributions towards understanding the\ncapacity region for MACs with the assistance of non-signaling correlations\nbetween the parties. We develop a linear program computing the optimal success\nprobability for coding over $n$ copies of a MAC $W$ with size growing\npolynomially in $n$. Solving this linear program allows us to achieve inner\nbounds for MACs.

For noisy channels, where the\nzero-error non-signaling assisted capacity region is trivial, we can use\nconcatenated codes to obtain achievable points in the capacity region. Applied\nto a noisy version of the binary adder channel, we show that non-signaling\nassistance still improves the sum-rate capacity.

During the training phase,\nmost of the existing multi-task learning models concentrate entirely on the\ntarget task data and ignore the non-target task data contained in the target\ntasks. To address this issue, Universum data, that do not correspond to any\nclass of a classification problem, may be used as prior knowledge in the\ntraining model. This study looks at the challenge of multi-task learning using\nUniversum data to employ non-target task data, which leads to better\nperformance.

The solution of the two primal problems in\nLS-UMTSVM is simplified to solving just two systems of linear equations,\nresulting in an incredibly simple and quick approach.

One\nof the considered explanations of their origin is magnetic reconnection, which\naccording to theoretical studies can efficiently heat the low-density ISM. We\npresent, for the first time, high-resolution C-band (5GHz) radio maps of the\nnearby face-on spiral galaxy M101 to study the magnetic fields and verify the\nexistence of the magnetic arms. The analysis of the archival XMM-Newton X-ray\ndata is performed to search for signatures of gas heating by magnetic\nreconnection effects in the disk and the halo of this galaxy. We combine the\nVery Large Array (VLA) and Effelsberg radio maps of M101 to restore the\nlarge-scale emission lost in the interferometric observations.

Benefiting from the above design concept, AdvSmo will generate\nadversarial examples with strong transferability and solid evasiveness.\nFinally, compared to the four advanced black-box adversarial attack methods,\nfor the eight target models, the results show that AdvSmo improves the average\nattack success rate by 9% on the CIFAR-10 and 16% on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset\ncompared to the best of these attack methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 11:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

In this paper, an\nauthentication model for identity documents based on forgery detection of\nguilloche patterns is proposed. The proposed approach is made up of two steps:\nfeature extraction and similarity measure between a pair of feature vectors of\nidentity documents. The feature extraction step involves learning the\nsimilarity between a pair of identity documents via a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architecture and ends by extracting highly discriminative\nfeatures between them. While, the similarity measure step is applied to decide\nif a given identity document is authentic or forged. In this work, these two\nsteps are combined together to achieve two objectives: (i) extracted features\nshould have good anticollision (discriminative) capabilities to distinguish\nbetween a pair of identity documents belonging to different classes, (ii)\nchecking out the conformity of the guilloche pattern of a given identity\ndocument and its similarity to the guilloche pattern of an authentic version of\nthe same country. Experiments are conducted in order to analyze and identify\nthe most proper parameters to achieve higher authentication performance. The\nexperimental results are performed on the MIDV-2020 dataset.

Most message-passing models act as graph convolutions, where\nfeatures are mixed by a shared, linear transformation before being propagated\nover the edges. On node-classification tasks, graph convolutions have been\nshown to suffer from two limitations: poor performance on heterophilic graphs,\nand over-smoothing. It is common belief that both phenomena occur because such\nmodels behave as low-pass filters, meaning that the Dirichlet energy of the\nfeatures decreases along the layers incurring a smoothing effect that\nultimately makes features no longer distinguishable. In this work, we\nrigorously prove that simple graph-convolutional models can actually enhance\nhigh frequencies and even lead to an asymptotic behaviour we refer to as\nover-sharpening, opposite to over-smoothing. We do so by showing that linear\ngraph convolutions with symmetric weights minimize a multi-particle energy that\ngeneralizes the Dirichlet energy; in this setting, the weight matrices induce\nedge-wise attraction (repulsion) through their positive (negative) eigenvalues,\nthereby controlling whether the features are being smoothed or sharpened.

Here we report on temperature-dependent\nmeasurements of helimagnon excitations in the field polarized regime\nCo$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ using the spin wave small-angle neutron scattering (SWSANS)\ntechnique. By applying a new analytical expression to interpret the data,\nquantitative estimates for both spin wave stiffness and damping are extracted\nacross a wide temperature range between 70 K and 250 K.

However, since some action instances of different\ncategories are visually similar, it is non-trivial to exactly label the\n(usually) one action category for a snippet, and incorrect pseudo labels would\nimpair the localization performance. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel method from a category exclusion perspective, named Progressive\nComplementary Learning (ProCL), which gradually enhances the snippet-level\nsupervision. Our method is inspired by the fact that video-level labels\nprecisely indicate the categories that all snippets surely do not belong to,\nwhich is ignored by previous works.

And then, we\nintroduce the background-aware pseudo complementary labeling in order to\nexclude more categories for snippets of less ambiguity. Furthermore, for the\nremaining ambiguous snippets, we attempt to reduce the ambiguity by\ndistinguishing foreground actions from the background.

In this paper, we propose a generic partial attention mechanism,\nwhich adopts the previous priority values (i.e., the number of\nadditionally-covered code units) to avoid considering all candidate test cases.\nIncorporating the mechanism with the additional-greedy strategy, we implement a\nnovel coverage-based TCP technique based on partition ordering (OCP). OCP first\ngroups the candidate test cases into different partitions and updates the\npartitions on the descending order. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on 19\nversions of Java programs and 30 versions of C programs to compare the\neffectiveness and efficiency of OCP with six state-of-the-art TCP techniques:\ntotal-greedy, additional-greedy, lexicographical-greedy, unify-greedy,\nart-based, and search-based. The experimental results show that OCP achieves a\nbetter fault detection rate than the state-of-the-arts. Moreover, the time\ncosts of OCP are found to achieve 85%-99% improvement than most\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 12:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

In particular, tensile strain promotes the selective\nreduction of apical oxygen, which may explain why the recently observed\nsuperconductivity of infinite-layer nickelates is limited to strained films.\nFor (LaNiO3)$_1$/(LaAlO3)$_1$(001) superlattices, the simulations reveal that\nthe NiO2 layer is most prone to vacancy formation, whereas the AlO2 layer\nexhibits generally the highest formation energies. The reduction is\nconsistently endothermic, and a largely repulsive vacancy-vacancy interaction\nis identified as a function of the vacancy concentration. The released\nelectrons are accommodated exclusively in the NiO2 layer, reducing the vacancy\nformation energy in the AlO2 layer by 70% with respect to bulk LaAlO3. By\nvarying the vacancy concentration from 0% to 8.3% in the NiO2 layer at tensile\nstrain, we observe an unexpected transition from a localized\nsite-disproportionated (0.5%) to a delocalized (2.1%) charge accommodation, a\nre-entrant site disproportionation leading to a metal-to-insulator transition\ndespite a half-filled majority-spin Ni $e_g$ manifold (4.2%), and finally a\nmagnetic phase transition (8.3%).

This gas was thought\nto be a protoplanetary remnant until it was recently shown that it could be\nreleased in collisions of volatile-rich solids. As CO is released, interstellar\nUV radiation photodissociates CO producing CI, which can shield CO allowing a\nlarge CO mass to accumulate. However, this picture was challenged because CI is\ninefficient at shielding if CO and CI are vertically mixed. Here, we study for\nthe first time the vertical evolution of gas to determine how vertical mixing\naffects the efficiency of shielding by CI. We present a 1D model that accounts\nfor gas release, photodissociation, ionisation, viscous evolution, and vertical\nmixing due to turbulent diffusion. We find that if the gas surface density is\nhigh and the vertical diffusion weak ($\\alpha_{\\rm v}/\\alpha<[H/r]^2$) CO\nphotodissociates high above the midplane, forming an optically thick CI layer\nthat shields the CO underneath. Conversely, if diffusion is strong\n($\\alpha_{\\rm v}/\\alpha>[H/r]^2$) CI and CO become well mixed, shortening the\nCO lifetime. Moreover, diffusion could also limit the amount of dust settling.\nHigh-resolution ALMA observations could resolve the vertical distribution of CO\nand CI, and thus constrain vertical mixing and the efficiency of CI shielding.\nWe also find that the CO and CI scale heights may not be good probes of the\nmean molecular weight, and thus composition, of the gas. Finally, we show that\nif mixing is strong the CO lifetime might not be long enough for CO to spread\ninterior to the planetesimal belt where gas is produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 13:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 08:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Applied to\nquiet Sun observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)/Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO), a novel method reveals a cellular network, with cells of\ntypical diameters 50\\arcsec\\ in the cool 304\\AA\\ channel, and 100\\arcsec\\ in\nthe coronal 193\\AA\\ channel.

The sources\nare points, or narrow corridors, of divergence that occupy the centres of\ncells. They are significantly aligned with photospheric network features and\nenhanced magnetic elements. This shows that the bright network is important to\nthe production of PDs, and confirms that the network is host to the source\nfootpoint of quiet coronal loops. The other footpoint, or the sinks of the PDs,\nform the boundaries of the coronal cells. These are not significantly aligned\nwith the photospheric network - they are generally situated above the dark\ninternetwork photosphere.

We argue that these sink\npoints can either be concentrations of closed field footpoints associated with\nminor magnetic elements in the internetwork, or concentrations of\nupward-aligned open field. The link between the coronal velocity and magnetic\nfields is strengthened by a comparison with a magnetic extrapolation, which\nshows several general and specific similarities, thus the velocity maps offer a\nvaluable additional constraint on models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 13:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Here, we present a universal trade-off relation that builds a bridge\nbetween these three concepts. This trade-off particularly reveals that (1)\nunder a global symmetry, any attempt to induce local dynamics that change the\nconserved quantity will cause inevitable irreversibility, and (2) such\nirreversibility could be mitigated by quantum coherence. Our fundamental\nrelation also admits broad applications in physics and quantum information\nprocessing. In the context of thermodynamics, we derive a trade-off relation\nbetween entropy production and quantum coherence in arbitrary isothermal\nprocesses. We also apply our relation to black hole physics and obtain a\nuniversal lower bound on how many bits of classical information thrown into a\nblack hole become unreadable under the Hayden-Preskill model with the energy\nconservation law. This particularly shows that when the black hole is large\nenough, under suitable encoding, at least about $m/4$ bits of the thrown $m$\nbits will be irrecoverable until 99 percent of the black hole evaporates. As an\napplication to quantum information processing, we provide a lower bound on the\ncoherence cost to implement an arbitrary quantum channel. We employ this bound\nto obtain a quantitative Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem that comes with a clear\noperational meaning, as well as an error-coherence trade-off for unitary gate\nimplementation and an error lower bound for approximate error correction with\ncovariant encoding.

Predictions of the limb-darkening coefficients for the\npower-2 law are not widely available. We therefore compute them, using stellar\natmosphere models generated by the ATLAS (plane-parallel) code.

Today, such experiments are more common than ever. While this is\ngreat for advancing the field, the number of publications makes it difficult to\nkeep an overview. Additionally, designing rigorous experiments with human\nparticipants is a challenging task, and the multitude of design decisions and\noptions can make it difficult for researchers to select a suitable design.\n  We therefore conducted a systematic mapping study of 95 source code\ncomprehension experiments published between 1979 and 2019.

We describe what topics have been studied, as well as how these\nstudies have been designed, conducted, and reported. Frequently chosen design\noptions and deficiencies are pointed out.

On a very short time horizon, the\nbest policy is to overbet the satellite, whereby the overriding objective is to\nraise the aggregate beta toward a growth-optimal level. On an infinite horizon,\nby contrast, the correct behavior is to blithely ignore the core and optimize\nthe exponential growth rate of the satellite, which will anyways come to\ndominate the entire bankroll in the limit. For time horizons strictly between\nzero and infinity, the optimal strategy is not so simple: there is a key\ntrade-off between the instantaneous growth rate of the composite bankroll, and\nthat of the satellite itself, which suffers ongoing volatility drag from the\noverbetting. Thus, a very perspicacious policy is called for, since any losses\nin the satellite will constrain the agent's access to leverage in the\ncontinuation problem. We characterize the optimal feedback controller, and\ncompute it in earnest by solving the corresponding HJB equation recursively and\nbackward in time. This solution is then compared to the best open-loop\ncontroller, which, in spite of its relative simplicity, is expected to perform\nsimilarly in practical situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 14:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 23:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

To\nbetter leverage the advantages of different acquisition functions, we propose a\nnew method for batch BO. In each iteration, three acquisition functions are\ndynamically selected from a set based on their current and historical\nperformance to form a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Using an\nevolutionary multi-objective algorithm to optimize such a MOP, a set of\nnon-dominated solutions can be obtained. To select batch candidate solutions,\nwe rank these non-dominated solutions into several layers according to their\nrelative performance on the three acquisition functions. The empirical results\nshow that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods\non different problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 14:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

We show that\nthis relaxation allows us to bypass the aforementioned negative results in a\nvery strong sense.

Experiments have shown that heat transfer is surprisingly always\ndiffusive. The scattering from phonons and impurities have been postulated to\nbe the two factors critical in causing the diffusive transport. In this work,\nwe evaluate the transport process by incorporating a bath of phonons and\nimpurities in order to understand the role played by each of the factors. While\nmethods like time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) can be\nused to simulate isolated spin chains, the coupling with phonons make\nsimulations significantly more challenging. The recently developed multisite\ntensor network path integral (MS-TNPI) method builds a framework for simulating\nthe dynamics in extended open quantum systems by combining ideas from tDMRG and\nFeynman-Vernon influence functional.

Therefore, prioritization and focus become critical, to spend their\nlimited time on the highest risk vulnerabilities. In doing this, it is\nimportant for these organizations not only to understand the technical\ndescriptions of the vulnerabilities, but also to gain insights into attackers'\nperspectives. In this work, we use machine learning and natural language\nprocessing techniques, as well as several publicly available data sets to\nprovide an explainable mapping of vulnerabilities to attack techniques and\nthreat actors. This work provides new security intelligence, by predicting\nwhich attack techniques are most likely to be used to exploit a given\nvulnerability and which threat actors are most likely to conduct the\nexploitation.

In domain\nadaptation (DA), one wants to classify unlabeled target images using source\nlabeled images. Unfortunately, deep neural networks trained on a source\ntraining set perform poorly on target images which do not belong to the\ntraining domain. One strategy to improve these performances is to align the\nsource and target image distributions in an embedded space using optimal\ntransport (OT). However OT can cause negative transfer, i.e. aligning samples\nwith different labels, which leads to overfitting especially in the presence of\nlabel shift between domains. In this work, we mitigate negative alignment by\nexplaining it as a noisy label assignment to target images. We then mitigate\nits effect by appropriate regularization.

This trick leads to a simpler way of solving an\n$f(R)$-theory regardless its specific form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 01:55:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The runtime benefits from using irregular super pixels as\nbasis for the input for the CNN rather than the image grid, which tremendously\nreduces the input size. Although, this method achieved remarkable low\ncomputational time in both training and testing phases, the lower resolution of\nthe super pixel domain yields naturally lower accuracy compared to high cost\nstate of the art methods. In this work, we focus on a refinement of the road\nsegmentation utilising a Conditional Random Field (CRF).The refinement\nprocedure is limited to the super pixels touching the predicted road boundary\nto keep the additional computational effort low. Reducing the input to the\nsuper pixel domain allows the CNNs structure to stay small and efficient to\ncompute while keeping the advantage of convolutional layers and makes them\neligible for ADAS. Applying CRF compensate the trade off between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. The proposed system obtained comparable performance\namong the top performing algorithms on the KITTI road benchmark and its fast\ninference makes it particularly suitable for realtime applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 12:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Unlike manual efforts that exploit all\navailable run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a\nsingle type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make\neffective use of the joint information among multi-source data. Consequently,\nmany false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system\nanomalies, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study based on a large amount\nof heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that\nsystem anomalies could manifest distinctly in different data types. Thus,\nintegrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a\nsystem's health status. In this context, we propose HADES, the first work to\neffectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach\nemploys a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the\nsystem status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures\ndiscriminative features and meaningful interactions from multi-modal data via a\nnovel cross-modal attention module, enabling accurate system anomaly detection.\nWe evaluate HADES extensively on large-scale simulated and industrial datasets.\nThe experimental results present the superiority of HADES in detecting system\nanomalies on heterogeneous data. We release the code and the annotated dataset\nfor reproducibility and future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 08:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 03:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

For cost-sensitive short-reach optical\nnetworks, some advanced single-polarization (SP) optical field recovery schemes\nare recently proposed to avoid chromatic dispersion-induced power fading\neffect, and improve the spectral efficiency for larger potential capacity.\nPolarization division multiplexing (PDM) can further double both the spectral\nefficiency and the system capacity of these SP carrier-assisted direct\ndetection (DD) schemes. However, the so-called polarization fading phenomenon\ninduced by random polarization rotation is a fundamental obstacle which\nprevents SP carrier-assisted DD systems from polarization diversity. In this\npaper, we propose a receiver of Jones-space field recovery (JSFR) to realize\npolarization diversity with SP carrier-assisted DD schemes in Jones space.\nDifferent receiver structures and simplified recovery procedures for JSFR are\nexplored theoretically. The proposed JSFR pushes the SP DD schemes towards PDM\nwithout extra optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty. In addition, the\nJSFR shows good tolerance to PMD since the optical field recovery is conducted\nbefore polarization recovery. In the concept-of-proof experiment, we\ndemonstrate 448-Gb/s reception over 80-km single-mode fiber using the proposed\nJSFR based on 22 couplers. Furthermore, we qualitatively compare the optical\nfield recovery in Jones space and Stokes space from the perspective of the\nmodulation dimension.
