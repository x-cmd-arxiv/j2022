Training\nwith corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however,\nlittle attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper,\nwe focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to\nmitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight\nfor each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization\nperformance over a validation set.

Recently, to abstract\na network's structural and dynamical attributes for utilization, network\nrepresentation has been one focus, mapping a network or its substructures (like\nnodes) into a low-dimensional vector space. Since the current methods are\nmostly based on machine learning, a black box of an input-output data fitting\nmechanism, generally the space's dimension is indeterminable and its elements\nare not interpreted. Although massive efforts to cope with this issue have\nincluded, for example, automated machine learning by computer scientists and\ncomputational theory by mathematics, the root causes still remain unresolved.\nGiven that, from a physical perspective, this article proposes two determinable\nand interpretable node representation methods. To evaluate their effectiveness\nand generalization, this article further proposes Adaptive and Interpretable\nProbS (AIProbS), a network-based model that can utilize node representations\nfor link prediction. Experimental results showed that the AIProbS can reach\nstate-of-the-art precision beyond baseline models, and by and large it can make\na good trade-off with machine learning-based models on precision, determinacy,\nand interpretability, indicating that physical methods could also play a large\nrole in the study of network representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 18:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

Here, we\npredict that upon stacking two layers of an STVS material with an angular\ntwist, a novel chiral topological phase -- an $f \\pm if'$-wave superconductor\n-- emerges in the vicinity of the `maximal' twist angle of 30$^{\\circ}$ where\nthe system becomes an extrinsic quasi-crystal with 12-fold tiling. The\nresulting composite is a non-Abelian topological superconductor (TSC) with an\nodd number of chiral Majorana modes at its edges and a single Majorana zero\nmode (MZM) localized in the vortex core. Through symmetry analysis and detailed\nmicroscopic modelling based on a novel quasi-crystal band structure technique,\nwe demonstrate that the non-Abelian TSC forms when the isolated Fermi pockets\ncoalesce into a single connected Fermi surface around the center of the\nmoir\\'{e} Brillouin zone and is stable over a wide range of electron density.\nWe further discuss how the energetics leading to the $f \\pm if'$-wave phase\nresults in anomalous $\\pi$-periodic inter-layer Josephson effect, which can\nserve as a distinctive signature of the chiral phase. Distinct from the\nvalley-preserving moir\\'{e} physics in small-angle twisted graphene, our\nresults establish the large-angle moir\\'{e} physics arising near maximal twist\nas a new avenue toward intrinsic TSC with non-Abelian excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 19:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 20:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 19:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Typical approaches for robots, however, require\ncomplex visual systems or multiple high-density tactile sensors which can be\nhighly expensive. In addition, they usually require actual collection of a\nlarge dataset from real objects through direct interaction. In this paper, we\npropose a kinesthetic-based object recognition method that can be performed\nwith any multi-fingered robotic hand in which the kinematics is known. The\nmethod does not require tactile sensors and is based on observing grasps of the\nobjects. We utilize a unique and frame invariant parameterization of grasps to\nlearn instances of object shapes. To train a classifier, training data is\ngenerated rapidly and solely in a computational process without interaction\nwith real objects. We then propose and compare between two iterative algorithms\nthat can integrate any trained classifier. The classifiers and algorithms are\nindependent of any particular robot hand and, therefore, can be exerted on\nvarious ones. We show in experiments, that with few grasps, the algorithms\nacquire accurate classification. Furthermore, we show that the object\nrecognition approach is scalable to objects of various sizes. Similarly, a\nglobal classifier is trained to identify general geometries (e.g., an ellipsoid\nor a box) rather than particular ones and demonstrated on a large set of\nobjects. Full scale experiments and analysis are provided to show the\nperformance of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 20:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

To tackle this, we develop a neural model, called RadNet,\nwhich forecasts system parameters such as average vehicle speeds for a future\ntimestep. As such systems largely follow daily or weekly periodicity, we\ncompare RadNet's predictions against historical averages to label incidents.\nUnlike prior work, RadNet infers spatial and temporal trends in both\npermutations, finally combining the dense representations before forecasting.\nThis facilitates informed inference and more accurate incident detection.\nExperiments with two publicly available and a new road traffic dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed model gives up to 8% higher prediction F1 scores\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 20:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

To enable such algorithm\ndevelopment, without the need for acquiring hundreds of patient exams, in this\npaper we demonstrate a deep learning technique to generate synthetic but\nrealistic whole-body PET sinograms from abundantly-available whole-body MRI.\nSpecifically, we use a dataset of 56 $^{18}$F-FDG-PET/MRI exams to train a 3D\nresidual UNet to predict physiologic PET uptake from whole-body T1-weighted\nMRI. In training we implemented a balanced loss function to generate realistic\nuptake across a large dynamic range and computed losses along tomographic lines\nof response to mimic the PET acquisition. The predicted PET images are forward\nprojected to produce synthetic PET time-of-flight (ToF) sinograms that can be\nused with vendor-provided PET reconstruction algorithms, including using\nCT-based attenuation correction (CTAC) and MR-based attenuation correction\n(MRAC). The resulting synthetic data recapitulates physiologic $^{18}$F-FDG\nuptake, e.g. high uptake localized to the brain and bladder, as well as uptake\nin liver, kidneys, heart and muscle. To simulate abnormalities with high\nuptake, we also insert synthetic lesions. We demonstrate that this synthetic\nPET data can be used interchangeably with real PET data for the PET\nquantification task of comparing CT and MR-based attenuation correction\nmethods, achieving $\\leq 7.6\\%$ error in mean-SUV compared to using real data.\nThese results together show that the proposed synthetic PET data pipeline can\nbe reasonably used for development, evaluation, and validation of PET/MRI\nreconstruction methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 21:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

These gradients can\narise either naturally through metabolism, or experimentally, e.g., by flow of\nmaterials through several channels or by use of diffusion chambers with\nsemipermeable membranes. Numerous hypotheses regarding the mechanism of this\nphenomenon have been proposed. Here we discuss a mechanism based solely on\ndiffusion and chemical kinetics and show that kinetic asymmetry, a difference\nin the off rates for substrate and for product, and diffusion asymmetry, a\ndifference in the diffusivities of the bound and free forms of the enzyme, are\nthe sole determinates of the direction of chemotaxis. Exploration of these\nfundamental symmetries that govern nonequilibrium behavior helps to distinguish\nbetween possible mechanisms for the evolution of a chemical system from initial\nto the steady state, and whether the principle that determines the direction a\nsystem shifts when exposed to an external energy source is based on\nthermodynamics, or on kinetics, with the latter being supported by the results\nof the present paper. Our results show that while dissipation ineluctably\naccompanies non-equilibrium phenomena, including chemotaxis, systems do not\nevolve to maximize dissipation, but rather to attain greatest kinetic\nstability. Chemotactic response to the gradients formed by other enzymes\nprovides a mechanism for forming loose associations known as metabolons.\nSignificantly the direction of the effective force due to these gradients\ndepends on the kinetic asymmetry of the enzyme, and so can be non-reciprocal,\nwhere one enzyme is attracted to another enzyme, but the other enzyme is\nrepelled by the one, an important ingredient in the behavior of active matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 22:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

We consider three random circuit\nfamilies, namely, Haar random, $p=1$ QAOA, and random IQP circuits. Our results\nare as follows. For Haar random circuits with $m$ gates, we improve on prior\nresults by showing $\\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hardness of average-case additive\napproximations to an imprecision of $2^{-O(m)}$. Efficient classical simulation\nof such problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For\nconstant depth circuits i.e., when $m=O(n)$, this linear scaling in the\nexponent is within a constant of the scaling required to show hardness of\nsampling. Prior to our work, such a result was shown only for Boson Sampling in\nBouland et al (2021).

In this paper, we propose\nSTD-NET, an unsupervised deep-learning architecture search approach via\nhierarchical tensor decomposition for image steganalysis. Our proposed strategy\nwill not be restricted by various residual connections, since this strategy\ndoes not change the number of input and output channels of the convolution\nblock. We propose a normalized distortion threshold to evaluate the sensitivity\nof each involved convolutional layer of the base model to guide STD-NET to\ncompress target network in an efficient and unsupervised approach, and obtain\ntwo network structures of different shapes with low computation cost and\nsimilar performance compared with the original one. Extensive experiments have\nconfirmed that, on one hand, our model can achieve comparable or even better\ndetection performance in various steganalytic scenarios due to the great\nadaptivity of the obtained network architecture. On the other hand, the\nexperimental results also demonstrate that our proposed strategy is more\nefficient and can remove more redundancy compared with previous steganalytic\nnetwork compression methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 03:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In such systems, blockchain is\nmainly used to store the trust score or trust-related information of\ninteractions among the various entities. However, present trust management\narchitectures using blockchain lack verifiable interactions among the entities\non which the trust score is calculated. In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-based trust management framework that allows independent trust\nproviders to implement different trust metrics on a common set of trust\nevidence and provide individual trust value. We employ geo-location as proof of\ninteraction. Some of the existing proposals rely upon geo-location data, but\nthey do not support trust calculation by multiple trust providers. Instead,\nthey can only support a centralised system. Our proposed architecture does not\ndepend upon a single centralised third-party entity to ensure trusted\ninteractions. Our architecture is supported by provable interactions that can\neasily be verified using blockchain. Therefore, it allows a high degree of\nconfidence in trust management by ensuring the actual interactions between the\nentities. We provide a detailed design and development of the architecture\nusing real-world use case examples. The proof of prototype was implemented on\nthe Ethereum blockchain platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nemployment of independent trust providers adequately provides a high degree of\ntrust scores and that the proposed architecture can be used in a real-world\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 06:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

We propose to conduct novel\nactive deep multiple instance learning that samples a small subset of\ninformative instances for annotation, aiming to significantly boost the\ninstance-level prediction. A variance regularized loss function is designed to\nproperly balance the bias and variance of instance-level predictions, aiming to\neffectively accommodate the highly imbalanced instance distribution in MIL and\nother fundamental challenges. Instead of directly minimizing the variance\nregularized loss that is non-convex, we optimize a distributionally robust bag\nlevel likelihood as its convex surrogate. The robust bag likelihood provides a\ngood approximation of the variance based MIL loss with a strong theoretical\nguarantee. It also automatically balances bias and variance, making it\neffective to identify the potentially positive instances to support active\nsampling. The robust bag likelihood can be naturally integrated with a deep\narchitecture to support deep model training using mini-batches of\npositive-negative bag pairs. Finally, a novel P-F sampling function is\ndeveloped that combines a probability vector and predicted instance scores,\nobtained by optimizing the robust bag likelihood. By leveraging the key MIL\nassumption, the sampling function can explore the most challenging bags and\neffectively detect their positive instances for annotation, which significantly\nimproves the instance-level prediction.

Previous\nanimal-related datasets focus either on animal tracking or single-frame animal\npose estimation, and never on both aspects. The lack of APT datasets hinders\nthe development and evaluation of video-based animal pose estimation and\ntracking methods, limiting real-world applications, e.g., understanding animal\nbehavior in wildlife conservation. To fill this gap, we make the first step and\npropose APT-36K, i.e., the first large-scale benchmark for animal pose\nestimation and tracking. Specifically, APT-36K consists of 2,400 video clips\ncollected and filtered from 30 animal species with 15 frames for each video,\nresulting in 36,000 frames in total. After manual annotation and careful\ndouble-check, high-quality keypoint and tracking annotations are provided for\nall the animal instances. Based on APT-36K, we benchmark several representative\nmodels on the following three tracks: (1) supervised animal pose estimation on\na single frame under intra- and inter-domain transfer learning settings, (2)\ninter-species domain generalization test for unseen animals, and (3) animal\npose estimation with animal tracking. Based on the experimental results, we\ngain some empirical insights and show that APT-36K provides a valuable animal\npose estimation and tracking benchmark, offering new challenges and\nopportunities for future research.

Taking a different\nresearch direction, in this work, we propose tBDFS -- a novel temporal GNN\narchitecture. tBDFS applies a layer that efficiently aggregates information\nfrom temporal paths to a given (target) node in the graph. For each given node,\nthe aggregation is applied in two stages: (1) A single representation is\nlearned for each temporal path ending in that node, and (2) all path\nrepresentations are aggregated into a final node representation. Overall, our\ngoal is not to add new information to a node, but rather observe the same exact\ninformation in a new perspective.

Concretely,\nthe GMS utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution to adapt to scale distribution\nand decouples the mixture model into sub-normal distributions to regularize the\nchaos within the sub-distributions. Then, an alignment is introduced to\nregularize the chaos among sub-distributions. However, despite that GMS is\neffective in regularizing the data distribution, it amounts to dislodging the\nhard samples in training set, which incurs overfitting. We assert that it is\nblamed on the block of transferring the latent knowledge exploited by GMS from\ndata to model. Therefore, a Scoped Teacher playing a role of bridge in\nknowledge transform is proposed. What' s more, the consistency regularization\nis also introduced to implement knowledge transform. To that effect, the\nfurther constraints are deployed on Scoped Teacher to derive feature\nconsistence between teacher and student end.\n  With proposed GMS and Scoped Teacher implemented on five mainstream datasets\nof crowd localization, the extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nour work. Moreover, comparing with existing crowd locators, our work achieves\nstate-of-the-art via F1-meansure comprehensively on five datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 11:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 10:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

When sending a\nlocally computed gradient, each device compresses a high dimensional local\ngradient to multiple lower-dimensional gradient vectors using block\nsparsification.

In this\npaper, we describe the data used and the approach adopted to derive and\nvalidate the G_RVS magnitudes published in DR3.

We processed these spectra following a procedure similar to that used for\nDR2, but incorporating several improvements that allow a better estimation of\nG_RVS. These improvements pertain to the stray-light background estimation, the\nline spread function calibration, and the detection of spectra contaminated by\nnearby relatively bright sources. We calibrated the G_RVS zero-point every 30\nhours based on the reference magnitudes of constant stars from the Hipparcos\ncatalogue, and used them to transform the integrated flux of the cleaned and\ncalibrated spectra into epoch magnitudes. The G_RVS magnitude of a star\npublished in DR3 is the median of the epoch magnitudes for that star. We\nestimated the G_RVS passband by comparing the RVS spectra of 108 bright stars\nwith their flux-calibrated spectra from external spectrophotometric libraries.\nThe G_RVS magnitude provides information that is complementary to that obtained\nfrom the G, G_BP, and G_RP magnitudes, which is useful for constraining stellar\nmetallicity and interstellar extinction. The median precision of G_RVS\nmeasurements ranges from about 0.006 mag for the brighter stars (i.e. with 3.5\n< G_RVS < 6.5 mag) to 0.125 mag at the faint end. The derived G_RVS passband\nshows that the effective transmittance of the RVS is approximately 1.23 times\nbetter than the pre-launch estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The widely accepted\ntheory of the fluctuation induced forces is based on the \"fluctuational\nelectrodynamics\" , when the Maxwell equations are supplemented by random\ncurrent sources responsible for the fluctuations of the medium polarization.\n  The first part of our paper touches on some conceptual issues of the theory,\nsuch as the dissipation-less limit and the link between Rytov's approach and\nquantum electrodynamics. We point out the problems with the dissipation-less\nplasma model (with its unphysical double pole at zero frequency) which still\nappears in the literature.\n  The second part of the paper is devoted to \"quantum friction\", in a broad\nsense, and it contains some novel material. In particular, it is pointed out\nthat in weakly dissipative systems the friction force may not be a stationary\nprocess. It is shown, using an \"exact\" (nonpertubative) quantum treatment that\nunder appropriate conditions, an instability can occur when the kinetic energy\n(due to the relative motion between the bodies) is transformed into coherent\nradiation, exponentially growing in intensity (the instability gets eventually\nlimited by non-linear effects). We also discuss a setup when the two bodies are\nat rest but a constant electric current is flowing in one of the bodies. One\nmay say that only the electron component of one body is dragged with respect to\nthe other body, unlike the usual setup when the two bodies are in relative\nmotion. Clearly there are differences in the frictional forces between the two\nsetups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 13:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

A magneto-mechanical device composed\nof nanomagnets that potentially meets this objective is thus predicated. The\nmagnetic particles must be bio-functionalised for \"in-body\" use where their\nuniqueness allows precise tracking and manipulation.

However, given the evolving\nsophistication of injection attacks and the increasing complexity of tuning a\nWAF, it is challenging to ensure that the WAF is free of injection\nvulnerabilities such that it will block all malicious injection attacks without\nwrongly affecting the legitimate message. Automatically testing the WAF is,\ntherefore, a timely and essential task. In this paper, we propose DaNuoYi, an\nautomatic injection testing tool that simultaneously generates test inputs for\nmultiple types of injection attacks on a WAF. Our basic idea derives from the\ncross-lingual translation in the natural language processing domain. In\nparticular, test inputs for different types of injection attacks are\nsyntactically different but may be semantically similar. Sharing semantic\nknowledge across multiple programming languages can thus stimulate the\ngeneration of more sophisticated test inputs and discovering injection\nvulnerabilities of the WAF that are otherwise difficult to find. To this end,\nin DaNuoYi, we train several injection translation models by using multi-task\nlearning that translates the test inputs between any pair of injection attacks.\nThe model is then used by a novel multi-task evolutionary algorithm to\nco-evolve test inputs for different types of injection attacks facilitated by a\nshared mating pool and domain-specific mutation operators at each generation.\nWe conduct experiments on three real-world open-source WAFs and six types of\ninjection attacks, the results reveal that DaNuoYi generates up to 3.8x and\n5.78x more valid test inputs (i.e., bypassing the underlying WAF) than its\nstate-of-the-art single-task counterparts and the context-free grammar-based\ninjection construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 14:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Three regimes of the\nchromospheric stellar activity are identified, confirming suggestions made by\nprevious authors on much smaller $R'_{\\rm HK}$ datasets. The highest stellar\nactivity regime is associated with PMS stars and RS CVn systems, in which\nactivity is enhanced by tidal interaction.

In order to study the\ncontribution of the occasional coupling scheme, we perform a detailed linear\nstability analysis and analytically explain this enhancement of the amplitude\ndeath region for coupled limit cycle oscillators.

We highlight that the chosen time integration scheme\ndiffers from existing implicit FSI integration methods in that it is indeed\nsecond-order accurate, does not suffer from the overshoot phenomenon, and\noptimally dissipates high-frequency modes in both subproblems. We propose a\npipeline for generating subject-specific meshes for FSI analysis for\nanatomically realistic geometric modeling. Unlike most existing methodologies\nthat operate directly on the wall surface mesh, our pipeline starts from the\nimage segmentation stage. With high-quality surface meshes obtained, the\nvolumetric meshes are then generated, guaranteeing a boundary-layered mesh in\nthe fluid subdomain and a matching mesh across the fluid-solid interface. In\nthe last, we propose a combined suite of nonlinear and linear solver\ntechnologies. Invoking a segregated algorithm within the Newton-Raphson\niteration, the problem reduces to solving two linear systems in the\nmulti-corrector stage. The first linear system can be addressed by the\nalgebraic multigrid (AMG) method. The matrix related to the balance equations\npresents a two-by-two block structure in both subproblems. Using the Schur\ncomplement reduction (SCR) technique reduces the problem to solving matrices of\nsmaller sizes of the elliptic type, and the AMG method again becomes a natural\ncandidate. The benefit of the unified formulation is demonstrated in\nparallelizing the solution algorithms as the number of unknowns matches in both\nsubdomains. We use the Greenshields-Weller benchmark as well as a\npatient-specific vascular model to demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and\nscalability of the overall FSI solver technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 12:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Instead of forming a mesh, the PINNs is meshless and can be trained\non batches of randomly sampled collocation points. In order to capture the\ntheoretical singular behavior of the near-tip stress and strain fields, the\nstandard PINNs formulation is enriched here by including the crack-tip\nasymptotic functions such that the singular solutions at the crack-tip region\ncan be modeled accurately without a high degree of nodal refinement. The\nlearnable parameters of the enriched PINNs are trained to satisfy the governing\nequations of the cracked body and the corresponding boundary conditions. It was\nfound that the incorporation of the crack-tip enrichment functions in PINNs is\nsubstantially simpler and more trouble-free than in the finite element (FEM) or\nboundary element (BEM) methods. The present algorithm is tested on a class of\nrepresentative benchmarks with different modes of loading types. Results show\nthat the present method allows the calculation of accurate stress intensity\nfactors (SIFs) with far fewer degrees of freedom. A self-contained MATLAB code\nand data-sets accompanying this manuscript are also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 09:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The renormalization program is an essential part\nof the calculation of the scattering amplitudes, where the infinities of the\ncalculated masses of the elementary particles are subtracted for the\nprogressive calculation of the higher-order perturbative terms. The\nmathematical structure of the mass term from quantum field theories expressed\nin the form of infinities suggests that there exists a finite dynamical mass in\nthe limit when the input mass parameter approaches zero. The Lagrangian\nrecovers symmetry at the same time as the input mass becomes zero, whereas the\nself-energy diagrams acquire a finite dynamical mass of the quantum fields in\nthe 4-dimensional space when the dimensional regularization method of\nrenormalization is utilized. The complex forms of the QCD and QED interaction\npotentials are obtained by replacing the fixed mass and coupling constants in\nthe Yukawa potential with the scale-dependent running coupling constant and the\ncorresponding dynamical mass. The derived QCD potential predicts quark\nconfinement and deconfinement, and the QED potential derived by the same method\npredicts the sharply rising delta function potential near the contact distance\nbetween the electron and positron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 17:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}
