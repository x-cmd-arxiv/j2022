We start with the two\nopposed regions I and II in the Penrose diagram, and study the evolution of\nmatter in these regions, using the algebra derived earlier from the Shapiro\neffect in quantum particles. Since this spacetime has two distinct asymptotic\nregions, one must assume that there is a mechanism that reduces the number of\nstates. In earlier work we proposed that region II describes the angular\nantipodes of region I, the `antipodal identification', but this eventually\nleads to contradictions. Our much simpler proposal is now that all states\ndefined in region II are exact quantum clones of those in region I. This\nindicates more precisely how to restore unitarity by making all quantum states\nobservable, and in addition suggests that generalisations towards other black\nhole structures will be possible.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark\n(BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442\nauthors across 132 institutions.

BIG-bench focuses on\ntasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language\nmodels. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense\ntransformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench,\nacross model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In\naddition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide\na strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both\nimprove with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with\nrater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes,\nthough with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and\npredictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component,\nwhereas tasks that exhibit \"breakthrough\" behavior at a critical scale often\ninvolve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically\nincreases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be\nimproved with prompting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 17:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 17:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Recent advances in differentiable causal discovery have\nproposed to factorize the data generating process into a set of modules, i.e.\none module for the conditional distribution of every variable where only causal\nparents are used as predictors. Such a modular decomposition of knowledge\nenables adaptation to distributions shifts by only updating a subset of\nparameters. In this work, we systematically study the generalization and\nadaption performance of such modular neural causal models by comparing it to\nmonolithic models and structured models where the set of predictors is not\nconstrained to causal parents.

Unlike integration of the stochastic\ndynamics, the method has the advantage of giving direct access to quantities\nthat are challenging to estimate from trajectories alone, such as the\nprobability current, the density itself, and its entropy.

These active metasurfaces arbitrarily transform an\nincident wavefront using a reconfigurable spatial phase profile and thus have\nbeen limited to manipulating coherent external sources.

In\na previous paper in this series, we argue that the astrometric mission Gaia can\nidentify long-period binaries by precisely measuring these arcs. An arc in a\nstar's path can also be caused by a fly-by -- the hyperbolic encounter with\nanother massive object. We quantify the apparent acceleration over time induced\nby a companion star as a function of the impact parameter, velocity of\ninteraction, and companion mass. In principle, Gaia could be used to\nastrometrically identify the contribution of massive compact halo objects to\nthe local dark matter potential of the Milky Way.

The traditional wisdom of convolution characterises\nfeature correspondences indistinguishably among 3D points, arising an intrinsic\nlimitation of poor distinctive feature learning.

AGConv generates adaptive kernels for points according to their\ndynamically learned features. Compared with the solution of using\nfixed/isotropic kernels, AGConv improves the flexibility of point cloud\nconvolutions, effectively and precisely capturing the diverse relations between\npoints from different semantic parts. Unlike the popular attentional weight\nschemes, AGConv implements the adaptiveness inside the convolution operation\ninstead of simply assigning different weights to the neighboring points.\nExtensive evaluations clearly show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts of point cloud classification and segmentation on various\nbenchmark datasets.Meanwhile, AGConv can flexibly serve more point cloud\nanalysis approaches to boost their performance. To validate its flexibility and\neffectiveness, we explore AGConv-based paradigms of completion, denoising,\nupsampling, registration and circle extraction, which are comparable or even\nsuperior to their competitors.

The aim of this study is to discover\nand characterise diffuse radio sources in low-mass galaxy clusters in order to\nunderstand their origin and their scaling with host cluster properties. We\nsearched for cluster-scale radio emission from low-mass galaxy clusters in the\nLow Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey - Data Release 2 (LoTSS-DR2)\nfields. We made use of existing optical (Abell, DESI, WHL) and X-ray (comPRASS,\nMCXC) catalogues. The LoTSS-DR2 data were processed further to improve the\nquality of the images that are used to detect and characterize diffuse sources.\nWe have detected diffuse radio emission in 28 galaxy clusters. The number of\nconfirmed (candidates) halos and relics are six (seven) and 10 (three),\nrespectively. Among these, 11 halos and 10 relics, including candidates, are\nnewly discovered by LOFAR. Beside these, five diffuse sources are detected in\ntailed radio galaxies and are probably associated with mergers during the\nformation of the host clusters. We are unable to classify other 13 diffuse\nsources. We compare our newly detected, diffuse sources to known sources by\nplacing them on the scaling relation between the radio power and the mass of\nthe host clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 17:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

A major challenge is that the model does not have\naccess to the future and has to solely rely on the history, i.e., the frames\nobserved so far, to make predictions. It is therefore important to accentuate\nparts of the history that are more informative to the prediction of the current\nframe. We present GateHUB, Gated History Unit with Background Suppression, that\ncomprises a novel position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to enhance or\nsuppress parts of the history as per how informative they are for current frame\nprediction. GateHUB further proposes Future-augmented History (FaH) to make\nhistory features more informative by using subsequently observed frames when\navailable. In a single unified framework, GateHUB integrates the transformer's\nability of long-range temporal modeling and the recurrent model's capacity to\nselectively encode relevant information. GateHUB also introduces a background\nsuppression objective to further mitigate false positive background frames that\nclosely resemble the action frames. Extensive validation on three benchmark\ndatasets, THUMOS, TVSeries, and HDD, demonstrates that GateHUB significantly\noutperforms all existing methods and is also more efficient than the existing\nbest work. Furthermore, a flow-free version of GateHUB is able to achieve\nhigher or close accuracy at 2.8x higher frame rate compared to all existing\nmethods that require both RGB and optical flow information for prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 17:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Thus, the full potential of\nPointNet++ has yet to be explored. In this work, we revisit the classical\nPointNet++ through a systematic study of model training and scaling strategies,\nand offer two major contributions.

We characterize the\ncosmography-readiness of our models using the stability of differences in\nFermat potential (proportional to time delay) w.r.t. modeling choices. We find\nthat for 10/30 lenses our models are cosmography or nearly cosmography grade\n(<3% and 3-5% variations). For 6/30 lenses the models are close to cosmography\ngrade (5-10%). These results are based on informative priors and will need to\nbe confirmed by further analysis. However, they are also likely to improve by\nextending the pipeline modeling sequence and options. In conclusion, we show\nthat uniform cosmography grade modeling of large strong lens samples is within\nreach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Here\nwe shed new light on the MW's past by studying the structural evolution of MW\nprogenitors, which we identify from extragalactic surveys. Specifically, we\nconstrain the stellar-mass growth history (SMGH) of the MW with two methods:\n($i$) direct measurement of the MW's star formation history, and ($ii$)\nassuming the MW is a typical star-forming galaxy that remains on the\nstar-forming main sequence.

In this\nregard, we have performed high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of a precessing jet in a galactic environment.

We carry out a\nsystematic investigation of the structural complexity of the nebula using\npublicly available imaging data at radio and infrared frequencies. For the\nanalysis, we use the well-known multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis\n(MFDFA) in two dimensions. We study the Crab nebula at various length scales to\nsearch for local scaling behaviors. We find that both radio and infra-red data\nexhibit long-range correlations, as expected from the underlying physics of the\nsupernova explosion and evolution. The correlations follow a power-law scaling\nwith length scales. The structural complexity is found to be multifractal in\nnature, as evidenced by the dependence of the generalized Hurst exponent on the\norder of the moments of the detrended fluctuation function. The nature and\nstrength of the multifractality vary with the observing frequency. By repeating\nthe analysis on shuffled data, we further probe the origin of the\nmultifractality in both the imaging data. For the radio data, we find that the\nprobability density function (PDF) is close to a Gaussian form, and hence the\nmultifractal behaviour is due to the differing nature of long-range\ncorrelations of the large and small detrended fluctuation field values. In\ncontrast, we find that the infra-red data has a broad non-Gaussian PDF.\nConsequently, its multifractal properties originate from the broad PDF as well\nas the different correlations of large and small fluctuation values.

The influence of sweep on the wake dynamics is considered for sweep\nangles from $0^\\circ$ to $45^\\circ$ and angles of attack from $16^\\circ$ to\n$30^\\circ$ for a spanwise periodic wing at a chord-based Reynolds number of\n$400$ and a Mach number of $0.1$. Wing sweep affects the wake dynamics,\nespecially in terms of stability and spanwise fluctuations with implications on\nthe development of three-dimensional wakes. We observe that wing sweep\nattenuates spanwise fluctuations. Even as the sweep angle influences the wake,\nforce and pressure coefficients can be collapsed for low angles of attack when\nexamined in wall-normal and wingspan-normal independent flow components. Some\nsmall deviations at high sweep and incidence angles are attributed to vortical\nwake structures that impose secondary aerodynamic loads, revealed through the\nforce element analysis. Furthermore, we conduct global resolvent analysis to\nuncover oblique modes with high disturbance amplification.

For flows at high sweep angles, the optimal convection speed of the\nresponse modes is shown to be faster than the optimal wavemakers speed\nsuggesting a mechanism for the attenuation of perturbations.

However, NDT focuses on modeling the temporal evolution of the\npopulation activity while neglecting the rich covariation between individual\nneurons. In this paper we introduce SpatioTemporal Neural Data Transformer\n(STNDT), an NDT-based architecture that explicitly models responses of\nindividual neurons in the population across time and space to uncover their\nunderlying firing rates. In addition, we propose a contrastive learning loss\nthat works in accordance with mask modeling objective to further improve the\npredictive performance. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on ensemble level in estimating neural activities across four\nneural datasets, demonstrating its capability to capture autonomous and\nnon-autonomous dynamics spanning different cortical regions while being\ncompletely agnostic to the specific behaviors at hand. Furthermore, STNDT\nspatial attention mechanism reveals consistently important subsets of neurons\nthat play a vital role in driving the response of the entire population,\nproviding interpretability and key insights into how the population of neurons\nperforms computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 18:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Such a system has\ntwo possible superconducting states: the chiral state (e.g. $p+ip$ or $d+id$),\nwhich breaks time-reversal symmetry, and the nematic state (e.g. $p+p$ or\n$d+d$), which breaks the threefold rotational symmetry of the lattice.\nWeak-coupling calculations generally favor the chiral over the nematic\nsuperconducting state, raising the question of what mechanism can stabilize the\nlatter. Here, we show that the electromagnetic field fluctuations can play a\ncrucial role in selecting between these two states. Specifically, we derive and\nanalyze the effective free energy for the two-component superconducting order\nparameter after integrating out the gauge-field fluctuations, which is formally\njustified if the spatial order parameter fluctuations can be neglected. A\nnon-analytic cubic term arises, as in the case of a conventional $s$-wave\nsuperconductor. However, unlike the latter, the cubic term depends on the\nrelative phase and on the relative amplitudes between the two order parameter\ncomponents, in such a way that it generally favors the nematic state. This\nresult is a direct consequence of the fact that the stiffness of the\nsuperconducting order parameter is not isotropic. Competition with the quartic\nterm, which favors the chiral state, leads to a renormalized phase diagram in\nwhich the nematic state displaces the chiral state over a wide region in the\nparameter space. We analyze the stability of the fluctuation-induced nematic\nphase, generalize our results to tetragonal lattices, and discuss their\napplicability to candidate nematic superconductors, including twisted bilayer\ngraphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 19:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

However,\nexisting approaches, penalizing the unseen actions or regularizing with the\nbehavior policy, are too pessimistic, which suppresses the generalization of\nthe value function and hinders the performance improvement. This paper explores\nmild but enough conservatism for offline learning while not harming\ngeneralization. We propose Mildly Conservative Q-learning (MCQ), where OOD\nactions are actively trained by assigning them proper pseudo Q values. We\ntheoretically show that MCQ induces a policy that behaves at least as well as\nthe behavior policy and no erroneous overestimation will occur for OOD actions.\nExperimental results on the D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that MCQ achieves\nremarkable performance compared with prior work. Furthermore, MCQ shows\nsuperior generalization ability when transferring from offline to online, and\nsignificantly outperforms baselines.

Recent investigations of lottery tickets\nhypothesis (LTH) demonstrate such enormous pre-trained models can be replaced\nby extremely sparse subnetworks (a.k.a. matching subnetworks) without\nsacrificing transferability. However, practical security-crucial applications\nusually pose more challenging requirements beyond standard transfer, which also\ndemand these subnetworks to overcome adversarial vulnerability. In this paper,\nwe formulate a more rigorous concept, Double-Win Lottery Tickets, in which a\nlocated subnetwork from a pre-trained model can be independently transferred on\ndiverse downstream tasks, to reach BOTH the same standard and robust\ngeneralization, under BOTH standard and adversarial training regimes, as the\nfull pre-trained model can do. We comprehensively examine various pre-training\nmechanisms and find that robust pre-training tends to craft sparser double-win\nlottery tickets with superior performance over the standard counterparts. For\nexample, on downstream CIFAR-10/100 datasets, we identify double-win matching\nsubnetworks with the standard, fast adversarial, and adversarial pre-training\nfrom ImageNet, at 89.26%/73.79%, 89.26%/79.03%, and 91.41%/83.22% sparsity,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we observe the obtained double-win lottery tickets\ncan be more data-efficient to transfer, under practical data-limited (e.g., 1%\nand 10%) downstream schemes. Our results show that the benefits from robust\npre-training are amplified by the lottery ticket scheme, as well as the\ndata-limited transfer setting.

Non-parallel VC allows us to develop H2NH-VC,\nbecause we cannot collect a parallel dataset that non-human creatures speak\nhuman language. In this study, we propose to use dogs as an example of a\nnon-human creature target domain and define the \"speak like a dog\" task. To\nclarify the possibilities and characteristics of the \"speak like a dog\" task,\nwe conducted a comparative experiment using existing representative\nnon-parallel VC methods in acoustic features (Mel-cepstral coefficients and\nMel-spectrograms), network architectures (five different kernel-size settings),\nand training criteria (variational autoencoder (VAE)- based and generative\nadversarial network-based). Finally, the converted voices were evaluated using\nmean opinion scores: dog-likeness, sound quality and intelligibility, and\ncharacter error rate (CER). The experiment showed that the employment of the\nMel-spectrogram improved the dog-likeness of the converted speech, while it is\nchallenging to preserve linguistic information.

Traditionally,\nempirical studies of collective efficacy use large sample surveys to estimate\ncollective efficacy of different neighborhoods within an urban setting. Such\nstudies have demonstrated an association between collective efficacy and local\nvariation in community violence, educational achievement, and health. Unlike\ntraditional collective efficacy measurement strategies, the Adolescent Health\nand Development in Context (AHDC) Study implemented a new approach, obtaining\nspatially-referenced, place-based ratings of collective efficacy from a\nrepresentative sample of individuals residing in Columbus, OH. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel nonstationary spatial model for interpolation of the AHDC\ncollective efficacy ratings across the study area which leverages\nadministrative data on land use.

However, many of the past attacks require\nthe adversary to solve an input-dependent optimization problem using gradient\ndescent which makes the attack impractical in real-time. These adversarial\nexamples are also tightly coupled to the attacked model and are not as\nsuccessful in transferring to different models. In this work, we propose\nReFace, a real-time, highly-transferable attack on face recognition models\nbased on Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATNs). ATNs model adversarial\nexample generation as a feed-forward neural network. We find that the white-box\nattack success rate of a pure U-Net ATN falls substantially short of\ngradient-based attacks like PGD on large face recognition datasets. We\ntherefore propose a new architecture for ATNs that closes this gap while\nmaintaining a 10000x speedup over PGD. Furthermore, we find that at a given\nperturbation magnitude, our ATN adversarial perturbations are more effective in\ntransferring to new face recognition models than PGD.

We find that SHAP exhibits lower\nvariance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this\nlower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and\nmissing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases\nthe bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a\nfavorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings.\nWith this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a\nnovel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME\n(CLIMB) that is superior to LIME and much faster than SHAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 22:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

To address this\nchallenge, recently, many works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the\nrecommendation scenarios, i.e. learning to learn the user preference by only a\nfew past interaction items. The core idea is to learn global shared\nmeta-initialization parameters for all users and rapidly adapt them into local\nparameters for each user respectively. They aim at deriving general knowledge\nacross preference learning of various users, so as to rapidly adapt to the\nfuture new user with the learned prior and a small amount of training data.\nHowever, previous works have shown that recommender systems are generally\nvulnerable to bias and unfairness. Despite the success of meta-learning at\nimproving the recommendation performance with cold-start, the fairness issues\nare largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fair\nmeta-learning framework, named CLOVER, for ensuring the fairness of\nmeta-learned recommendation models. We systematically study three kinds of\nfairness - individual fairness, counterfactual fairness, and group fairness in\nthe recommender systems, and propose to satisfy all three kinds via a\nmulti-task adversarial learning scheme. Our framework offers a generic training\nparadigm that is applicable to different meta-learned recommender systems.

As an essential step\nprior to machine unlearning, it is still a challenge for a data owner to tell\nwhether or not her data have been used by an unauthorized party to train a\nmachine learning model. Membership inference is a recently emerging technique\nto identify whether a data sample was used to train a target model, and seems\nto be a promising solution to this challenge. However, straightforward adoption\nof existing membership inference approaches fails to address the challenge\neffectively due to being originally designed for attacking membership privacy\nand suffering from several severe limitations such as low inference accuracy on\nwell-generalized models.

Here we\nreport a type of UMR, termed as the anomalous UMR (AUMR), in a single CoFeB\nlayer without any adjacent SHE layers, where the UMR signal is about 10 times\nlarger than that in Ta/CoFeB structures and can be detected by using\nconventional dc multimeters in the absence of lock-in amplifiers. We further\ndemonstrate that the extracted AUMR by excluding thermal contributions shows\nreversal signs for the CoFeB and NiFe single layers with opposite SHAs,\nindicating that the AUMR may originate from the self-generated spin\naccumulation interacting with magnetization through the giant\nmagnetoresistance-like mechanism. These results suggest that the AUMR\ncontributes UMR signals larger than the interfacial spin Hall UMR in the\nCoFeB-involved systems, providing a convenient and reliable approach to detect\nin-plane magnetization for the two-terminal spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 02:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a new HFR method from the perspective of heterogeneous\ndata augmentation, named Face Synthesis with Identity-Attribute Disentanglement\n(FSIAD). Firstly, the identity-attribute disentanglement (IAD) decouples face\nimages into identity-related representations and identity-unrelated\nrepresentations (called attributes), and then decreases the correlation between\nidentities and attributes. Secondly, we devise a face synthesis module (FSM) to\ngenerate a large number of images with stochastic combinations of disentangled\nidentities and attributes for enriching the attribute diversity of synthetic\nimages. Both the original images and the synthetic ones are utilized to train\nthe HFR network for tackling the challenges and improving the performance of\nHFR. Extensive experiments on five HFR databases validate that FSIAD obtains\nsuperior performance than previous HFR approaches.

However, it ignores the data's structure and the\nassociation between consecutive time stamps. To address this constraint, we\noffer an approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structuring the\ninput representation and exploiting the relations among the samples. However,\neven when using a simple graph convolution network to eliminate this shortage,\nthere are still several limiting factors, such as inter-class activities\nissues, skewed class distribution, and a lack of consideration for sensor data\npriority, all of which harm the HAR model's performance. To improve the current\nHAR model's performance, we investigate novel possibilities within the\nframework of graph structure to achieve highly discriminated and rich activity\nfeatures.

In this paper, we propose elucidating fact\nchecking predictions using counterfactual explanations to help people\nunderstand why a specific piece of news was identified as fake. In this work,\ngenerating counterfactual explanations for fake news involves three steps:\nasking good questions, finding contradictions, and reasoning appropriately. We\nframe this research question as contradicted entailment reasoning through\nquestion answering (QA). We first ask questions towards the false claim and\nretrieve potential answers from the relevant evidence documents. Then, we\nidentify the most contradictory answer to the false claim by use of an\nentailment classifier. Finally, a counterfactual explanation is created using a\nmatched QA pair with three different counterfactual explanation forms.\nExperiments are conducted on the FEVER dataset for both system and human\nevaluations. Results suggest that the proposed approach generates the most\nhelpful explanations compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 04:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 05:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In order to\nachieve universal quantum computation (UQC) in the MPQC protocol based on\ntriply-even CSS QECCs, in addition to the set of trivially implemented\ntransversal quantum gates, one needs to implement a non-transversal $H$ gate,\nwhich can be accomplished by the gate teleportation technique with the logical\n``plus'' state as an ancillary quantum state. In comparison, to achieve UQC in\nthe previously suggested MPQC protocol based on another sub-class of CSS QECCs,\ni.e., self-dual CSS QECCs, instead of non-transversal $H$ gate one needs to\nimplement a non-transversal $T$ gate.

Recently, the\nself-training strategy has been considered a powerful solution for unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, which iteratively adapts the model from the source domain to\nthe target domain by generating target pseudo labels and re-training the model.\nHowever, the selection of confident pseudo labels inevitably suffers from the\nconflict between sparsity and accuracy, both of which will lead to suboptimal\nmodels. To tackle this problem, we exploit the characteristics of the foggy\nimage sequence of driving scenes to densify the confident pseudo labels.\nSpecifically, based on the two discoveries of local spatial similarity and\nadjacent temporal correspondence of the sequential image data, we propose a\nnovel Target-Domain driven pseudo label Diffusion (TDo-Dif) scheme. It employs\nsuperpixels and optical flows to identify the spatial similarity and temporal\ncorrespondence, respectively and then diffuses the confident but sparse pseudo\nlabels within a superpixel or a temporal corresponding pair linked by the flow.\nMoreover, to ensure the feature similarity of the diffused pixels, we introduce\nlocal spatial similarity loss and temporal contrastive loss in the model\nre-training stage.

Therewith, the security of distributed\nlearning has also drawn increasing attentions from both academia and industry.\nIn this context, federated learning (FL) was developed as a \"secure\"\ndistributed learning by maintaining private training data locally and only\npublic model gradients are communicated between. However, to date, a variety of\ngradient leakage attacks have been proposed for this procedure and prove that\nit is insecure. For instance, a common drawback of these attacks is shared:\nthey require too much auxiliary information such as model weights, optimizers,\nand some hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate), which are difficult to obtain\nin real situations. Moreover, many existing algorithms avoid transmitting model\ngradients in FL and turn to sending model weights, such as FedAvg, but few\npeople consider its security breach. In this paper, we present two novel\nframeworks to demonstrate that transmitting model weights is also likely to\nleak private local data of clients, i.e., (DLM and DLM+), under the FL\nscenario. In addition, a number of experiments are performed to illustrate the\neffect and generality of our attack frameworks. At the end of this paper, we\nalso introduce two defenses to the proposed attacks and evaluate their\nprotection effects. Comprehensively, the proposed attack and defense schemes\ncan be applied to the general distributed learning scenario as well, just with\nsome appropriate customization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 05:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Thus, the complexity of a system can be better\ncharacterized by a complexity profile (complexity as a function of scale) than\nby a single number. It would therefore be useful to have a multi-scale\ngeneralization of Ashby's law that requires that a system possess at least as\nmuch complexity as the relevant set of environmental behaviors *at each scale*.\nWe construct a formalism for a class of complexity profiles that is the first,\nto our knowledge, to exhibit this multi-scale law of requisite variety.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel source-view-wise feature aggregation method, which facilitates\nus to find out the consensus in a robust way by leveraging local structures in\nthe feature set. We first calculate the source-view-wise distance distribution\nfor each source feature for the proposed aggregation.

To deal with\nthe malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms,\nbut they sacrifice users' privacy. What's more, the digital identities (static\nstrings or updatable chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a\nthird-party executable program (mobile app, smart contract, etc.) to achieve\nidentity reading, storing and proving, users' self-sovereignty are weakened. To\nsolve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to\nstrike a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the\ndependence on the third-party program.

Our\napproach, dubbed Fisher SAM, defines more accurate neighborhood structures that\nconform to the intrinsic metric of the underlying statistical manifold. For\ninstance, SAM may probe the worst-case loss value at either a too nearby or\ninappropriately distant point due to the ignorance of the parameter space\ngeometry, which is avoided by our Fisher SAM.

Progressing towards this goal, a large-scale dataset Ego2Hands was\nrecently proposed to address the task of two-hand segmentation and detection in\nthe wild.

The\nthermal conductivity of WSe2 increases dramatically with size below a\ncharacteristic with of ~ 5 nm and levels off for broader samples and reaches a\nconstant value of ~2 W/mK. By introducing atomic vacancies, we discovered that\nthe thermal conductivity of WSe2 is significantly reduced. In particular, the W\nvacancy has a greater impact on thermal conductivity reduction than Se\nvacancies: the thermal conductivity of pristine WSe2 reduced by ~60% and ~70%\nwith the adding of ~1% of Se and W vacancies, respectively. The reduction of\nthermal conductivity is found to be related with the decrease of mean free path\n(MFP) of phonons in the defective WSe2. The MFP of WSe2 decreases from ~4.2 nm\nfor prefect WSe2 to ~2.2 nm with the adding of 0.9% Se vacancies. More\nsophisticated types of point defects, such as vacancy clusters and anti-site\ndefects, are explored in addition to single vacancies, and are found to\ndramatically renormalize the phonons. The reconstruction of the bonds leads to\nlocalized phonons in the forbidden gap in the phonon density of states which\nleads to the drop of thermal conduction. This work demonstrates the influence\nof different defects on thermal conductivity of single-layer WSe2, providing\ninsight into the process of defect-induced phonon transport as well as ways to\nimprove heat dissipation in WSe2-based electronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

One key insight is to decouple the complex mesh reconstruction into\ntwo sub-tasks: topology formulation and shape deformation. Thanks to the\ndecoupling, DT-Net implicitly learns a disentangled representation for the\ntopology and shape in the latent space. Hence, it can enable novel disentangled\ncontrols for supporting various shape generation applications, e.g., remix the\ntopologies of 3D objects, that are not achievable by previous reconstruction\nworks.

Researchers have speculated on several possible mechanisms.\nElectrokinetic energy conversion is the least hypothetical one. The basics of\npressure-driven electrokinetic phenomena of streaming current and streaming\npotential have long been established. The regularities of evaporation from\nporous media are also well known. However, coupling of these two classes of\nphenomena has not, yet, been seriously explored. In this critical review, we\nwill recapitalize and combine the available knowledge from these two fields to\nproduce a coherent picture of electrokinetic electricity generation during\nevaporation from (nano)porous materials. For illustration, we will consider\nseveral configurations, namely, single nanopores, arrays of nanopores, systems\nwith reduced area of electrokinetic-conversion elements and devices with side\nevaporation from thin nanoporous films. For the latter (practically the only\none studied experimentally), we will formulate a simple model describing\ncorrelations of system performance with such principal parameters as the\nnanoporous-layer length, width and thickness as well as the pore size,\npore-surface hydrophilicity, effective zeta-potential and electric conductivity\nin nanopores. These correlations will be qualitatively compared with\nexperimental data available in the literature. We will see that experimental\ndata not always are in agreement with the model predictions, which may be due\nto simplifying model assumptions but also because the mechanisms are different\nfrom the classical electrokinetic energy conversion. In particular, this\nconcerns the mechanisms of conversion of evaporation-driven ion streaming\ncurrents into electron currents in external circuits. We will also formulate\ndirections of future experimental and theoretical studies that could help\nclarify these issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 08:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

The MCF utilizes a hierarchical structure to resolve the longitudinal\nstring stability and the lateral control problem under the complex driving\nenvironment and time-varying communication delay. Firstly, the H-infinity\nfeedback controller is developed to ensure the robustness of the platoon under\ntime-varying communication delay in the upper-level coordination layer (UCL).\nThe output from UCL will be delivered to the lower-level motion-planning layer\n(LML) as reference signals.

Although numerous advanced methods have\nbeen proposed in past decades, most of them generally overlook the significance\nof weakly-supervised information and fail to preserve the feature properties of\nmultiple views, thus resulting in unsatisfactory clustering performance. To\naddress these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-view\nSemi-supervised Clustering (DMSC) method, which jointly optimizes three kinds\nof losses during networks finetuning, including multi-view clustering loss,\nsemi-supervised pairwise constraint loss and multiple autoencoders\nreconstruction loss. Specifically, a KL divergence based multi-view clustering\nloss is imposed on the common representation of multi-view data to perform\nheterogeneous feature optimization, multi-view weighting and clustering\nprediction simultaneously. Then, we innovatively propose to integrate pairwise\nconstraints into the process of multi-view clustering by enforcing the learned\nmulti-view representation of must-link samples (cannot-link samples) to be\nsimilar (dissimilar), such that the formed clustering architecture can be more\ncredible. Moreover, unlike existing rivals that only preserve the encoders for\neach heterogeneous branch during networks finetuning, we further propose to\ntune the intact autoencoders frame that contains both encoders and decoders. In\nthis way, the issue of serious corruption of view-specific and view-shared\nfeature space could be alleviated, making the whole training procedure more\nstable.

However, current 3D parallelism frameworks still meet\ntwo issues: i) they are not transparent to model developers, which need to\nmanually modify the model to parallelize training. ii) their utilization of\ncomputation, GPU memory and network bandwidth are not sufficient. We propose\nMerak, an automated 3D parallelism deep learning training framework with high\nresource utilization. Merak automatically deploys with an automatic model\npartitioner, which uses a graph sharding algorithm on a proxy representation of\nthe model. Merak also presents the non-intrusive API for scaling out foundation\nmodel training with minimal code modification. In addition, we design a\nhigh-performance 3D parallel runtime engine in Merak. It uses several\ntechniques to exploit available training resources, including shifted critical\npath pipeline schedule that brings a higher computation utilization,\nstage-aware recomputation that makes use of idle worker memory, and\nsub-pipelined tensor model parallelism that overlaps communication and\ncomputation. Experiments on 64 GPUs show Merak can speedup the training\nperformance over the state-of-the-art 3D parallelism frameworks of models with\n1.5, 2.5, 8.3, and 20 billion parameters by up to 1.42X, 1.39X, 1.43X, and\n1.61X, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 09:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 12:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 06:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Using a new algorithm called Iterative Local Refinement\n(ILR), we combine refinement functions to find refined predictions for logical\nformulas of any complexity. ILR finds refinements on complex SAT formulas in\nsignificantly fewer iterations and frequently finds solutions where gradient\ndescent can not.

The largest limitation is the extreme\nsensitivity of nullers to any residual optical path differences between the\nincoming telescope beams even after adaptive optics or fringe-tracker\ncorrection. The recently proposed kernel-nulling architecture attempts to\nalleviate this by producing the destructive interference required for nulling,\nin a scheme whereby self-calibrated observables can be created efficiently, in\neffect canceling out residual atmospheric piston terms. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate for the first time a successful creation of self-calibrated\nkernel-null observables for nulling interferometry in the laboratory. We\nachieved this through the use of a purpose-built photonic integrated device,\ncontaining a multimode interference coupler that creates one bright, and two\nnulled outputs when injected with three co-phased telescope beams. The device\nproduces the nulled outputs in a way that, by the subtraction of the measured\noutput flux, create a single self-calibrated kernel-null. We experimentally\ndemonstrate the extraction of kernel-nulls for up to 200 nm induced piston\nerror using a laboratory test-bench at a wavelength of 1.55 {\\mu}m. Further, we\nempirically demonstrate the kernel-null behaviour when injected with a binary\ncompanion analogue equivalent to a 2.32 mas separation at a contrast of\n10^{-2}, under 100 nm RMS upstream piston residuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 10:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

The TEM scheme may be implemented, as\nspatially or temporally periodic modulations, in optics or BEC, respectively.\nThe consideration is carried out by dint of numerical simulations and\nvariational approximation (VA).

However, applications running in clouds are much more flexible:\nmodern frameworks allow to (horizontally) scale a single application to dozens,\neven hundreds of instances; and then the load balancer can precisely divide the\nworkload between them.\n  We analyze a model that captures this (semi)-flexibility of cloud resource\nmanagement. Each cloud application is characterized by its memory footprint and\nits momentary CPU load. Combining the scheduler and the load balancer, the\nresource manager decides how many instances of each application will be created\nand how the CPU load will be balanced between them. In contrast to the\ndivisible load model, each instance of the application requires a certain\namount of memory, independent of the number of instances. Thus, the resource\nmanager effectively trades additional memory for more evenly balanced load.\n  We study two objectives: the bin-packing-like minimization of the number of\nmachines used; and the makespan-like minimization of the maximum load among all\nthe machines. We prove NP-hardness of the general problems, but also propose\npolynomial-time exact algorithms for boundary special cases. Notably, we show\nthat (semi)-flexibility may result in reducing the required number of machines\nby a tight factor of $2-\\varepsilon$.

Arable lands present hard challenges for Simultaneous Localization\nand Mapping (SLAM) systems, key for mobile robotics, given the visual\ndifficulty due to the highly repetitive scene and the crop leaves movement\ncaused by the wind.\n  In recent years, several Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and SLAM systems have\nbeen developed.

The joint probability distribution of the task parameters and\noptimization variables is approximated using the Tensor Train model which\nenables efficient conditioning and sampling. Unlike existing methods, we treat\nthe task parameters as random variables and for a given task we generate\nsamples for decision variables from the conditional distribution to initialize\nthe optimization solver. Our method can produce multiple solutions for a given\ntask from different modes when they exist. We first evaluate the approach on\nbenchmark functions for numerical optimization that are hard to solve using\ngradient-based optimization solvers with a naive initialization. The results\nshow that the proposed method can generate samples close to global optima and\nfrom multiple modes. We then demonstrate the generality and relevance of our\nframework to robotics by applying it to inverse kinematics with obstacles and\nmotion planning problems with a 7-DoF manipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 13:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 14:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 16:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

The components are\ngeneral enough to treat other classes of radial pulsation. The theoretical\nspectrum from a shocked pulsation model shows line doubling, with the blue\ncomponent emerging at standstill velocity and accelerating blueward. The\ndoubling phase depends on line depth and parent ion. The behaviour of line\ncores post-shock points to a drop in the ionization temperature, although the\ngas temperature in the model remains high.

This model leads\nto a non-smooth, non-convex optimization problem for which traditional\niteration schemes are inefficient or even divergent. By exploiting special\nstructures of the $\\ell_0$ norm, we identify a local minimizer of the proposed\nnon-convex optimization problem with a global minimizer of a convex\noptimization problem, which provides us insights for the development of\nefficient and convergence guaranteed algorithms to solve it. We characterize\nthe solution of the regularization model in terms of a fixed-point of a map\ndefined by the proximity operator of the $\\ell_0$ norm and develop a\nfixed-point iteration algorithm to solve it. By connecting the map with an\n$\\alpha$-averaged nonexpansive operator, we prove that the sequence generated\nby the proposed fixed-point proximity algorithm converges to a local minimizer\nof the proposed model.

Three asymptotic regimes\nare possible depending on how one lets the number of initial balls scale with\nthe number of draws of the urn. In each regime, we show a first order\ndeterministic limit and Gaussian second order fluctuations, where the behaviour\nof these limit processes depend on the regime, the initial composition of the\nurn, and the urns replacement rule.\n  To prove our main results, we embed the process in continuous-time and use\nmartingale theory. Although these methods are classical since the works of\nAthreya & Karlin [1] and Janson [11], our setting with initial growing\ncomposition necessitates many new ideas. The main difference in proving\nlimiting results for the continuous time embedding in our setting is that, when\nthe initial composition is large compared to the number of draws, the branching\nprocess does not have time to reach equilibrium. Because of this, translating\nthe results back to discrete-time is also much harder than in Janson [11].\nInterestingly, our continuous-time results hold under weaker assumptions on the\nreplacement structure than classical results for multi-type branching\nprocesses; in particular, we do not need any \"irreducibility\" assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 14:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Yet, by July 2018, the X-ray flux had dropped by over\ntwo orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic change to the inner accretion\nflow. With three years of observations with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, we\npresent the X-ray evolution of 1ES 1927+654, which can be broken into three\nphases-(1) an early super-Eddington phase with rapid variability in X-ray\nluminosity and spectral parameters, (2) a stable super-Eddington phase at the\npeak X-ray luminosity, and (3) a steady decline back to the pre-outburst\nluminosity and spectral parameters. For the first time, we witnessed the\nformation of the X-ray corona, as the X-ray spectrum transitioned from\nthermally-dominated to primarily Comptonized. We also track the evolution of\nthe prominent, broad 1 keV feature in the early X-ray spectra and show that\nthis feature can be modeled with blueshifted reflection (z = -0.33) from a\nsingle-temperature blackbody irradiating spectrum using xillverTDE, a new\nflavor of the xillver models.

Consequently, creating explainable/interpretable models or\napplying post-hoc methods on classifiers to build trust in deep learning models\nare required. Moreover, deep learning methods can be used for segmentation\ntasks, which typically require hard-to-obtain, time-consuming\nmanually-annotated segmentation labels for training.

In the last\ndecades, new instrumental facilities and large observational campaigns have\nbeen driven by the quest for habitable worlds. Climate models aimed at studying\nthe habitability of rocky planets are essential tools to pay off these\ntechnological and observational endeavours. In this context, we present\nEOS-ESTM, a fast and flexible model aimed at exploring the impact on\nhabitability of multiple climate factors, including those unconstrained by\nobservations. EOS-ESTM is built on ESTM, a seasonal-latitudinal energy balance\nmodel featuring an advanced treatment of the meridional and vertical transport.\nThe novel features of EOS-ESTM include: (1) parameterizations for simulating\nthe climate impact of oceans, land, ice, and clouds as a function of\ntemperature and stellar zenith distance; (2) a procedure (EOS) for calculating\nthe radiative transfer in atmospheres with terrestrial and non-terrestrial\ncompositions illuminated by solar- and non-solar-type stars.

The main idea is not to\nattempt to learn a single classifier that would have to work well across all\noccurring data distributions, nor many separate classifiers, but to exploit a\nhybrid strategy: we learn a single set of model parameters from which a\nspecific classifier for any specific data distribution is derived via\nclassifier adaptation. Assuming a multi-class classification setting with\nclass-prior shift, the adaptation step can be performed analytically with only\nthe classifier's bias terms being affected. Another contribution of our work is\nan extrapolation step that predicts suitable adaptation parameters for future\ntime steps based on the previous data. In combination, we obtain a lightweight\nprocedure for learning from streaming data with varying class distribution that\nadds no trainable parameters and almost no memory or computational overhead\ncompared to training a single model.

An emerging strand of work empirically\nestimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a\nconfidence interval for the privacy budget $\\varepsilon$ spent on training a\nmodel. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for $\\varepsilon$ from\nconfidence intervals for the false positive and false negative rates of\nmembership inference attacks.

Under localizing conditions,\ntransport is arrested because the wave is trapped in the bulk of the sample\nwith decaying-exponential coupling to the boundaries. Any further increase in\ndisorder does not modify the overall transport properties. Here, we report the\nexperimental demonstration of a hitherto-unrealized anomalous transport of\nhybrid particles under localizing disorder in a non-Hermitian setting. We\ncreate hybrid polariton-photon states in a one-dimensional copper sample with a\ncomb-shaped periodic microstructure designed for microwave frequencies.\nMetallic dissipation realizes the necessary non-Hermiticity. Disorder is\nintroduced by deliberate alterations of the periodic microstructure. Direct\nmeasurement of wave-functions and phases was achieved by a near-field probe. At\na particular disorder, We observe the onset of Anderson localization of the\nhybrid states endorsed by exponential tails of the wavefunction. However, at\nstronger disorder and under conditions that support localization, an unexpected\nenhancement in the transmission was facilitated by an emergent mini-band. The\ntransmission was traced to the hopping of the hybrid particle over multiple\nco-existing localized resonances that exchange energy due to the\nnon-orthogonality. These emergent states are manifested in all configurations\nunder strong disorder, suggesting the formation of a novel transport regime.\nThis is verified by measuring the averaged conductance which endorses an\nanomalous transport regime in the hybrid, non-Hermitian environment under\nstrong disorder. These experimental observations open up new unexplored avenues\nin the ambit of disorder under non-Hermitian conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In practice, however, the similarity condition\nis difficult to meet or is even violated. Instead of the similarity condition,\na brand-new strategy, linear correlation-ratio, is introduced in this paper to\nbuild an accurate relationship between the models. Such a correlation-ratio can\nbe easily estimated by historical data or a part of sample. Then, a\ncorrelation-ratio transfer learning likelihood is established based on the\ncorrelation-ratio combination. On the practical side, the new framework is\napplied to some application scenarios, especially the areas of data streams and\nmedical studies. Methodologically, some techniques are suggested for\ntransferring the information from simple source models to a relatively complex\ntarget model. Theoretically, some favorable properties, including the global\nconvergence rate, are achieved, even for the case where the source models are\nnot similar to the target model. All in all, it can be seen from the theories\nand experimental results that the inference on the target model is\nsignificantly improved by the information from similar or dissimilar source\nmodels. In other words, a variational Stein's paradox is illustrated in the\ncontext of transfer learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 01:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The purpose is to create\na mathematical foundation for cognition which is in line with enactivism. We\nsee two main benefits of doing so: (1) It enables enactivist ideas to be more\naccessible for computer scientists, AI researchers, roboticists, cognitive\nscientists, and psychologists, and (2) it gives the philosophers a mathematical\ntool which can be used to clarify their notions and help with their debates.\nOur main notion is that of a sensorimotor system which is a special case of a\nwell studied notion of a transition system. We also consider related notions\nsuch as labeled transition systems and deterministic automata. We analyze a\nnotion called sufficiency and show that it is a very good candidate for a\nfoundational notion in the \"mathematics of cognition from an enactivist\nperspective\". We demonstrate its importance by proving a uniqueness theorem\nabout the minimal sufficient refinements (which correspond in some sense to an\noptimal attunement of an organism to its environment) and by showing that\nsufficiency corresponds to known notions such as sufficient history information\nspaces.

The\nstatistical analysis of recurrence plots (RPs) is a powerful framework in\nnonlinear time series analysis that has proven to be effective in addressing\nmany fundamental problems, e.g., regime shift detection and identification of\ncouplings. The recurrence flow through an RP exploits artifacts in the\nformation of diagonal lines, a structure in RPs that reflects periods of\npredictable dynamics.

Given an RP, no parameters are\nrequired for its computation. We showcase the scope of the method for\nquantifying lagged nonlinear correlations and put a focus on the delay\nselection problem in time-delay embedding which is often used for attractor\nreconstruction.
