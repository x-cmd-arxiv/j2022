We are increasingly seeing a delay and disconnect of the\ntransmission of locally situated information to the hierarchical system for\nmaking the overall preparedness and response more proactive than reactive for\ndealing with emergencies such as 2014 Ebola. For our COVID-19, it is timely to\nconsider whether digital surveillance networks and support systems can be used\nto bring the formal and community based ad hoc networks required for\nfacilitating the transmission of both strong (i.e., infections, confirmed\ncases, deaths in hospital or clinic settings) and weak alters from the\ncommunity. This will allow timely detection of symptoms of isolated suspected\ncases for making the overall surveillance and intervention strategy far more\neffective. The use of digital surveillance networks can further contribute to\nthe development of global awareness of complex emergencies such as Ebola for\nconstructing information infrastructure required to develop, monitor and\nanalysis of community based global emergency surveillance in developed and\ndeveloping countries. In this study, a systematic analysis of the spread during\nthe months of March to October 2014 was performed using data from the Program\nfor Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and the Factiva database. Using\ndigital surveillance networks, we aim to draw network connections of\nindividuals/groups from a localized to a globalized transmission of Ebola using\nreported suspected/probable/confirmed cases at different locations around the\nworld. We argue that public health preparedness and response can be\nstrengthened by understanding the social network connections between responders\n(such as local health authorities) and spreaders (infected individuals and\ngroups).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 16:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this paper, we aim\nto demonstrate the role of the generalization properties of the substitute\nclassifier used for generating adversarial examples in the transferability of\nthe attack scheme to unobserved NN classifiers. To do this, we apply the\nmax-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the\ngeneralization properties of the substitute NN in the success of the black-box\nattack scheme in application to different NN classifiers. We prove theoretical\ngeneralization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability\nrates on training and test samples.

This naturally explains why all\nabundance patterns attributed so far to Kraken are in fact fully consistent\nwith the metal-poor in-situ so-called Aurora population and thick disc.\nHowever, our model makes a falsifiable prediction: if the Milky Way underwent a\ngas-rich double merger at high redshift, then this should be imprinted on its\nstar formation history with bursts about $\\sim2\\,$Gyrs apart. This may offer\nconstraining power on the highest-redshift major mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 17:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 10:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Consequently, when input to these trained models is data with\nsignificantly different statistical properties from data used for training,\nthere is no guarantee of accurate prediction. Consequently, using these models\non out-of-distribution input data may result in a completely different\npredicted outcome from the desired one, which is not only erroneous but can\nalso be hazardous in some cases. Successful deployment of these machine\nlearning models in any system requires a detection system, which should be able\nto distinguish between out-of-distribution and in-distribution data (i.e.\nsimilar to training data). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for\nthis detection process using a Reduced Robust Random Cut Forest (RRRCF) data\nstructure, which can be used on both small and large data sets. Similar to the\nRobust Random Cut Forest (RRCF), RRRCF is a structured, but a reduced\nrepresentation of the training data sub-space in form of cut trees. Empirical\nresults of this method on both low and high-dimensional data showed that\ninference about data being in/out of training distribution can be made\nefficiently and the model is easy to train with no difficult hyper-parameter\ntuning.

The eye region isolation is performed with a U-Net\nstyle network which we train using a synthetic dataset that contains eye region\nmasks for the visible eyeball and the iris region. The synthetic dataset used\nin this stage is a new dataset consisting of 60,000 eye images, which we create\nusing an eye-gaze simulator, UnityEyes. Successive to training, the eye region\nisolation network is then transferred to the real domain for generating masks\nfor the real-world eye images. In order to successfully make the transfer, we\nexploit domain randomization in the training process, which allows for the\nsynthetic images to benefit from a larger variance with the help of\naugmentations that resemble artifacts. The generated eye region masks along\nwith the raw eye images are then used together as a multistream input to our\ngaze estimation network.

To avoid\nincurring excessive resource cost and stale training computation, Pisces uses a\nnovel scoring mechanism to identify suitable clients to participate in a\ntraining iteration. It also adapts the pace of model aggregation to dynamically\nbound the progress gap between the selected clients and the server, with a\nprovable convergence guarantee in a smooth non-convex setting. We have\nimplemented Pisces in an open-source FL platform called Plato, and evaluated\nits performance in large-scale experiments with popular vision and language\nmodels. Pisces outperforms the state-of-the-art synchronous and asynchronous\nschemes, accelerating the time-to-accuracy by up to 2.0x and 1.9x,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 18:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

They have a different nature from the\ntraditional static and localized backdoors that can be triggered by perturbing\na small input area with some fixed pattern, e.g., a patch with solid color.\nExisting defense techniques are highly effective for traditional backdoors.\nHowever, they may not work well for pervasive backdoors, especially regarding\nbackdoor removal and model hardening. In this paper, we propose a novel model\nhardening technique against pervasive backdoors, including both natural and\ninjected backdoors. We develop a general pervasive attack based on an\nencoder-decoder architecture enhanced with a special transformation layer. The\nattack can model a wide range of existing pervasive backdoor attacks and\nquantify them by class distances. As such, using the samples derived from our\nattack in adversarial training can harden a model against these backdoor\nvulnerabilities. Our evaluation on 9 datasets with 15 model structures shows\nthat our technique can enlarge class distances by 59.65% on average with less\nthan 1% accuracy degradation and no robustness loss, outperforming five\nhardening techniques such as adversarial training, universal adversarial\ntraining, MOTH, etc. It can reduce the attack success rate of six pervasive\nbackdoor attacks from 99.06% to 1.94%, surpassing seven state-of-the-art\nbackdoor removal techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 19:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data, which\ngrows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels.\nIn many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification\ntask; hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and\nthus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for\nchannel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a\nprototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype\ndistance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable\nbetter separation between classes; hence, channels with the higher distance\nbetween class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA Multivariate Time Series\nClassification (MTSC) benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve\nsignificant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of\nclassification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step\nbefore training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70\\% of\ncomputation time and data storage, with preserved accuracy.

Secondly, in fact, they are\nonly partially based on Bayesian deep learning, as their overall architectures\nare not designed under the Bayesian framework. However, unifying the overall\narchitecture under the Bayesian perspective can make the architecture have a\nrigorous theoretical basis, so that each part of the architecture can have a\nclear probabilistic interpretation. Therefore, to solve the problems, we\npropose a new generative Bayesian deep learning (GBDL) architecture. GBDL\nbelongs to the generative models, whose target is to estimate the joint\ndistribution of input medical volumes and their corresponding labels.\nEstimating the joint distribution implicitly involves the distribution of data,\nso both labeled and unlabeled data can be utilized in the early stage of\ntraining, which alleviates the potential overfitting problem. Besides, GBDL is\ncompletely designed under the Bayesian framework, and thus we give its full\nBayesian formulation, which lays a theoretical probabilistic foundation for our\narchitecture.

In order to robustly imitate the multiple\nsample experts, we minimize the risk with respect to the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence between the agent's policy and each of the sample experts.

Over the years, the problem has\nbeen addressed for different types of process data, i.e., process models,\nprocess event data at runtime, and event logs representing historical\nexecution. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle compliance checking\nover process logs. These approaches have been based on different data models\nand storage technologies including relational databases, graph databases, and\nproprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising\ndirection that turns several process analytics tasks into queries on the\nunderlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In\nthis paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to\nguarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important\ndue to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, compliance checking\nwould benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are\nadded, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly\nto optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two\nencoding methods using graph representation, realized in Neo4J, and show the\nbenefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed order\ncompliance rules. Compared to a baseline encoding, our experiments show up to\n5x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3x reduction in the graph size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 07:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

To address\nthese issues, we propose Scalable Neural Data Server (SNDS), a large-scale\nsearch engine that can theoretically index thousands of datasets to serve\nrelevant ML data to end users. SNDS trains the mixture of experts on\nintermediary datasets during initialization, and represents both data sources\nand downstream tasks by their proximity to the intermediary datasets. As such,\ncomputational cost incurred by SNDS users remains fixed as new datasets are\nadded to the server.

Therefore,\ntrained networks could assign unexpected high-confidence predictions to\nout-of-distribution samples drawn from distributions differing from that of\nin-distribution samples. Specifically, networks extract the strongly\nlabel-related information from in-distribution samples to learn the\nlabel-discriminative representations but discard the weakly label-related\ninformation. Accordingly, networks treat out-of-distribution samples with\nminimum label-sensitive information as in-distribution samples. According to\nthe different informativeness properties of in- and out-of-distribution\nsamples, a Dual Representation Learning (DRL) method learns\ndistribution-discriminative representations that are weakly related to the\nlabeling of in-distribution samples and combines label- and\ndistribution-discriminative representations to detect out-of-distribution\nsamples. For a label-discriminative representation, DRL constructs the\ncomplementary distribution-discriminative representation by an implicit\nconstraint, i.e., integrating diverse intermediate representations where an\nintermediate representation less similar to the label-discriminative\nrepresentation owns a higher weight.

To address the above problems, we\npropose a Multi-Metric Evaluation based on Correlation Re-Scaling (MME-CRS) for\nevaluating open-domain dialogue. Firstly, we build an evaluation metric\ncomposed of 5 groups of parallel sub-metrics called Multi-Metric Evaluation\n(MME) to evaluate the quality of dialogue comprehensively. Furthermore, we\npropose a novel score composition method called Correlation Re-Scaling (CRS) to\nmodel the relationship between sub-metrics and diverse qualities. Our approach\nMME-CRS ranks first on the final test data of DSTC10 track5 subtask1 Automatic\nOpen-domain Dialogue Evaluation Challenge with a large margin, which proved the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 13:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Therefore, we propose\nthe low-rank decomposition network (LordNet) which is tunable and also\nefficient to model various entanglements. Specifically, LordNet learns a\nlow-rank approximation to the global entanglements with simple fully connected\nlayers, which extracts the dominant pattern with reduced computational cost.\nThe experiments on solving Poisson's equation and Navier-Stokes equation\ndemonstrate that the physical constraints by the MSR loss can lead to better\naccuracy and generalization ability of the neural network. In addition, LordNet\noutperforms other modern neural network architectures in both PDEs with the\nfewest parameters and the fastest inference speed. For Navier-Stokes equation,\nthe learned operator is over 50 times faster than the finite difference\nsolution with the same computational resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 14:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this paper, a novel framework,\nnamely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can\nefficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic\ncontrol. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with\ntwisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can\nquantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control.

The proposed method provides an efficient tool and\nin-depth insight into the failure mechanism of structure components and solid\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 20:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 06:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

J. C. Maxwell was the first to adopt the algebra\nof quaternions to describe the physical quantities of electromagnetic fields.\nThe contemporary scholars utilize the quaternions and octonions to research the\nphysical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The\napplication of octonions is able to study the physical quantities of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the octonion field\nstrength, field source, linear moment, angular moment, torque and force. When\nthe octonion force is equal to zero, it is capable of achieving eight\nindependent equations, including the force equilibrium equation, fluid\ncontinuity equation, current continuity equation, and second-precession\nequilibrium equation and others. One of inferences derived from the\nsecond-precession equilibrium equation is that the electric current and\nderivative of electric moments are able to excite each other. The external\nderivative of electric moments can induce the electric currents. Meanwhile the\nexternal electric currents are capable of inducing the derivative of electric\nmoments. The research states that this inference can be considered as the\nunderlying mechanism for the direct and inverse piezoelectric effects. Further\nthe second-precession equilibrium equation is able to predict several new\ninfluencing factors of direct and inverse piezoelectric effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 11:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
