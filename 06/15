While the [OIII] line and UV continuum are compact, the\n[CII] line is extended up to a radius of $r \\sim 12$ kpc. Using multi-band\nrest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum data ranging from 52-400 $\\mu$m, we\nfind an average dust temperature and emissivity index of $T_{\\rm dust} =\n41^{+17}_{-14}$ K and $\\beta = 1.7^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$, respectively, across the\ngalaxy. We find slight differences in the dust continuum profiles at different\nwavelengths, which may indicate that the dust temperature decreases with\ndistance. We map the star-formation rate (SFR) via IR and UV luminosities and\ndetermine a total SFR of $37\\pm 1~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ with an obscured\nfraction of $87\\%$. While the [OIII] line is a good tracer of the SFR, the\n[CII] line shows deviation from the local $L_{\\rm [CII]}$-SFR relations in the\noutskirts of the galaxy. Finally, we observe a clear difference in the line\nprofile between [CII] and [OIII], with significant residuals ($\\sim 5\\sigma$)\nin the [OIII] line spectrum after subtracting a single Gaussian model. This\nsuggests a possible origin of the extended [CII] structure from the cooling of\nhot ionized outflows. The extended [CII] and high-velocity [OIII] emission may\nboth contribute in part to the high $L_{\\rm [OIII]}$/$L_{\\rm [CII]}$ ratios\nrecently reported in $z>6$ galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The two main future trends for companies that want to build\nmachine learning-based applications and systems are real-time inference and\ncontinual updating. Unfortunately, both trends require a mature infrastructure\nthat is hard and costly to realize on-premise. This paper defines a novel\nsoftware service and model delivery infrastructure termed Continual\nLearning-as-a-Service (CLaaS) to address these issues. Specifically, it\nembraces continual machine learning and continuous integration techniques. It\nprovides support for model updating and validation tools for data scientists\nwithout an on-premise solution and in an efficient, stateful and easy-to-use\nmanner. Finally, this CL model service is easy to encapsulate in any machine\nlearning infrastructure or cloud system. This paper presents the design and\nimplementation of a CLaaS instantiation, called LiquidBrain, evaluated in two\nreal-world scenarios. The former is a robotic object recognition setting using\nthe CORe50 dataset while the latter is a named category and attribute\nprediction using the DeepFashion-C dataset in the fashion domain. Our\npreliminary results suggest the usability and efficiency of the Continual\nLearning model services and the effectiveness of the solution in addressing\nreal-world use-cases regardless of where the computation happens in the\ncontinuum Edge-Cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 16:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 09:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Thus, researchers have begun to explore\nways to maintain algorithmic fairness over time. One line of work focuses on\ndynamic learning: retraining after each batch, and the other on robust learning\nwhich tries to make algorithms robust against all possible future changes.\nDynamic learning seeks to reduce biases soon after they have occurred and\nrobust learning often yields (overly) conservative models.

Addressing the first point, we consider\nConstrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) as a standard representation of program\nverification problems, providing a simple and programming language-independent\nsyntax. For the second challenge, we explore graph representations of CHCs, and\npropose a new Relational Hypergraph Neural Network (R-HyGNN) architecture to\nlearn program features. We introduce two different graph representations of\nCHCs. One is called constraint graph (CG), and emphasizes syntactic information\nof CHCs by translating the symbols and their relations in CHCs as typed nodes\nand binary edges, respectively, and constructing the constraints as abstract\nsyntax trees. The second one is called control- and data-flow hypergraph\n(CDHG), and emphasizes semantic information of CHCs by representing the control\nand data flow through ternary hyperedges. We then propose a new GNN\narchitecture, R-HyGNN, extending Relational Graph Convolutional Networks, to\nhandle hypergraphs. To evaluate the ability of R-HyGNN to extract semantic\ninformation from programs, we use R-HyGNNs to train models on the two graph\nrepresentations, and on five proxy tasks with increasing difficulty, using\nbenchmarks from CHC-COMP 2021 as training data. The most difficult proxy task\nrequires the model to predict the occurrence of clauses in counter-examples,\nwhich subsumes satisfiability of CHCs. CDHG achieves 90.59% accuracy in this\ntask. Furthermore, R-HyGNN has perfect predictions on one of the graphs\nconsisting of more than 290 clauses. Overall, our experiments indicate that\nR-HyGNN can capture intricate program features for guiding verification\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 17:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 14:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 15:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 22:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

Given the importance of CO$_2$ confinement in Mg-MOF-74\nfor capture and storage applications, it is important to understand the\nstructural and dynamical behavior of CO$_2$ in Mg-MOF-74 pores. While most\nmolecular simulation studies use ideal single crystal models of nano-porous\nsubstrates, the existence of inter-crystalline space has been shown to have\nprofound effects on the sorption, structure and dynamics of the adsorbed fluid.\nTo address these issues, we report a molecular dynamics simulation study at 300\nK, of CO$_2$ confined in several models of Mg-MOF-74 with systematically\ninserted inter-crystalline spacing of different widths. Both structural and\ndynamical behavior of CO$_2$ is studied in 5 models of Mg-MOF-74, each at 4\ndifferent loadings. Six strong sites of CO$_2$ adsorption are found at the\nperiphery of the pores of Mg-MOF-74 in addition to a relatively weak adsorption\nat the center of the pore. On insertion of inter-crystalline spacing,\nadditional six sites of strong adsorption are seen in the inter-crystalline\nspace close to the pore opening. These additional sites delocalize as the\ninter-crystalline space is widened and the population of guest molecules\nadsorbed at the pore center grows at the expense of peripheral population. This\nredistribution of guest molecules has important implications for their\ndynamics. While in the model without inter-crystalline space, translation\nmotion is found to be slower at higher loadings, as wider inter-crystalline\nspace is introduced, anomalous loading dependence of translational diffusivity\nis observed. In general, inserting inter-crystalline spacing is found to\nenhance both translational as well as rotational motion of the guest molecules.\nThe results reported here provide valuable insight to carbon capture and\nstorage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 17:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

In this paper, we propose a method that can identify potential\nmicroservices from a given monolithic application. Our method takes as input\nthe source code of the source application in order to measure the similarities\nand dependencies between all of the classes in the system using their\ninteractions and the domain terminology employed within the code. These\nsimilarity values are then used with a variant of a density-based clustering\nalgorithm to generate a hierarchical structure of the recommended microservices\nwhile identifying potential outlier classes. We provide an empirical evaluation\nof our approach through different experimental settings including a comparison\nwith existing human-designed microservices and a comparison with 5 baselines.\nThe results show that our method succeeds in generating microservices that are\noverall more cohesive and that have fewer interactions in-between them with up\nto 0.9 of precision score when compared to human-designed microservices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 17:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

To tackle such an\nissue, this paper proposes a new protocol for supporting distributed\nauthentication while avoiding vulnerability to information leakage where CRPs\ncould be retrieved from hacked devices and collectively used to model the PUF.\nThe main idea is to provision for scrambling the challenge bit-stream in a way\nthat is dependent on the verifier.

Next, to have a better fit\nto Federated Learning applications, we incorporate local computation, i.e., we\npropose and analyze the variants of Q-RR and DIANA-RR -- Q-NASTYA and\nDIANA-NASTYA that use local gradient steps and different local and global\nstepsizes.

The key reason that body shape accuracy lags pose accuracy\nis the lack of data. While humans can label 2D joints, and these constrain 3D\npose, it is not so easy to \"label\" 3D body shape. Since paired data with images\nand 3D body shape are rare, we exploit two sources of information: (1) we\ncollect internet images of diverse \"fashion\" models together with a small set\nof anthropometric measurements; (2) we collect linguistic shape attributes for\na wide range of 3D body meshes and the model images. Taken together, these\ndatasets provide sufficient constraints to infer dense 3D shape. We exploit the\nanthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes in several novel\nways to train a neural network, called SHAPY, that regresses 3D human pose and\nshape from an RGB image. We evaluate SHAPY on public benchmarks, but note that\nthey either lack significant body shape variation, ground-truth shape, or\nclothing variation.

However, current machine learning approaches still\nextrapolate poorly for activity coefficients of unknown molecules. In this\nwork, we introduce the SMILES-to-Properties-Transformer (SPT), a natural\nlanguage processing network to predict binary limiting activity coefficients\nfrom SMILES codes. To overcome the limitations of available experimental data,\nwe initially train our network on a large dataset of synthetic data sampled\nfrom COSMO-RS (10 Million data points) and then fine-tune the model on\nexperimental data (20 870 data points). This training strategy enables SPT to\naccurately predict limiting activity coefficients even for unknown molecules,\ncutting the mean prediction error in half compared to state-of-the-art models\nfor activity coefficient predictions such as COSMO-RS, UNIFAC, and improving on\nrecent machine learning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Galaxy shear measures\nthe shape distortions of galaxies, probing both their local environment and the\nintervening matter distribution. Both observables give interesting constraints\non the cosmological model; here we ask: what can be learnt from their\ncombination? The pSZ-shear cross-spectrum measures the\nshear-galaxy-polarization bispectrum and contains contributions from (1) the\nSachs-Wolfe (SW) effect, (2) the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and (3)\ninflationary gravitational waves. Since the modes contributing to the pSZ\nsignal are not restricted to the Earth's past lightcone, the low-redshift\ncross-spectra could provide a novel constraint on dark energy via the ISW\neffect, whilst the SW signal couples scalar modes at very different times but\nat similar positions; this provides a unique probe of the Universe's\nhomogeneous time evolution. We give expressions for all major contributions to\nthe shear, galaxy, and pSZ auto- and cross-spectra, and evaluate their\ndetectability via Fisher forecasts. Despite significant theoretical utility,\nthe cross-spectra will be challenging to detect: combining CMB-S4 with Rubin\nyields a $1.6\\sigma$ detection of the ISW contribution, which increases to\n$5.2\\sigma$ for a futuristic experiment involving CMB-HD and a higher galaxy\nsample density.

Whilst this is significantly better than the\nconstraints from galaxy shear alone (and less sensitive to systematics), it is\nunlikely to be competitive, but may serve as a useful cross-check.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 08:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Thankfully the same particles are experiencing forces that are\nsize dependent (e.g., radiation pressure), and with high angular resolution\nobservations we can take advantage of this natural spatial segregation.\nObservations at different wavelengths probe different ranges of sizes, and\nthere is therefore a great synergy in multi-wavelength observations to better\nconstrain the optical properties of the particles.

The formation of the CE is likely to occur during unstable\nmass transfer, initiated by a primary star which is evolving off the main\nsequence (a Hertzsprung gap star) and a lower mass companion. In agreement with\nobservations, theoretical studies have shown that outflows from the pre-CE\nphase produce a detectable brightening of the progenitor system a few years\nbefore the ejection event. Based on these assumptions, we present a method to\nidentify Galactic LRNe precursors, the resulting precursor candidates, and our\nfollow-up analysis to uncover their nature.

Most of existing studies focus on the\nconvergence of optimization errors, while the generalization analysis of\nstochastic optimization is much lagging behind. This is especially the case for\nnonconvex and nonsmooth problems often encountered in practice. In this paper,\nwe initialize a systematic stability and generalization analysis of stochastic\noptimization on nonconvex and nonsmooth problems. We introduce novel\nalgorithmic stability measures and establish their quantitative connection on\nthe gap between population gradients and empirical gradients, which is then\nfurther extended to study the gap between the Moreau envelope of the empirical\nrisk and that of the population risk. To our knowledge, these quantitative\nconnection between stability and generalization in terms of either gradients or\nMoreau envelopes have not been studied in the literature. We introduce a class\nof sampling-determined algorithms, for which we develop bounds for three\nstability measures. Finally, we apply these discussions to derive error bounds\nfor stochastic gradient descent and its adaptive variant, where we show how to\nachieve an implicit regularization by tuning the step sizes and the number of\niterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 18:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Examples of\nthis phenomenon include the Kirchoff laws in electric networks and opinion\nconsensus in social networks. Conservation laws in networked systems may be\nmodeled as balance equations of the form $X = B^{*} Y$, where the sparsity\npattern of $B^{*}$ captures the connectivity of the network, and $Y, X \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^p$ are vectors of \"potentials\" and \"injected flows\" at the nodes\nrespectively. The node potentials $Y$ cause flows across edges and the flows\n$X$ injected at the nodes are extraneous to the network dynamics. In several\npractical systems, the network structure is often unknown and needs to be\nestimated from data. Towards this, one has access to samples of the node\npotentials $Y$, but only the statistics of the node injections $X$. Motivated\nby this important problem, we study the estimation of the sparsity structure of\nthe matrix $B^{*}$ from $n$ samples of $Y$ under the assumption that the node\ninjections $X$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance\n$\\Sigma_X$. We propose a new $\\ell_{1}$-regularized maximum likelihood\nestimator for this problem in the high-dimensional regime where the size of the\nnetwork $p$ is larger than sample size $n$. We show that this optimization\nproblem is convex in the objective and admits a unique solution. Under a new\nmutual incoherence condition, we establish sufficient conditions on the triple\n$(n,p,d)$ for which exact sparsity recovery of $B^{*}$ is possible with high\nprobability; $d$ is the degree of the graph. We also establish guarantees for\nthe recovery of $B^{*}$ in the element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator\nnorms. Finally, we complement these theoretical results with experimental\nvalidation of the performance of the proposed estimator on synthetic and\nreal-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 18:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

A voting rule's purpose is to pick a candidate with\nminimum total distance to the voters, given only the rankings, but not the\nactual distances. As a result, in the worst case, each deterministic rule picks\na candidate whose total distance is at least three times larger than that of an\noptimal one, i.e., has distortion at least 3. A recent breakthrough result\nshowed that achieving this bound of 3 is possible; however, the proof is\nnon-constructive, and the voting rule itself is a complicated exhaustive\nsearch.\n  Our main result is an extremely simple voting rule, called Plurality Veto,\nwhich achieves the same optimal distortion of 3. Each candidate starts with a\nscore equal to his number of first-place votes. These scores are then gradually\ndecreased via an n-round veto process in which a candidate drops out when his\nscore reaches zero. One after the other, voters decrement the score of their\nbottom choice among the standing candidates, and the last standing candidate\nwins. We give a one-paragraph proof that this voting rule achieves distortion\n3. This rule is also immensely practical, and it only makes two queries to each\nvoter, so it has low communication overhead.\n  We also generalize Plurality Veto into a class of randomized voting rules in\nthe following way: Plurality veto is run only for k < n rounds; then, a\ncandidate is chosen with probability proportional to his residual score. This\ngeneral rule interpolates between Random Dictatorship (for k=0) and Plurality\nVeto (for k=n-1), and k controls the variance of the output. We show that for\nall k, this rule has distortion at most 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 18:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Various methods have been proposed for generating singlet order,\nstarting from nuclear magnetization.

To understand\nthe structure of the model, we first derive several well-known LQBH solutions\nby taking proper limits. These include the B\\\"ohmer-Vandersloot and\nAshtekar-Olmedo-Singh models, which were all obtained by the so-called\nbottom-up polymerizations within the framework of the minisuperspace\nquantizations. Then, we study the ABP model, and find that the inverse volume\ncorrections become important only when the radius of the two-sphere is of the\nPlanck size. For macroscopic black holes, the minimal radius obtained at the\ntransition surface is always much larger than the Planck scale, and hence these\ncorrections are always sub-leading. The transition surface divides the whole\nspacetime into two regions, and in one of them the spacetime is asymptotically\nSchwarzschild-like, while in the other region, the asymptotical behavior\nsensitively depends on the ratio of two spin numbers involved in the model, and\ncan be divided into three different classes. In one class, the spacetime in the\n2-planes orthogonal to the two spheres is asymptotically flat, and in the\nsecond one it is not even conformally flat, while in the third one it can be\nasymptotically conformally flat by properly choosing the free parameters of the\nmodel.

Though there have been several studies looking into\natomic data uncertainties using theoretical calculations, in general, there is\nno commonly accepted solution for this task. We present a new approach for\nestimating uncertainties in the line emissivities for the current models of\ncollisional plasma, mainly based upon dedicated analysis of observed high\nresolution spectra of stellar coronae and galaxy clusters. We find that the\nsystematic uncertainties of the observed lines consistently show\nanti-correlation with the model line fluxes, after properly accounting for the\nadditional uncertainties from the ion concentration calculation. The strong\nlines in the spectra are in general better reproduced, indicating that the\natomic data and modeling of the main transitions are more accurate than those\nfor the minor ones. This underlying anti-correlation is found to be roughly\nindependent on source properties, line positions, ion species, and the line\nformation processes. We further apply our method to the simulated XRISM and\nAthena observations of collisional plasma sources and discuss the impact of\nuncertainties on the interpretation of these spectra. The typical uncertainties\nare 1-2% on temperature and 3-20% on abundances of O, Ne, Fe, Mg, and Ni.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 19:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

However, existing methods to solve these issues, such as\nadversarial training, are expensive and often sacrifice predictive accuracy.\n  In this work, we consider curvature, which is a mathematical quantity which\nencodes the degree of non-linearity. Using this, we demonstrate low-curvature\nneural networks (LCNNs) that obtain drastically lower curvature than standard\nmodels while exhibiting similar predictive performance, which leads to improved\nrobustness and stable gradients, with only a marginally increased training\ntime. To achieve this, we minimize a data-independent upper bound on the\ncurvature of a neural network, which decomposes overall curvature in terms of\ncurvatures and slopes of its constituent layers. To efficiently minimize this\nbound, we introduce two novel architectural components: first, a non-linearity\ncalled centered-softplus that is a stable variant of the softplus\nnon-linearity, and second, a Lipschitz-constrained batch normalization layer.\n  Our experiments show that LCNNs have lower curvature, more stable gradients\nand increased off-the-shelf adversarial robustness when compared to their\nstandard high-curvature counterparts, all without affecting predictive\nperformance.

Specifically,\nwe consider a general setup with a nonlinear affine physical plant controlled\nwith a perception-based controller that maps both the physical sensor (e.g.,\nIMUs) and perceptual (e.g., camera) measurements to the control input; in\naddition, the system is equipped with a statistical or learning-based anomaly\ndetector (AD) to detect the presence of abnormal behaviours in the system.

Doing so, we relieve the proof\nengineer of the burden of memory-based reasoning, allowing them to instead\nfocus on functional properties of their code.\n  Our first contribution is a new approach to borrows and controlled aliasing.\nWe propose a pure, functional semantics for LLBC, a Low-Level Borrow Calculus\nthat captures a large subset of Rust programs.

However, this comparison\ntypically needs to ignore differences due to signal noise, temporal offset,\nsignal magnitude, and other external factors. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nalgorithm quantifies this similarity by finding corresponding regions between\nthe signals and non-linearly warping one signal by stretching and shrinking it.\nUnfortunately, searching through all \"warps\" of a signal to find the best\ncorresponding regions is computationally expensive. The FastDTW algorithm\nimproves performance, but sacrifices accuracy by only considering small signal\nwarps.\n  My goal is to improve the speed of DTW while maintaining high accuracy. My\nkey insight is that in any particular application domain, signals exhibit\nspecific types of variation. For example, the accelerometer signal measured for\ntwo different people would differ based on their stride length and weight. My\nsystem, called Machine Learning DTW (MLDTW), uses machine learning to learn the\ntypes of warps that are common in a particular domain. It then uses the learned\nmodel to improve DTW performance by limiting the search of potential warps\nappropriately. My results show that compared to FastDTW, MLDTW is at least as\nfast and reduces errors by 60% on average across four different data sets.\nThese improvements will significantly impact a wide variety of applications\n(e.g. health monitoring) and enable more scalable processing of multivariate,\nhigher frequency, and longer signal recordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 23:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

We translate empirical crowd signals based on variations in the\namounts and timings of contributions into mock contribution scenarios to\nscrutinize the influence of essential signals on contributors' decisions to\nfund. We conduct two experiments with 1,250 online participants. The first\nexperiment investigates whether high crowd signals, i.e., contributions of\nvarying amounts arriving at unequally spaced time intervals, are making people\nmore likely to contribute to a crowdfunding project. The second experiment\nfurther examines the effect of basic competition on the role of the crowd\nsignals. Across both, we observe that high crowd signals attract 19.2% more\ncontributors than low signals. These findings are robust to different project\ntypes, fundraising goals, participants' interest level in the projects, their\naltruistic attitudes, and susceptibility to social influence. Participants'\nunguided, post-hoc reflections about the reasons behind their choice to fund\nrevealed that most were unaware of their reliance on any crowd signals and\ninstead attributed their decision to nonexistent differences in project\ndescriptions. These results point to the power of crowd signals unbeknownst to\nthose affected by them and lay the groundwork for theory-building, specifically\nin relation to the essential signaling that is happening on online platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 23:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Known approaches to assessing the\nstability of such systems rest on the utility of Lyapunov functions and\nLyapunov first approximation methodologies, typically providing conservative\nand computationally elaborate criteria for multidimensional systems of this\ncategory. Adequate criteria of boundedness of solutions to nonhomogeneous\nsystems of this kind are rare in the contemporary literature. Lately, we\ndevelop a new approach to these problems which rests on bounding the evolution\nof the norms of solutions to initial systems by matching solutions of a scalar\nauxiliary equation we introduced in [1], [2] and [3]. Still, the technique\nadvanced in [3] rests on the assumption that the average of the linear\ncomponents of the underlying system is defined by a stable matrix of general\nposition. The current paper substantially amplifies the application domain of\nthis approach. It is merely assumed that the time-dependent linear block of the\nunderlying system can be split into slow and fast varying components by\napplication of any smoothing technique. This dichotomy of temporal scales is\ndetermined by the optimal criterion reducing the conservatism of our estimates.\nIn turn, we transform the linear subsystem with slow-varying matrix in a\ndiagonally dominant form by successive applications of the Lyapunov transforms.\nThis prompts the development of novel scalar auxiliary equations embracing the\nestimation of the norms of solutions to our initial systems. Next, we formulate\nboundedness or stability criteria and estimate the relevant regions of the\nunderlying systems using analytical and abridged numerical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Implementing exact steering\nfunctions requires either analytical solutions to the time-optimal control\nproblem, or nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers to solve the boundary value\nproblem given the system's kinodynamic equations. Unfortunately, analytical\nsolutions are unavailable for many real-world domains, and NLP solvers are\nprohibitively computationally expensive, hence fast and optimal kinodynamic\nmotion planning remains an open problem. We provide a solution to this problem\nby introducing State Supervised Steering Function (S3F), a novel approach to\nlearn time-optimal steering functions. S3F is able to produce near-optimal\nsolutions to the steering function orders of magnitude faster than its NLP\ncounterpart. Experiments conducted on three challenging robot domains show that\nRRT* using S3F significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning approaches\non both solution cost and runtime.

Many\nhave noted that the rankings not only affect the satisfaction of the users\n(e.g., customers, listeners, employers, travelers), but that the position in\nthe ranking allocates exposure -- and thus economic opportunity -- to the\nranked items (e.g., articles, products, songs, job seekers, restaurants,\nhotels). This has raised questions of fairness to the items, and most existing\nworks have addressed fairness by explicitly linking item exposure to item\nrelevance. However, we argue that any particular choice of such a link function\nmay be difficult to defend, and we show that the resulting rankings can still\nbe unfair. To avoid these shortcomings, we develop a new axiomatic approach\nthat is rooted in principles of fair division. This not only avoids the need to\nchoose a link function, but also more meaningfully quantifies the impact on the\nitems beyond exposure. Our axioms of envy-freeness and dominance over uniform\nranking postulate that for a fair ranking policy every item should prefer their\nown rank allocation over that of any other item, and that no item should be\nactively disadvantaged by the rankings. To compute ranking policies that are\nfair according to these axioms, we propose a new ranking objective related to\nthe Nash Social Welfare. We show that the solution has guarantees regarding its\nenvy-freeness, its dominance over uniform rankings for every item, and its\nPareto optimality. In contrast, we show that conventional exposure-based\nfairness can produce large amounts of envy and have a highly disparate impact\non the items. Beyond these theoretical results, we illustrate empirically how\nour framework controls the trade-off between impact-based individual item\nfairness and user utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 02:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 11:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

We find that the main driving\nprocess is the radiative cooling of CO2 (or other non-condensable greenhouse\ngases) rather than CO2 greenhouse warming or stellar radiation. Stellar\nradiation is the ultimate mechanism but not the direct mechanism. Due to the\ncombination of the uneven distribution in the stellar radiation and effective\nhorizontal energy transports in the free troposphere, there is strong\ntemperature inversion in the area away from the substellar region. This\ninversion makes CO2 to have a radiative cooling effect rather than a radiative\nwarming effect for the atmosphere, same as that in the stratosphere of Earth's\natmosphere. This cooling effect produces negative buoyancy and drives\nlarge-scale downwelling, supporting the formation of a global-scale overturning\ncirculation. If CO2 is excluded from the atmosphere, the overturning\ncirculation becomes very weak, regardless the level of stellar radiation. This\nmechanism is completely different from that for the atmospheric overturning\ncirculation on Earth or on moist, tidally-locked rocky planets, where latent\nheat release and/or baroclinic instability are the dominated mechanisms.

A promising approach is 'greenhouse\ncultivation' providing a microclimate to the cultivated plants to overcome\nunfavorable climate. However, massive-sized greenhouses develop non-uniform\nmicro-climate throughout the complex requiring high degree of human\nsupervision. We propose deploying an Agri-Bot to create and maintain positive\necological conditions in the greenhouse, reducing labor costs and increasing\nproduction. The prototype will contain two primary systems, the navigation\nsystem and the data analytics system. The navigation system will be controlled\nby an Arduino, and data analytics will be handled using an ESP8266 microchip.\nNumerous sensors for measuring the greenhouse parameters will be mounted on the\nrobot. It will follow a predefined path, while taking readings at checkpoints.\nThe microchip will collect and process data from sensors, transmit to the\ncloud, and give commands to the actuators. The soil and climate parameters like\ntemperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, pH will be measured\nperiodically. When the parameters are not within a specified range, the\nAgri-Bot will take corrective actions like switching on blowers/heaters,\nstarting irrigation etc. If external intervention is required, eg., fertilizer,\nit will indicate accordingly. Deploying such an Agri-Bot for monitoring and\ncontrolling microclimate in large-scale greenhouses can mitigate labor costs\nwhile increasing productivity. In spite of an initial cost, it can provide a\nhigh return on investment by providing flexibility, low power consumption and\neasy management to help greenhouse be water efficient, provide evenly dispersed\nand controlled sunlight intensity, temperature and humidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 03:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

This difference is\nlikely attributable to how the eyes sample visual input and how the brain\nprocesses retinal samples through its dorsal and ventral visual pathways, which\nare under-explored for computer vision. Inspired by the brain, we design\nrecurrent neural networks, including an input sampler that mimics the human\nretina, a dorsal network that guides where to look next, and a ventral network\nthat represents the retinal samples. Taking these modules together, the models\nlearn to take multiple glances at an image, attend to a salient part at each\nglance, and accumulate the representation over time to recognize the image. We\ntest such models for their robustness against a varying level of adversarial\nnoises with a special focus on the effect of different input sampling\nstrategies. Our findings suggest that retinal foveation and sampling renders a\nmodel more robust against adversarial noises, and the model may correct itself\nfrom an attack when it is given a longer time to take more glances at an image.\nIn conclusion, robust visual recognition can benefit from the combined use of\nthree brain-inspired mechanisms: retinal transformation, attention guided eye\nmovement, and recurrent processing, as opposed to feedforward-only CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 03:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

In this work, we\ninvestigate an important component in the PRV error budget - the spectral\ncontamination from the Earth's atmosphere (tellurics).

We investigate the effectiveness in mitigating tellurics using\nsimulated spectra of a solar twin star with telluric contamination over a\nyear's worth of observations, and we extracted the RVs using two commonly\nadopted algorithms: dividing out a telluric model before performing\ncross-correlation or Forward Modeling the observed spectrum incorporating a\ntelluric model. We assume various degrees of cleanness in removing the\ntellurics, including mimicking the lack of accurate knowledge of the telluric\nlines by using a mismatched line profile to model the \"observed\" tellurics. We\nconclude that the RV errors caused by telluric absorption can be suppressed to\nclose to or even below the photon-limited precision in the optical region,\nespecially in the blue, around 1-10 cm/s. At red through near-infrared\nwavelengths, however, the residuals of tellurics can induce an RV error on the\nm/s level even under the most favorable assumptions for telluric removal,\nleading to significant systematic noise in the RV time series and periodograms.\nIf the red-optical or near-infrared becomes critical in the mitigation of\nstellar activity, systematic errors from tellurics can be eliminated with a\nspace mission such as EarthFinder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 04:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

This paper presents a new model to achieve a trade-off\nbetween accuracy/speed for real-time road scene semantic segmentation.\nSpecifically, we proposed a lightweight model named Scale-aware Strip Attention\nGuided Feature Pyramid Network (S$^2$-FPN). Our network consists of three main\nmodules: Attention Pyramid Fusion (APF) module, Scale-aware Strip Attention\nModule (SSAM), and Global Feature Upsample (GFU) module. APF adopts an\nattention mechanisms to learn discriminative multi-scale features and help\nclose the semantic gap between different levels. APF uses the scale-aware\nattention to encode global context with vertical stripping operation and models\nthe long-range dependencies, which helps relate pixels with similar semantic\nlabel. In addition, APF employs channel-wise reweighting block (CRB) to\nemphasize the channel features. Finally, the decoder of S$^2$-FPN then adopts\nGFU, which is used to fuse features from APF and the encoder. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted on two challenging semantic segmentation\nbenchmarks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves better accuracy/speed\ntrade-off with different model settings. The proposed models have achieved a\nresults of 76.2\\%mIoU/87.3FPS, 77.4\\%mIoU/67FPS, and 77.8\\%mIoU/30.5FPS on\nCityscapes dataset, and 69.6\\%mIoU,71.0\\% mIoU, and 74.2\\% mIoU on Camvid\ndataset.

We show in this\npaper that in the case of magnetic MXenes, the magneto-transport properties of\nthe material provide an easy solution. One of the fascinating properties that\nMXenes offer is the realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism which is important\nfor two-dimensional (2D) materials family. The previous reports have only made\na few statements on some MXenes citing its usefulness for spintronics related\napplications. Here, using first-principle calculations we have examined the\nactual magneto-transport phenomena in MXenes family. We have considered all\npossible combinations of 3\\textit{d} transition metals ($Ti, V, Cr$ and $Mn$)\nand nitride based functionalized $(O_2, F_2$ and $(OH)_2$) MXenes, $M_2NT_2$.\nThe intrinsic anomalous Hall effect is investigated in $Cr$ and $Mn$ based\nMXenes as the compounds possess ground state stable ferromagnetic solutions. We\ndemonstrate that intrinsic Anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) can be used to\nidentify the functional groups in MXenes.\n  Additionally, half-metallic features of these ferromagnetic MXenes make them\npotential candidates for varieties of applications such as in logic and memory\ndevices, quantum computations, spintronics etc. The maximum anomalous Hall\nconductivity (AHC) at Fermi energy, $E_F$, is found in case of $Mn_2NO_2$ (470\n$S/cm$) which is attributed to the presence of avoided band crossing and larger\ndensity of states. Together, when considered all the studied systems, the AHC\ncan be above 2500 $S/cm$ within $E_F \\pm $ 0.25 $eV$.

This is mainly for\naddressing the coupling dilemma between the range and angle resolutions, which\nis historically and naturally inherited from a conventional FSR. First of all,\nthe frequency-modulated continuous-wave system architecture is selected to\nexemplify and recall the characteristics of a conventional FSR with an emphasis\non that resolution coupling. Then, a radar solution featuring a stitched\nfrequency-space domain is introduced for the resolution decoupling, depending\non an array of FB-enabled LWA channels. With the radar equation, FB-related\nconditions for realizing the critical frequency-space stitching are\nanalytically derived and equivalently converted into several design\nspecifications of an array of LWAs, i.e., engineered beam-scanning functions,\nbeam-crossovers, and phase alignments. To facilitate the practical\nimplementation of such an array technique, a detailed and generalized design\nflow is developed. Finally, for a simple proof of concept, an FB-enabled\ntwo-channel LWA array is modeled, fabricated, and measured.

Given the fact that neural networks are often\nover-parameterized, one effective way to reduce such computational overhead is\nneural network pruning, by removing redundant parameters from trained neural\nnetworks. It has been recently observed that pruning can not only reduce\ncomputational overhead but also can improve empirical robustness of deep neural\nnetworks (NNs), potentially owing to removing spurious correlations while\npreserving the predictive accuracies. This paper for the first time\ndemonstrates that pruning can generally improve certified robustness for\nReLU-based NNs under the complete verification setting. Using the popular\nBranch-and-Bound (BaB) framework, we find that pruning can enhance the\nestimated bound tightness of certified robustness verification, by alleviating\nlinear relaxation and sub-domain split problems.

To this end, we introduce\nMorphence-2.0, a scalable moving target defense (MTD) powered by\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection to defend against adversarial examples. By\nregularly moving the decision function of a model, Morphence-2.0 makes it\nsignificantly challenging for repeated or correlated attacks to succeed.\nMorphence-2.0 deploys a pool of models generated from a base model in a manner\nthat introduces sufficient randomness when it responds to prediction queries.\nVia OOD detection, Morphence-2.0 is equipped with a scheduling approach that\nassigns adversarial examples to robust decision functions and benign samples to\nan undefended accurate models. To ensure repeated or correlated attacks fail,\nthe deployed pool of models automatically expires after a query budget is\nreached and the model pool is seamlessly replaced by a new model pool generated\nin advance. We evaluate Morphence-2.0 on two benchmark image classification\ndatasets (MNIST and CIFAR10) against 4 reference attacks (3 white-box and 1\nblack-box).

As acknowledged by\nrecent literature, the interaction of individual CIDER components and different\nCIDERs through the grid can lead to undesirable amplification of harmonic\nfrequencies and, ultimately, compromise the distribution system stability. In\nthis context, the interaction of the DC and AC sides of CIDERs has been shown\nto have a significant impact. In order to analyze and support the mitigation of\nsuch phenomena, the authors of this paper recently proposed a Harmonic\nPower-Flow (HPF) framework for polyphase grids with a high share of CIDERs. The\nframework considers the coupling between harmonics, but ignores the DC-side\nresponse of the CIDERs. Modelling the DC side and AC/DC converter introduces a\nnonlinearity into the CIDER model that needs to be approximated for the\nnumerical solution of the HPF.

Identification of different types of MHD waves is an\nimportant and challenging task in such complex wave patterns. Moreover, owing\nto the multiplicity of solutions and their admissibility for different systems,\nespecially for intermediate-type MHD shock waves, the identification of MHD\nwave types is complicated if one solely relies on the Rankine-Hugoniot jump\nconditions. MHD wave detection is further exacerbated by the unphysical\nsmearing of discontinuous shock waves in numerical simulations. We present two\nMHD wave detection methods based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) which\nenables the classification of waves and identification of their locations. The\nfirst method separates the output into a regression (location prediction) and a\nclassification problem assuming the number of waves for each training data is\nfixed. In the second method, the number of waves is not specified a priori and\nthe algorithm, using only regression, predicts the waves' locations and\nclassifies their types. The first fixed output model efficiently provides high\nprecision and recall, the accuracy of the entire neural network achieved is up\nto 0.99, and the classification accuracy of some waves approaches unity. The\nsecond detection model has relatively lower performance, with more sensitivity\nto the setting of parameters, such as the number of grid cells N_{grid} and the\nthresholds of confidence score and class probability, etc. The proposed two\nmethods demonstrate very strong potential to be applied for MHD wave detection\nin some complex wave structures and interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

As reinforcement\nlearning (RL) naturally fits this objective -- maximizing an user's reward per\nsession -- it has become an emerging topic in recommender systems. Developing\nRL-based recommendation methods, however, is not trivial due to the\n\\emph{offline training challenge}. Specifically, the keystone of traditional RL\nis to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of\n`errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannot\nafford the price of making `errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to be\ntrained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under different\nrecommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimal\npolicies under these offline training settings.\n  Here we propose a new learning paradigm -- namely Prompt-Based Reinforcement\nLearning (PRL) -- for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents.\nWhile traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs to\ntheir expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e.,\nrecommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trained\nto predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observed\nreward value -- with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, this\nhistorical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-reward\npairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question:\n\\emph{ Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions \\& the\nprompted reward value}? We implement PRL with four notable recommendation\nmodels and conduct experiments on two real-world e-commerce datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

We consider two main mechanisms to\ngrow the central BH, that are expected to cooperate in the high-redshift\nstar-forming progenitors of local massive galaxies. The first is the gaseous\ndynamical friction process, that can cause the migration toward the nuclear\nregions of stellar-mass BHs originated during the intense bursts of star\nformation in the gas-rich host progenitor galaxy, and the buildup of a central\nheavy BH seed $M_\\bullet\\sim 10^{3-5}\\, M_\\odot$ within short timescales\n$\\lesssim$ some $10^7$ yr. The second mechanism is the standard Eddington-type\ngas disk accretion onto the heavy BH seed, through which the central BH can\nbecome (super)massive $M_\\bullet\\sim 10^{6-10}\\, M_\\odot$ within the typical\nstar-formation duration $\\lesssim 1$ Gyr of the host. We validate our\nsemi-empirical approach by reproducing the observed redshift-dependent\nbolometric AGN luminosity functions and Eddington ratio distributions, and the\nrelationship between the star-formation and the bolometric luminosity of the\naccreting central BH. We then derive the relic (super)massive BH mass function\nat different redshifts via a generalized continuity equation approach, and\ncompare it with present observational estimates.

Most GNNs use\na message passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising\nresults, MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing\nand under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the\nliterature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most\nstate-of-the-art graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of\nthe graph, are neither differentiable nor inductive, and require the tuning of\nhyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose DiffWire, a novel framework for\ngraph rewiring in MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and\nparameter-free by leveraging the Lov\\'asz bound. The proposed approach provides\na unified theory for graph rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers\nin MPNNs: CT-Layer, a layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a\nrelevance function for edge re-weighting; and GAP-Layer, a layer to optimize\nthe spectral gap, depending on the nature of the network and the task at hand.\nWe empirically validate the value of each of these layers separately with\nbenchmark datasets for graph classification. We also perform preliminary\nstudies on the use of CT-Layer for homophilic and heterophilic node\nclassification tasks. DiffWire brings together the learnability of commute\ntimes to related definitions of curvature, opening the door to creating more\nexpressive MPNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 10:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Due to the ill-posed 2D to 3D mapping\nessence from the monocular imaging process, monocular 3D object detection\nsuffers from inaccurate depth estimation and thus has poor 3D detection\nresults. To alleviate this problem, we propose to introduce the ground plane as\na prior in the monocular 3d object detection. The ground plane prior serves as\nan additional geometric condition to the ill-posed mapping and an extra source\nin depth estimation. In this way, we can get a more accurate depth estimation\nfrom the ground. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of the ground plane prior,\nwe propose a depth-align training strategy and a precise two-stage depth\ninference method tailored for the ground plane prior. It is worth noting that\nthe introduced ground plane prior requires no extra data sources like LiDAR,\nstereo images, and depth information.

This paper\naims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement\nlearning w.r.t. steady reward distribution. Since semivariance is\ntime-inconsistent and does not satisfy the standard Bellman equation, the\ntraditional dynamic programming methods are inapplicable to MSV problems\ndirectly.

A key insight of our\nanalysis is that, for bunched beams a relatively small gradient error can\nresult in a large half-integer stop band width. The achievable maximum bunch\nintensity, often referred to as space charge limit, is thus reduced\nsignificantly. This contrasts the findings in existing studies in literature\nbased on more simplified beam distributions. The reason for discrepancy is\nidentified in the increasing stop band width for Gaussian distributions when\nspace charge becomes stronger, which appears on longer time scales as relevant\nfor synchrotrons. The role of synchrotron motion in providing continuous\nemittance growth across the bunch is scrutinized. To minimize the half-integer\nstop band for a bunched beam, and hence increase the space charge limit,\nlattice corrections are applied: Including space charge in the optimization\nprocedure recovers results equivalent to conventional lattice correction.\nTherefore, we find that conventional correction tools are well suited to\nincrease the gradient-error-induced space charge limit of synchrotrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Now, the\nchiral anomaly implies that non-vanishing $\\boldsymbol{E} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}$\ninduces the chiral charge in the system. The question is whether the chiral\ncharge is generated in the massless limit when we take into account the\naxion-like degree of freedom in the discussion. The discussion is relevant for\nthe mechanism of baryogenesis under the background of time-dependent $\\theta$.\nWe solve the system of the massless QED with time dependent $\\theta$ by\nreducing it to the two-dimensional QED. We demonstrate the occurrence of chiral\ncharge generation in the background of static magnetic field for two cases: a\nmagnetic monopole and a uniform magnetic flux. For the monopole case, the\nchiral charge comes out from the monopole while canceling the Witten effect.\nFor the case of the uniform flux, on the other hand, the effect of the\nbackreaction cannot be ignored, giving a more non-trivial time dependence. We\nalso discuss their implications on baryogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In the context of video coding,\nthe random nature of film grain makes it both difficult to preserve and very\nexpensive to compress.

For semantic segmentation, deep regression and final\ninstance segmentation, 93.75 %, 95 %, and 80 % of the model weights can be\npruned by layer-wise pruning with less than 2 % reduction in the performance of\nrespective models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 09:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

The\nmain difference between this task and topical classification is that genres,\nunlike topics, usually do not correspond to simple keywords, and thus they need\nto be defined in terms of their functions in communication.

To\nmitigate this problem, we experiment with individual models as well as with\ntheir ensembles.

This is particularly effective\nwhen employing the abundance of H$_2$D$^+$. However, its low abundances and\nlarge distances make detections in massive sources hard to achieve. We present\nan application of the radiative transfer code POLARIS, with the goal to test\nthe observability of the ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ transition $1_{10}$-$1_{11}$ (372.42\nGHz) using simulations of high-mass collapsing cores that include deuteration\nchemistry. We analyzed an early and a late stage of the collapse of a 60\nM$_{\\odot}$ core, testing different source distances. For all cases, we\ngenerated synthetic single-dish and interferometric observations and studied\nthe differences in both techniques. The column densities we derive are\ncomparable to values reported for similar sources. These estimates depend on\nthe extent over which they are averaged, and sources with compact emission they\ncan be highly affected by beam dilution. Combined ALMA-ACA observations improve\nin signal-to-noise ratio and lead to better column density estimates as\ncompared to ALMA alone. We confirm the feasibility to study ortho-H$_2$D$^+$\nemission up to distances of 7 kpc. We provide a proof-of-concept of our\nframework for synthetic observations and highlight its importance when\ncomparing numerical simulations with real observations. This work also proves\nhow relevant it is to combine single-dish and interferometric measurements to\nderive appropriate source column densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 10:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Closely related to the\ninformation loss puzzle is the challenge to define an objective notion of\nphysical entropy which increases throughout this process in a way consistent\nwith unitarity. In recent years, this has been addressed with certain notions\nof coarse grained entropy. We have suggested instead that physical entropy\nshould be identified with matter-gravity entanglement entropy and that this may\noffer an explanation of entropy increase both for the black hole collapse and\nevaporation system and also for other closed unitarily evolving systems,\nnotably the universe as a whole. For this to work, it would have to be that the\nmatter-gravity entanglement entropy of the late-time state of black hole\nevaporation is larger than the entropy of the freshly formed black hole. We\nargue here that this is possibly the case due to (usually neglected)\nphoton-graviton interactions. If black hole evaporation is slowed down by\nputting the black hole in a slightly permeable box, we give plausibility\narguments that the radiation remaining after a large black hole has evaporated\nwill (be pure and) mainly consist of roughly equal numbers of photons and\ngravitons entangled with one another -- with a photon-graviton entanglement\nentropy possibly greater than the entropy of the freshly formed black hole. It\nalso seems possible that, even in the absence of such a box, the matter-gravity\nentanglement entropy might still increase and the late-time state again be a\npure state of (predominantly) photons highly entangled with soft gravitons that\nthe Hawking-emitted photons themselves had radiated. More work is needed to\nfind out if it is indeed so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 10:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:49:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

However, deep neural networks are known to\nbe overconfident for abnormal data. Existing works directly design score\nfunction by mining the inconsistency from classifier for in-distribution (ID)\nand OOD. In this paper, we further complement this inconsistency with\nreconstruction error, based on the assumption that an autoencoder trained on ID\ndata can not reconstruct OOD as well as ID. We propose a novel method, READ\n(Reconstruction Error Aggregated Detector), to unify inconsistencies from\nclassifier and autoencoder. Specifically, the reconstruction error of raw\npixels is transformed to latent space of classifier. We show that the\ntransformed reconstruction error bridges the semantic gap and inherits\ndetection performance from the original. Moreover, we propose an adjustment\nstrategy to alleviate the overconfidence problem of autoencoder according to a\nfine-grained characterization of OOD data. Under two scenarios of pre-training\nand retraining, we respectively present two variants of our method, namely\nREAD-MD (Mahalanobis Distance) only based on pre-trained classifier and READ-ED\n(Euclidean Distance) which retrains the classifier.

Studying properly the tension on the Hubble constant,\n$H_0$, obtained by Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) and the Planck measurements of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation would require complete samples of\ndistance indicators at any epoch. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are necessary for the\naforementioned task because of their huge luminosity that allows us to extend\nthe cosmic ladder at very high redshifts. However, using GRBs alone as standard\ncandles is challenging because their luminosity varies widely. To this end, we\nchoose a reliable correlation for GRBs with a very small intrinsic scatter: the\nso-called fundamental plane correlation for GRB afterglows corrected for\nselection biases and redshift evolution. We choose a well-defined sample: the\nplatinum sample, composed of 50 Long GRBs. To further constrain cosmological\nparameters, we use Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) given their reliability\nas standard rulers.

In\nthe standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\\ldots,m$ we first sample\ntwo randomly chosen bins, compare their two loads and then place a ball in the\nleast loaded bin. It is well-known that for any $m\\geq n$, this results in a\ngap (difference between the maximum and average load) of $\\log_2\\log\nn+\\Theta(1)$ (with high probability).\n  In this work, we consider Two-Choice in different settings with noisy load\ncomparisons. One key setting involves an adaptive adversary whose power is\nlimited by some threshold $g\\in\\mathbb{N}$. In each step, such adversary can\ndetermine the result of any load comparison between two bins whose loads differ\nby at most $g$, while if the load difference is greater than $g$, the\ncomparison is correct.\n  For this adversarial setting, we first prove that for any $m \\geq n$ the gap\nis $O(g+\\log n)$ with high probability. Then through a refined analysis we\nprove that if $g\\leq\\log n$, then for any $m \\geq n$ the gap is\n$O(\\frac{g}{\\log g}\\cdot\\log\\log n)$. For constant values of $g$, this\ngeneralizes the heavily loaded analysis of [BCSV06, TW14] for the Two-Choice\nprocess, and establishes that asymptotically the same gap bound holds even if\nload comparisons among \"similarly loaded\" bins are wrong. Finally, we\ncomplement these upper bounds with tight lower bounds, which establish an\ninteresting phase transition on how the parameter $g$ impacts the gap.\n  The analysis also applies to settings with outdated and delayed information.\nFor example, for the setting of [BCEFN12] where balls are allocated in\nconsecutive batches of size $b=n$, we present an improved and tight gap bound\nof $\\Theta(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$. This bound also extends for a range of\nvalues of $b$ and applies to a relaxed setting where the reported load of a bin\ncan be any load value from the last $b$ steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 12:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 13:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized\nQ-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an\nalgorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution\n(CTDE) and leads to efficient learning in practice. Despite all the advantages,\nwe revisit these two principles and show that in certain scenarios, e.g.,\nenvironments with a highly multi-modal reward landscape, value decomposition,\nand parameter sharing can be problematic and lead to undesired outcomes. In\ncontrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual policies provably\nconverge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially supports some\nrecent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL testbeds.\nInspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions on\nimplementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverse\nemergent behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety of\ndomains, ranging from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complex\nbenchmarks such as StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research\nFootball.

While our data is highly valuable, it is often\nprivacy-sensitive. Thus, regulations like the GDPR restrict what data can be\nlegally published, and what a buyer may do with this sensitive data. While\npersonal data must be protected, we can still sell some insights gathered from\nour data that do not hurt our privacy. A data marketplace is a platform that\nhelps users to sell their data while assisting buyers in discovering relevant\ndatasets. The major challenge such a marketplace faces is balancing between\noffering valuable insights into data while preserving privacy requirements.\nPrivate data marketplaces try to solve this challenge by offering\nprivacy-preserving computations on personal data. Such computations allow for\ncalculating statistics or training machine learning models on personal data\nwithout accessing the data in plain. However, the user selling the data cannot\nrestrict who can buy or what type of computation the data is allowed.\n  We close the latter gap by proposing a flexible access control architecture\nfor private data marketplaces, which can be applied to existing data markets.\nOur architecture enables data sellers to define detailed policies restricting\nwho can buy their data. Furthermore, a seller can control what computation a\nspecific buyer can purchase on the data, and make constraints on its parameters\nto mitigate privacy breaches. The data market's computation system then\nenforces the policies before initiating a computation.\n  To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide an implementation\nfor the KRAKEN marketplace, a distributed data market using MPC.

Here we analyze\nand compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic\ndynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models\nin the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an\napproximation of NMM2 in this regime.

This appears to be a genuine representation for many real-world\nsystems. However, due to a variety of potential factors, such as limited budget\nand equipment, or physical impossibility, multiplex data can be difficult to\nobserve directly. Often, only partial information on the layer structure of the\nsystem is available, whereas the remaining information is in the form of a\nsingle-layer network. In this work, we face the problem of reconstructing the\nhidden multiplex structure of an aggregated network from partial information.\nWe propose an algorithm that leverages the layer-wise community structure that\ncan be learned from partial observations to reconstruct the ground-truth\ntopology of the unobserved part of the multiplex. The algorithm is\ncharacterized by a computational time that grows linearly with the network\nsize. We perform a systematic study of reconstruction problems for both\nsynthetic and real-world multiplex networks. We show that the ability of the\nproposed method to solve the reconstruction problem is affected by the\nheterogeneity of the individual layers and the similarity among the layers. On\nreal-world networks, we observe that the accuracy of the reconstruction\nsaturates quickly as the amount of available information increases. In genetic\ninteraction and scientific collaboration multiplexes for example, we find that\n10% of ground-truth information yields 70% accuracy, while 30% information\nallows for more than 90% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 13:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 16:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

In the lifted space, the dynamics are linear and\nrepresented by a so-called Koopman operator. While the Koopman theory was\noriginally introduced for autonomous systems, it has been widely used to derive\nlinear time-invariant (LTI) models for nonlinear systems with inputs through\nvarious approximation schemes such as the extended dynamics mode decomposition\n(EDMD). However, recent extensions of the Koopman theory show that the lifting\nprocess for such systems results in a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model\ninstead of an LTI form. As LTI Koopman model based control has been\nsuccessfully used in practice and it is generally temping to use such LTI\ndescriptions of nonlinear systems, due to the simplicity of the associated\ncontrol tool chain, a systematic approach is needed to synthesise optimal LTI\napproximations of LPV Koopman models compared to the ad-hoc schemes such as\nEDMD, which is based on least-squares regression.

Gliese 832 (GJ 832) is an M2V star hosting a massive planet on a\ndecade-long orbit, GJ 832b, discovered by radial velocity (RV).

The recently determined stellar rotation period (45.7 $\\pm$ 9.3\ndays) is close to the orbital period of putative planet c (35.68 $\\pm$ 0.03\ndays).\n  Aims. We aim to confirm or dismiss the planetary nature of the RV signature\nattributed to GJ 832c, by adding 119 new RV data points, new photometric data,\nand an analysis of the spectroscopic stellar activity indicators. Additionally,\nwe update the orbital parameters of the planetary system and search for\nadditional signals.\n  Methods. We performed a frequency content analysis of the RVs to search for\nperiodic and stable signals. Radial velocity time series were modelled with\nKeplerians and Gaussian process (GP) regressions alongside activity indicators\nto subsequently compare them within a Bayesian framework.\n  Results. We updated the stellar rotational period of GJ 832 from activity\nindicators, obtaining $37.5^{+1.4}_{-1.5}$ days, improving the precision by a\nfactor of 6. The new photometric data are in agreement with this value. We\ndetected an RV signal near 18 days (FAP < 4.6%), which is half of the stellar\nrotation period. Two Keplerians alone fail at modelling GJ 832b and a second\nplanet with a 35-day orbital period. Moreover, the Bayesian evidence from the\nGP analysis of the RV data with simultaneous activity indices prefers a model\nwithout a second Keplerian, therefore negating the existence of planet c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 14:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 13:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 12:06:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 15:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

This paper\nproposes a dimension of interactional ethics thus far overlooked: the ways AI\nsystems should treat human beings. For this purpose, we explore the\nphilosophical concept of respect: if respect is something everyone needs and\ndeserves, shouldn't technology aim to be respectful? Despite its intuitive\nsimplicity, respect in philosophy is a complex concept with many disparate\nsenses. Like fairness or justice, respect can characterise how people deserve\nto be treated; but rather than relating primarily to the distribution of\nbenefits or punishments, respect relates to how people regard one another, and\nhow this translates to perception, treatment, and behaviour. We explore respect\nbroadly across several literatures, synthesising perspectives on respect from\nKantian, post-Kantian, dramaturgical, and agential realist design perspectives\nwith a goal of drawing together a view of what respect could mean for AI. In so\ndoing, we identify ways that respect may guide us towards more sociable\nartefacts that ethically and inclusively honour and recognise humans using the\nrich social language that we have evolved to interact with one another every\nday.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 14:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

However, current approaches are\ninsufficient to achieve comprehensive source prosody transfer and target\nspeaker timbre preservation in the converted speech, and the quality of the\nconverted speech is also unsatisfied due to the mismatch between the acoustic\nmodel and the vocoder. In this paper, we leverage the recent advances in\ninformation perturbation and propose a fully end-to-end approach to conduct\nhigh-quality voice conversion. We first adopt information perturbation to\nremove speaker-related information in the source speech to disentangle speaker\ntimbre and linguistic content and thus the linguistic information is\nsubsequently modeled by a content encoder. To better transfer the prosody of\nthe source speech to the target, we particularly introduce a speaker-related\npitch encoder which can maintain the general pitch pattern of the source\nspeaker while flexibly modifying the pitch intensity of the generated speech.\nFinally, one-shot voice conversion is set up through continuous speaker space\nmodeling.

In recent years,\nsimulation-based inference methods have emerged as powerful tools for\nperforming this task when the model likelihood function is intractable, as is\noften the case for ABMs. In some real-world use cases of ABMs, both the\nobserved data and the ABM output consist of the agents' states and their\ninteractions over time. In such cases, there is a tension between the desire to\nmake full use of the rich information content of such granular data on the one\nhand, and the need to reduce the dimensionality of the data to prevent\ndifficulties associated with high-dimensional learning tasks on the other. A\npossible resolution is to construct lower-dimensional time-series through the\nuse of summary statistics describing the macrostate of the system at each time\npoint.

Due to the large data scale in histology,\ndeep learning methods play an increasingly significant role as feature\nextractors. Existing solutions heavily rely on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for global pixel-level analysis, leaving the underlying local geometric\nstructure such as the interaction between cells in the tumor microenvironment\nunexplored. The topological structure in medical images, as proven to be\nclosely related to tumor evolution, can be well characterized by graphs. To\nobtain a more comprehensive representation for downstream oncology tasks, we\npropose a fusion framework for enhancing the global image-level representation\ncaptured by CNNs with the geometry of cell-level spatial information learned by\ngraph neural networks (GNN). The fusion layer optimizes an integration between\ncollaborative features of global images and cell graphs. Two fusion strategies\nhave been developed: one with MLP which is simple but turns out efficient\nthrough fine-tuning, and the other with Transformer gains a champion in fusing\nmultiple networks. We evaluate our fusion strategies on histology datasets\ncurated from large patient cohorts of colorectal and gastric cancers for three\nbiomarker prediction tasks. Both two models outperform plain CNNs or GNNs,\nreaching a consistent AUC improvement of more than 5% on various network\nbackbones. The experimental results yield the necessity for combining\nimage-level morphological features with cell spatial relations in medical image\nanalysis.

Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity of\na-Si in a wide range of temperatures and sample sizes is still a challenge.\nHerein we present a systematic investigation of the thermal transport\nproperties of a-Si by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nwith an accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP)\ntrained against abundant reference data calculated at the quantum-mechanical\ndensity-functional-theory level. The high efficiency of NEP allows us to study\nthe effects of finite size and quenching rate in the formation of a-Si in great\ndetail. We find that it requires a simulation cell up to $64,000$ atoms (a\ncubic cell with a linear size of 11 nm) and a quenching rate down to $10^{11}$\nK s$^{-1}$ for fully convergent thermal conductivity. Structural properties,\nincluding short- and medium-range order as characterized by the pair\ncorrelation function, angular distribution function, coordination number, ring\nstatistics and structure factor are studied to demonstrate the accuracy of NEP\nand to further evaluate the role of quenching rate. Using both the\nheterogeneous and the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD methods and the related\nspectral decomposition techniques, we calculate the temperature- and\nthickness-dependent thermal conductivity values of a-Si and show that they\nagree well with available experimental results from 10 K to room temperature.\nOur results also highlight the importance of quantum effects in the calculated\nthermal conductivity and support the quantum correction method based on the\nspectral thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 15:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 19:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 12:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, most AI\nalgorithms are trained on a specific input domain (e.g., single scanner vendor\nor hospital-tailored imaging protocol) and lack the robustness to perform\noptimally when applied to CMR data from other input domains. METHODS: Our\nproposed framework consists of an AI-based algorithm for biventricular\nsegmentation of short-axis images, followed by a post-analysis quality control\nto detect erroneous results. The segmentation algorithm was trained on a large\ndataset of clinical CMR scans from two NHS hospitals (n=2793) and validated on\nadditional cases from this dataset (n=441) and on five external datasets\n(n=6808). The validation data included CMR scans of patients with a range of\ndiseases acquired at 12 different centres using CMR scanners from all major\nvendors. RESULTS: Our method yielded median Dice scores over 87%, translating\ninto median absolute errors in cardiac biomarkers within the range of\ninter-observer variability: <8.4mL (left ventricle), <9.2mL (right ventricle),\n<13.3g (left ventricular mass), and <5.9% (ejection fraction) across all\ndatasets. Stratification of cases according to phenotypes of cardiac disease\nand scanner vendors showed good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: We show that our\nproposed tool, which combines a state-of-the-art AI algorithm trained on a\nlarge-scale multi-domain CMR dataset with a post-analysis quality control,\nallows us to robustly deal with routine clinical data from multiple centres,\nvendors, and cardiac diseases. This is a fundamental step for the clinical\ntranslation of AI algorithms. Moreover, our method yields a range of additional\nbiomarkers of cardiac function (filling and ejection rates, regional wall\nmotion, and strain) at no extra computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 11:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

The ability to automatically segment a GUI into perceptual\ngroups of widgets constitutes a fundamental component of visual intelligence to\nautomate GUI design, implementation and automation tasks. Although humans can\npartition a GUI into meaningful perceptual groups of widgets in a highly\nreliable way, perceptual grouping is still an open challenge for computational\napproaches. Existing methods rely on ad-hoc heuristics or supervised machine\nlearning that is dependent on specific GUI implementations and runtime\ninformation. Research in psychology and biological vision has formulated a set\nof principles (i.e., Gestalt theory of perception) that describe how humans\ngroup elements in visual scenes based on visual cues like connectivity,\nsimilarity, proximity and continuity. These principles are domain-independent\nand have been widely adopted by practitioners to structure content on GUIs to\nimprove aesthetic pleasant and usability. Inspired by these principles, we\npresent a novel unsupervised image-based method for inferring perceptual groups\nof GUI widgets. Our method requires only GUI pixel images, is independent of\nGUI implementation, and does not require any training data.

A good representation of the tightly foliated aspect of the cerebellar\ncortex is difficult to achieve because of the highly convoluted surface and the\ntime it would take for manual delineation. The quality of manual segmentation\nis influenced by human expert judgment, and automatic labelling is constrained\nby the limited robustness of existing segmentation algorithms. The\n20umisotropic BigBrain dataset provides an unprecedented high resolution\nframework for semantic segmentation compared to the 1000um(1mm) resolution\nafforded by magnetic resonance imaging.

The distinct visual discrepancy between the Allen Brain and\nBigBrain prevents existing approaches to provide meaningful segmentation masks,\nand artifacts caused by sectioning and histological slice preparation in the\nBigBrain data pose an extra challenge.

In the application of\nhigh-throughput thickness as a downstream process of the high-throughput\noptimization of optoelectronic thin films with autonomous workflows, data\nscarcity occurs especially for new materials. To achieve high-throughput\nthickness characterization, we propose a machine learning model called\nthicknessML that predicts thickness from UV-Vis spectrophotometry input and an\noverarching transfer learning workflow.

The fusion is commonly carried out in a\nmodel-based extended Kalman filter framework. One of the critical parameters of\nthe filter is the process noise covariance. It is responsible for the real-time\nsolution accuracy, as it considers both vehicle dynamics uncertainty and the\ninertial sensors quality. In most situations, the process noise is covariance\nassumed to be constant. Yet, due to vehicle dynamics and sensor measurement\nvariations throughout the trajectory, the process noise covariance is subject\nto change. To cope with such situations, several adaptive model-based Kalman\nfilters were suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nmodel and learning-based adaptive navigation filter. We rely on the model-based\nKalman filter and design a deep neural network model to tune the momentary\nsystem noise covariance matrix, based only on the inertial sensor readings.\nOnce the process noise covariance is learned, it is plugged into the\nwell-established, model-based Kalman filter. After deriving the proposed hybrid\nframework, field experiment results using a quadrotor are presented and a\ncomparison to model-based adaptive approaches is given. We show that the\nproposed method obtained an improvement of 25% in the position error.\nFurthermore, the proposed hybrid learning method can be used in any navigation\nfilter and also in any relevant estimation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 17:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2022 10:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Universal Generating Function (UGF) is an important method in\nthe reliability analysis, which efficiently obtains the system reliability by a\nfast algebraic procedure. However, when structural relationships between\nsubsystems or components are not clear or without explicit expressions, the UGF\nmethod is difficult to use or not applicable at all. Bayesian Network (BN) has\na natural advantage in terms of uncertainty inference for the relationship\nwithout explicit expressions. For the number of components is extremely large,\nthough, it has the defects of low efficiency. To overcome the respective\ndefects of UGF and BN, a novel reliability analysis method called UGF-BN is\nproposed for the complex MSS. In the UGF-BN framework, the UGF method is\nfirstly used to analyze the bottom components with a large number. Then\nprobability distributions obtained are taken as the input of BN. Finally, the\nreliability of the complex MSS is modeled by the BN method. This proposed\nmethod improves the computational efficiency, especially for the MSS with the\nlarge number of bottom components. Besides, the aircraft reliability-based\ndesign optimization based on the UGF-BN method is further studied with budget\nconstraints on mass, power, and cost. Finally, two cases are used to\ndemonstrate and verify the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 08:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

Of particular\ninterest is the ability of VCSELs to exhibit neural-like spiking responses,\nmuch like biological neurons, but at ultrafast sub-nanosecond rates; thus\noffering great prospects for high-speed light-enabled neuromorphic\n(spike-based) processors. Recent works have shown the use the spiking dynamics\nin VCSELs for pattern recognition and image processing problems such as image\ndata encoding and edge-feature detection. Additionally, VCSELs have also been\nused recently as nonlinear elements in photonic reservoir computing (RC)\nimplementations, yielding excellent state of the art operation. This work\nintroduces and experimentally demonstrates for the first time the new concept\nof a Ghz-rate photonic spiking neural network (SNN) built with a single VCSEL\nneuron.

Importantly, the proposed system\nbenefits from a highly hardware-friendly, inexpensive realization (built with a\nsingle VCSEL and off-the-shelf fibre-optic components), for high-speed\n(GHz-rate inputs) and low-power (sub-mW optical input power) photonic\noperation.
