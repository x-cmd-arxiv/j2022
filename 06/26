The resolution of input images can be\nreduced, however, with significant loss of critical information. Based on the\noutlined issues, we introduce a novel research problem of training CNN models\nfor very large images, and present 'UltraMNIST dataset', a simple yet\nrepresentative benchmark dataset for this task. UltraMNIST has been designed\nusing the popular MNIST digits with additional levels of complexity added to\nreplicate well the challenges of real-world problems. We present two variants\nof the problem: 'UltraMNIST classification' and 'Budget-aware UltraMNIST\nclassification'. The standard UltraMNIST classification benchmark is intended\nto facilitate the development of novel CNN training methods that make the\neffective use of the best available GPU resources. The budget-aware variant is\nintended to promote development of methods that work under constrained GPU\nmemory. For the development of competitive solutions, we present several\nbaseline models for the standard benchmark and its budget-aware variant. We\nstudy the effect of reducing resolution on the performance and present results\nfor baseline models involving pretrained backbones from among the popular\nstate-of-the-art models.

However, most often this phenomenon does not lead to a complete and\ninverted bandgap formation over the entire Brillouin zone. Here, by\nsystematically breaking the symmetry of a two-dimensional square photonic\ncrystal, we investigate the formation of Dirac points, line node singularities,\nand inverted bandgaps. The formation of this complete bandgap is due to the\nlevel repulsion between degenerate modes along the line nodes of a\nsemimetal-like photonic crystal, over the entire Brillouin zone. Our numerical\nexperimentations are performed by a home-build numerical framework based on a\nmultigrid finite element method.

However, these methods often make strong\nassumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model\nstructure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation.

This common and core interest stimulates extensive studies on\nmodeling TTR. Researchers have developed a range of theories and models of TTR,\nmany of which have been incorporated into transportation models, policies, and\nproject appraisals. Adopting the network perspective, this paper aims to\nprovide an integrated framework for reviewing the methodological developments\nof modeling TTR in transportation networks, including its characterization,\nevaluation and valuation, and traffic assignment. Specifically, the TTR\ncharacterization provides a whole picture of travel time distribution in\ntransportation networks. TTR evaluation and TTR valuation (known as the value\nof reliability, VOR) simply and intuitively interpret abstract characterized\nTTR to be well understood by different stakeholders of transportation systems.\nTTR-based traffic assignment investigates the effects of TTR on the individual\nusers travel behavior and consequently the collective network flow pattern. As\nthe above three topics are mainly separately studied in different disciplines\nand research areas, the integrated framework allows us to better understand\ntheir relationships and may contribute to developing possible combinations of\nTTR modeling philosophy. Also, the network perspective enables to focus on\ncommon challenges of modeling TTR, especially the uncertainty propagation from\nthe uncertainty sources to the TTR at spatial levels including link, route, and\nthe entire network.

In this paper, we investigate the\nrobustness of multimodal neural networks against worst-case (i.e., adversarial)\nperturbations on a single modality. We first show that standard multimodal\nfusion models are vulnerable to single-source adversaries: an attack on any\nsingle modality can overcome the correct information from multiple unperturbed\nmodalities and cause the model to fail. This surprising vulnerability holds\nacross diverse multimodal tasks and necessitates a solution. Motivated by this\nfinding, we propose an adversarially robust fusion strategy that trains the\nmodel to compare information coming from all the input sources, detect\ninconsistencies in the perturbed modality compared to the other modalities, and\nonly allow information from the unperturbed modalities to pass through.

The emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a\npromising approach for multi-agent cooperation through the interaction of the\nagents and environments. However, traditional DRL solutions suffer from the\nhigh dimensions of multiple agents with continuous action space during policy\nsearch. Besides, the dynamicity of agents' policies makes the training\nnon-stationary. To tackle the issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning approach with high-level decision-making and low-level individual\ncontrol for efficient policy search. In particular, the cooperation of multiple\nagents can be learned in high-level discrete action space efficiently. At the\nsame time, the low-level individual control can be reduced to single-agent\nreinforcement learning. In addition to hierarchical reinforcement learning, we\npropose an opponent modeling network to model other agents' policies during the\nlearning process. In contrast to end-to-end DRL approaches, our approach\nreduces the learning complexity by decomposing the overall task into sub-tasks\nin a hierarchical way. To evaluate the efficiency of our approach, we conduct a\nreal-world case study in the cooperative lane change scenario.

This sample,\ncombined with archival observations of three additional sources, enables the\nfirst exploration of the demographics of phosphorus chemistry in low-mass\nprotostars.

The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is\nperformed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of\niterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth\ncorresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the\npotential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted\nquantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models\nfrom the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the\nrobustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 20:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Effective detection of falls can reduce the risk of complications\nand injuries. Fall detection can be performed using wearable devices or ambient\nsensors; these methods may struggle with user compliance issues or false\nalarms. Video cameras provide a passive alternative; however, regular RGB\ncameras are impacted by changing lighting conditions and privacy concerns. From\na machine learning perspective, developing an effective fall detection system\nis challenging because of the rarity and variability of falls. Many existing\nfall detection datasets lack important real-world considerations, such as\nvaried lighting, continuous activities of daily living (ADLs), and camera\nplacement. The lack of these considerations makes it difficult to develop\npredictive models that can operate effectively in the real world. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modality dataset (MUVIM) that\ncontains four visual modalities: infra-red, depth, RGB and thermal cameras.\nThese modalities offer benefits such as obfuscated facial features and improved\nperformance in low-light conditions. We formulated fall detection as an anomaly\ndetection problem, in which a customized spatio-temporal convolutional\nautoencoder was trained only on ADLs so that a fall would increase the\nreconstruction error.

However, they alter\nthe homeostasis of the insect-fungi interaction, modifies the topology of the\ngallery and, more importantly, does not reveal the 100% complex structure made\nby the insect. Therefore, a novel way to study this structure is by imaging the\ngalleries by means of computerized axial tomography (CT). This method allows\nobtaining a three-dimensional representation of the gallery and the pupal\nchambers to be studied, while the wood and insect sample is not disturbed and\ngenerates a high amount of data. The isolation of the galleries and pupal\nchambers from the CT background images is not simple, because there is not\nenough contrast between the grey levels of the galleries and the marks\ngenerated by internal components of the trunk itself.

The problem is important for reducing the onerous\namount of manual effort to post-process possible rendezvous areas using\nsatellite imagery and has many societal applications to improve public safety,\nsecurity, and health. The problem of rendezvous detection is challenging due to\nthe difficulty of interpreting missing data within a trajectory gap and the\nvery high cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data. Most\nrecent literature presents formal models, namely space-time prism, to track an\nobject's rendezvous patterns within trajectory gaps on a spatial network.\nHowever, the bounds derived from the space-time prism are rather loose,\nresulting in unnecessarily extensive post-processing manual effort.

Quantization is a popular method for obtaining lightweight\nCNNs, where the initialization with a pretrained model is widely used to\novercome degraded performance in low-resolution quantization. However, large\nquantization errors between real values and their low-bit quantized ones cause\ndifficulties in achieving acceptable performance for complex networks and large\ndatasets. The proposed training method softly delivers the knowledge of\npretrained models to low-bit quantized models in multiple quantization steps.\nIn each quantization step, the trained weights of a model are used to\ninitialize the weights of the next model with the quantization bit depth\nreduced by one. With small change of the quantization bit depth, the\nperformance gap can be bridged, thus providing better weight initialization. In\ncyclic training, after training a low-bit quantized model, its trained weights\nare used in the initialization of its accurate model to be trained.

Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a\nsingle domain (e.g., politics). However, correlations exist commonly across\nmultiple news domains, and thus it is promising to simultaneously detect fake\nnews of multiple domains. Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in\nmulti-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy\namong domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling\nincompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs\none single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece. In this\npaper, we propose a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection\nFramework (M$^3$FEND) to address these two challenges.

Then, with enriched domain information as input,\na Domain Adapter could adaptively aggregate discriminative information from\nmultiple views for news in various domains.

Most CF methods utilize an encoder to embed users and\nitems into the same representation space, and the Bayesian personalized ranking\n(BPR) loss is usually adopted as the objective function to learn informative\nencoders. Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders\n(e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few\nefforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of\nrepresentations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of\nexisting CF methods and design new learning objectives. In this paper, we\nmeasure the representation quality in CF from the perspective of alignment and\nuniformity on the hypersphere. We first theoretically reveal the connection\nbetween the BPR loss and these two properties. Then, we empirically analyze the\nlearning dynamics of typical CF methods in terms of quantified alignment and\nuniformity, which shows that better alignment or uniformity both contribute to\nhigher recommendation performance. Based on the analyses results, a learning\nobjective that directly optimizes these two properties is proposed, named\nDirectAU. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the\nproposed learning framework with a simple matrix factorization model leads to\nsignificant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art CF methods.\nOur implementations are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/THUwangcy/DirectAU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 07:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

By introducing a non-collinear perturbing pulse to the\ndriving field, the process of IAP generation is modified both spatially and\ntemporally, manifesting as a spatial and a frequency modulation in the harmonic\nspectrum. By using a FROG-like retrieval method, the spatio-spectral phases of\nthe harmonic spectrum are faithfully extracted from the induced spatio-spectral\nmodulations, which allows a thoroughgoing characterization of the IAP in both\ntime and space. With this method, the spatio-temporal structures of the IAP\ngenerated in a two-color driving field in both the near- and far-field are\nfully reconstructed, from which a weak spatio-temporal coupling in the IAP\ngeneration is revealed.

We use Reinforcement Learning\n(RL)-based methods to find the best behaviour of the agent, based on which\nsynthetic population vehicle trajectories can be generated to estimate link\nflows across the whole network.

Most\nrecent works attempt to mitigate the online calculation issue of long\nhistorical behaviors by adopting two-stage methods to balance online efficiency\nand effectiveness.

This\nEssay outlines research on AI that learn structures in policy data that can be\nleveraged for downstream tasks. As a demonstration of the ability of AI to\ncomprehend policy, we provide a case study of an AI system that predicts the\nrelevance of proposed legislation to any given publicly traded company and its\nlikely effect on that company. We believe this represents the \"comprehension\"\nphase of AI and policy, but leveraging policy as a key source of human values\nto align AI requires \"understanding\" policy. Solving the alignment problem is\ncrucial to ensuring that AI is beneficial both individually (to the person or\ngroup deploying the AI) and socially. As AI systems are given increasing\nresponsibility in high-stakes contexts, integrating democratically-determined\npolicy into those systems could align their behavior with human goals in a way\nthat is responsive to a constantly evolving society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 21:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

Lots of programming know-what and\nknow-how knowledge is documented in text, for example, API reference\ndocumentation and programming tutorials. To improve knowledge accessibility and\nusage, several recent studies use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to\nconstruct API know-what knowledge graph (API-KG) and programming task know-how\nknowledge graph (Task-KG) from software documentation. Although being\npromising, current API-KG and Task-KG are independent of each other, and thus\nare void of inherent connections between the two types of knowledge. Our\nempirical study on Stack Overflow questions confirms that only 36% of the API\nusage problems can be answered by the know-how or the know-what knowledge\nalone, while the rest questions require a fusion of both. Inspired by this\nobservation, we make the first attempt to fuse API-KG and Task-KG by API entity\nlinking. This fusion creates nine categories of API semantic relations and two\ntypes of task semantic relations which are not present in the stand-alone\nAPI-KG or Task-KG. According to the definitions of these new API and task\nsemantic relations, our approach dives deeper than the surface-level API\nlinking of API-KG and Task-KG, and infers nine categories of API semantic\nrelations from task descriptions and two types of task semantic relations with\nthe assistance of API-KG, which enrich the declaration or syntactic relations\nin the current API-KG and Task-KG. Our fused and semantically-enriched API-Task\nKG supports coherent API/Task-centric knowledge search by text or code queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 01:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 02:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

At the upper echelons of this realm, the pnictogen and chalcogen\nclass of honeycomb layered oxides have emerged with fascinating crystal\nchemistry and exotic electromagnetic and topological phenomena that muster\nmultifaceted concepts spanning from materials science to condensed matter\nphysics and potential applications in electrochemistry, quantum mechanics and\nelectronics. In a bid to shed light on the mechanisms governing these\nbiomimetic nanostructures, this review highlights the significant milestones\nand breakthroughs that have augmented their current knowledgebase of theory,\nproperties and utilities. Herein, we elucidate the vast promising crystal\nchemistry space against the backdrop of known synthesis and characterisation\ntechniques employed in the development and optimisation of this class of\nmaterials. Further, we highlight key theoretical models that have reinvigorated\nthe exploration and characterisation of honeycomb layered oxides within this\nclass and are poised to redefine the frontiers of material research and their\napplications. We conclude by envisaging future research directions where\nfascinating physicochemical, topological and electromagnetic properties could\nbe lurking and where valiant efforts ought to be inclined, particularly in the\nprospective realisation of exotic material compositional space as well as their\nutility as testing grounds for emergent two-dimensional (2D) topological\nquantum gravity and conformal field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2022 10:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Some of these theories, such as loop quantum gravity (LQG),\npredict that this discreetness could be manifested through Lorentz invariance\nviolations (LIV) over travelling particles at astronomical length distances.\nHowever, reports on LIV are controversial, and space discreetness could still\nbe compatible with Lorentz invariance. Here, it is tested whether space\nquantization on the order of Planck length could still be compatible with\nLorentz invariance through the application of a covariant geometric uncertainty\nprinciple (GeUP) as a constraint over geodesics in FRW geometries. Space time\nline elements compatible with the uncertainty principle are calculated for a\nhomogeneous, isotropic expanding Universe represented by the Friedmann Lemaitre\nRobertson Walker solution to General Relativity (FLRW or FRW metric). A generic\nexpression for the quadratic proper space time line element is derived,\nproportional to Planck length squared, and dependent on two contributions. The\nfirst is associated to the energy time uncertainty, and the second depends on\nthe Hubble function. The results are in agreement with space-time quantization\non the expected length orders, according to quantum gravity theories, and\nwithin experimental constraints on putative LIV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 14:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
