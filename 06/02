Focusing on the finite element\nmethods (conforming, discontinuous Galerkin, etc.), we show that the regular\nconvergence of discrete holomorphic operator functions follows from the\napproximation property of the finite element spaces and the compact convergence\nof the discrete operators in some suitable Sobolev space. The convergence for\neigenvalues is then obtained using the discrete approximation theory for the\neigenvalue problems of holomorphic Fredholm operator functions. The result can\nbe used to show the convergence of various finite element methods for\neigenvalue problems such as the Dirhcilet eigenvalue problem and the biharmonic\neigenvalue problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 16:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 12:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-20"}

Our intended audience is scientists\ninterested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g. the three-body problem). The\nmain directions pursued in this article are: (1) given two periodic orbits,\ndecide when they can be connected by a regular family; (2) use numerical\ninvariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the\npresence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign +/- to each elliptic or hyperbolic\nFloquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, generalizing the classical\nKrein--Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the\nabove in a visual, easily implementable and resource-efficient way. The\nmathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors, where the\n``Broucke stability diagram'' was rediscovered, but further refined with the\nabove signs, and algebraically reformulated in terms of GIT quotients of the\nsymplectic group. The advantage of the above framework is that it applies to\nthe study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. Moreover, in the\ncase where the system admits symmetries in the form of ``reflections'', i.e.\nanti-symplectic involutions, which is the case for many systems of interest,\nthe information provided for orbits which are symmetric is richer, and one may\ndistinguish more symmetric orbits. This is the case for several well-known\nfamilies in the space mission design industry, such as the Halo orbits, which\nare ubiquitous in real-life space missions. We will carry out numerical work\nbased on the cell-mapping method, for the Jupiter-Europa and the\nSaturn-Enceladus systems.

The method proposed is based on repeated\nevolution followed by a measurement on the single accessible qubit, which has\nthe potential to reduce the temperature in the rest of the subsystems, thereby\ndemonstrating cooling in the device. The performance of the refrigerator is\nquantified by the fidelity of each local subsystem with the ground state of the\nlocal Hamiltonian and the corresponding probability of success. We identify\nsystem parameters, which include the interaction strength, range of\ninteractions, initial temperature of each qubit, and the position of the\nmeasured qubit, so that the fidelities of all the unmeasured qubits approach\nunity with a nonvanishing probability.

In this context, we propose\nto study an original concept of a hybrid accelerometer associating a\nstate-of-the-art electrostatic accelerometer (EA) and a promising quantum\nsensor based on cold atom interferometry. To assess the performance potential\nof such instrument, numerical simulations have been performed to determine its\nimpact in term of gravity field retrieval. Taking advantage of the long term\nstability of the cold atom interferometer (CAI), it has been shown that the\nreduced drift of the hybrid sensor could lead to improved gravity field\nretrieval. Nevertheless this gain vanishes once temporal variations of the\ngravity field and related aliasing effects are taken into account. Improved\nde-aliasing models or some specific satellite constellations are then required\nto maximize the impact of the accelerometer performance gain. To evaluate the\nachievable acceleration performance in orbit, a numerical simulator of the\nhybrid accelerometer has been developed and preliminary results are given.

However, practical\napplication as a secondary battery material is currently limited by practical\nissues such as poor cyclability. To better understand these materials, we have\ndeveloped a pseudo-two-dimensional model for conversion cathodes. We apply this\nmodel to FeS2 - a material that undergoes intercalation followed by conversion\nduring discharge. The model is derived from the half-cell Doyle-Fuller-Newman\nmodel with additional loss terms added to reflect the converted shell\nresistance as the reaction progresses. We also account for polydisperse active\nmaterial particles by incorporating a variable active surface area and\neffective particle radius. Using the model, we show that the leading loss\nmechanisms for FeS2 are associated with solid-state diffusion and electrical\ntransport limitations through the converted shell material. The polydisperse\nsimulations are also compared to a monodisperse system, and we show that\npolydispersity has very little effect on the intercalation behavior yet leads\nto capacity loss during the conversion reaction.

The\nimplementation forms a package (the `Hamiltonian Gauge Gravity Surveyor' -\nHiGGS) for the xAct tensor manipulation suite in Mathematica.

Accordingly HiGGS is designed to survey the whole\nLagrangian space with high-performance computing resources (clusters and\nsupercomputers).

The survey spans\npossible configurations of teleparallel-style multiplier fields which might be\nused to kill-off the strongly coupled modes, with the results to be analysed in\nsubsequent work.

In contrast to traditional multi-view\nstereo methods, these approaches tend to produce smoother and more complete\nreconstructions due to the inductive smoothness bias of neural networks.\nState-of-the-art neural implicit methods allow for high-quality reconstructions\nof simple scenes from many input views. Yet, their performance drops\nsignificantly for larger and more complex scenes and scenes captured from\nsparse viewpoints. This is caused primarily by the inherent ambiguity in the\nRGB reconstruction loss that does not provide enough constraints, in particular\nin less-observed and textureless areas. Motivated by recent advances in the\narea of monocular geometry prediction, we systematically explore the utility\nthese cues provide for improving neural implicit surface reconstruction. We\ndemonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by general-purpose monocular\nestimators, significantly improve reconstruction quality and optimization time.\nFurther, we analyse and investigate multiple design choices for representing\nneural implicit surfaces, ranging from monolithic MLP models over single-grid\nto multi-resolution grid representations.

An instance of a clear identification is the\nsynchrotron emission during the very strong flare in GRB160821A, that occurs\nduring the prompt phase at 135 s. Here we show that the distribution of the\nradiating electrons in this flare is initially very narrow, but later develops\na power-law tail of accelerated electrons.

The flare is consistent with a\nlate energy release from the central engine causing an external-shock as it\nencounters a preexisting ring nebula of a progenitor Wolf-Rayet star.\nRelativistic forward and reverse shocks develop, leading to two distinct\nemission zones with similar properties. The particle acceleration only occurs\nin the forward shock, moving into the dense nebula matter.

In offline RL, it is\noften important to prevent a policy from selecting unobserved actions, since\nthe consequence of these actions cannot be presumed without additional\ninformation about the environment. One straightforward way to implement such a\nconstraint is to explicitly model a given data distribution via behavior\ncloning and directly force a policy not to select uncertain actions. However,\nmany offline RL methods instantiate the constraint indirectly -- for example,\npessimistic value estimation -- due to a concern about errors when modeling a\npotentially complex behavior policy. In this work, we argue that it is not only\nviable but beneficial to explicitly model the behavior policy for offline RL\nbecause the constraint can be realized in a stable way with the trained model.\nWe first suggest a theoretical framework that allows us to incorporate\nbehavior-cloned models into value-based offline RL methods, enjoying the\nstrength of both explicit behavior cloning and value learning.

However, due to commonly occurring distributional shifts in training\ndata, ML models constantly get updated in practice, which might render\npreviously generated recourses invalid and diminish end-users trust in our\nalgorithmic framework. To address this problem, we propose RoCourseNet, a\ntraining framework that jointly optimizes for predictions and robust recourses\nto future data shifts. We have three main contributions: (i) We propose a novel\nvirtual data shift (VDS) algorithm to find worst-case shifted ML models by\nexplicitly considering the worst-case data shift in the training dataset. (ii)\nWe leverage adversarial training to solve a novel tri-level optimization\nproblem inside RoCourseNet, which simultaneously generates predictions and\ncorresponding robust recourses.

In addition, even though the capacity region is known,\nthe optimal signaling to achieve the capacity region is unknown. In this paper,\nwe determine one optimal encoding order to achieve every point on the capacity\nregion, and thus reduce the encoding complexity K factorial times. We prove\nthat the optimal decoding order for the K-receiver MIMO wiretap channel is the\nsame as that for the MIMO broadcast channel without secrecy. To be specific,\nthe descending weight ordering in the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization\nproblem determines the optimal encoding order. Next, to reach the border of the\nsecrecy capacity region, we form a WSR maximization problem and apply the block\nsuccessive maximization method to solve this nonconvex problem and find the\ninput covariance matrices corresponding to each message. Numerical results are\nused to verify the optimality of the encoding order and to demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed signaling design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 18:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 21:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

In this article and the\nrelated invited lecture from the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Physical\nSociety's Division of Fluid Dynamics, we describe the collective behavior of\ndrops in a concentrated emulsion by tracking the dynamics and the fate of\nindividual drops within the emulsion. At the slow flow limit of the\nconcentrated emulsion, we observe an unexpected order, where the velocity of\nindividual drops in the emulsion exhibits spatiotemporal periodicity. As the\nflow rate increases, the emulsion transitions from a solid-like to a\nliquid-like material, and the spatiotemporal order in the flow is lost. At the\nfast flow limit, droplet breakup starts to occur. We show that droplet breakup\nwithin the emulsion follows a probability distribution, in stark contrast to\nthe deterministic behavior in classical single-drop studies. In addition to\ncapillary number and viscosity ratio, break-up probability is governed by a\nconfinement factor that measures drop size relative to a characteristic channel\nlength. The breakup probability arises from the time-varying packing\nconfiguration of the drops.

Here, we show that this computational cost can be\nsignificantly reduced by leveraging the cancellation of many-body finite-size\nerrors that accompanies the evaluation of energy differences when calculating\nquantities like binding energies and mapping potential energy surfaces. We test\nthe error cancellation and convergence in two well-known adsorbate/slab\nsystems, H2O/LiH(001) and CO/Pt(111).

We focus on Federated\nLearning (FL) as a canonical application. One of the main challenges of FL is\nthe communication bottleneck between the nodes and the parameter server. A\npopular solution in the literature is to allow each node to do several local\nupdates on the model in each iteration before sending it back to the PS. While\nthis mitigates the communication bottleneck, the statistical heterogeneity of\nthe data owned by the different nodes has proven to delay convergence and bias\nthe model. In this work, we study random walk (RW) learning algorithms for\ntackling the communication and data heterogeneity problems. The main idea is to\nleverage available direct connections among the nodes themselves, which are\ntypically \"cheaper\" than the communication to the PS. In a random walk, the\nmodel is thought of as a \"baton\" that is passed from a node to one of its\nneighbors after being updated in each iteration. The challenge in designing the\nRW is the data heterogeneity and the uncertainty about the data distributions.\nIdeally, we would want to visit more often nodes that hold more informative\ndata. We cast this problem as a sleeping multi-armed bandit (MAB) to design a\nnear-optimal node sampling strategy that achieves variance-reduced gradient\nestimates and approaches sub-linearly the optimal sampling strategy. Based on\nthis framework, we present an adaptive random walk learning algorithm. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our numerical results\nvalidate our theoretical findings and show that our algorithm outperforms\nexisting random walk algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 19:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

However, these\nILP-like methods have not been able to capitalise fully on the rapid hardware,\nsoftware and algorithmic developments fuelling current developments in deep\nneural networks. In this paper, we treat relational features as functions and\nuse the notion of generalised composition of functions to derive complex\nfunctions from simpler ones.

In particular, the dynamics and coupling\nbetween the hydrodynamics, heat release rate and acoustics are compared for\nvarious forcing amplitudes at a fixed forcing frequency $f_f$. The\nhydrodynamics were characterized via laser Mie scattering from droplets in the\nfuel spray, while the heat release rate was qualitatively measured using\nchemiluminescence (CL) emissions in the 312 $\\pm$ 12.5 nm wavelength range,\nboth at 10 kHz. The dynamics at the frequencies of interest were extracted\nusing spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). In the unforced case,\nthe spray and CL oscillations exhibited similar dynamics, dominated by\noscillations at frequency $f_0$, whereas the pressure fluctuations were\npredominantly at $f_P$. As the forcing amplitude was increased from zero, the\nspray and CL exhibited changes in their power spectra characteristic of the\nsuppression route to synchronization. The pressure fluctuations, however, were\nobserved to follow the phase-locking route to synchronization. In contrast with\nexpectations from synchronization theory, the amplitude of the pressure\nfluctuations increased significantly not only after lock-on, but also as the\nfrequency detuning with $f_f$ decreased. It is shown that this increase in\namplitude is not due to intermittency in the frequency of the pressure\noscillations. The simultaneous occurrence of phase-locking and suppression\nillustrates the rich variety of dynamics that can occur in practical combustor\nsystems. In addition, the amplification of the pressure oscillations based on\nthe frequency detuning with the forcing suggests that classical reasoning based\non the Rayleigh Index may not be sufficient to understand the high amplitude\nbehaviour of multimodal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 19:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

We provide such an example proving that the simple combination of\nGradient Descent Ascent (GDA) with adaptive stepsizes can diverge if the\nprimal-dual stepsize ratio is not carefully chosen; hence, a fortiori, such\nadaptive extensions are not parameter-agnostic.

The\nmakeup of an automatic topic identification process consists of creating\ndocument representations and performing classification. However, the\nimplementation of these processes on energetics research imposes new\nchallenges. Energetics datasets contain many scientific terms that are\nnecessary to understand the context of a document but may require more complex\ndocument representations. Secondly, the predictions from classification must be\nunderstandable and trusted by the chemists within the pipeline. In this work,\nwe study the trade-off between prediction accuracy and interpretability by\nimplementing three document embedding methods that vary in computational\ncomplexity. With our accuracy results, we also introduce local interpretability\nmodel-agnostic explanations (LIME) of each prediction to provide a localized\nunderstanding of each prediction and to validate classifier decisions with our\nteam of energetics experts.

In such method, the cluster head of a\ncluster of edges schedules DL training jobs from the edges. Using such\ncentralized scheduling method, the cluster head knows all loads of edges, which\ncan avoid overloading the cluster edges, but the head itself may become\noverloaded. To handle this problem, we propose a multi-agent RL (MARL) system\nthat enables each edge to schedule its jobs using RL. However, without\ncoordination among edges, action collision may occur, in which multiple edges\nschedule tasks to the same edge and make it overloaded. For this reason, we\npropose a system called Shielded ReinfOrcement learning (RL) based DL training\non Edges (SROLE). In SROLE, the shield deployed in an edge checks action\ncollisions and provides alternative actions to avoid collisions. As the central\nshield for entire cluster may become a bottleneck, we further propose a\ndecentralized shielding method, where different shields are responsible for\ndifferent regions in the cluster and they coordinate to avoid action collisions\non the region boundaries. Our emulation and real device experiments show SROLE\nreduces training time by 59% compared to MARL and centralized RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 21:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Recent works\nhave shown significant promise for reconstructing MR images from sparsely\nsampled k-space data using deep learning. In this work, we propose a technique\nthat rapidly estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction time by\nfitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In\nbrief, our algorithm alternates between searching for neighbors in a data set\nthat are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network on\nthese neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our\nreconstruction model is learned on a dataset that is structurally similar to\nthe image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse\ntraining set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle changes in\ntraining sets and flexible scan settings, while being relatively fast. Our\napproach, dubbed LONDN-MRI, was validated on the FastMRI multi-coil knee data\nset using deep unrolled reconstruction networks.

The traditional game theory\nassumes that individuals can acquire their neighbor's information without cost\nafter generating information. In fact, the environment and cognition of\npopulations often limit the magnitude of information received by individuals.\nOur model divides information dynamics into two processes: generation and\ndissemination. After generating, information starts to disseminate in the\npopulation. Individuals match and interact with each other based on the\ninformation received and then confirm partnerships, which differs from\ntraditional research's unilateral partner selection process. Specifically, we\nfind a function to simulate two constraints of information acquisition in\ndifferent populations: information dissemination cost and cognition competence.\nThese two kinds of constraints affect the choice of partnership and then the\nevolution of cooperation. The game evolved under the condition of information\nconstraints. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we find that\ninformation dissemination and cognition underlie the evolution of cooperation.\nThe lower cost of information dissemination and the more valid cognition of\ninformation, the higher level of cooperation. Moreover, deviations in cognition\namong individuals more sensitively determine the equilibrium cooperation\ndensity. As the deviations increase, cooperation density decreases\nsignificantly. This paper provides a new explanation for the diversity of\ncooperation among populations with different information dissemination costs\nand cognition competence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 22:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 06:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

To address this issue, we propose local masked\nreconstruction (LoMaR), a simple yet effective approach that performs masked\nreconstruction within a small window of 7$\\times$7 patches on a simple\nTransformer encoder, improving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy\ncompared to global masked reconstruction over the entire image. Extensive\nexperiments show that LoMaR reaches 84.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nclassification, outperforming MAE by 0.5%. After finetuning the pretrained\nLoMaR on 384$\\times$384 images, it can reach 85.4% top-1 accuracy, surpassing\nMAE by 0.6%.

For stochastic diffusive\nmotion, the effect of topology is expected to have a drastically stronger\nimpact, but the predicted even qualitative impact has not been demonstrated.\nThe required tuning of the topology to achieve zero effective topological\ncharge can be achieved using antiferromagnetic skyrmions.

A single-pulse analysis in the MWA's\n140-170 MHz band also reveals a complex sub-pulse drifting behavior, including\nboth rapid changes of the drift rate characteristic of mode switching pulsars,\nas well as a slow, consistent evolution of the drift rate within modes. In some\nlonger drift sequences, interruptions in the otherwise smooth drift rate\nevolution occur preferentially at a particular phase, typically lasting a few\npulses. These properties make this pulsar an ideal test bed for prevailing\nmodels of drifting behavior such as the carousel model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 00:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

There has recently been renewed\ninterest in using data-driven approaches to improve camera noise models via\nneural networks. These data-driven approaches target noise present in the\nraw-sensor image before it has been processed by the camera's image signal\nprocessor (ISP). Modeling noise in the RAW-rgb domain is useful for improving\nand testing the in-camera denoising algorithm; however, there are situations\nwhere the camera's ISP does not apply denoising or additional denoising is\ndesired when the RAW-rgb domain image is no longer available. In such cases,\nthe sensor noise propagates through the ISP to the final rendered image encoded\nin standard RGB (sRGB). The nonlinear steps on the ISP culminate in a\nsignificantly more complex noise distribution in the sRGB domain and existing\nraw-domain noise models are unable to capture the sRGB noise distribution. We\npropose a new sRGB-domain noise model based on normalizing flows that is\ncapable of learning the complex noise distribution found in sRGB images under\nvarious ISO levels.

Leveraging results from deep\nlearning theory based on loss landscape curvature, we ask: how do\nbiologically-plausible gradient approximations affect generalization? We first\ndemonstrate that state-of-the-art biologically-plausible learning rules for\ntraining RNNs exhibit worse and more variable generalization performance\ncompared to their machine learning counterparts that follow the true gradient\nmore closely. Next, we verify that such generalization performance is\ncorrelated significantly with loss landscape curvature, and we show that\nbiologically-plausible learning rules tend to approach high-curvature regions\nin synaptic weight space. Using tools from dynamical systems, we derive\ntheoretical arguments and present a theorem explaining this phenomenon.

Soft X-rays of sub-keV energy suffer from large\nphotoelectric absorption originating from the local SN environment with\n$NH_{\\rm int}(t)\\approx3\\times 10^{22}(t/400\n\\,\\rm{days})^{-1.4}\\,\\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We interpret these findings as the result\nof the interaction of the SN shock with a dense ($n\\approx\n10^{5}-10^{6}\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}$), H-rich disk-like circumstellar medium (CSM) with\ninner radius $\\sim2\\times 10^{16}$ cm and extending to $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm. Based\non the declining $NH_{\\rm int}(t)$ and X-ray luminosity evolution, we infer a\nCSM mass of $\\sim(1.2\\,f$--2.0$\\sqrt{f}) \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, where $f$ is the\nvolume filling factor. Finally, we place SN\\,2014C in the context of 119\ncore-collapse SNe with evidence for strong shock interaction with a thick\ncircumstellar medium and we highlight the challenges that the current mass-loss\ntheories (including wave-driven mass loss, binary interaction and line-driven\nwinds) face when interpreting the wide dynamic ranges of CSM parameters\ninferred from observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 02:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-16"}

To handle this problem, we propose a novel task-level\ndisentanglement generation framework based on the Disentangled Generation\nNetwork (DGNet), which disentangles the generation into the text generation and\nbackground generation in an end-to-end manner to effectively ensure diversity\nand integrity, for robust enlarged license plate recognition. Extensive\nexperiments on the created dataset are conducted, and we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in three representative text recognition\nframeworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 03:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

On the algorithm level, EyeCoD integrates a predict-then-focus\npipeline that first predicts the region-of-interest (ROI) via segmentation and\nthen only focuses on the ROI parts to estimate gaze directions, greatly\nreducing redundant computations and data movements. On the hardware level, we\nfurther develop a dedicated accelerator that (1) integrates a novel workload\norchestration between the aforementioned segmentation and gaze estimation\nmodels, (2) leverages intra-channel reuse opportunities for depth-wise layers,\nand (3) utilizes input feature-wise partition to save activation memory size.\nOn-silicon measurement validates that our EyeCoD consistently reduces both the\ncommunication and computation costs, leading to an overall system speedup of\n10.95x, 3.21x, and 12.85x over CPUs, GPUs, and a prior-art eye tracking\nprocessor called CIS-GEP, respectively, while maintaining the tracking\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 05:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 18:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

With the rise of\nsatellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and modern machine\nlearning (ML), it is now possible to automate detection of dark vessels day or\nnight, under all-weather conditions. SAR images, however, require a\ndomain-specific treatment and are not widely accessible to the ML community.\nMaritime objects (vessels and offshore infrastructure) are relatively small and\nsparse, challenging traditional computer vision approaches. We present the\nlargest labeled dataset for training ML models to detect and characterize\nvessels and ocean structures in SAR imagery. xView3-SAR consists of nearly\n1,000 analysis-ready SAR images from the Sentinel-1 mission that are, on\naverage, 29,400-by-24,400 pixels each.

Although Transformer was born to\nmodel the long-range dependency on the extracted feature maps, it still suffers\nfrom extreme computational and spatial complexities in processing\nhigh-resolution 3D feature maps.

In a disruption, instabilities can break\nup magnetic surfaces into chaotic field line regions, causing current profile\nrelaxation, as well as a rapid radial transport of heat and particles. Using a\nmean-field helicity transport model implemented in the disruption runaway\nmodeling framework DREAM, we calculate the dynamics of runaway electrons in the\npresence of current relaxation events. In scenarios where flux surfaces remain\nintact in parts of the plasma, a skin current is induced at the boundary of the\nintact magnetic field region. This skin current region becomes an important\ncenter concerning the subsequent dynamics: It may turn into a hot ohmic current\nchannel, or a sizable radially localized runaway beam, depending on the heat\ntransport. If the intact region is in the plasma edge, runaway generation in\nthe counter-current direction can occur, which may develop into a sizable\nreverse runaway beam. Even when the current relaxation extends to the entire\nplasma, the final runaway current density profile can be significantly\naffected, as the induced electric field is reduced in the core and increased in\nthe edge, thereby shifting the center of runaway generation towards the edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 07:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

To address this issue, in this paper, a new concept, namely confidence\nthreshold (CT), is introduced and the reducing of the confidence threshold,\nknown as confidence threshold reduction (CTR), is proven to improve both the\ngeneralization and robustness of the model. Specifically, to reduce the CT for\nnatural training (i.e., for natural training with CTR), we propose a\nmask-guided divergence loss function (MDL) consisting of a cross-entropy loss\nterm and an orthogonal term. The empirical and theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that the MDL loss improves the robustness and generalization of\nthe model simultaneously for natural training. However, the model robustness\nimprovement of natural training with CTR is not comparable to that of\nadversarial training. Therefore, for adversarial training, we propose a\nstandard deviation loss function (STD), which minimizes the difference in the\nprobabilities of the wrong categories, to reduce the CT by being integrated\ninto the loss function of adversarial training.

Matrix profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm\nto perform time series analysis, computes the most similar subsequence for a\ngiven query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low\narithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series\ndata. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the\noff-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix\nprofile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is\nextremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy.\n  In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator\nfor time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High\nBandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile\ncomputation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three\nkey benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of\napplications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic\nprocessing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution\ntime by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses\nbetween the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time\nseries data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and\nenergy-efficient memory access provided by HBM.

The distribution of period ratios between adjacent planets shows an\naccumulation in the vicinity of the resonance, which is not centred on the\nnominal resonance but instead presents an offset slightly exterior to it. Here\nwe extend on previous works by thoroughly exploring the effect of different\ndisc and planet parameters on the resonance offset during the disc migration\nphase. The dynamical study is carried out for several first-order MMRs and for\nboth low-mass Earth-like planets undergoing type-I migration and giant planets\nevolving under type-II migration. We find that the offset varies with time\nduring the migration of the two-planet system along the apsidal corotation\nresonance family. The departure from the nominal resonance increases for higher\nplanetary masses and stronger eccentricity damping. In the Earth to super-Earth\nregime, we find offset values in agreement with the observations when using a\nsophisticated modelling for the planet-disc interactions, where the damping\ntimescale depends on the eccentricity. This dependence causes a feedback which\ninduces an increase of the resonance offsets. Regarding giant planets, the\noffsets of detected planet pairs are well reproduced with a classical\n$K$-factor prescription for the planet-disc interactions when the eccentricity\ndamping rate remains low to moderate.

These diseases recurrently\nundergo acute, unstable, and stable phases, each of which requires a different\ntreatment regimen. However, the correct identification of trajectory phases,\nand thus treatment regimens, is challenging. In this paper, we propose a\ndata-driven, dynamic approach for identifying trajectory phases of chronic\ndiseases and thus suggesting treatment regimens. Specifically, we develop a\nnovel variable-duration copula hidden Markov model (VDC-HMMX). In our VDC-HMMX,\nthe trajectory is modeled as a series of latent states with acute, stable, and\nunstable phases, which are eventually recovered. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our VDC-HMMX model on the basis of a longitudinal study with\n928 patients suffering from low back pain. A myopic classifier identifies\ncorrect treatment regimens with a balanced accuracy of slightly above 70%.

Since its discovery in the 60s, it was believed that\nonly an elliptical or circular polarization could magnetize matter by this\nmagneto-optical phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the generation of an IFE via a\nlinear polarization of light. This new physical concept results from the local\nmanipulation of light by a plasmonic nano-antenna. We demonstrate that a gold\nnanorod excited by a linear polarization generates a non-zero magnetic field by\nIFE when the incident polarization of the light is not parallel to the long\naxis of the rod. We show that this dissymmetry generates hot spots of local\nnon-vanishing spin densities (local elliptical polarization state), introducing\nthe concept of super circular light, allowing this magnetization. Moreover, by\nvarying the angle of the incident linear polarization with respect to the\nnano-antenna, we demonstrate the on-demand flipping of the magnetic field\norientation. Finally, this linear IFE generates a stationary magnetic field 25\ntimes stronger than what a gold nanoparticle produces when excited by a\ncircular polarization and via a classical IFE. The creation of stationary\nmagnetic fields by IFE in a plasmonic nanostructure is nowadays the only\ntechnique allowing the creation of ultra-short, intense magnetic field pulses\nat the nanoscale. Thus, it finds applications in the ultrafast control of\nmagnetic domains with applications not only in data storage technologies but\nalso in research fields such as magnetic trapping, magnetic skyrmion, magnetic\ncircular dichroism, to spin control, spin precession, spin currents, and spin\nwaves, among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 09:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

From this information, we\nextract the optical conductivity for the Holstein polaron and bipolaron with\ndispersive phonons at finite temperatures. For the polaron in the weak and\nintermediate electron-phonon coupling regimes, we analyze the influence of\nphonon dispersion relations on the spectra. For strong electron-phonon\ncoupling, the known result of an asymmetric Gaussian is reproduced for a flat\nphonon band. For a finite phonon bandwidth, the center of the Gaussian is\neither shifted to larger or smaller frequencies, depending on the sign of the\nphonon hopping. We illustrate that this can be well understood by considering\nthe Born-Oppenheimer surfaces. A similar behavior is seen for the bipolaron for\nstrong coupling. For the bipolaron with weak and intermediate coupling\nstrengths and a flat phonon band, we obtain two very different spectra. The\nlatter also has a temperature-dependent resonance at a frequency below the\nphonon frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 11:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 15:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-27"}

The interlayer interactions of these\nbilayers are reported differently in theoretical and experimental studies.\nHerein, we design and investigate bilayer beta12-borophene, by first-principles\ncalculations. Our results show that the interlayer distance of the relaxed\nAA-stacked bilayer is about 2.5 A, suggesting a van der Waals (vdW) interlayer\ninteraction. However, this is not supported by previous experiments, therefore\nby constraining the interlayer distance, we propose a preferred model which is\nclose to experimental records. This preferred model has one covalent interlayer\nbond in every unit cell (single-pillar). Further, we argue that the preferred\nmodel is nothing but the relaxed model under a 2% compression. Additionally, we\ndesigned three substrate-supported bilayers on the Ag, Al, and Au substrates,\nwhich lead to double-pillar structures. Afterward, we investigate the AB\nstacking, which forms covalent bonds in the relaxed form, without the need for\ncompression or substrate. Moreover, phonon dispersion shows that, unlike the AA\nstacking, the AB stacking is stable in freestanding form. Subsequently, we\ncalculate the mechanical properties of the AA and AB stackings. The ultimate\nstrengths of the AA and the AB stackings are 29.72 N/m at 12% strain and 23.18\nN/m at 8% strain, respectively. Moreover, the calculated Young's moduli are 419\nN/m and 356 N/m for the AA and the AB stackings, respectively. These results\nshow the superiority of bilayer borophene over bilayer MoS2 in terms of\nstiffness and compliance. Our results can pave the way for future studies on\nbilayer borophene structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 11:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

While very prominent, this\nparadigm leads to information propagation bottlenecks, as information is\nrepeatedly compressed at intermediary node representations, which causes loss\nof information, making it practically impossible to gather meaningful signals\nfrom distant nodes. To address this, we propose shortest path message passing\nneural networks, where the node representations of a graph are propagated to\neach node in the shortest path neighborhoods. In this setting, nodes can\ndirectly communicate between each other even if they are not neighbors,\nbreaking the information bottleneck and hence leading to more adequately\nlearned representations. Our framework generalizes message passing neural\nnetworks, resulting in a class of more expressive models, including some recent\nstate-of-the-art models. We verify the capacity of a basic model of this\nframework on dedicated synthetic experiments, and on real-world graph\nclassification and regression benchmarks, and obtain state-of-the art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 12:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 20:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 12:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 20:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

For this reason, COOL (Constraint and Object Ordered\nLanguage), a fifth generation programming language proposed in this paper,\novercomes the problems of intuitive semantics, rigorous restrictions on\nhandling problem conditions, and improves the inference ability of previous\nfifth generation programming languages. Specific improvements are as follows:\nFirst, COOL supports process-oriented and object-oriented for easy application\nin production projects; Second, COOL supports expression as function\ndeclaration and function return, which improves language affinity for\nmathematical formulas, and supports embedding function parameters into function\nname strings to make function naming closer to natural languages. Make\nmathematical problems easier to describe; Third, COOL introduces a weighting\nmechanism and accelerates the inference process through cumulative weighting.\nFourth, COOL introduces the concepts of forward and reverse functions in\nprogramming so that computers can infer and execute problems with logical\nsequential constraints. Fifth, the computer can deduce the reverse solution\nprocess by using the forward solution process through the back-tracking\nalgorithm and the dynamic programming algorithm, so that the computer can\ndeduce the problem with time-sequential constraints.

In the research of narrow AI,\nthis seems not a severe problem, since researchers in that field focus on some\nspecific problems as well as one or some aspects of cognition, and the criteria\nfor evaluation are explicitly defined. By contrast, an AGI agent should solve\nproblems that are never-encountered by both agents and developers. However,\nonce a developer tests and debugs the agent with a problem, the\nnever-encountered problem becomes the encountered problem, as a result, the\nproblem is solved by the developers to some extent, exploiting their\nexperience, rather than the agents. This conflict, as we call the trap of\ndevelopers' experience, leads to that this kind of problems is probably hard to\nbecome an acknowledged criterion. In this paper, we propose an evaluation\nmethod named Artificial Open World, aiming to jump out of the trap. The\nintuition is that most of the experience in the actual world should not be\nnecessary to be applied to the artificial world, and the world should be open\nin some sense, such that developers are unable to perceive the world and solve\nproblems by themselves before testing, though after that they are allowed to\ncheck all the data. The world is generated in a similar way as the actual\nworld, and a general form of problems is proposed. A metric is proposed aiming\nto quantify the progress of research.

We report here the detection\ntowards the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 of several nitriles, including cyanic\nacid (HOCN), and three C$_4$H$_3$N isomers (cyanoallene, CH$_2$CCHCN; propargyl\ncyanide, HCCCH$_2$CN; and cyanopropyne (CH$_3$CCCN), and the tentative\ndetections of cyanoformaldehyde (HCOCN), and glycolonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN).

Based on the derived molecular\nabundances of the different nitriles in G+0.693-0.027 and other interstellar\nsources, we have discussed their formation mechanisms in the ISM. We propose\nthat the observed HOCN abundance in G+0.693-0.027 is mainly due to surface\nchemistry and subsequent shock-induced desorption, while HCOCN might be mainly\nformed through gas-phase chemistry. In the case of HOCH$_2$CN, several\ngrain-surface routes from abundant precursors could produce it. The derived\nabundances of the three C$_4$H$_3$N isomers in G+0.693-0.027 are very similar,\nand also similar to those previously reported in the dark cold cloud TMC-1.\nThis suggests that the three isomers are likely formed through gas-phase\nchemistry from common precursors, possibly unsaturated hydrocarbons (CH$_3$CCH\nand CH$_2$CCH$_2$) that react with the cyanide radical (CN). The rich nitrile\nfeedstock found towards G+0.693-0.027 confirms that interstellar chemistry is\nable to synthesize in space molecular species that could drive the prebiotic\nchemistry of the RNA-world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 14:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

These solutions, however, suffer from data\ndependency and are difficult to achieve model generalization. To address this\nproblem, we are inspired by the idea of domain adaptation and propose a\nuniversal learning-based framework, which achieves generalization while\ntraining with limited data. To reduce differences between data distributions, a\ncompressed U-Net is introduced as a domain mapper to map the raw region of\ninterest image onto a target domain. The concentrated target domain is a\nunified feature space for the subsequent matching, in which a local descriptor\nmodel SOSNet is employed to embed patches into descriptors measuring the\nsimilarity of matching pairs. In the proposed framework, the domain mapper is\nan approximation to a specific extraction function thus the training is only a\none-time effort with limited data. Moreover, the local descriptor model can be\ntrained to be representative enough based on a public dataset of\nnon-finger-vein images. The whole pipeline enables the framework to be well\ngeneralized, making it possible to enhance universality and helps to reduce\ncosts of data collection, tuning and retraining. The comparable experimental\nresults to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in five public datasets prove\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the framework shows\napplication potential in other vein-based biometric recognition as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 14:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Signed graphs arise naturally\nin many contexts, including for instance nowhere-zero flows for graphs embedded\nin non-orientable surfaces. For a fixed signed graph $\\widehat{H}$, the list\nhomomorphism problem asks whether an input signed graph $\\widehat{G}$ with\nlists $L(v) \\subseteq V(\\widehat{H}), v \\in V(\\widehat{G}),$ admits a\nhomomorphism $f$ to $\\widehat{H}$ with all $f(v) \\in L(v), v \\in\nV(\\widehat{G})$.

For the Willmore-type energies, the equation is of\nfourth order, whereas it is of order two in the other two cases. We prove that\nthe generating curves coincide for the Willmore-type energies without area\nconstraint and for weighted areas, and the similar result holds for the\ngenerating curves of Willmore-type energies and of the vertical potential\nenergies, after suitable choices of the physical parameters. In all the cases,\ngenerating curves are critical points for a family of energies extending the\nclassical bending energy. In the final section of the paper, we analyze the\nstability of a liquid drop deposited on a horizontal hyperplane with vertical\npotential energies.

If this\npreference is known, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) criterion can be\napplied to aggregate scenarios or objectives into a single function.\nFormulating this preference, however, can be challenging, as we need to make\nexplicit what is usually only implicit knowledge. We explore an\noptimization-based method of preference elicitation for a risk-averse decision\nmaker to identify appropriate non-increasing OWA weights. We follow a\ndata-driven approach, assuming the existence of observations, where the\ndecision maker has chosen the preferred solution, but otherwise remains passive\nduring the elicitation process. We then use these observations to determine the\nunderlying preference by finding the preference vector that is at minimum\ndistance to the polyhedra of feasible vectors for each of the observations.\nUsing our optimization-based model, weights are determined by solving an\nalternating sequence of linear programs and standard OWA problems.

The methodology is then extended to the multiple changepoint\nsetting via both a sliding window method and a more computationally efficient\nscore statistic.

Machine learning\n(ML) refers to approaches whereby statistical algorithms 'learn' from data on\ntheir own, without imposing a priori theories of system behavior. Biological\nsystems -- from molecules, to cells, to entire organisms -- consist of vast\nnumbers of entities, governed by complex webs of interactions that span many\nspatiotemporal scales and exhibit nonlinearity, stochasticity and intricate\ncoupling between entities. The macroscopic properties and collective dynamics\nof such systems are difficult to capture via continuum modelling and mean-field\nformalisms. ABM takes a 'bottom-up' approach that obviates these difficulties\nby enabling one to easily propose and test a set of well-defined 'rules' to be\napplied to the individual entities (agents) in a system. Evaluating a system\nand propagating its state over discrete time-steps effectively simulates the\nsystem, allowing observables to be computed and system properties to be\nanalyzed. Because the rules that govern an ABM can be difficult to abstract and\nformulate from experimental data, there is an opportunity to use ML to help\ninfer optimal, system-specific ABM rules. Once such rule-sets are devised, ABM\ncalculations can generate a wealth of data, and ML can be applied there too --\ne.g., to probe statistical measures that meaningfully describe a system's\nstochastic properties. As an example of synergy in the other direction (from\nABM to ML), ABM simulations can generate realistic datasets for training ML\nalgorithms (e.g., for regularization, to mitigate overfitting).

We provide a theoretical framework that generalizes beyond\nthis typical assumption by modeling label noise as a distribution over feature\nspace. We show that both the scale and the shape of the noise distribution\ninfluence the posterior likelihood; and the shape of the noise distribution has\na stronger impact on classification performance if the noise is concentrated in\nfeature space where the decision boundary can be moved. For the special case of\nuniform label noise (independent of features and the class label), we show that\nthe Bayes optimal classifier for $c$ classes is robust to label noise until the\nratio of noisy samples goes above $\\frac{c-1}{c}$ (e.g. 90% for 10 classes),\nwhich we call the tipping point. However, for the special case of\nclass-dependent label noise (independent of features given the class label),\nthe tipping point can be as low as 50%. Most importantly, we show that when the\nnoise distribution targets decision boundaries (label noise is directly\ndependent on feature space), classification robustness can drop off even at a\nsmall scale of noise. Even when evaluating recent label-noise mitigation\nmethods we see reduced accuracy when label noise is dependent on features.\nThese findings explain why machine learning often handles label noise well if\nthe noise distribution is uniform in feature-space; yet it also points to the\ndifficulty of overcoming label noise when it is concentrated in a region of\nfeature space where a decision boundary can move.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 15:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

In standard applications of ensemble-based data assimilation,\nall realizations in the initial ensemble are generated from the same covariance\nmatrix with the implicit assumption that this covariance is appropriate for the\nproblem. In a hierarchical approach, the parameters of the covariance function,\nfor example the variance, the orientation of the anisotropy and the ranges in\ntwo principal directions, may all be uncertain. Thus, the hierarchical approach\nis much more robust against model misspecification. In this paper, three\napproaches to sampling from the posterior for hierarchical parameterizations\nare discussed: an optimization-based sampling approach (RML), an iterative\nensemble smoother (IES), and a novel hybrid of the previous two approaches\n(hybrid IES). The three approximate sampling methods are applied to a\nlinear-Gaussian inverse problem for which it is possible to compare results\nwith an exact \"marginal-then-conditional\" approach. Additionally, the IES and\nthe hybrid IES methods are tested on a two-dimensional flow problem with\nuncertain anisotropy in the prior covariance.

This\nfacility has been proposed after the measurements reported in 2012 of a\nrelatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$, which raised\nthe possibility of observing potential CP violation in the leptonic sector with\nconventional neutrino beams. The measured value of $\\theta_{13}$ also\nprivileges the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum for the discovery of CP violation\ninstead of the more typically studied $1^{st}$ maximum. The sensitivity at this\n$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum is about three times higher than at the $1^{st}$\none, which implies a reduced influence of systematic errors. Working at the\n$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum requires a very intense neutrino beam with an\nappropriate energy. The world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source,\nthe European Spallation Source (ESS), will have a proton linac operating at\n5\\,MW power, 2\\,GeV kinetic energy and 14~Hz repetition rate (3~ms pulse\nduration, 4\\% duty cycle) for neutron production. In this design study it is\nproposed to double the repetition rate and compress the beam pulses to the\nlevel of microseconds in order to provide an additional 5~MW proton beam for\nneutrino production. The physics performance has been evaluated for such a\nneutrino super beam, in conjunction with a megaton-scale underground water\nCherenkov neutrino detector installed at a distance of 360--550\\,km from ESS.\nThe ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring required for proton-pulse\ncompression, the target station design and optimisation, the near and far\ndetector complexes, and the physics potential of the facility are all described\nin this report.

These novel representational\nconstructs are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing\nwith functionality would represent a major step toward achieving Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 08:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 04:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-18"}

It is observed that introducing intermittency in the interaction\nterm as a function of time or the system state, predictably alters the dynamics\nof the constituent oscillators. Choosing the nature of the interaction -\nattractive or repulsive, allows for either suppression of oscillations or\nstimulation of activity. Two parameters $\\Delta$ and $\\tau$, that reign the\nextent of interaction among subsystems are introduced. They serve as a harness\nto access the entire range of possible behaviours from fixed points to chaos.\nFor fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing $\\Delta$\nand $\\tau$ offers fine control over the dynamics of coupled subsystems. We show\nthis experimentally using coupled Chua's circuits and elucidate their behaviour\nfor a range of coupling parameters through detailed numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 10:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

However, the existing methods, that\nboost the communication efficiency in FL, result in a considerable trade-off\nbetween communication efficiency and global convergence rate. We formulate an\noptimization problem for compression-aided FL, which captures the relationship\nbetween the distortion rate, number of participating IoT devices, and\nconvergence rate. Following that, the objective function is to minimize the\ntotal transmission time for FL convergence. Because the problem is non-convex,\nwe propose to decompose it into sub-problems. Based on the property of a FL\nmodel, we first determine the number of IoT devices participating in the FL\nprocess. Then, the communication between IoT devices and the server is\noptimized by efficiently allocating wireless resources based on a coalition\ngame. Our theoretical analysis shows that, by actively controlling the number\nof participating IoT devices, we can avoid the training divergence of\ncompression-aided FL while maintaining the communication efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 05:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The Deep Learning\nnetwork, the CNN-LSTM model, is a hybrid network architecture which combines\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) layers with long short-term memory (LSTM)\nlayers. 1452 EGM signals from a total of 9 patients undergoing\nclinically-indicated 3D cardiac mapping were used for the training, validation\nand testing of our models.

For comparison, we separately\ndeveloped a rule-based Decision Trees model which attained an accuracy of 67%\nfor the same balanced dataset. Our work elucidates that analysing the EGM\nsignals using a set of explicitly specified rules as proposed by the Decision\nTrees model is not suitable as EGM signals are complex. The CNN-LSTM model, on\nthe other hand, has the ability to learn the complex, intrinsic features within\nthe signals and identify useful features to differentiate the EGM signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 09:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}
