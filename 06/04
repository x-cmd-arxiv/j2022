In that regime, one such critical quantum spin chain is described by\na conformal field theory where the usual Virasoro algebra associated to\nconformal invariance is augmented with a Kac-Moody algebra associated to\nconserved currents. Specifically, we first propose a method to construct\nlattice operators corresponding to the Kac-Moody generators.

The optimizer filters a large set\nof candidate solutions using a two-stage metaheuristic search in from a\npre-filtered set of candidates.

The light curves of\nSN 2020wnt are characterised by an early bump lasting $\\sim5$ days, followed by\na bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of\nM$_{r}^{max}=-20.52\\pm0.03$ mag at $\\sim77.5$ days from explosion. This\nmagnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of SLSNe-I, but\nthe rise-time is one of the longest reported to date.

Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr, but\nits evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the bolometric light curve to\nhydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2020wnt luminosity can be explained by\nradioactive powering. The progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and\nextended star with a pre-SN mass of 80 M$_\\odot$ and a pre-SN radius of 15\nR$_\\odot$ that experiences a very energetic explosion of $45\\times10^{51}$ erg,\nproducing 4 M$_\\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni. In this framework, the first peak results\nfrom a post-shock cooling phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous\nmain peak is due to a large nickel production.

While\nmany excellent uplink schemes have been developed for URA, these schemes do not\nspecify a mechanism for providing feedback regarding whether a user's message\nwas successfully decoded. While this may be acceptable in some MTC scenarios,\nthe lack of feedback is inadequate for applications that demand a high level of\nreliability. However, the problem of providing feedback to active users is\ncomplicated by the fact that the base station does not know the identities of\nthe active users. In this paper, a novel downlink beamforming scheme called\nHashBeam is presented that enables the base station to provide feedback to the\nactive users within URA, despite not knowing their identities. The key idea of\nthis scheme is that the users' channels and hashes of their messages may be\nused as proxies for their true identities. The proposed scheme may be adapted\nto any number of antennas at the base station and it is shown that the required\nnumber of channel uses is linear in the number of users to acknowledge. The\nidea of using channel gains in conjunction with user hashes as discriminating\nattributes of active users is novel and expands the design space of URA\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 16:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Clearly, there is an approximately optimal choice of\nnetwork architecture that is best suited for every meta-learning problem,\nhowever, identifying it beforehand is not straightforward.

However, predicting the severe\nhealth risk for COVID-19 patients including children remains a significant\nchallenge because many underlying medical factors affecting the risk are still\nlargely unknown.

The main source of robustness\nof such stochastic defenses however is often due to the obfuscation of the\ngradients, offering a false sense of security.

Recently, five characteristics have\nbeen identified, which are commonly observed when the improvement in robustness\nis mainly caused by gradient obfuscation.

In this paper, we propose an alternative structured\napproach for compositional generation using diffusion models. An image is\ngenerated by composing a set of diffusion models, with each of them modeling a\ncertain component of the image. To do this, we interpret diffusion models as\nenergy-based models in which the data distributions defined by the energy\nfunctions may be explicitly combined. The proposed method can generate scenes\nat test time that are substantially more complex than those seen in training,\ncomposing sentence descriptions, object relations, human facial attributes, and\neven generalizing to new combinations that are rarely seen in the real world.\nWe further illustrate how our approach may be used to compose pre-trained\ntext-guided diffusion models and generate photorealistic images containing all\nthe details described in the input descriptions, including the binding of\ncertain object attributes that have been shown difficult for DALLE-2.

This leads to severely sub-optimal\nrobustness guarantees as the dimension of the problem increases. We then show\nthat it is theoretically possible to bypass this issue by collecting more\ninformation about the classifier. More precisely, we show that it is possible\nto approximate the optimal certificate with arbitrary precision, by probing the\ndecision boundary with several noise distributions. Since this process is\nexecuted at certification time rather than at test time, it entails no loss in\nnatural accuracy while enhancing the quality of the certificates.

One way to access the\nbulk of protostellar activity within star-forming clusters is to trace\nsignposts of active star formation with emission from molecular outflows. These\noutflows are bright in water emission, providing a direct observational link\nbetween nearby and distant galaxies. We propose to utilize the knowledge of\nlocal star formation as seen with molecular tracers to explore the nature of\nstar formation in the Universe. We present a large-scale statistical galactic\nmodel of emission from galactic active star-forming regions. Our model is built\non observations of well-resolved nearby clusters. By simulating emission from\nmolecular outflows, which is known to scale with mass, we create a proxy that\ncan be used to predict the emission from clustered star formation at galactic\nscales. We evaluated the impact of the most important global-star formation\nparameters (i.e., initial stellar mass function (IMF), molecular cloud mass\ndistribution, star formation efficiency (SFE), and free-fall time efficiency)\non simulation results. We observe that for emission from the para-H2O 202 - 111\nline, the IMF and molecular cloud mass distribution have a negligible impact on\nthe emission, both locally and globally, whereas the opposite holds for the SFE\nand free-fall time efficiency. Moreover, this water transition proves to be a\nlow-contrast tracer of star formation. The fine-tuning of the model and\nadaptation to morphologies of distant galaxies should result in realistic\npredictions of observed molecular emission and make the galaxy-in-a-box model a\ntool to analyze and better understand star formation throughout cosmological\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Such instability\ncan be tempered by the frictional forces acting on the planets from gaseous\ndiscs. A similar situation applies to stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN\ndiscs around supermassive black holes. In this paper, we use $N$-body\nintegrations to evaluate how the frictional damping of orbital eccentricity\naffects the growth of dynamical instability for a wide range of planetary\nspacing and planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that the stability of a system\ndepends on the damping timescale $\\tau$ relative to the zero-friction\ninstability growth timescale $t_{\\rm inst}$. In a two-planet system, the\nfrictional damping can stabilise the dynamical evolution if $t_{\\rm\ninst}\\gtrsim\\tau$. With three planets, $t_{\\rm inst} \\gtrsim 10\\tau - 100\\tau$\nis needed for stabilisation. When the separations between the planetary orbits\nare sufficiently small, $t_{\\rm inst}$ can be less than the synodic period\nbetween the planets, which makes frictional stabilisation unlikely to occur. As\nthe orbital spacing increases, the instability timescale tends to grow\nexponentially on average, but it can vary by a few orders of magnitude\ndepending on the initial orbital phases of the planets. In general, the stable\nregion (at large orbital spacings) and unstable region (at small orbital\nspacings) are separated by a transition zone, in which the (in)stability of the\nsystem is not guaranteed. We also devise a linear map to analyse the dynamical\ninstability of the \"planet + test-mass\" system, and we find qualitatively\nsimilar results to the $N$-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In 1952,\nAlan Turing proposed an elegant mechanism for pattern formation based on\nspontaneous breaking of the spatial translational symmetry in the underlying\nreaction-diffusion system. Much is understood about dynamics and structure of\nTuring patterns. However, little is known about the energetic cost of Turing\npattern. Here, we study nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a small spatially\nextended biochemical reaction-diffusion system by using analytical and\nnumerical methods. We find that the onset of Turing pattern requires a minimum\nenergy dissipation to drive the nonequilibrium chemical reactions. Above onset,\nonly a small fraction of the total energy expenditure is used to overcome\ndiffusion for maintaining the spatial pattern. We show that the positioning\nerror decreases as energy dissipation increases following the same tradeoff\nrelationship between timing error and energy cost in biochemical oscillatory\nsystems. In a finite system, we find that a specific Turing pattern exists only\nwithin a finite range of total molecule number, and energy dissipation broadens\nthe range, which enhances the robustness of the Turing pattern against molecule\nnumber fluctuations in living cells. These results are verified in a realistic\nmodel of the Muk system underlying DNA segregation in E. coli, and testable\npredictions are made for the dependence of the accuracy and robustness of the\nspatial pattern on the ATP/ADP ratio. In general, the theoretical framework\ndeveloped here can be applied to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics of\nspatially extended biochemical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 18:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

One useful probe for studying the magnetic field component parallel\nto the line of sight (LoS) is Faraday rotation of linearly polarized radio\nsynchrotron emission, combined with H$\\alpha$ observations. HII regions are the\nperfect laboratories to probe such magnetic fields as they are localized in\nspace, and are well-defined sources often with known distances and measurable\nelectron densities. We chose the HII region Sharpless 2-27 (Sh 2-27). By using\na map of the magnetic field strength along the LoS ($B_{\\parallel}$) for the\nfirst time, we investigate the basic statistical properties of the turbulent\nmagnetic field inside Sh 2-27. We study the scaling of the magnetic field\nfluctuations, compare it to the Kolmogorov scaling, and attempt to find an\nouter scale of the turbulent magnetic field fluctuations. We estimate the\nmedian value of $n_e$ as $7.3\\pm0.1$ cm$^{-3}$, and the median value of\n$B_{\\parallel}$ as $-4.5\\pm0.1$ $\\mu$G, which is comparable to the magnetic\nfield strength in diffuse ISM. The slope of the structure function of the\nestimated $B_{\\parallel}$-map is found to be slightly steeper than Kolmogorov,\nconsistent with our Gaussian-random-field $B_{\\parallel}$ simulations revealing\nthat an input Kolmogorov slope in the magnetic field results in a somewhat\nsteeper slope in $B_{\\parallel}$. These results suggest that the lower limit to\nthe outer scale of turbulence is 10 pc in the HII region, which is comparable\nto the size of the computation domain. This may indicate that the turbulence\nprobed here could actually be cascading from the larger scales in the ambient\nmedium, associated with the interstellar turbulence in the general ISM, which\nis illuminated by the presence of Sh 2-27.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 19:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The gradient structure is associated with\nconservation of invariants or with dissipation and hence plays a crucial role\nin the description of the physical properties of the system. Traditional\nhyper-reduction of nonlinear gradient fields yields efficient approximations\nthat, however, lack the gradient structure. We focus on Hamiltonian gradients\nand we propose to first decompose the nonlinear part of the Hamiltonian, mapped\ninto a suitable reduced space, into the sum of d terms, each characterized by a\nsparse dependence on the system state. Then, the hyper-reduced approximation is\nobtained via discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) of the Jacobian of the\nderived d-valued nonlinear function. The resulting hyper-reduced model retains\nthe gradient structure and its computationally complexity is independent of the\nsize of the full model. Moreover, a priori error estimates show that the\nhyper-reduced model converges to the reduced model and the Hamiltonian is\nasymptotically preserved. Whenever the nonlinear Hamiltonian gradient is not\nglobally reducible, i.e. its evolution requires high-dimensional DEIM\napproximation spaces, an adaptive strategy is performed. This consists in\nupdating the hyper-reduced Hamiltonian via a low-rank correction of the DEIM\nbasis. Numerical tests demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach\nto general nonlinear operators and runtime speedups compared to the full and\nthe reduced models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 19:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Despite its quick embracement by the medical imaging community,\nits performance suffers on complicated datasets. The problem can be ascribed to\nits simple feature extracting blocks: encoder/decoder, and the semantic gap\nbetween encoder and decoder. Variants of U-Net (such as R2U-Net) have been\nproposed to address the problem of simple feature extracting blocks by making\nthe network deeper, but it does not deal with the semantic gap problem. On the\nother hand, another variant UNET++ deals with the semantic gap problem by\nintroducing dense skip connections but has simple feature extraction blocks. To\novercome these issues, we propose a new U-Net based medical image segmentation\narchitecture R2U++. In the proposed architecture, the adapted changes from\nvanilla U-Net are: (1) the plain convolutional backbone is replaced by a deeper\nrecurrent residual convolution block. The increased field of view with these\nblocks aids in extracting crucial features for segmentation which is proven by\nimprovement in the overall performance of the network. (2) The semantic gap\nbetween encoder and decoder is reduced by dense skip pathways. These pathways\naccumulate features coming from multiple scales and apply concatenation\naccordingly. The modified architecture has embedded multi-depth models, and an\nensemble of outputs taken from varying depths improves the performance on\nforeground objects appearing at various scales in the images. The performance\nof R2U++ is evaluated on four distinct medical imaging modalities: electron\nmicroscopy (EM), X-rays, fundus, and computed tomography (CT).

Periodic\nvaccination could counteract this decline in protection. In the present work,\nour aim was to develop and explore a model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with\nvaccination, reinfection and breakthrough infection. A modified deterministic\nSIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model represented by a system of\ndifferential equations was designed. As in any SIS model, the population was\ndivided into susceptible and infected individuals. But in our design,\nsusceptible individuals were, in turn, grouped into three consecutive\ncategories whose susceptibility increases with time after infection or\nvaccination. The model was studied by means of computer simulations, which were\nanalysed qualitatively. The results obtained show that the prevalence, after\noscillating between peaks and valleys, reaches a plateau phase. Moreover, as\nmight be expected, the magnitude of the peaks and plateaus increases as the\ninfection rate rises, the vaccination rate decreases and the rate of decay of\nprotection conferred by vaccination or previous infection increases. Therefore,\nthe present study suggests that, at least under certain conditions, the spread\nof SARS-CoV-2, although it could experience fluctuations, would finally evolve\ninto an endemic form, with a more or less stable prevalence that would depend\non the levels of infection and vaccination, and on the kinetics of\npost-infection and post-vaccination protection. However, it should be kept in\nmind that our development is a theoretical scheme with many limitations. For\nthis reason, its predictions should be considered with great care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 20:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Classical regression models for mixture experiments\nare widely used in industry, however, when the assumption of constant variance\nis not satisfied, the building of procedures that allow minimizing the\nvariability becomes necessary and other methods of statistical modeling should\nbe considered. In this article, we use the class of generalized linear models\n(GLMs) to build statistical models in mixture experiments.

Trojan asteroids\nco-orbit the Sun with a planet but remain bound to the Lagrange points, L4\n(60{\\deg} leading the planet) or L5 (60{\\deg} trailing). In the circular\nthree-body approximation, the stability of a Trojan asteroid depends on the\nratio of the host planet mass and the central mass. For the inner planets, the\nrange of stability becomes increasingly small, so perturbations from the\nplanets have made primordial Trojans rare. To date there have been just two\nETAs (2010 TK7 and 2020 XL5), several Mars Trojans, and a Venus Trojan\ndiscovered. The estimated lifetimes of the known inner system Trojans are less\nthan a million years, suggesting they are interlopers rather than members of a\nstable and long-lasting population.

We also show correlations between ETA\nejections and the periods of the Milankovitch cycles.

For the\nquality-of-service (QoS) problem, by utilizing the optimal multicast\nbeamforming structure obtained recently in [2], we convert the original problem\ninto a non-convex weight optimization problem of a lower dimension and propose\ntwo fast first-order algorithms to solve it. Both algorithms are based on\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) and provide fast iterative updates to\nsolve each SCA subproblem. The first algorithm uses a saddle point\nreformulation in the dual domain and applies the extragradient method with an\nadaptive step-size procedure to find the saddle point with simple closed-form\nupdates. The second algorithm adopts the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) method by converting each SCA subproblem into a favorable\nADMM structure. The structure leads to simple closed-form ADMM updates, where\nthe problem in each update block can be further decomposed into parallel\nsubproblems of small sizes, for which closed-form solutions are obtained. We\nalso propose efficient initialization methods to obtain favorable initial\npoints that facilitate fast convergence. Furthermore, taking advantage of the\nproposed fast algorithms, for the max-min fair (MMF) problem, we propose a\nsimple closed-form scaling scheme that directly uses the solution obtained from\nthe QoS problem, avoiding the conventional computationally expensive method\nthat iteratively solves the inverse QoS problem. We further develop lower and\nupper bounds on the performance of this scaling scheme.

Large-scale online programming contests attract millions of\nexperienced programmers to compete against each other. Competition-level\nprogramming problems are challenging in nature, and participants often fail to\nsolve the problem on their first attempt. Some online platforms for competitive\nprogramming allow programmers to practice on competition-level problems as\nwell, and the standard feedback for an incorrect practice submission is the\nfirst test case that the submission fails. Often, the failed test case does not\nprovide programmers with enough information to resolve the errors in their\ncode, and they abandon the problem after several more unsuccessful attempts.\n  We present Clef, the first data-driven tool that can generate feedback on\ncompetition-level code automatically by repairing programmers' incorrect\nsubmissions. The key development is that Clef can learn how to generate repairs\nfor incorrect submissions by examining the repairs that other programmers made\nto their own submissions over time. Since the differences between an incorrect\nprogram and a correct program for the same task may be significant, we\nintroduce a new data structure, merge trees, to capture the changes between\nsubmissions. Merge trees are versatile: they can encode both large\nalgorithm-level redesigns and small statement-level alterations. Clef applies\nthe patterns it learns from a database of submissions to generate repairs for\nnew submissions outside the database. We evaluated Clef on six real-world\nproblems from Codeforces, the world's largest platform for competitive\nprogramming. Clef achieves 42.1% accuracy in repairing programmers' incorrect\nsubmissions. Even when given incorrect submissions from programmers who never\nfound the solution to a problem on their own, Clef repairs the users' programs\n34.1% of the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 22:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In this work, we explore\na sparsity and dictionary learning-based approach and present a novel\nself-supervised learning method for single-image denoising where the noise is\napproximated as a Poisson process, requiring no clean ground-truth data.\nSpecifically, we approximate traditional iterative optimization algorithms for\nimage denoising with a recurrent neural network that enforces sparsity with\nrespect to the weights of the network. Since the sparse representations are\nbased on the underlying image, it is able to suppress the spurious components\n(noise) in the image patches, thereby introducing implicit regularization for\ndenoising tasks through the network structure. Experiments on two bio-imaging\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM. Our qualitative results demonstrate that,\nin addition to higher performance on standard quantitative metrics, we are able\nto recover much more subtle details than other compared approaches.

It is also shown in that work that for small\nrotationally-symmetric perturbations of the initial embeddings that are\nsufficiently far away from the tip, MCF develops Type-I \"neckpinch\"\nsingularities.\n  In this work, we again use numerical simulations to show that MCF subject to\ninitial perturbations that are not rotationally symmetric behaves\nasymptotically like it does for rotationally-symmetric perturbations. In\nparticular, if we impose sinusoidal angular dependence on the initial\nembeddings, we find that for perturbations near the tip, evolutions by MCF\nasymptotically lose their angular dependence -- becoming round -- and develop\nType-II bowl soliton singularities. As well, if we impose sinusoidal angular\ndependence on the initial embeddings for perturbations sufficiently far from\nthe tip, the angular dependence again disappears as Type-I neckpinch\nsingularities develop. The numerical analysis carried out in this work is an\nadaptation of the \"overlap\" method introduced in [GIKW21] and permits angular\ndependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 03:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Our results implicate that volcano\neruption could indirectly affect the satellite communication links in the\nregion more than ten thousand kilometers away.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 04:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In real-world\nproblems, however, a significant fraction of actually occurring data vectors\nwill be located in a boundary zone between or outside of all categories, so\nthat perfect classification cannot even in principle be achieved.

However, the meta-learner is\nprone to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be\nidentified as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Moreover, when handling the\ndata with noisy labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label\nnoise on a corrupted dataset. To address these two challenges, we present\nEigen-Reptile (ER) that updates the meta-parameters with the main direction of\nhistorical task-specific parameters to alleviate sampling and label noise.\nSpecifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of\nthe calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps instead of the\nnumber of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main direction for\nEigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose\nIntrospective Self-paced Learning (ISPL).

Clinical\nsetting: This study designs an image exchange system in the private dental\nsector of Urmia city using user-centered methods and prototyping. Methods:\nInformation was collected based on each stage's software development life\ncycle. Interviews and observations were used to gather user-needs data, such as\nobject-oriented programming for developing a Prototype. Results: The users'\nneeds were determined to consider at the beginning. Ease of use, security, and\nmobile apps were their most essential needs. Then, the prototype was designed\nand evaluated in the focus group session. These steps continued until users\nwere satisfied in the focus group. Eventually, after the users' consent, the\nprototype became the final system. Discussion: Instant access to Information,\nvolunteering, user interface design, and usefulness were the most critical\nvariables users considered. The advantage of this system also includes less\nradiation to the patient due to not losing and missing the clips of the\npatient's images. Conclusion: The success of such a system requires the\nconsideration of end-users needs and their application to the system. In\naddition to this system, having an electronic health record can improve the\ntreatment process and improve the work of the medical staff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 11:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

This problem of influence maximization (IM) has wide application, belongs\nto subset problems, and is NP-hard. To solve it, we should theoretically\nexamine all seed sets and evaluate their influence spreads, which is\ntime-consuming. Therefore, metaheuristic strategies are generally employed to\ngain a good seed set within a reasonable time. We observe that many algorithms\nfor the IM problem only adopt a uniform mechanism in the whole solution search\nprocess, which lacks a response measure when the algorithm becomes trapped in a\nlocal optimum.

After applying modal\ndecomposition, the stabilizing law is based on a transformation for the ODE\nsystem corresponding to the comparatively unstable modes into a target one,\nwhere calculation of the stabilization law is independent of the arbitrarily\nlarge number of them. This is achieved by solving generalized Sylvester\nequations recursively.

When writing a report,\nophthalmologists make inferences with prior clinical knowledge. This knowledge\nhas been neglected in prior medical report generation methods. To endow models\nwith the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal\nclinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in\nwhich clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior\nknowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge\nNoise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general\nbiomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the\nspecific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for\nknowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual\nfeatures from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design\nan automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing\nto obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training\nreports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph\nfrom the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features.\nThen visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the\nimpact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal\nfeatures via a Transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on the large-scale\nFFA-IR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CGT is able to outperform\nprevious benchmark methods and achieve state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 13:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In this study, the Morris\nMethod sensitivity analysis is performed on multiple quantities of interest to\nassess the sensitivity of a steady-state groundwater flow model to uncertain\ninput parameters. The Morris Method determines which of these parameters are\nless influential on model outputs. Uninfluential parameters can be set constant\nduring subsequent parameter optimization to reduce computational expense.\nCombining multiple quantities of interest (e.g., RMSE, groundwater fluxes) when\nperforming both the Morris Method and parameter optimization offers a more\ncomplete assessment of groundwater models, providing a more reliable and\nphysically consistent estimate of uncertain parameters.

Compared with supervised\nlearning, more aggressive augmentations have been introduced to further improve\nthe diversity of training pairs. However, aggressive augmentations may distort\nimages' structures leading to a severe semantic shift problem that augmented\nviews of the same image may not share the same semantics, thus degrading the\ntransfer performance. To address this problem, we propose a new SSL paradigm,\nwhich counteracts the impact of semantic shift by balancing the role of weak\nand aggressively augmented pairs. Specifically, semantically inconsistent pairs\nare of minority and we treat them as noisy pairs. Note that deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) have a crucial memorization effect that DNNs tend to first\nmemorize clean (majority) examples before overfitting to noisy (minority)\nexamples. Therefore, we set a relatively large weight for aggressively\naugmented data pairs at the early learning stage. With the training going on,\nthe model begins to overfit noisy pairs. Accordingly, we gradually reduce the\nweights of aggressively augmented pairs. In doing so, our method can better\nembrace the aggressive augmentations and neutralize the semantic shift problem.\nExperiments show that our model achieves 73.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nwith ResNet-50 for 200 epochs, which is a 2.5% improvement over BYOL.

Conventional cytometers assume that\nindividual measurements are well characterized by simple properties such as the\nsignal area, width, and height. However, these approaches have difficulty\ndistinguishing inherent biological variability from instrument artifacts and\noperating conditions. As a result, it is challenging to quantify uncertainty in\nthe properties of individual cells and perform tasks such as doublet\ndeconvolution. We address these problems via signals analysis techniques that\nuse scale transformations to: (I) separate variation in biomarker expression\nfrom effects due to flow conditions and particle size; (II) quantify\nreproducibility associated with a given laser interrogation region; (III)\nestimate uncertainty in measurement values on a per-event basis; and (IV)\nextract the singlets that make up a multiplet. The key idea behind this\napproach is to model how variable operating conditions deform the signal shape\nand then use constrained optimization to \"undo\" these deformations for measured\nsignals; residuals to this process characterize reproducibility.

In this paper, we direct an arbitrary initial mixed\nstate of two and four qubits, which is interacting with its environment, into a\nmaximally entangled state . We use QASM simulator and also an IBM Q real\nprocessor, with and without errors mitigating, to investigate the effect of the\nnoise on the preparation of the initial mixed state of the qubits in addition\nto the population of the target state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 16:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}
