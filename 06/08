Existing methods typically adopt\nthe $\\ell_p$ type robust norm to measure the alignment error and regularize the\nsmoothness of deformation, and use a proximal algorithm to solve the resulting\nnon-smooth optimization problem. However, the slow convergence of such\nalgorithms limits their wide applications. In this paper, we propose a\nformulation for robust non-rigid registration based on a globally smooth robust\nnorm for alignment and regularization, which can effectively handle outliers\nand partial overlaps. The problem is solved using the majorization-minimization\nalgorithm, which reduces each iteration to a convex quadratic problem with a\nclosed-form solution. We further apply Anderson acceleration to speed up the\nconvergence of the solver, enabling the solver to run efficiently on devices\nwith limited compute capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for non-rigid alignment between two shapes with\noutliers and partial overlaps, with quantitative evaluation showing that it\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of registration accuracy and\ncomputational speed.

Deformable image registration (DIR) is\noften used to propagate the manual contours on the planning CT (pCT) of the\nsame patient to CBCT.

However, it is unclear whether using multiple frames is\nbeneficial to downstream tasks, and if yes, whether the performance gain is\nworth the drastically-increased computation and memory costs resulting from\nusing more frames. In this work, we explore single-frame models for\nvideo-and-language learning. On a diverse set of video-and-language tasks\n(including text-to-video retrieval and video question answering), we show the\nsurprising result that, with large-scale pre-training and a proper frame\nensemble strategy at inference time, a single-frame trained model that does not\nconsider temporal information can achieve better performance than existing\nmethods that use multiple frames for training. This result reveals the\nexistence of a strong \"static appearance bias\" in popular video-and-language\ndatasets. Therefore, to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of\nvideo-and-language models, we propose two new retrieval tasks based on existing\nfine-grained action recognition datasets that encourage temporal modeling.

Existing\nvideo generation methods often fail to produce new content as a function of\ntime while maintaining consistencies expected in real environments, such as\nplausible dynamics and object persistence. A common failure case is for content\nto never change due to over-reliance on inductive biases to provide temporal\nconsistency, such as a single latent code that dictates content for the entire\nvideo. On the other extreme, without long-term consistency, generated videos\nmay morph unrealistically between different scenes. To address these\nlimitations, we prioritize the time axis by redesigning the temporal latent\nrepresentation and learning long-term consistency from data by training on\nlonger videos. To this end, we leverage a two-phase training strategy, where we\nseparately train using longer videos at a low resolution and shorter videos at\na high resolution.

Subsequent optical emission\ncaptured the fading ejecta alongside a persistent narrow line emission spectrum\nfrom the accretion disk. Ongoing hard X-ray emission is characteristic of a\nstanding accretion shock in an intermediate polar.

The problem is\napproachable in constrained environments where there is ample prior knowledge\nof the environment layout and manipulatable objects. The challenge is in\nbuilding systems that scale beyond specific situational instances and\ngracefully operate in novel conditions. In the past, researchers used heuristic\nand simple rule-based strategies to accomplish tasks such as scene segmentation\nor reasoning about occlusion. These heuristic strategies work in constrained\nenvironments where a roboticist can make simplifying assumptions about\neverything from the geometries of the objects to be interacted with, level of\nclutter, camera position, lighting, and a myriad of other relevant variables.\nThe work in this thesis will demonstrate how to build a system for robotic\nmobile manipulation that is robust to changes in these variables. This\nrobustness will be enabled by recent simultaneous advances in the fields of big\ndata, deep learning, and simulation. The ability of simulators to create\nrealistic sensory data enables the generation of massive corpora of labeled\ntraining data for various grasping and navigation-based tasks.

For an adequate modelling, the coupling\nbetween rate-dependent stiffness, dissipative mechanisms present in the bulk\nmaterial and crack driving force has to be accounted for in an appropriate\nmanner. In addition, the fracture toughness, i.e. the resistance against crack\npropagation, can depend on rate of deformation. In this contribution, an\nenergetic phase-field model of rate-dependent fracture at finite deformation is\npresented. For the deformation of the bulk material, a formulation of finite\nviscoelasticity is adopted with strain energy densities of Ogden type assumed.\nThe unified formulation allows to study different expressions for the fracture\ndriving force. Furthermore, a possibly rate-dependent toughness is\nincorporated. The model is calibrated using experimental results from the\nliterature for an elastomer and predictions are qualitatively and\nquantitatively validated against experimental data. Predictive capabilities of\nthe model are studied for monotonic loads as well as creep fracture.\nSymmetrical and asymmetrical crack patterns are discussed and the influence of\na dissipative fracture driving force contribution is analysed. It is shown\nthat, different from ductile fracture of metals, such a driving force is not\nrequired for an adequate simulation of experimentally observable crack paths\nand is not favourable for the description of failure in viscoelastic rubbery\npolymers. Furthermore, the influence of a rate-dependent toughness is discussed\nby means of a numerical study.

The latent\nspace models (LSM) have become prominent frameworks for embedding networks and\ninclude the latent distance (LDM) and eigenmodel (LEM) as the most widely used\nLSM specifications. For latent community detection, the embedding space in LDMs\nhas been endowed with a clustering model whereas LEMs have been constrained to\npart-based non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) inspired representations\npromoting community discovery. We presently reconcile LSMs with latent\ncommunity detection by constraining the LDM representation to the D-simplex\nforming the hybrid-membership latent distance model (HM-LDM). We show that for\nsufficiently large simplex volumes this can be achieved without loss of\nexpressive power whereas by extending the model to squared Euclidean distances,\nwe recover the LEM formulation with constraints promoting part-based\nrepresentations akin to NMF.

It is known that\nneural networks can be fragile in the presence of even small input\nperturbations, yielding unpredictable outputs. The verification of neural\nnetworks is therefore vital to their adoption, and a number of approaches have\nbeen proposed in recent years. In this paper we focus on semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) based techniques for neural network verification, which are\nparticularly attractive because they can encode expressive behaviors while\nensuring a polynomial time decision. Our starting point is the DeepSDP\nframework proposed by Fazlyab et al, which uses quadratic constraints to\nabstract the verification problem into a large-scale SDP. When the size of the\nneural network grows, however, solving this SDP quickly becomes intractable.\nOur key observation is that by leveraging chordal sparsity and specific\nparametrizations of DeepSDP, we can decompose the primary computational\nbottleneck of DeepSDP -- a large linear matrix inequality (LMI) -- into an\nequivalent collection of smaller LMIs. Our parametrization admits a tunable\nparameter, allowing us to trade-off efficiency and accuracy in the verification\nprocedure.

The categories across datasets are semantically aligned\ninto a unified space by replacing one-hot category representations with word\nembedding and leveraging the semantic coherence of language embedding.\nDetection Hub fulfills the benefits of large data on object detection.\nExperiments demonstrate that joint training on multiple datasets achieves\nsignificant performance gains over training on each dataset alone. Detection\nHub further achieves SoTA performance on UODB benchmark with wide variety of\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 17:59:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

A\ngreat contribution to the study of planetary formation processes comes from the\nstudy of young, low-mass planets, with short orbital periods. In the last\nyears, the TESS satellite has identified many planets of this kind, and their\ncharacterization is mandatory to understand how they formed and evolved. Within\nthe framework of the GAPS project, we performed the validation and\ncharacterization of the ultra-short period planet (USPP) TOI-1807b, orbiting\nits young host star BD+39 2643 (~300 Myr) in only 13 hours. This is the\nyoungest USPP discovered so far. Thanks to a joint modeling of the stellar\nactivity and planetary signals in the TESS light curve and in HARPS-N\nradial-velocity measurements, combined with accurate estimation of stellar\nparameters, we validated the planetary nature of TOI-1807b and measured its\norbital and physical parameters. By using astrometric, photometric, and\nspectroscopic observations we found that BD+39 2643 is a young, active K dwarf\nstar, member of a 300+/-80 Myr old moving group and that it rotates in\nProt=8.8+/-0.1 days. This star hosts an USPP with an orbital period of only\nP_b=0.54937+/-0.00001 d. Thanks to the exquisite photometric and spectroscopic\nseries, and the accurate information on the stellar activity, we measured both\nthe radius and the mass of TOI-1807b with high precision, obtaining\nR_b=1.37+/-0.09 R_Earth and M_b=2.57+/-0.50 M_Earth. These planet parameters\ncorrespond to a rocky planet with an Earth-like density and no extended H/He\nenvelope. From the analysis of the age-R_P distribution for planets with well\nmeasured ages, we inferred that TOI-1807b may have already lost a large part of\nits atmosphere during its 300 Myr life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

We provide a tight regret analysis for\nExpTS, which simultaneously yields both the finite-time regret bound as well as\nthe asymptotic regret bound.

A\npredictive understanding of the emergent mechanical behaviors in collective\ncell motion is challenging due to the complex interplay between cell-cell\ninteractions, cell-matrix adhesions and active cell behaviors. To overcome this\nchallenge, we develop a predictive cellular vertex model that can delineate the\nrelative roles of substrate rigidity, tissue mechanics and active cell\nproperties on the movement of cell collectives. We apply the model to the\nspecific case of collective motion in cell aggregates as they spread into a\ntwo-dimensional cell monolayer adherent to a soft elastic matrix. Consistent\nwith recent experiments, we find that substrate stiffness regulates the driving\nforces for the spreading of cellular monolayer, which can be pressure-driven or\ncrawling-based depending on substrate rigidity. On soft substrates, cell\nmonolayer spreading is driven by an active pressure due to the influx of cells\ncoming from the aggregate, whereas on stiff substrates, cell spreading is\ndriven primarily by active crawling forces. Our model predicts that cooperation\nof cell crawling and tissue pressure drives faster spreading, while the\nspreading rate is sensitive to the mechanical properties of the tissue. We find\nthat solid tissues spread faster on stiff substrates, with spreading rate\nincreasing with tissue tension. By contrast, the spreading of fluid tissues is\nindependent of substrate stiffness and is slower than solid tissues.

We show how to solve this\nproblem exactly for individual test points, and provide an approximate but more\nscalable method that does not require advance knowledge of the test point. We\nextensively evaluate both techniques and find that linear models -- both\nregression- and classification-based -- often display high levels of\nbias-robustness.

To solve these\ntwo problems, this study propose a gradient-matrix singularity analysis-based\nmethod to estimate the maximum network redundancy. Guided by that maximum rate,\na novel and efficient hierarchical network pruning algorithm is developed to\nmaximally condense the neuronal network structure without sacrificing network\nperformance.

Compared to existing pruning methods, the proposed pruning\nalgorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance.

The VPM uses a Lagrangian scheme, which not only\navoids the hurdles of mesh generation, but it also conserves vortical\nstructures over long distances with minimal numerical dissipation while being\norders of magnitude faster than conventional mesh-based CFD. However, VPM is\nknown to be numerically unstable when vortical structures break down close to\nthe turbulent regime. In this study, we reformulate the VPM as a large eddy\nsimulation (LES) in a scheme that is numerically stable, without increasing its\ncomputational cost. A new set of VPM governing equations are derived from the\nLES-filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The new equations reinforce conservation\nof mass and angular momentum by reshaping the vortex elements subject to vortex\nstretching. In addition to the VPM reformulation, a new anisotropic dynamic\nmodel of subfilter-scale (SFS) vortex stretching is developed. This SFS model\nis well suited for turbulent flows with coherent vortical structures where the\npredominant cascade mechanism is vortex stretching. Advection, viscous\ndiffusion, and vortex stretching are validated through simulation of isolated\nand leapfrogging vortex rings. Mean and fluctuating components of turbulent\nflow are validated through simulation of a turbulent round jet, where Reynolds\nstresses are resolved directly and compared to experimental measurements.\nFinally, the computational efficiency of the scheme is showcased in the\nsimulation of an aircraft rotor in hover, showing our meshless LES to be 100x\nfaster than a mesh-based LES with similar fidelity, while being 10x faster than\na low-fidelity unsteady Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes simulation and 1000x\nfaster than a high-fidelity detached-eddy simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 03:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

However, it is difficult to obtain the ground truth of scene flow in the\nreal scenes, and recent studies are based on synthetic data for training.\nTherefore, how to train a scene flow network with unsupervised methods based on\nreal-world data shows crucial significance. A novel unsupervised learning\nmethod for scene flow is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the images of\ntwo consecutive frames taken by monocular camera without the ground truth of\nscene flow for training. Our method realizes the goal that training scene flow\nnetwork with real-world data, which bridges the gap between training data and\ntest data and broadens the scope of available data for training. Unsupervised\nlearning of scene flow in this paper mainly consists of two parts: (i) depth\nestimation and camera pose estimation, and (ii) scene flow estimation based on\nfour different loss functions. Depth estimation and camera pose estimation\nobtain the depth maps and camera pose between two consecutive frames, which\nprovide further information for the next scene flow estimation. After that, we\nused depth consistency loss, dynamic-static consistency loss, Chamfer loss, and\nLaplacian regularization loss to carry out unsupervised training of the scene\nflow network.

Due to the dataset bias, the model correctly classifies data\nsamples including bias attributes (i.e., bias-aligned samples) while failing to\ncorrectly predict those without bias attributes (i.e., bias-conflicting\nsamples). Recently, a myriad of studies focus on mitigating such dataset bias,\nthe task of which is referred to as debiasing. However, our comprehensive study\nindicates several issues need to be improved when conducting evaluation of\ndebiasing in image classification. First, most of the previous studies do not\nspecify how they select their hyper-parameters and model checkpoints (i.e.,\ntuning criterion). Second, the debiasing studies until now evaluated their\nproposed methods on datasets with excessively high bias-severities, showing\ndegraded performance on datasets with low bias severity. Third, the debiasing\nstudies do not share consistent experimental settings (e.g., datasets and\nneural networks) which need to be standardized for fair comparisons. Based on\nsuch issues, this paper 1) proposes an evaluation metric `Align-Conflict (AC)\nscore' for the tuning criterion, 2) includes experimental settings with low\nbias severity and shows that they are yet to be explored, and 3) unifies the\nstandardized experimental settings to promote fair comparisons between\ndebiasing methods.

However, when handling real-world noisy images, the\ndenoising performance is still limited. In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective Bayesian deep ensemble (BDE) method for real-world image denoising,\nwhere several representative deep denoisers pre-trained with various training\ndata settings can be fused to improve robustness. The foundation of BDE is that\nreal-world image noises are highly signal-dependent, and heterogeneous noises\nin a real-world noisy image can be separately handled by different denoisers.\nIn particular, we take well-trained CBDNet, NBNet, HINet, Uformer and GMSNet\ninto denoiser pool, and a U-Net is adopted to predict pixel-wise weighting maps\nto fuse these denoisers. Instead of solely learning pixel-wise weighting maps,\nBayesian deep learning strategy is introduced to predict weighting uncertainty\nas well as weighting map, by which prediction variance can be modeled for\nimproving robustness on real-world noisy images. Extensive experiments have\nshown that real-world noises can be better removed by fusing existing denoisers\ninstead of training a big denoiser with expensive cost.

The perturbations are made along the normal of the decision\nboundary constructed by an SVM with an attention mechanism. We analyze the\nmerits of our generated boundary-guided adversarial examples from a boundary\nfield perspective and visualization view. Extensive experiments and detailed\nanalysis on MNIST, SVHN, CelebA, and CIFAR-10 validate the effectiveness of\nLADDER in achieving a better trade-off between standard accuracy and\nadversarial robustness as compared with vanilla DNNs and competitive baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 07:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 13:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

Prior transfer learning work mainly transfers from a\nsingle model.

In this paper, we propose a Hub-Pathway framework to enable knowledge\ntransfer from a model hub. The framework generates data-dependent pathway\nweights, based on which we assign the pathway routes at the input level to\ndecide which pre-trained models are activated and passed through, and then set\nthe pathway aggregation at the output level to aggregate the knowledge from\ndifferent models to make predictions.

We utilize a noisy pathway generator and design an\nexploration loss to further explore different pathways throughout the model\nhub.

Such motifs often represent concealed\nstructures, such as heart beats in an ECG recording, or sleep spindles in EEG\nsleep data. Motif discovery (MD) is the task of finding such motifs in a given\ninput series. As there are varying definitions of what exactly a motif is, a\nnumber of algorithms exist. As central parameters they all take the length l of\nthe motif and the maximal distance r between the motif's occurrences. In\npractice, however, suitable values for r are very hard to determine upfront,\nand the found motifs show a high variability. Setting the wrong input value\nwill result in a motif that is not distinguishable from noise. Accordingly,\nfinding an interesting motif with these methods requires extensive\ntrial-and-error. We present a different approach to the MD problem. We define\nk-Motiflets as the set of exactly k occurrences of a motif of length l, whose\nmaximum pairwise distance is minimal. This turns the MD problem upside-down:\nOur central parameter is not the distance threshold r, but the desired size k\nof a motif set, which we show is considerably more intuitive and easier to set.\nBased on this definition, we present exact and approximate algorithms for\nfinding k-Motiflets and analyze their complexity. To further ease the use of\nour method, we describe extensions to automatically determine the\nright/suitable values for its input parameters. Thus, for the first time,\nextracting meaningful motif sets without any a-priori knowledge becomes\nfeasible. By evaluating real-world use cases and comparison to 4\nstate-of-the-art MD algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm is (a)\nquantitatively superior, finding larger motif sets at higher similarity, (b)\nqualitatively better, leading to clearer and easier to interpret motifs, and\n(c) has the lowest runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 08:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Balancing waiting times of patients\nto be first seen by a physician with the overall length of stay over all acuity\nlevels is crucial to maintain an acceptable level of operational performance\nfor all patients. To address those requirements when assigning idle resources\nto patients, several methods have been proposed in the past, including the\nAccumulated Priority Queuing (APQ) method. The APQ method linearly assigns\npriority scores to patients with respect to their time in the system and acuity\nlevel.

Thereby, it\nincorporates a comprehensive state representation of the system and a complex\nnon-linear selection function.

However, due to the large number of antennas, the conventional channel\nestimation and hybrid beamforming algorithms generally require high\ncomputational complexity and signaling overhead. In this work, we propose an\nend-to-end deep-unfolding neural network (NN) joint channel estimation and\nhybrid beamforming (JCEHB) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate in\ntime-division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO. Specifically, the recursive\nleast-squares (RLS) algorithm and stochastic successive convex approximation\n(SSCA) algorithm are unfolded for channel estimation and hybrid beamforming,\nrespectively. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, we consider a\nmixed-timescale hybrid beamforming scheme, where the analog beamforming\nmatrices are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) statistics\noffline, while the digital beamforming matrices are designed at each time slot\nbased on the estimated low-dimensional equivalent CSI matrices. We jointly\ntrain the analog beamformers together with the trainable parameters of the RLS\nand SSCA induced deep-unfolding NNs based on the CSI statistics offline. During\ndata transmission, we estimate the low-dimensional equivalent CSI by the RLS\ninduced deep-unfolding NN and update the digital beamformers. In addition, we\npropose a mixed-timescale deep-unfolding NN where the analog beamformers are\noptimized online, and extend the framework to frequency-division duplex (FDD)\nsystems where channel feedback is considered. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional algorithms with\nreduced computational complexity and signaling overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 09:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Problems of such type arise in the\nstream of literature on optimal trade execution pioneered by Obizhaeva and Wang\n(models with finite resilience). We consider a general framework where the\nprice impact and the resilience are stochastic processes. Both are allowed to\nhave diffusive components. First we continuously extend the problem from\nprocesses of finite variation to progressively measurable processes.

In this work, we address the problem of estimating the global 6 DoF\ncamera pose from a single RGB image in a given environment. Previous works\nconsider every part of the image valuable for localization. However, many image\nregions such as the sky, occlusions, and repetitive non-distinguishable\npatterns cannot be utilized for localization. In addition to adding unnecessary\ncomputation efforts, extracting and matching features from such regions produce\nmany wrong matches which in turn degrades the localization accuracy and\nefficiency. Our work addresses this particular issue and shows by exploiting an\ninteresting concept of sparse 3D models that we can exploit discriminatory\nenvironment parts and avoid useless image regions for the sake of a single\nimage localization. Interestingly, through avoiding selecting keypoints from\nnon-reliable image regions such as trees, bushes, cars, pedestrians, and\nocclusions, our work acts naturally as an outlier filter. This makes our system\nhighly efficient in that minimal set of correspondences is needed and highly\naccurate as the number of outliers is low.

However, these methods suffer from\nspatial misalignment or false distractors due to delayed and implicit\nspatial-temporal interaction occurring in the decoding phase. To tackle these\nlimitations, we propose a Language-Bridged Duplex Transfer (LBDT) module which\nutilizes language as an intermediary bridge to accomplish explicit and adaptive\nspatial-temporal interaction earlier in the encoding phase. Concretely,\ncross-modal attention is performed among the temporal encoder, referring words\nand the spatial encoder to aggregate and transfer language-relevant motion and\nappearance information. In addition, we also propose a Bilateral Channel\nActivation (BCA) module in the decoding phase for further denoising and\nhighlighting the spatial-temporal consistent features via channel-wise\nactivation. Extensive experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformances on four popular benchmarks with 6.8% and 6.9% absolute AP gains on\nA2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences respectively, while consuming around 7x less\ncomputational overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 10:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

The presence of a third body can modify the\nrate of energy transfer between donor and acceptor in distinctive and intricate\nways, especially when the three-site system is itself interacting with a larger\nmacroscopic background such as a solvent. The rate can be calculated\nperturbatively, which ordinarily requires the summation of very large numbers\nof Feynman-like diagrams. Here we demonstrate a method based on canonical\nperturbation theory that allows us to reduce the computational effort required,\nand use this technique to derive a formula for the rate of three-body resonance\nenergy transfer in a background environment. As a proof-of-principle, we apply\nthis to the situation of a dimer positioned near a dielectric interface, with a\ndistant third molecule controlling the rate, finding both enhancement or\nsuppression of the rate depending on system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 10:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

We show that\nthe switchbacks modulation, on a timescale of several hours, seems to be\nindependent of whether PSP is near perihelion, when it rapidly traverses large\nswaths of longitude remaining at the same heliocentric distance, or near the\nradial-scan part of its orbit, when PSP hovers over the same longitude on the\nSun while rapidly moving radially inwards or outwards. This implies that\nswitchback patches must also have an intrinsically temporal modulation most\nprobably originating at the Sun. Between two consecutive patches, the magnetic\nfield is usually very quiescent with weak fluctuations. We compare various\nparameters between the quiescent intervals and the switchback intervals. The\nresults show that the quiescent intervals are typically less Alfv\\'enic than\nswitchback intervals, and the magnetic power spectrum is usually shallower in\nquiescent intervals.

In this work we propose an\nalternative method to generate mid-infrared light, utilizing the coupling\nbetween longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom due to the nonlocal\noptical response of nanoscopic polar dielectric crystals. Polar crystals\nsupport sub-diffraction photonic modes in the mid-infrared.

Learn2Evaluate has several\nadvantages compared to commonly applied performance estimation methodologies.\nFirstly, a learning curve offers a graphical overview of a learner. This\noverview assists in assessing the potential benefit of adding training samples\nand it provides a more complete comparison between learners than performance\nestimates at a fixed subsample size. Secondly, a learning curve facilitates in\nestimating the performance at the total sample size rather than a subsample\nsize. Thirdly, Learn2Evaluate allows the computation of a theoretically\njustified and useful lower confidence bound. Furthermore, this bound may be\ntightened by performing a bias correction.

The notion of uniform\nstability, however, is stringent in the sense that it is invariant to the\ndata-generating distribution.

The present paper addresses this long standing tension between\nthese two regimes of results and makes progress towards relaxing it inside a\nclassic framework of confidence-boosting.

However, due to the different compression\noptimization methods, the compressed images may have different levels of\nquality, which needs to be evaluated quantificationally. Nowadays, the\nmainstream full-reference (FR) metrics are effective to predict the quality of\ncompressed images at coarse-grained levels (the bit rates differences of\ncompressed images are obvious), however, they may perform poorly for\nfine-grained compressed images whose bit rates differences are quite subtle.\nTherefore, to better improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) and provide useful\nguidance for compression algorithms, we propose a full-reference image quality\nassessment (FR-IQA) method for compressed images of fine-grained levels.\nSpecifically, the reference images and compressed images are first converted to\n$YCbCr$ color space. The gradient features are extracted from regions that are\nsensitive to compression artifacts. Then we employ the Log-Gabor transformation\nto further analyze the texture difference.

It may also contain\ndiscussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these\nelements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper,\nthe aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain\nknowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset\nafter annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference\nsummaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel\ncounseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three\nindependent modules.

Adam and Delbr\\\"uck put forth the\nreduction-of-dimensionality concept, according to which a ligand first binds\nnon-specifically to any point of the surface on which the target is placed and\nthen diffuses along this surface until it locates the target. In this work, we\nanalyse the efficiency of such a scenario and confront it with the efficiency\nof a direct search process, in which the target is approached directly from the\nbulk and not aided by surface diffusion. We consider two situations: (i) a\nsingle ligand is launched from a fixed or a random position and searches for\nthe target, and (ii) the case of \"amplified\" signals when $N$ ligands start\neither from the same point or from random positions, and the search terminates\nwhen the fastest of them arrives to the target. For such settings, we go beyond\nthe conventional analyses, which compare only the mean values of the\ncorresponding FPTs. Instead, we calculate the full probability density function\nof FPTs for both scenarios and study its integral characteristic -- the\n\"survival\" probability of a target up to time $t$. On this basis, we examine\nhow the efficiencies of both scenarios are controlled by a variety of\nparameters and single out realistic conditions in which the\nreduction-of-dimensionality scenario outperforms the direct search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 13:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 11:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

However, in image segmentation, the large memory footprint due to the\ncomputation of the pixel-wise contrastive loss makes it prohibitive to use.\nFurthermore, labeled target data is not easily available in medical imaging,\nand obtaining new samples is not economical. As a result, in this work, we\ntackle a more challenging UDA task when there are only a few (fewshot) or a\nsingle (oneshot) image available from the target domain. We apply a style\ntransfer module to mitigate the scarcity of target samples.

Two pairs of graphs are called Ramsey\nequivalent if they have the same collection of Ramsey graphs. The symmetric\nsetting, that is, the case $G=H$, received considerable attention. This led to\nthe open question whether there are connected graphs $G$ and $G'$ such that\n$(G,G)$ and $(G',G')$ are Ramsey equivalent. We make progress on the asymmetric\nversion of this question and identify several non-trivial families of Ramsey\nequivalent pairs of connected graphs.\n  Certain pairs of stars provide a first, albeit trivial, example of Ramsey\nequivalent pairs of connected graphs. Our first result characterizes all Ramsey\nequivalent pairs of stars. The rest of the paper focuses on pairs of the form\n$(T,K_t)$, where $T$ is a tree and $K_t$ is a complete graph.

Extending studies\nof such Hamiltonians to quasi-two dimensional systems is of great current\ninterest, as electron-phonon couplings are predicted to play a major role in\nthe stabilization or enhancement of novel phases in 2D material systems. In\nthis work, we study model systems that describe the interplay between the\nHubbard coupling and the phonon modes in the Holstein (H) and\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonians using the functional renormalization\ngroup (fRG). For both types of electron phonon couplings, we find the predicted\ncharge density wave phases in competition with anti-ferromagnetic ($AF$)\nordering. As the system is doped, the transition shifts, with both orders\nshowing incommensurate peaks. We compare the evolution of the quasiparticle\nweight for the Holstein model with that of the SSH model as the systems\ntransition from antiferromagnetic to charge-ordered ground states. Finally, we\ncalculate the self-energy of the phonon and capture the impact of charge\nordering on the phonon modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 15:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Unlike blockchain-based systems, Hypersyn does not rely on any\nconsensus algorithm. It does not require a distributed ledger to store the\nhistory of events nor a set of validators. Hypersyn does not have a\nsystem-imposed hard-cap on the number of transactions per second that it can\nperform, and can therefore easily scale up or down depending on network usage.\nUnlike in other payment systems, money in Hypersyn does not get transferred\nfrom person $A$ to person $B$ in the conventional sense. Instead of\ntransferring a token between each other, peers in Hypersyn change their\nexchange value of their credit (i.e. their purchasing power) within the\nnetwork. Just as in centrally-issued fiat systems, money in Hypersyn is treated\nas freely tradable debt, which inherently requires trust. But unlike\ncentrally-issued fiat systems, money issuance in Hypersyn is not controlled by\nan authority, but is instead created on the spot as mutual credit. In\nblockchain-based systems and even in centrally-issued fiat systems, money is\ntreated as a scarce commodity. In the Hypersyn protocol on the other hand,\nmoney supply within the system is elastic in nature. Because of these\nfundamental differences in assumptions, the Hypersyn protocol does not aim to\ncompete with, or substitute blockchain-based systems. Instead, Hypersyn should\nbe viewed as a tool that aims to offer a qualitative change in the way we\nexchange. It has the potential to increase the autonomy and self-organization\nthat people can have, by enabling people to become both the creditors and\ndebtors of their own \"money\" through mutual credit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 08:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

While the impact of data imbalance\non predictive models has been extensively studied, it remains largely unknown\nwith respect to SHAP-based model explanations. This study sought to investigate\nthe effects of data imbalance on SHAP explanations for deep learning models,\nand to propose a strategy to mitigate these effects. Materials and Methods: We\npropose to adjust class distributions in the background and explanation data in\nSHAP when explaining black box models. Our data balancing strategy is to\ncompose background data and explanation data with an equal distribution of\nclasses. To evaluate the effects of data adjustment on model explanation, we\npropose to use the beeswarm plot as a qualitative tool to identify \"abnormal\"\nexplanation artifacts, and quantitatively test the consistency between variable\nimportance and prediction power. We demonstrated our proposed approach in an\nempirical study that predicted inpatient mortality using the Medical\nInformation Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data and a multilayer\nperceptron. Results: Using the data balancing strategy would allow us to reduce\nthe number of the artifacts in the beeswarm plot, thus mitigating the negative\neffects of data imbalance. Additionally, with the balancing strategy, the\ntop-ranked variables from the corresponding importance ranking demonstrated\nimproved discrimination power. Discussion and Conclusion: Our findings suggest\nthat balanced background and explanation data could help reduce the noise in\nexplanation results induced by skewed data distribution and improve the\nreliability of variable importance ranking.

These multimodal\nforecasting models can improve accuracy but be less practical when different\nparts of multimodal datasets are owned by different institutions who cannot\ndirectly share data among them. While various institutions may can not share\ntheir data with each other directly, they may share forecasting models trained\nby their data, where such models cannot be used to identify the exact\ninformation from their datasets. This study proposes an Unsupervised Knowledge\nAdaptation Demand Forecasting framework to forecast the demand of the target\nmode by utilizing a pre-trained model based on data of another mode, which does\nnot require direct data sharing of the source mode. The proposed framework\nutilizes the potential shared patterns among multiple transport modes to\nimprove forecasting performance while avoiding the direct sharing of data among\ndifferent institutions. Specifically, a pre-trained forecasting model is first\nlearned based on the data of a source mode, which can capture and memorize the\nsource travel patterns. Then, the demand data of the target dataset is encoded\ninto an individual knowledge part and a sharing knowledge part which will\nextract travel patterns by individual extraction network and sharing extraction\nnetwork, respectively. The unsupervised knowledge adaptation strategy is\nutilized to form the sharing features for further forecasting by making the\npre-trained network and the sharing extraction network analogous. Our findings\nillustrate that unsupervised knowledge adaptation by sharing the pre-trained\nmodel to the target mode can improve the forecasting performance without the\ndependence on direct data sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 11:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

The increased\nprevalence of bTBI necessitates bTBI models that result in a properly scaled\ninjury for the model organism being used. The primary laboratory model for bTBI\nis the shock tube, wherein a compressed gas ruptures a thin membrane,\ngenerating a shockwave. To generate a shock wave that is properly scaled from\nhuman to rodent subjects the shock wave must have a short duration and high\npeak overpressure while fitting a Friedlander waveform, the ideal\nrepresentation of a blast wave. A large variety of factors have been\nexperimentally characterized in attempts to create an ideal waveform, however\nwe found current research on the gas composition being used to drive shock wave\nformation to be lacking. To better understand the effect the driver gas has on\nthe waveform being produced, we utilized a previously established murine shock\ntube bTBI model in conjunction with several distinct driver gasses. In\nagreement with previous findings, helium produced a shock wave most closely\nfitting the Friedlander waveform in contrast to the plateau-like waveforms\nproduced by some other gases. The peak pressure at the exit of the shock tube\nand 5 cm from the exit have a strong negative correlation with the density of\nthe gas being used: helium the least dense gas used produces the highest peak\noverpressure. Density of the driver gas also exerts a strong positive effect on\nthe duration of the shock wave, with helium producing the shortest duration\nwave.

We propose two\nfamilies of inductive biases, one for constituency structure and another one\nfor dependency structure. The constituency inductive bias encourages deep\nlearning models to use different units (or neurons) to separately process\nlong-term and short-term information. This separation provides a way for deep\nlearning models to build the latent hierarchical representations from\nsequential inputs, that a higher-level representation is composed of and can be\ndecomposed into a series of lower-level representations. For example, without\nknowing the ground-truth structure, our proposed model learns to process\nlogical expression through composing representations of variables and operators\ninto representations of expressions according to its syntactic structure. On\nthe other hand, the dependency inductive bias encourages models to find the\nlatent relations between entities in the input sequence. For natural language,\nthe latent relations are usually modeled as a directed dependency graph, where\na word has exactly one parent node and zero or several children nodes. After\napplying this constraint to a Transformer-like model, we find the model is\ncapable of inducing directed graphs that are close to human expert annotations,\nand it also outperforms the standard transformer model on different tasks. We\nbelieve that these experimental results demonstrate an interesting alternative\nfor the future development of deep learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 11:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

Moreover, with the increasing\ndemand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure\npower system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated.\nConsidering its significance in power system security, it is important to\nsuggest a different methodology for enhancing the transient stability,\nconsidering uncertainties. Current deterministic industry practices of\ntransient stability assessment ignore the probabilistic nature of variables\n(fault type, fault location, fault clearing time, etc.). These approaches\ntypically provide a cautious principle and can result in high-priced expansion\nprojects or operational limits. With the increasing system uncertainties and\nwidespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong inevitability to\nincorporate risk in the traditional transient stability analysis. Accurate\nassessment of transient stability in a modern power network is becoming a\nstrict requirement both in planning and in real-time operation, due to the\nincreasingly intricate dynamics of a power system. Further, increasing sources\nof uncertainty in forecast state and in the reaction to faults highly implies\nthe implementation of risk-based approach in assessing transient stability.\nThus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of risk-based transient\nstability in power networks and the accompanying research.

Most HAR systems for ultra-low power\ndevices are based on classic Machine Learning (ML) models, whereas Deep\nLearning (DL), although reaching state-of-the-art accuracy, is less popular due\nto its high energy consumption, which poses a significant challenge for\nbattery-operated and resource-constrained devices. In this work, we bridge the\ngap between on-device HAR and DL thanks to a hierarchical architecture composed\nof a decision tree (DT) and a one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D\nCNN). The two classifiers operate in a cascaded fashion on two different\nsub-tasks: the DT classifies only the easiest activities, while the CNN deals\nwith more complex ones. With experiments on a state-of-the-art dataset and\ntargeting a single-core RISC-V MCU, we show that this approach allows to save\nup to 67.7% energy w.r.t. a \"stand-alone\" DL architecture at iso-accuracy.\nAdditionally, the two-stage system either introduces a negligible memory\noverhead (up to 200 B) or on the contrary, reduces the total memory occupation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 16:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

A typical\nproblem of teleoperation is communication time delay which, together with\nactuator saturation and environmental disturbance, can cause a vehicle\ndeviation from the target trajectory imposed by the human operator who imposes\nto the vehicle a steering wheel angle reference and a speed/acceleration\nreference. With predictive techniques, time-delay can be accounted at\nsufficient extent. But, in presence of disturbances, due to the absence of\ninstantaneous haptic and visual feedback, human-operator steering command\ntransmitted to the the vehicle is unaccounted with disturbances observed by the\nvehicle. To improve reference tracking without losing promptness in driving\ncontrol, reference trajectory in the form of successive reference poses can be\ntransmitted instead of steering commands to the vehicle. We introduce this new\nconcept, namely, the 'successive reference-pose tracking (SRPT)' to improve\npath tracking in vehicle teleoperation. This paper discusses feasibility and\nadvantages of this new method, compare to the smith predictor control approach.\nSimulations are performed in SIMULINK environment, where a 14-dof vehicle model\nis being controlled with Smith and SRPT controllers in presence of variable\nnetwork delay. Scenarios for performance comparison are low adhesion ground,\nstrong lateral wind and steer-rate demanding maneuvers. Simulation result shows\nsignificant improvement in reference tracking with SRPT approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 15:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Many trials use a modified\nintention-to-treat (mITT) approach, whereby participants who do not initiate\ntreatment are excluded from the analysis. However, it is not clear the estimand\nbeing targeted by such an approach or the assumptions necessary for it to be\nunbiased.\n  Methods: We demonstrate that a mITT analysis which excludes participants who\ndo not begin treatment is estimating a principal stratum estimand (i.e. the\ntreatment effect in the subpopulation of participants who would begin\ntreatment, regardless of which arm they were assigned to). The mITT estimator\nis unbiased for the principal stratum estimand under the assumption that the\nintercurrent event is not affected by the assigned treatment arm, that is,\nparticipants who initiate treatment in one arm would also do so in the other\narm.\n  Results: We identify two key criteria in determining whether the mITT\nestimator is likely to be unbiased: first, we must be able to measure the\nparticipants in each treatment arm who experience the intercurrent event, and\nsecond, the assumption that treatment allocation will not affect whether the\nparticipant begins treatment must be reasonable. Most double-blind trials will\nsatisfy these criteria, and we provide an example of an open-label trial where\nthese criteria are likely to be satisfied as well.\n  Conclusions: A modified intention-to-treat analysis which excludes\nparticipants who do not begin treatment can be an unbiased estimator for the\nprincipal stratum estimand. Our framework can help identify when the\nassumptions for unbiasedness are likely to hold, and thus whether modified\nintention-to-treat is appropriate or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 11:34:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The widespread use of xAI brought new\nchallenges. On the one hand, the number of published xAI algorithms underwent a\nboom, and it became difficult for practitioners to select the right tool. On\nthe other hand, some experiments did highlight how easy data scientists could\nmisuse xAI algorithms and misinterpret their results. To tackle the issue of\ncomparing and correctly using feature importance xAI algorithms, we propose\nCompare-xAI, a benchmark that unifies all exclusive functional testing methods\napplied to xAI algorithms. We propose a selection protocol to shortlist\nnon-redundant functional tests from the literature, i.e., each targeting a\nspecific end-user requirement in explaining a model.

The last level is the aggregated\ncomprehensibility score, which encapsulates the ease of correctly interpreting\nthe algorithm's output in one easy to compare value.
