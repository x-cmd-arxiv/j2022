One is to analyze the\nreturn amplitudes in the presence of \"space-like\" defects stretching around the\nsystem. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with\nthe fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary\nevolution in the presence of \"time-like\" defects that implement anti-periodic\nand duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired\nlocalized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly\nconstruct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit.

First, instead of\nmapping a fixed 2D domain, such as a set of square patches, to the surface, we\nlearn a continuous 2D domain with arbitrary topology by optimizing a point\nsampling distribution represented as a mixture of Gaussians. Second, we learn\nconsistent mappings in both directions: charts, from the 3D surface to 2D\ndomain, and parametrizations, their inverse. We demonstrate that this improves\nthe quality of the learned surface representation, as well as its consistency\nin a collection of related shapes. It thus leads to improvements for\napplications such as correspondence estimation, texture transfer, and\nconsistent UV mapping. As an additional technical contribution, we outline\nthat, while incorporating normal consistency has clear benefits, it leads to\nissues in the optimization, and that these issues can be mitigated using a\nsimple repulsive regularization.

It occurs when an adaptive\ninnovation from an individual is repeatedly passed onto consecutive generations\nthrough social learning. For example, pigeons who fly alone or in stable pairs\nshow relatively rigid sub-optimal routes, but gradually improve route\nefficiency over generations of pairs in which experienced members are swapped\nfor naive ones. This raises the question of what the minimally required\ncognitive architecture is for cumulative cultural evolution to emerge. Here, I\naimed to answer this question in artificial agents who employ three main\nfunctions: goal-direction, social proximity, and route memory. At the optima\nfor efficiency and generational efficiency improvement, agents replicated\ncumulative culture observed in pigeons. Naive individuals benefitted from being\npaired with an experienced navigator, because it allowed them to follow an\nestablished route. Experienced navigators also benefitted from being paired\nwith a naive individual due to regression to the goal. Unhindered by route\nmemory, the naive agent's heading was more likely to err towards the goal.\nBecause of their need for social proximity, experienced agents were biased\ntowards their naive counterparts while following a memorised route. Thus, the\npresence of goal-erring naive agents improved pair's route efficiency. The\nresulting incremental improvements over generations meet all core criteria in\ncurrent frameworks of cumulative cultural evolution, suggesting that\nrudimentary cumulative optimisation is an evolutionary mechanism that emerges\neven in simple systems that prefer social proximity and have a memory capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 16:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 16:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Consequently, the capillarity-driven thinning\ndynamics typically feature two distinct regions at the early and late stages of\nthe filament breakup process, each dominated by distinct mechanisms. These\nfeatures have been incorporated in a simple Inelastic Rate-Thickening (IRT)\nmodel with linear and quadratic contributions to the constitutive stress-strain\nrate relationship, where the apparent extensional viscosity slowly thickens at\nhigh strain rates. We numerically compute the thinning dynamics of the IRT\nmodel assuming an axially-slender axisymmetric filament and no fluid inertia.\nThe computational results motivate a new self-similar solution dominated by the\nsecond-order stress obtained through a similarity transformation. The new\nasymptotic solution leads to a self-similar filament shape that is more slender\nthan the Newtonian counterpart and results in a quadratic thinning of the\nmid-point radius of the filament with time to breakup close to singularity. A\nnew and distinct asymptotic geometric correction factor, $X\\approx 0.5778$ is\nobtained, from which a more accurate true extensional viscosity can be\nrecovered from an interpolated time-varying geometric correction factor based\non the magnitudes of different stress components. Finally, we propose a\nstatistics-based protocol to select the best-fit constitutive model using a\nparameter-free criterion, enabling us to quantify the extensional rheological\nbehavior through capillarity-driven thinning dynamics more systematically on\ncomplex rate-thickening viscoelastic fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 16:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

To capture such\ntrustworthy behavior, we deviate from the expected utility theory and use a new\nnotion of rationality based on limited-trust equilibrium (LTE).

A prominent example is the hysteresis and bistability of the Duffing\noscillator, which in the classical description is attributed to the coexistence\nof two steady states in a double-well potential. However, this interpretation\nfails in the quantum-mechanical perspective, where a single unique steady state\nis allowed in the whole parameter space. Here, we measure the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of a superconducting Duffing oscillator and reconcile the classical\nand quantum descriptions in a unified picture of quantum metastability. We\ndemonstrate that the two classically regarded steady states are in fact\nmetastable states. They have a remarkably long lifetime in the classical\nhysteresis regime but must eventually relax into a single unique steady state\nallowed by quantum mechanics. By engineering the lifetime of the metastable\nstates sufficiently large, we observe a first-order dissipative phase\ntransition, which mimics a sudden change of the mean field in a 11-site\nBose-Hubbard lattice. We also reveal the two distinct phases of the transition\nby quantum state tomography, namely a coherent-state phase and a squeezed-state\nphase separated by a critical point. Our results reveal a smooth quantum state\nevolution behind a sudden dissipative phase transition, and they form an\nessential step towards understanding hysteresis and instability in\nnon-equilibrium systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 17:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Gaussian Process (GP) is a powerful\nBayesian model that comes with naturally well-calibrated variance estimations.\nHowever, it is challenging to learn a stand-alone global GP since merging local\nkernels leads to privacy leakage. To preserve privacy, previous works that\nconsider federated GPs avoid learning a global model by focusing on the\npersonalized setting or learning an ensemble of local models. We present\nFederated Bayesian Neural Regression (FedBNR), an algorithm that learns a\nscalable stand-alone global federated GP that respects clients' privacy.

To obtain\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically adopted.\nHowever, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep\nnetworks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and\nthus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be\nunreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling:\ninstead of relying on model confidence, we instead measure whether an unlabeled\nsample is likely to be \"in-distribution\"; i.e., close to the current training\ndata. To classify whether an unlabeled sample is \"in-distribution\" or\n\"out-of-distribution\", we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution\ndetection literature. As training progresses and more unlabeled samples become\nin-distribution and contribute to training, the combined labeled and\npseudo-labeled data can better approximate the true distribution to improve the\nmodel.

First, we advocate a\ndata-driven strategy to generate object masks that serve as a pixel grouping\nprior for semantic segmentation. This approach omits handcrafted priors, which\nare often designed for specific scene compositions and limit the applicability\nof competing frameworks. Second, MaskDistill clusters the object masks to\nobtain pseudo-ground-truth for training an initial object segmentation model.\nThird, we leverage this model to filter out low-quality object masks. This\nstrategy mitigates the noise in our pixel grouping prior and results in a clean\ncollection of masks which we use to train a final segmentation model. By\ncombining these components, we can considerably outperform previous works for\nunsupervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL (+11% mIoU) and COCO (+4% mask\nAP50).

We report the first self-consistent synthetic emission maps of [CII]\nin feedback bubbles, largely devoid of emission inside them, as recently found\nin observations. The C$^+$ mass is only poorly affected by stellar feedback but\nthe [CII] luminosity increases by $50 - 85$ per cent compared to runs without\nfeedback. Furthermore, we investigate the capability of the CO/[CII] line ratio\nas a tracer of the amount of H$_2$ in the clouds and their evolutionary stage.\nWe obtain, for both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, no clear trend of the luminosity\nratio, $L_\\mathrm{CO}/L_\\mathrm{[CII]}$. It can therefore \\textit{not} be used\nas a reliable measure of the H$_2$ mass fraction. We note a monotonic relation\nbetween $L_\\mathrm{CO}/L_\\mathrm{[CII]}$ and the H$_2$ fraction when\nconsidering the ratio for individual pixels of our synthetic maps, but with\nlarge scatter. Moreover, we show that assuming chemical equilibrium results in\nan overestimation of H$_2$ and CO masses of up to 110 and 30 per cent,\nrespectively, and in an underestimation of H and C$^+$ masses of 65 and 7 per\ncent, respectively. In consequence, $L_\\mathrm{CO}$ would be overestimated by\nup to 50 per cent, and $L_\\mathrm{C[II]}$ be underestimated by up to 35 per\ncent. Hence, the assumption of chemical equilibrium in molecular cloud\nsimulations introduces intrinsic errors of a factor of up to $\\sim2$ in\nchemical abundances, luminosities and luminosity ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 18:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 13:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

We present a summary of the variability processing and analysis of the\nphotometric and spectroscopic time series of 1.8 billion sources done for Gaia\nDR3.\n  Methods. We used statistical and Machine Learning methods to characterise and\nclassify the variable sources. Training sets were built from a global revision\nof major published variable star catalogues.

In total, 10.5 million objects are identified as variable in Gaia\nDR3 and have associated time series in G, GBP, and GRP and, in some cases,\nradial velocity time series. The DR3 variable sources subdivide into 9.5\nmillion variable stars and 1 million Active Galactic Nuclei/Quasars. In\naddition, supervised classification identified 2.5 million galaxies thanks to\nspurious variability induced by the extent of these objects.

In many real world\napplications, however, an agent can observe only a score that represents the\nquality of the whole trajectory, which is referred to as the {\\em\ntrajectory-wise reward}. In such a situation, it is difficult for standard RL\nmethods to well utilize trajectory-wise reward, and large bias and variance\nerrors can be incurred in policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel\noffline RL algorithm, called Pessimistic vAlue iteRaTion with rEward\nDecomposition (PARTED), which decomposes the trajectory return into per-step\nproxy rewards via least-squares-based reward redistribution, and then performs\npessimistic value iteration based on the learned proxy reward. To ensure the\nvalue functions constructed by PARTED are always pessimistic with respect to\nthe optimal ones, we design a new penalty term to offset the uncertainty of the\nproxy reward. For general episodic MDPs with large state space, we show that\nPARTED with overparameterized neural network function approximation achieves an\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(D_{\\text{eff}}H^2/\\sqrt{N})$ suboptimality, where $H$ is\nthe length of episode, $N$ is the total number of samples, and $D_{\\text{eff}}$\nis the effective dimension of the neural tangent kernel matrix.

This\nis particularly true for medical images, where the resolution, field-of-view\nand orientation can differ across channels and subjects. Images and labels are\ntherefore commonly resampled onto the same grid, as a pre-processing step.\nHowever, the resampling operation introduces partial volume effects and\nblurring, thereby changing the effective resolution and reducing the contrast\nbetween structures. In this paper we propose a splat layer, which automatically\nhandles resolution mismatches in the input data. This layer pushes each image\nonto a mean space where the forward pass is performed. As the splat operator is\nthe adjoint to the resampling operator, the mean-space prediction can be pulled\nback to the native label space, where the loss function is computed. Thus, the\nneed for explicit resolution adjustment using interpolation is removed.

Learning code representation from a\nmultilingual source code dataset has been shown to be more effective than\nlearning from single-language datasets separately, since more training data\nfrom multilingual dataset improves the model's ability to extract\nlanguage-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multilingual\ntraining overlooks the language-specific information which is crucial for\nmodeling source code across different programming languages, while only\nfocusing on learning a unified model with shared parameters among different\nlanguages for language-agnostic information modeling. To address this problem,\nwe propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code\nrepresentation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for the\nfeature extractor according to the specific programming language type of the\ninput code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostic and\nlanguage-specific information with dynamic parameters in the feature extractor.\nWe conduct experiments on the code summarization and code completion tasks to\nverify the effectiveness of our approach.

In this work, we explore how\nmultivariate information theory can reveal higher-order, synergistic\ndependencies in the human brain.

In this context it is crucial to understand\nhow screening mechanisms, which hide the deviations of these theories from the\npredictions of general relativity in local experiments, affect structure\nformation. In this work we approach this problem by using a combination of\nanalytic and numerical methods to describe chameleon screening in the context\nof cosmic voids. We apply a finite element method (FEM) code, SELCIE, to solve\nthe chameleon equation of motion for a number of void profiles derived from\nobservational data and simulations. The obtained results indicate a complex\nrelationship between the properties of cosmic voids and the size of the\nchameleon acceleration of a test particle. We find that the fifth force on a\ntest particle in a void is primarily related to the depth and the inner density\ngradient of the void. For realistic void profiles, the obtained\nchameleon-to-Newtonian acceleration ratios range between $a_{\\phi}/a_{\\rm Newt}\n\\approx 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}$. However, it should be noted that in unusually deep\nvoids with large inner density gradients, the acceleration ratios can be\nsignificantly higher.

This challenge is especially apparent in continual\nlearning problems where a single stream of experience is available to a\nsingular agent.

Most existing theoretical analysis of MALA relies on the smoothness\nand strongly log-concavity properties of the target distribution, which\nunfortunately is often unsatisfied in practical Bayesian problems.

Algorithm design of AT and its variants are\nfocused on training models at a specified perturbation strength $\\epsilon$ and\nonly using the feedback from the performance of that $\\epsilon$-robust model to\nimprove the algorithm. In this work, we focus on models, trained on a spectrum\nof $\\epsilon$ values. We analyze three perspectives: model performance,\nintermediate feature precision and convolution filter sensitivity. In each, we\nidentify alternative improvements to AT that otherwise wouldn't have been\napparent at a single $\\epsilon$. Specifically, we find that for a PGD attack at\nsome strength $\\delta$, there is an AT model at some slightly larger strength\n$\\epsilon$, but no greater, that generalizes best to it. Hence, we propose\noverdesigning for robustness where we suggest training models at an $\\epsilon$\njust above $\\delta$. Second, we observe (across various $\\epsilon$ values) that\nrobustness is highly sensitive to the precision of intermediate features and\nparticularly those after the first and second layer. Thus, we propose adding a\nsimple quantization to defenses that improves accuracy on seen and unseen\nadaptive attacks.

These optimal designs have not been\nconsidered widely in applications in part due to the difficulty and cost\ninvolved with computing them. Three primary algorithms for constructing exact\n$G$-optimal designs are presented in the literature: the coordinate exchange\n(CEXCH), a genetic algorithm (GA), and the relatively new $G$-optimal via\n$I_\\lambda$-optimality algorithm ($G(I_\\lambda)$-CEXCH) which was developed in\npart to address large computational cost. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has\nachieved widespread use in many applications, but to date, its broad-scale\nsuccess notwithstanding, has seen relatively few applications in optimal design\nproblems. In this paper we develop an extension of PSO to adapt it to the\noptimal design problem. We then employ PSO to generate optimal designs for\nseveral scenarios covering $K = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ design factors, which are common\nexperimental sizes in industrial experiments. We compare these results to all\n$G$-optimal designs published in last two decades of literature.

We demonstrate that PSO has found improved\n$G$-optimal designs for these scenarios, and it does this with comparable\ncomputational cost to the state-of-the-art algorithm $G(I_\\lambda)$-CEXCH.\nFurther, we show that PSO is able to produce equal or better $G$-optimal\ndesigns for $K= 4, 5$ factors than those currently known.

However, it is costly to update the entire\nparameter set of large pre-trained models. Although recently proposed\nparameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) techniques allow updating a small\nsubset of parameters (e.g. only using 2% of parameters) inside a pre-trained\nbackbone network for a new task, they only reduce the training memory\nrequirement by up to 30%. This is because the gradient computation for the\ntrainable parameters still requires backpropagation through the large\npre-trained backbone model. To address this, we propose Ladder Side-Tuning\n(LST), a new PETL technique that can reduce training memory requirements by\nmore substantial amounts. Unlike existing parameter-efficient methods that\ninsert additional parameters inside backbone networks, we train a ladder side\nnetwork, a small and separate network that takes intermediate activations as\ninput via shortcut connections (called ladders) from backbone networks and\nmakes predictions. LST has significantly lower memory requirements than\nprevious methods, because it does not require backpropagation through the\nbackbone network, but instead only through the side network and ladder\nconnections. We evaluate our method with various models (T5 and CLIP-T5) on\nboth NLP (GLUE) and vision-and-language (VQA, GQA, NLVR2 , MSCOCO) tasks. LST\nsaves 69% of the memory costs to fine-tune the whole network, while other\nmethods only save 26% of that in similar parameter usages (hence, 2.7x more\nmemory savings). Moreover, LST achieves higher accuracy than Adapter and LoRA\nin a low-memory regime. To further show the advantage of this better memory\nefficiency, we also apply LST to larger T5 models, attaining better GLUE\nperformance than full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. The\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off also holds on VL tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 23:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 17:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}

We calculate numerically the filament thinning profiles predicted by\nthe two models with realistic entanglement densities, assuming cylindrical\nfilament shapes and no fluid inertia. Both results reveal an early\ntube-reorientation regime, followed by a brief intermediate elasto-capillary\nregime, and finally a finite-extensibility regime close to the pinch-off\nsingularity. The results presented in this work reveal two critical features in\nthe transient extensional rheology of entangled polymer solutions that have\nbeen reported from previous experimental studies, but are poorly described by\nthe widely-used FENE-P model. First, the relaxation time obtained from\ncapillary breakup extensional rheometry is notably smaller than that from\nsteady-shear rheometry. Their ratio can be expressed as a universal function of\nthe entanglement state and the polymer concentration, which agrees well with\nthe experimental data for a range of entangled polymer solutions. Second, the\nfilament thinning dynamics at sufficiently high polymer concentrations are\ngoverned by the tube reorientation at intermediate strain-rates, and the\napparent extensional viscosity shows a noticeably rate-thinning response. We\nfinally evaluate the filament thinning dynamics of aqueous polyethylene oxide\nsolutions (1 MDa) over dilute and entangled regimes.

Existing IQA methods are\ndesigned to measure the quality of an image in terms of Mean Opinion Score\n(MOS) at the image-level (i.e. the whole image) or at the patch-level (dividing\nthe image into multiple units and measuring quality of each patch). Some\napplications may require assessing the quality at the pixel-level (i.e. MOS\nvalue for each pixel), however, this is not possible in case of existing\ntechniques as the spatial information is lost owing to their network\nstructures. This paper proposes an IQA algorithm that can measure the MOS at\nthe pixel-level, in addition to the image-level MOS. The proposed algorithm\nconsists of three core parts, namely: i) Local IQA; ii) Region of Interest\n(ROI) prediction; iii) High-level feature embedding. The Local IQA part outputs\nthe MOS at the pixel-level, or pixel-by-pixel MOS - we term it 'pMOS'. The ROI\nprediction part outputs weights that characterize the relative importance of\nregion when calculating the image-level IQA. The high-level feature embedding\npart extracts high-level image features which are then embedded into the Local\nIQA part. In other words, the proposed algorithm yields three outputs: the pMOS\nwhich represents MOS for each pixel, the weights from the ROI indicating the\nrelative importance of region, and finally the image-level MOS that is obtained\nby the weighted sum of pMOS and ROI values. The image-level MOS thus obtained\nby utilizing pMOS and ROI weights shows superior performance compared to the\nexisting popular IQA techniques. In addition, visualization results indicate\nthat predicted pMOS and ROI outputs are reasonably aligned with the general\nprinciples of the human visual system (HVS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 01:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

We argue that SBST needs to be focused to search for test cases in\ndefective areas rather in non-defective areas of the code in order to maximise\nthe likelihood of discovering the bugs.

However, even the top-notch IC systems, such as\nMicrosoft Azure Cognitive Services and IBM Image Caption Generator, may return\nincorrect results, leading to the omission of important objects, deep\nmisunderstanding, and threats to personal safety.\n  To address this problem, we propose MetaIC, the \\textit{first} metamorphic\ntesting approach to validate IC systems. Our core idea is that the object names\nshould exhibit directional changes after object insertion. Specifically, MetaIC\n(1) extracts objects from existing images to construct an object corpus; (2)\ninserts an object into an image via novel object resizing and location tuning\nalgorithms; and (3) reports image pairs whose captions do not exhibit\ndifferences in an expected way.

It is\nwidely accepted that such solitons react to parameter inhomogeneities by\nexperiencing a temporal drift whose rate is governed by the gradient of the\nparameter at the soliton's position. This result, however, assumes that the\ngradient of the inhomogeneity is constant across the soliton, which may not\nhold true under all situations, e.g. when using bichromatic driving or in the\npresence of third-order dispersion that gives rise to an extended dispersive\nwave tail. Here we report on theoretical and numerical results pertaining to\nthe behavior of dissipative temporal Kerr cavity solitons under conditions\nwhere parameter inhomogeneities vary nonlinearly across the width of the\nsoliton. In this case, the soliton velocity is dictated by the full overlap\nbetween its so-called neutral mode and the parameter perturbation, which we\nshow can yield dynamics that are manifestly at odds with the common wisdom of\nmotion dependent solely upon the gradient of the inhomogeneity. We also\ninvestigate how the presence of third-order dispersion and the associated\ndispersive wave tail changes the motion induced by parameter inhomogeneities.\nWe find that the dispersive wave tail as such does not contribute to the\nsoliton motion; instead, higher-order dispersion yields counter-intuitive\ninfluences on the soliton motion. Our results provide new insights to the\nbehavior of temporal cavity solitons in the presence of parameter\ninhomogeneities, and can impact systems employing pulsed or bichromatic pumping\nand/or resonators with non-negligible higher-order dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Recent studies on flat-plate electrodes have demonstrated that\nasymmetries in ion properties, such as valences and diffusivities, lead to\nintriguing and counter-intuitive physical phenomena. Yet, the consequences of\nsuch asymmetries to ion transport have seldom been explored in porous\ngeometries. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a perturbation expansion\nof the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations in a cylindrical pore in the limit of\nsmall potentials for a binary electrolyte with arbitrary valences and\ndiffusivities. We obtain good agreement between the perturbation analysis and\ndirect numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals that the charge and the salt\ntransport are coupled with each other. Further, the coupling between the charge\nand salt transport processes is enhanced with an increase in valence and\ndiffusivity asymmetries of ions. We observe that the mismatch of the ionic\ndiffusivities induces a non-trivial salt dynamics, producing either transient\ndepletion or enhancement of salt in the pore. In the regime of high static\ndiffusion layer conductance, we obtain an analytical solution to our\nperturbation model. The solution elucidates how electrolyte asymmetry induces\ntwo charging timescales that are set by the relative pore size. In the\noverlapping-double-layer regime, these timescales reduce to the diffusion times\nof each ion such that the transport of the two ions appears to be decoupled.\nOverall, our work underscores that the asymmetry in cation and anion\ndiffusivities fundamentally alters the behavior of ionic transport inside a\ncharged cylindrical pore and opens up new avenues of research on electrolyte\ntransport in porous materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In essence,\nour FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally\ncompatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large\nmargin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD\nhas comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that\ndistill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 03:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 03:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 05:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

To answer this, we propose\nLanguage-Interfaced Fine-Tuning (LIFT) and study its efficacy and limitations\nby conducting an extensive empirical study on a suite of non-language\nclassification and regression tasks.

In this paper, the rotational\ndependence of the $\\alpha^2$-type dynamo and the cause of it are explored by\nmean-field (MF) dynamo models coupled with direct numerical simulations (DNSs)\nof MHD convections. Bearing the application to the solar/stellar dynamo in\nmind, we adopt a strongly-stratified polytrope as a model of the convective\natmosphere. Our DNS models show that the $\\alpha^2$-type dynamo is excited when\n${\\rm Ro} \\lesssim 0.1$ where ${\\rm Ro}$ is the Rossby number defined with the\nvolume-averaged mean convective velocity. From the corresponding MF models, we\ndemonstrate that the rotational dependence of the $\\alpha^2$-type dynamo is\nmainly due to the change in the magnitude of the turbulent magnetic diffusion.\nWith increasing the spin rate, the turbulent magnetic diffusion weakens while\nthe $\\alpha$-effect remains essentially unchanged over the convection zone,\nproviding the critical point for the excitation of the large-scale dynamo. The\n${\\rm Ro}$-dependence of the stellar magnetic activity observable in the cool\nstar is also discussed from the viewpoint of the rotational dependence of the\nturbulent electro-motive force. Overall our results suggest that, to get a\nbetter grasp of the stellar dynamo activity and its ${\\rm Ro}$-dependence, it\nshould be quantified how the convection velocity changes with the stellar spin\nrate with taking account of the rotational quenching and the Lorentz force\nfeedback from the magnetic field on the convective turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

When a $k$-local\nfunction is also a class function, we give an explicit rule for calculating its\nexpansion in the basis $\\{ \\chi^{\\lambda} \\}$ of irreducible\n$\\mathfrak{S}_n$-characters.

Existing solutions\neither assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple\nfluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for\nreal-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the\nfirst method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics\n(ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos\nwithout taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary\nconditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene\nrepresentation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity\nsolution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects.\nWith a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid\ninteractions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without\nadditional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural\nradiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from\nthe supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization\nfrom sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to\nprogressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models\nwith a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color\nambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained\ndensity-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to\navoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills\nphysical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed\nconstraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and\nreal flow captures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 03:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The notion, however, restricts the ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) associated with an LPP to have only finitely many equilibria. This\nrestriction places an intrinsic limitation on the model. As a result, a number\nis computable by an LPP if and only if it is algebraic, namely, not a single\ntranscendental number can be computed under this notion.\n  In this paper, we lift the finitary requirement on equilibria. That is, we\nconsider systems with a continuum of equilibria. We show that essentially all\nnumbers in [0,1] that are computable by bounded general-purpose analog\ncomputers (GPACs) or chemical reaction networks (CRNs) can also be computed by\nLPPs under this new definition. This implies a rich series of numbers (e.g.,\nthe reciprocal of Euler's constant, $\\pi/4$, Euler's $\\gamma$, Catalan's\nconstant, and Dottie number) are all computable by LPPs. Our proof is\nconstructive: We develop an algorithm that transfers bounded GPACs/CRNs into\nLPPs. Our algorithm also fixes a gap in Bournez et al.'s construction of LPPs\ndesigned to compute any arbitrary algebraic number in [0,1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 05:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Since SpGEMM is a well-known memory-bounded\napplication with vast and irregular memory accesses, considering the memory\naccess efficiency is of critical importance for SpGEMM's performance. Yet, the\nexisting methods put less consideration into the memory subsystem and achieved\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the memory access\npatterns of SpGEMM and their influences on the memory subsystem. Based on the\nanalysis, we propose a novel and more efficient accumulation method named\nBRMerge for the multi-core CPU architectures.\n  The BRMerge accumulation method follows the row-wise dataflow. It first\naccesses the $B$ matrix, generates the intermediate lists for one output row,\nand stores these intermediate lists in a consecutive memory space, which is\nimplemented by a ping-pong buffer. It then immediately merges these\nintermediate lists generated in the previous phase two by two in a tree-like\nhierarchy between two ping-pong buffers. The architectural benefits of BRMerge\nare 1) streaming access patterns, 2) minimized TLB cache miss rate, and 3)\nreasonably high L1/L2 cache hit rates, which result in both low access latency\nand high bandwidth utilization when performing SpGEMM. Based on the BRMerge\naccumulation method, we propose two SpGEMM libraries named BRMerge-Upper and\nBRMerge-Precise, which use different allocation methods. Performance\nevaluations with 26 commonly used benchmarks on two CPU servers show that the\nproposed SpGEMM libraries significantly outperform the state-of-the-art SpGEMM\nlibraries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 06:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 08:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

The previous methods generally address the core problem of\nvisual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with\nmanually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated\nbut also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this,\nwe first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by\nTransformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box\ncoordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be\nreplaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher\nperformance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone\nagainst uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited\nvisual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to\nsub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make\ntwo-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely\nTransformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature\nencoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that\nremoves external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for\nvision-language fusion at the intermediate layers.

It is therefore of great necessity to facilitate\narchitecture adaptation across various devices. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple framework, Slimmable Domain Adaptation, to improve cross-domain\ngeneralization with a weight-sharing model bank, from which models of different\ncapacities can be sampled to accommodate different accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. The main challenge in this framework lies in simultaneously\nboosting the adaptation performance of numerous models in the model bank. To\ntackle this problem, we develop a Stochastic EnsEmble Distillation method to\nfully exploit the complementary knowledge in the model bank for inter-model\ninteraction. Nevertheless, considering the optimization conflict between\ninter-model interaction and intra-model adaptation, we augment the existing\nbi-classifier domain confusion architecture into an Optimization-Separated\nTri-Classifier counterpart. After optimizing the model bank, architecture\nadaptation is leveraged via our proposed Unsupervised Performance Evaluation\nMetric.

Crucially, we approximate the\nimportance sampling control by a neural network, which makes the algorithm in\nprinciple feasible for high dimensional applications. We can numerically\ndemonstrate in relevant metastable problems that our algorithm is more\neffective than previous attempts and that only the combination of the two\napproaches leads to a satisfying convergence and therefore to an efficient\nsampling in certain metastable settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 06:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The two distinct superconducting gaps, one for each\nspin-orbit split band, consist of a mixture of s-wave and f-wave components.\nTheir different amplitudes are due to different normal densities of states of\nthe two bands at the Fermi level. Using a microscopic multiband BCS approach,\nwe derive and self-consistently solve the gap equation, demonstrating the\nstability of nontrivial solutions in a realistic parameter range. We find a\nuniversal behavior of the temperature dependence of the gaps and of the\ncritical in-plane field which is consistent with various sets of existing\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

We here\nintroduce spatio-temporal heterogeneity of social resources and explore their\nconsequences on involution. When spatial heterogeneity is applied, network\nreciprocity can mitigate the involution for rich resources, which would be\ncritical otherwise in a homogeneous population.

It has been widely observed that a teacher minimizing the empirical\nrisk not necessarily yields the best performing student, suggesting a\nfundamental discrepancy between the common practice in teacher network training\nand the distillation objective. To fill this gap, we propose a novel\nstudent-oriented teacher network training framework SoTeacher, inspired by\nrecent findings that student performance hinges on teacher's capability to\napproximate the true label distribution of training samples. We theoretically\nestablished that (1) the empirical risk minimizer with proper scoring rules as\nloss function can provably approximate the true label distribution of training\ndata if the hypothesis function is locally Lipschitz continuous around training\nsamples; and (2) when data augmentation is employed for training, an additional\nconstraint is required that the minimizer has to produce consistent predictions\nacross augmented views of the same training input. In light of our theory,\nSoTeacher renovates the empirical risk minimization by incorporating Lipschitz\nregularization and consistency regularization. It is worth mentioning that\nSoTeacher is applicable to almost all teacher-student architecture pairs,\nrequires no prior knowledge of the student upon teacher's training, and induces\nalmost no computation overhead. Experiments on two benchmark datasets confirm\nthat SoTeacher can improve student performance significantly and consistently\nacross various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

In a\ndeterministic inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions\ncorrespond to different regularization terms for each solution in the sum.\nAlthough various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus\non the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse solution and a smooth\nsolution. For computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection\nmethods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and\ngeneralized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach integrates techniques from the\ngeneralized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods.

However, there are various ways\nto physically implement qubits in different physical devices and manipulate\nthose qubits. These differences lead to different communication methods and\nconnection topologies, with each vendor implementing its own set of primitive\ngates. Therefore, quantum circuits have to be rewritten or transformed in order\nto be transplanted from one platform to another. We propose a pattern\nmatching-based framework for rewriting quantum circuits, called QRewriting. It\ntakes advantage of a new representation of quantum circuits using symbol\nsequences. Unlike the traditional way of using directed acyclic graphs, the new\nrepresentation allows us to easily identify the patterns that appear\nnon-consecutively but reducible. Then, we convert the problem of pattern\nmatching into that of finding distinct subsequences and propose a\npolynomial-time dynamic programming-based pattern matching and replacement\nalgorithm. We develop a rule library for basic optimizations and use it to\nrewrite the Arithmetic and Toffoli benchmarks from the $G_{IBM}$ gate set to\nthe $G_{Sur}$ gate set.

Understanding\nthe generalization of quantum models is essential to realizing similar speedups\non problems of practical interest. Recent results demonstrate that\ngeneralization is hindered by the exponential size of the quantum feature\nspace. Although these results suggest that quantum models cannot generalize\nwhen the number of qubits is large, in this paper we show that these results\nrely on overly restrictive assumptions. We consider a wider class of models by\nvarying a hyperparameter that we call quantum kernel bandwidth. We analyze the\nlarge-qubit limit and provide explicit formulas for the generalization of a\nquantum model that can be solved in closed form.

Self-organized vegetation\npatterns are a remarkable characteristic of these ecosystems; apart from being\nvisually captivating, patterns modulate the system-response to increasing\nenvironmental stress. Empirical studies hinted that herbivory is one the key\nregulatory mechanism behind pattern formation and overall ecosystem\nfunctioning. However most of the mathematical models have taken a mean-field\nstrategy to grazing; foraging has been considered to be independent of spatial\ndistribution of vegetation. To this end, an extended version of the celebrated\nplant-water model due to Klausmeier, has been taken as the base here. To\nencompass the effect of heterogeneous vegetation distribution on foraging\nintensity and subsequent impact on entire ecosystem, grazing is considered here\nto depend on spatially weighted average vegetation density, instead of density\nat a particular point. Moreover, varying influence of vegetation at any\nlocation over gazing elsewhere, is incorporated by choosing suitable averaging\nfunction. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that inclusion of spatial\nnon-locality, alters the understanding of system dynamics significantly. The\ngrazing ecosystem is found to be more resilient to increasing aridity than it\nwas anticipated to be in earlier studies on non-local grazing. The\nsystem-response to rising environmental pressure is also observed to vary\ndepending on the grazer. Obtained results also suggest possibility of\nmulti-stability due the history-dependence of system-response. Overall, this\nwork indicates that the spatial heterogeneity in grazing intensity has a\ndecisive role to play in the functioning of water-limited ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 08:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2022 14:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

Current decoy-state QKD setups operate at GHz repetition rates, a\nregime where memory effects in the modulators and electronics that control them\ncreate correlations between the intensities of the emitted pulses. This\ntranslates into information leakage about the selected intensities, which\ncripples a crucial premise of the decoy-state method, thus invalidating the use\nof standard security analyses. To overcome this problem, a novel security proof\nthat exploits the Cauchy-Schwarz constraint has been introduced recently. Its\nmain drawback is, however, that the achievable key rate is significantly lower\nthan that of the ideal scenario without intensity correlations. Here, we\nimprove this security proof technique by combining it with a fine-grained\ndecoy-state analysis, which can deliver a tight estimation of the relevant\nparameters that determine the secret key rate. This results in a notable\nperformance enhancement, being now the attainable distance double than that of\nprevious analyses for certain parameter regimes.

A key element of this proposal is the charge at which convexity\nmust appear, which was proposed to never be parametrically large. In this\npaper, we develop this constraint in the context of multiple Abelian global\nsymmetries. We propose the statement that the convex directions in the\nmulti-dimensional charge space should generate a sub-lattice of the total\nlattice of charged operators, such that the index of this sub-lattice cannot be\nmade parametrically large. In the special case of two-dimensional CFTs, the\nindex can be made parametrically large, which we prove by an explicit example.\nHowever, we also prove that in two dimensions there always exist convex\ndirections generating a sub-lattice with an index bounded by the current levels\nof the global symmetry. Therefore, in two dimensions, the conjecture should be\nslightly modified to account for the current levels, and then it can be proven.\nIn more than two dimensions, we show that the index of the sub-lattice\ngenerated by marginally convex charge vectors associated to BPS operators only,\ncan be made parametrically large.

The overall polarization degree of $1.8 \\pm 0.3$% is detected\nby summing over a large region, assuming circular symmetry for the polarization\nvectors. The measurements imply an average polarization degree for the\nsynchrotron component of $\\sim 2.5$%, and close to 5% for the X-ray\nsynchrotron-domimated forward-shock region. These numbers are based on an\nassessment of the thermal and non-thermal radiation contributions, for which we\nused a detailed spatial-spectral model based on Chandra X-ray data. A\npixel-by-pixel search for polarization provides a few tentative detections from\ndiscrete regions at the $\\sim 3\\sigma$ confidence level. Given the number of\npixels, the significance is {insufficient} to claim a detection for individual\npixels, but implies considerable turbulence on scales smaller than the angular\nresolution. Cas A's X-ray continuum emission is dominated by synchrotron\nradiation from regions within $\\lesssim 10^{17}$ cm of the forward- and reverse\nshocks. We find that i) the measured polarization angle corresponds to a\nradially-oriented magnetic field, similar to what has been inferred from radio\nobservations; ii) the X-ray polarization degree is lower than in the radio band\n($\\sim 5$%). Since shock compression should impose a tangential magnetic field\nstructure, the IXPE results imply that magnetic-fields are reoriented within\n$\\sim 10^{17}$cm of the shock. If the magnetic-field alignment is due to\nlocally enhanced acceleration near quasi-parallel shocks, the preferred X-ray\npolarization angle suggests a size of $3\\times 10^{16}$ cm for cells with\nradial magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 09:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 12:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

This effect may cause the difference in the SoCs to\nincrease considerably over time, leading to some batteries reaching their SoC\nlimits. These batteries would no longer be able to control the dc-link of the\nhybrid grid forming DG.

However, PICCs have a fatal drawback\nof a high frequency of tip mispositions, increasing the risk of puncture,\nembolism, and complications such as cardiac arrhythmias. To automatically and\nprecisely detect it, various attempts have been made by using the latest deep\nlearning (DL) technologies. However, even with these approaches, it is still\npractically difficult to determine the tip location because the multiple\nfragments phenomenon (MFP) occurs in the process of predicting and extracting\nthe PICC line required before predicting the tip. This study aimed to develop a\nsystem generally applied to existing models and to restore the PICC line more\nexactly by removing the MFs of the model output, thereby precisely localizing\nthe actual tip position for detecting its disposition. To achieve this, we\nproposed a multi-stage DL-based framework post-processing the PICC line\nextraction result of the existing technology.

While recent studies have made significant\nimprovements in accuracy, they typically heavily depend on pixel-level crack\nannotations, which are time-consuming to obtain. In earlier work, we proposed\nto reduce the annotation cost bottleneck by reformulating the crack\nsegmentation problem as a weakly-supervised problem -- i.e. the annotation\nprocess is expedited by sacrificing the annotation quality. The loss in\nannotation quality was remedied by refining the inference with per-pixel\nbrightness values, which was effective when the pixel brightness distribution\nbetween cracks and non-cracks are well separated, but struggled greatly for\nlighter-colored cracks as well as non-crack targets in which the brightness\ndistribution is less articulated. In this work, we propose an annotation\nrefinement approach which takes advantage of the fact that the regions falsely\nannotated as cracks have similar local visual features as the background.\nBecause the proposed approach is data-driven, it is effective regardless of a\ndataset's pixel brightness profile. The proposed method is evaluated on three\ncrack segmentation datasets as well as one blood vessel segmentation dataset to\ntest for domain robustness, and the results show that it speeds up the\nannotation process by factors of 10 to 30, while the detection accuracy stays\nat a comparable level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 10:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 01:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

Depending on the domain, this approach can be very successful.\nHowever, significant time is required to learn these expressions and the\nresulting expressions can either become very complex or inaccurate in the\npresence of dirty data. The alternative of manually writing regular expressions\nbecomes unattractive when faced with a large number of values which must be\nmatched.\n  As an alternative, we propose learning from a large corpus of manually\nauthored, but uncurated regular expressions mined from a public repository. The\nadvantage of this approach is that we are able to extract salient features from\na set of strings with limited overhead to feature engineering. Since the set of\nregular expressions covers a wide range of application domains, we expect them\nto widely applicable.\n  To demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our approach, we train a model\nusing the extracted corpus of regular expressions for the class of semantic\ntype classification. While our approach generally yields results that are\ninferior to the state of the art, our training data is much smaller and simpler\nand a closer analysis of the performance results suggests this approach holds\nsignificant promise.

In fact, defects are a source of disorder that can\nenhance the density of states and conductivity of the bulk of the system and\nthey break crystal symmetries that can protect the topological states.

Motivated by recent experiments on\nthree-dimensional (3D) topological systems such as Bi$_2$TeI and\nBi$_{14}$Rh$_3$I$_9$, we examine the effect of stacking faults on the\nelectronic properties of weak topological insulators (WTIs). Working with a\nsimple model consisting of a 3D WTI formed by weakly-coupled two-dimensional\n(2D) topological layers separated by trivial spacers, we find that 2D stacking\nfaults can carry their own, topologically nontrivial gapless states. Depending\non the WTI properties, as well as the way in which the stacking fault is\nrealized, the latter can form a topologically protected 2D semimetal, but also\na 2D topological insulator which is embedded in the higher-dimensional WTI\nbulk. This suggests the possibility of using stacking faults in real materials\nas a source of topologically nontrivial, symmetry-protected conducting states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 11:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This paper uses data from the DIII-D experiment,\ntheory, and simulations to demonstrate that resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM)\nproduce the thermal quench (TQ) in a typical locked mode shot. Analysis of the\nlinear RWTM dispersion relation shows the parameter dependence of the growth\nrate, particularly on the resistive wall time. Linear simulations of the locked\nmode equilibrium show that it is unstable with a resistive wall, and stable\nwith an ideally conducting wall. Nonlinear simulations demonstrate that the\nRWTM grows to sufficient amplitude to cause a complete thermal quench. The RWTM\ngrowth time is proportional to the thermal quench time. The nonlinearly\nsaturated RWTM magnetic perturbation amplitude agrees with experimental\nmeasurements. The onset condition is that the q = 2 rational surface is\nsufficiently close to the resistive wall. Collectively, this identifies the\nRWTM as the cause of the TQ.

In this\npaper, we provide a systematic study of SDL, including the theory, algorithm,\nand applications of SDL. First, we provide a novel framework that `lifts' SDL\nas a convex problem in a combined factor space and propose a low-rank projected\ngradient descent algorithm that converges exponentially to the global minimizer\nof the objective. We also formulate generative models of SDL and provide global\nestimation guarantees of the true parameters depending on the hyperparameter\nregime. Second, viewed as a nonconvex constrained optimization problem, we\nprovided an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm for SDL that is\nguaranteed to find an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point of the objective in\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-1}(\\log \\varepsilon^{-1})^{2})$ iterations. For the\ncorresponding generative model, we establish a novel non-asymptotic local\nconsistency result for constrained and regularized maximum likelihood\nestimation problems, which may be of independent interest.

In particular, we consider mobile devices located in an\narea where the direct link to an access point (AP) is blocked. Thus, the\ndevices try to connect to the AP via a reflected link provided by an RIS.\nTherefore, a RIS phase-shift design is desired that covers the entire blocked\narea with a wide reflection beam because the exact locations and times of\nactivity of the devices are unknown in GF transmission. In order to study the\nimpact of the phase-shift design on the device activity detection, we derive a\ngeneralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) based detector and present an\nanalytical expression for the probability of detection. Assuming knowledge of\nstatistical CSI, we formulate an optimization problem for the phase-shift\ndesign for maximization of the guaranteed probability of detection for all\nlocations within a given coverage area. To tackle the non-convexity of the\nproblem, we propose two different approximations of the objective function. The\nfirst approximation leads to a design that aims to reduce the variations of the\nend-to-end channel while taking system parameters such as transmit power, noise\npower, and probability of false alarm into account. The second approximation\ncan be adopted for versatile RIS deployments because it only depends on the\nline-of-sight component of the end-to-end channel and is not affected by system\nparameters. For comparison, we also consider a phase-shift design maximizing\nthe average channel gain and a baseline analytical phase-shift design for large\nblocked areas.

In this article, we study\nthe trade-off between teleportation fidelity and success probability for\noptimal performance of the teleportation protocol, which to the best of our\nknowledge, has never been studied before. To this end, we first derive a\nunified expression for the Wigner characteristic function describing three\nnon-Gaussian states, photon subtracted, photon added, and photon catalyzed\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum states. We then utilize it to obtain the fidelity of\nteleportation for input coherent and squeezed vacuum states using the\naforementioned non-Gaussian resource states.

We provide the associated optimal\nsqueezing and beam splitter transmissivity values for the considered\nnon-Gaussian resource states, which will be of significant interest to the\nexperimental community.

In\nrecent years, machine learning (ML) technology has received significant\nattention across industries, and this big wave has propagated various interests\nin the fluid dynamics community. Recent ML CFD studies have revealed that\ncompletely suppressing the increase in error with the increase in interval\nbetween the training and prediction times in data driven methods is\nunrealistic. The development of a practical CFD acceleration methodology that\napplies ML is a remaining issue. Therefore, the objectives of this study were\ndeveloping a realistic ML strategy based on a physics-informed transfer\nlearning and validating the accuracy and acceleration performance of this\nstrategy using an unsteady CFD dataset. This strategy can determine the timing\nof transfer learning while monitoring the residuals of the governing equations\nin a cross coupling computation framework. Consequently, our hypothesis that\ncontinuous fluid flow time series prediction is feasible was validated, as the\nintermediate CFD simulations periodically not only reduce the increased\nresiduals but also update the network parameters.

In\nan ecosystemic framework, this solvency of virtuous companies would compensate\nin accounting terms for the lack of financial solvency. The State would then be\nthe guarantor in order to facilitate their access to financing, also reduced by\nBasel III and Solvency II. This policy develops a system of reallocation of\nfinancing capacities from non-virtuous companies to the most virtuous ones with\npublic guarantees, aiming to reduce the debt ratio while increasing green\ninvestments, with monetary policies of rates but also of volumes and ratios\ndifferentiated according to the types of assets and the greening of bank\nbalance sheets, and finally forms of public-private partnership.

Based on the\nconnections among the continuous ranked probability score, the energy distance,\nthe $L_2$ discrepancy and the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler distance, we\ninvestigate the distributional convergence of the representative points and\nestablish the rate of convergence of the density regression estimator. The\nusefulness of the methodology is illustrated by modeling the conditional\ndistribution of power output given multivariate environmental factors using a\nlarge scale wind turbine data set.

However, effective management of charging stations is challenging\ndue to individual EV owners' privacy concerns, competing interests of different\nstations, and the coupling distribution network constraints. To cope with this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, the\naggregate EV power flexibility region is derived by solving an optimization\nproblem. We prove that any trajectory within the obtained region corresponds to\nat least one feasible EV dispatch strategy. By submitting this flexibility\nregion instead of the detailed EV data to the charging station operator, EV\nowners' privacy can be preserved and the computational burden can be reduced.\nIn the second stage, a distributed coordination mechanism with a clear physical\ninterpretation is developed with consideration of AC power flow constraints. We\nprove that the proposed mechanism is guaranteed to converge to the centralized\noptimum. Case studies validate the theoretical results.

This study examines the full cardiac coverage using a 3D\nconvolutional model and then reduces the number of false predictions using an\ninnovative salient region detection model. Salient regions are extracted from\nthe short-axis cine CMR stacks using a three-step proposed algorithm. Combining\nthe 3D CNN baseline model with the proposed salient region detection model\nprovides a cascade detector that can reduce the number of false negatives of\nthe baseline model. The results obtained on the images of over 6,200\nparticipants of the UK Biobank population cohort study show the superiority of\nthe proposed model over the previous state-of-the-art studies.

We also discuss sensitivity of the flavor-universal non-standard\nneutrino interactions in future observations of diffuse neutrinos from all the\npast SNe, known as the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). According\nto our analysis, observations of the DSNB in HK, JUNO and DUNE experiments can\nprobe such couplings by a factor of $\\sim 2$ beyond the SN 1987A constraint.\nHowever, our result is also subject to a large uncertainty concerning the\nprecise estimation of the DSNB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 13:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Clinical\nstudies on RBE variability have been conducted for decades for carbon\nradiation, which could advance the understanding of the clinical proton RBE\ngiven an ion-independent RBE model. In this work, such a model, linear and\nsimple, using the beam quantity Q = Z^2/E (Z = ion charge, E = kinetic energy\nper nucleon) was tested and compared to the commonly used, proton-specific and\nlinear energy transfer (LET) based Wedenberg RBE model. Material and methods:\nThe Wedenberg and Q models, both predicting RBEmax and RBEmin (i.e., RBE at\nvanishing and very high dose, respectively), are compared in terms of\nion-dependence and prediction power. An experimental in-vitro data ensemble\ncovering 115 publications for various ions was used as dataset. Results: The\nmodel parameter of the Q model was observed to be similar for different ions\n(in contrast to LET). The Q model was trained without any prior knowledge of\nproton data. For proton RBE, the differences between experimental data and\ncorresponding predictions of the Wedenberg or the Q model were highly\ncomparable. Conclusions: A simple linear RBE model using Q instead of LET was\nproposed and tested to be able to predict proton RBE using model parameter\ntrained based on only RBE data of other particles in a clinical proton energy\nrange for a large in-vitro dataset. Adding (pre)clinical knowledge from carbon\nion therapy may, therefore, reduce the dominating biological uncertainty in\nproton RBE modelling. This would translate in reduced RBE related uncertainty\nin proton therapy treatment planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 14:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

These approaches also suffer from the trouble of pre-defining a\nfixed set of labels for each type of documents, as well as the label imbalance\nissue. In this work, we assume Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been\napplied to input documents, and reformulate the KIE task as a region prediction\nproblem in the two-dimensional (2D) space given a target field. Following this\nnew setup, we develop a new KIE model named Region-based Document Understanding\n(RDU) that takes as input the text content and corresponding coordinates of a\ndocument, and tries to predict the result by localizing a bounding-box-like\nregion. Our RDU first applies a layout-aware BERT equipped with a soft layout\nattention masking and bias mechanism to incorporate layout information into the\nrepresentations. Then, a list of candidate regions is generated from the\nrepresentations via a Region Proposal Module inspired by computer vision models\nwidely applied for object detection. Finally, a Region Categorization Module\nand a Region Selection Module are adopted to judge whether a proposed region is\nvalid and select the one with the largest probability from all proposed regions\nrespectively. Experiments on four types of form-style documents show that our\nproposed method can achieve impressive results. In addition, our RDU model can\nbe trained with different document types seamlessly, which is especially\nhelpful over low-resource documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 14:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

However,\nmost existing approaches in bus travel time forecasting are based on\ndeterministic models that provide only point estimation. To this end, we\ndevelop in this paper a Bayesian probabilistic forecasting model for bus travel\ntime. To characterize the strong dependencies/interactions between consecutive\nbuses, we concatenate the link travel time vectors and the headway vector from\na pair of two adjacent buses as a new augmented variable and model it with a\nconstrained Multivariate Gaussian mixture distributions. This approach can\nnaturally capture the interactions between adjacent buses (e.g., correlated\nspeed and smooth variation of headway), handle missing values in data, and\ndepict the multimodality in bus travel time distributions. Next, we assume\ndifferent periods in a day share the same set of Gaussian components but\ndifferent mixing coefficients to characterize the systematic temporal\nvariations in bus operation. For model inference, we develop an efficient\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm to obtain the posterior\ndistributions of model parameters and make probabilistic forecasting. We test\nthe proposed model using the data from a twenty-link bus route in Guangzhou,\nChina. Results show our approach significantly outperforms baseline models that\noverlook bus-to-bus interactions in terms of both predictive means and\ndistributions. Besides forecasting, the parameters of the proposed model\ncontain rich information for understanding/improving the bus service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

However, from studies of dust in large\nsamples of galaxies, it is known that dust attenuation can vary significantly.\nHere we take advantage of state-of-the-art modeling of galaxy properties to\ncharacterize dust parameters (dust attenuation $A_V$, and a parameter\ndescribing the dust law slope $R_V$) for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SN Ia\nhost galaxies using the publicly available \\texttt{BAGPIPES} code. Utilizing\noptical and infrared data of the hosts alone, we find three key aspects of host\ndust that impact SN Ia cosmology: 1) there exists a large range ($\\sim1-6$) of\nhost $R_V$ 2) high stellar mass hosts have $R_V$ on average $\\sim0.7$ lower\nthan that of low-mass hosts 3) there is a significant ($>3\\sigma$) correlation\nbetween the Hubble diagram residuals of red SNe Ia that when corrected for\nreduces scatter by $\\sim13\\%$ and the significance of the ``mass step'' to\n$\\sim1\\sigma$. These represent independent confirmations of recent predictions\nbased on dust that attempted to explain the puzzling ``mass step'' and\nintrinsic scatter ($\\sigma_{\\rm int}$) in SN Ia analyses. We also find that\nred-sequence galaxies have both lower and more peaked dust law slope\ndistributions on average in comparison to non red-sequence galaxies. We find\nthat the SN Ia $\\beta$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm int}$ both differ by $>3\\sigma$ when\ndetermined separately for red-sequence galaxy and all other galaxy hosts. The\nagreement between fitted host-$R_V$ and SN Ia $\\beta$ \\& $\\sigma_{\\rm int}$\nsuggests that host dust properties play a major role in SN Ia color-luminosity\nstandardization and supports the claim that SN Ia intrinsic scatter is driven\nby $R_V$ variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

No consensus has been reached on how to mitigate this issue,\nalthough a widely discussed strategy consists in scaling the output of each\nlayer by a factor $\\alpha_L$. We show in a probabilistic setting that with\nstandard i.i.d. initializations, the only non-trivial dynamics is for $\\alpha_L\n= 1/\\sqrt{L}$ (other choices lead either to explosion or to identity mapping).\nThis scaling factor corresponds in the continuous-time limit to a neural\nstochastic differential equation, contrarily to a widespread interpretation\nthat deep ResNets are discretizations of neural ordinary differential\nequations. By contrast, in the latter regime, stability is obtained with\nspecific correlated initializations and $\\alpha_L = 1/L$.

Modern techniques commonly capitalize on a\npre-trained object detector/classifier to mine the semantics in an image, while\nleaving the inherent linguistic ordering of semantics under-exploited. In this\npaper, we propose a new recipe of Transformer-style structure, namely\nComprehending and Ordering Semantics Networks (COS-Net), that novelly unifies\nan enriched semantic comprehending and a learnable semantic ordering processes\ninto a single architecture. Technically, we initially utilize a cross-modal\nretrieval model to search the relevant sentences of each image, and all words\nin the searched sentences are taken as primary semantic cues. Next, a novel\nsemantic comprehender is devised to filter out the irrelevant semantic words in\nprimary semantic cues, and meanwhile infer the missing relevant semantic words\nvisually grounded in the image. After that, we feed all the screened and\nenriched semantic words into a semantic ranker, which learns to allocate all\nsemantic words in linguistic order as humans. Such sequence of ordered semantic\nwords are further integrated with visual tokens of images to trigger sentence\ngeneration.

Modern deep learning models leverage motion by\neither executing spatio-temporal 3D convolutions, factorizing 3D convolutions\ninto spatial and temporal convolutions separately, or computing self-attention\nalong temporal dimension. The implicit assumption behind such successes is that\nthe feature maps across consecutive frames can be nicely aggregated.\nNevertheless, the assumption may not always hold especially for the regions\nwith large deformation. In this paper, we present a new recipe of inter-frame\nattention block, namely Stand-alone Inter-Frame Attention (SIFA), that novelly\ndelves into the deformation across frames to estimate local self-attention on\neach spatial location. Technically, SIFA remoulds the deformable design via\nre-scaling the offset predictions by the difference between two frames. Taking\neach spatial location in the current frame as the query, the locally deformable\nneighbors in the next frame are regarded as the keys/values. Then, SIFA\nmeasures the similarity between query and keys as stand-alone attention to\nweighted average the values for temporal aggregation. We further plug SIFA\nblock into ConvNets and Vision Transformer, respectively, to devise SIFA-Net\nand SIFA-Transformer. Extensive experiments conducted on four video datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of SIFA-Net and SIFA-Transformer as stronger\nbackbones. More remarkably, SIFA-Transformer achieves an accuracy of 83.1% on\nKinetics-400 dataset.

On the\nother hand, experimental processing parameter optimization recommends a\nsystematic, and consequently time-consuming, investigation over the available\nprocessing parameter space. An intelligent strategy is to employ machine\nlearning (ML) techniques to capture the relationship between picosecond laser\nmachining parameters for finding proper parameter combinations to create the\ndesired cuts on industrial-grade alumina ceramic with deep, smooth and\ndefect-free patterns. Laser parameters such as beam amplitude and frequency,\nscanner passing speed and the number of passes over the surface, as well as the\nvertical distance of the scanner from the sample surface, are used for\npredicting the depth, top width, and bottom width of the engraved channels\nusing ML models.

The emerging high-quality large-scale connectomic\ndatasets raise the question of what general functional principles can be\ngleaned from structural information such as the distribution of\nexcitatory/inhibitory synapse types and the distribution of synaptic weights.\nMotivated by this question, we developed a statistical mechanical theory of\nlearning in neural networks that incorporates structural information as\nconstraints.

Often\nundiagnosed heart attacks can hit people by surprise since many current medical\nplans don't cover the costs to require the searching of calcification on these\nscans. Only if someone is suspected to have a heart problem, a gated CT scan is\ntaken, otherwise, there's no way for the patient to be aware of a possible\nheart attack/disease. While nongated CT scans are more periodically taken, it\nis harder to detect calcification and is usually taken for a purpose other than\nlocating calcification in arteries. In fact, in real time coronary artery\ncalcification scores are only calculated on gated CT scans, not nongated CT\nscans. After training a unet model on the Coronary Calcium and chest CT's gated\nscans, it received a DICE coefficient of 0.95 on its untouched test set. This\nmodel was used to predict on nongated CT scans, performing with a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 674.19 and bucket classification accuracy of 41% (5 classes).\nThrough the analysis of the images and the information stored in the images,\nmathematical equations were derived and used to automatically crop the images\naround the location of the heart. By performing semi-supervised learning the\nnew cropped nongated scans were able to closely resemble gated CT scans,\nimproving the performance by 91% in MAE (62.38) and 23% in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 20:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 03:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

As annotating large\namounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs\nfrequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect\ncategory detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and\nfew methods are available. In this paper, we propose a novel label-enhanced\nprototypical network (LPN) for multi-label few-shot aspect category detection.\nThe highlights of LPN can be summarized as follows. First, it leverages label\ndescription as auxiliary knowledge to learn more discriminative prototypes,\nwhich can retain aspect-relevant information while eliminating the harmful\neffect caused by irrelevant aspects. Second, it integrates with contrastive\nlearning, which encourages that the sentences with the same aspect label are\npulled together in embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart the\nsentences with different aspect labels. In addition, it introduces an adaptive\nmulti-label inference module to predict the aspect count in the sentence, which\nis simple yet effective. Extensive experimental results on three datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed model LPN can consistently achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 02:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}
