More recently, a more general form of\nsorting on partially ordered sets (or posets), where some pairs of elements are\nincomparable, has been studied. General poset sorting algorithms have a\nlower-bound query complexity of $\\Omega(wn + n \\log n)$, where $w$ is the width\nof the poset.\n  We consider the problem of sorting in trees, a particular case of partial\norders, and parametrize the complexity with respect to $d$, the maximum degree\nof an element in the tree, as $d$ is usually much smaller than $w$ in trees.\nFor example, in complete binary trees, $d = \\Theta(1), w = \\Theta(n)$. We\npresent a randomized algorithm for sorting a tree poset in worst-case expected\n$O(dn\\log n)$ query and time complexity. This improves the previous upper bound\nof $O(dn \\log^2 n)$. Our algorithm is the first to be optimal for\nbounded-degree trees. We also provide a new lower bound of $\\Omega(dn + n \\log\nn)$ for the worst-case query complexity of sorting a tree poset. Finally, we\npresent the first deterministic algorithm for sorting tree posets that has\nlower total complexity than existing algorithms for sorting general partial\norders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 16:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 14:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Recently,\ndown-sampling has proved effective in genetic programming (GP) runs that\nutilize the lexicase parent selection technique. Although this down-sampling\nprocedure has been shown to significantly improve performance across a variety\nof problems, it does not seem to do so due to encouraging adaptability through\nenvironmental change. We hypothesize that the random sampling that is performed\nevery generation causes discontinuities that result in the population being\nunable to adapt to the shifting environment. We investigate modifications to\ndown-sampled lexicase selection in hopes of promoting incremental environmental\nchange to scaffold evolution by reducing the amount of jarring discontinuities\nbetween the environments of successive generations. In our empirical studies,\nwe find that forcing incremental environmental change is not significantly\nbetter for evolving solutions to program synthesis problems than simple random\ndown-sampling. In response to this, we attempt to exacerbate the hypothesized\nprevalence of discontinuities by using only disjoint down-samples to see if it\nhinders performance. We find that this also does not significantly differ from\nthe performance of regular random down-sampling.

However, a downside of the\nwideband regime is that obtaining channel state information is costly, and the\ncapacity of previously used modulation schemes such as code division multiple\naccess and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing begins to diverge from\nthe capacity bound without channel state information. Impulsive frequency shift\nkeying and wideband time frequency coding have been shown to perform well in\nthe wideband regime without channel state information, thus avoiding the costs\nand challenges associated with obtaining channel state information. However,\nthe maximum likelihood receiver is a bank of frequency-selective filters, which\nis very costly to implement due to the large number of filters. In this work,\nwe aim to simplify the receiver by using an analog compressed sensing receiver\nwith chipping sequences as correlating signals to detect the sparse signals.\nOur results show that using a compressed sensing receiver allows for the\nsimplification of the analog receiver with the trade off of a slight\ndegradation in recovery performance.

In the present work, we implement the\ncorresponding approach to solve for valence space effective electromagnetic\noperators. To this end, we use the NCSM results for $A=16-18$, obtained at\n$N_{\\rm max}=4$, to derive a charge-dependent version of the effective\ninteraction for the $sd$ shell, which allows us to exactly reproduce selected\nNCSM spectra of $^{18}$O, $^{18}$F and $^{18}$Ne within the two valence nucleon\nspace.

It was previously shown how to use the well-known\nsolitonic solutions of the KdV equation to construct \"solitonic\" electric\nfields that do not create scalar pairs with an arbitrary fixed momentum. We\nshow that this construction can be adapted to the fermionic case in two\ninequivalent ways, both leading to the vanishing of the pair-creation rate at\ncertain values of the P\\\"oschl-Teller like index $p$ of the associated\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Thus for any given momentum we can construct electric\nfields that create scalar particles but not spinor particles, and also the\nother way round. Therefore, while often spin is even neglected in Schwinger\npair creation, in such cases it becomes decisive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 16:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In these\nsettings, performing actions at each time step quickly accumulates costs\nleading to vastly suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, repeatedly acting produces\nwear and tear and ultimately, damage.

As the enhancement of heat transfer is\none of the most important aspects of turbulence from an engineering\nperspective, it is also important to study how turbulent heat fluxes are\ntransported in space and in scale by nonlinear multi-scale interactions in wall\nturbulence as well as turbulent energy. In the present study, the spectral\ntransport budgets of turbulent heat fluxes are investigated based on direct\nnumerical simulation data of a turbulent plane Couette flow with a passive\nscalar heat transfer. The transport budgets of spanwise spectra of temperature\nfluctuation and velocity-temperature correlations are investigated in detail in\ncomparison to those of the corresponding Reynolds stress spectra. The\nsimilarity and difference between those scale-by-scale transports are\ndiscussed, with a particular focus on the roles of interscale transport and\nspatial turbulent diffusion.

During the final of the passing competition,\nthe TUM team reached speeds and accelerations close to the limit of the\nvehicle, peaking at around 270 km/h and 28 ms2. This paper will present details\nof the vehicle hardware platform, the developed algorithms, and the workflow to\ntest and enhance the software applied during the two-year project. We derive\ndeep insights into the autonomous vehicle's behavior at high speed and high\nacceleration by providing a detailed competition analysis. Based on this, we\ndeduce a list of lessons learned and provide insights on promising areas of\nfuture work based on the real-world evaluation of the displayed concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 17:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 08:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Software testing is an important activity for identifying\nproblematic code and helping to produce high-quality software. However, testing\nof research software is difficult due to the complexity of the underlying\nscience, relatively unknown results from scientific algorithms, and the culture\nof the research software community. Aims: The goal of this paper is to better\nunderstand current testing practices, identify challenges, and provide\nrecommendations on how to improve the testing process for research software\ndevelopment. Method: We surveyed members of the research software developer\ncommunity to collect information regarding their knowledge about and use of\nsoftware testing in their projects. Results: We analysed 120 responses and\nidentified that even though research software developers report they have an\naverage level of knowledge about software testing, they still find it difficult\ndue to the numerous challenges involved. However, there are a number of ways,\nsuch as proper training, that can improve the testing process for research\nsoftware. Conclusions: Testing can be challenging for any type of software.\nThis difficulty is especially present in the development of research software,\nwhere software engineering activities are typically given less attention.

However, existing generative models\noften fall short under the high diversity of clothing shapes and textures.\nFurthermore, the generation process is even desired to be intuitively\ncontrollable for layman users. In this work, we present a text-driven\ncontrollable framework, Text2Human, for a high-quality and diverse human\ngeneration. We synthesize full-body human images starting from a given human\npose with two dedicated steps. 1) With some texts describing the shapes of\nclothes, the given human pose is first translated to a human parsing map. 2)\nThe final human image is then generated by providing the system with more\nattributes about the textures of clothes. Specifically, to model the diversity\nof clothing textures, we build a hierarchical texture-aware codebook that\nstores multi-scale neural representations for each type of texture. The\ncodebook at the coarse level includes the structural representations of\ntextures, while the codebook at the fine level focuses on the details of\ntextures. To make use of the learned hierarchical codebook to synthesize\ndesired images, a diffusion-based transformer sampler with mixture of experts\nis firstly employed to sample indices from the coarsest level of the codebook,\nwhich then is used to predict the indices of the codebook at finer levels.

To\ninitialize each fiber path, we use finite element analysis to calculate the\nstress field on the object and greedily \"walk\" in the direction of the stress\nfield.

Here\nwe add a new example, the \"Arrow\" system, to the growing list of classical\nsystems that possess incompatible variables. We show how classical probability\ntheory can be extended to include any system with incompatible variables in a\ngeneral incompatible variables (GIV) theory. We then show how the QM theory of\nelementary systems emerges naturally from the GIV framework when the\nfundamental variables are taken to be the symmetries of the states of the\nsystem. This result follows primarily because in QM the symmetries of the\nPoincare group play a double role, not only as the operators which transform\nthe states under symmetry transformations but also as the fundamental variables\nof the system. The incompatibility of the QM variables is then seen to be just\nthe incompatibility of the corresponding space-time symmetries.

Finally, we show that any\nprobabilistic system (classical or quantal) that possesses incompatible\nvariables will show not only uncertainty, but also interference in its\nprobability patterns. Thus the GIV framework provides the basis for a broader\nperspective from which to view QM: quantal systems are a subset of the set of\nall systems possessing incompatible variables (and hence showing uncertainty\nand interference), namely the subset in which the incompatible variables are\nincompatible symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 16:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Measurement and\nclassical computing costs, however, increase exponentially in the system size -\na bottleneck given the scale of existing and near-term quantum devices. Here,\nwe demonstrate a scalable and practical QST approach that uses a single\nmeasurement setting, namely symmetric informationally complete (SIC) positive\noperator-valued measures (POVM).

Combining this SIC tomography with the recently developed\nrandomized measurement toolbox (\"classical shadows\") proves to be a powerful\ncombination. SIC tomography alleviates the need for choosing measurement\nsettings at random (\"derandomization\"), while classical shadows enable the\nestimation of arbitrary polynomial functions of the density matrix orders of\nmagnitudes faster than standard methods. The latter enables in-depth\nentanglement studies, which we experimentally showcase on a 5-qubit absolutely\nmaximally entangled (AME) state.

Although satisfactory lens modeling is\ngenerally achieved without accounting for these azimuthal structures, the\nquestion about their impact on inferred lens parameters remains, in particular,\non time delays as they are used in time-delay cosmography. This paper aims at\ncharacterizing these effects and quantifying their impact considering realistic\namplitudes of the variations. We achieved this goal by creating mock lensing\ngalaxies with morphologies based on two data sets: observational data of local\nelliptical galaxies, and hydrodynamical simulations of elliptical galaxies at a\ntypical lens redshift. We then simulated images of the lensing systems with\nspace-based data quality and modeled them in a standard way to assess the\nimpact of a lack of azimuthal freedom in the lens model. We find that twists in\nlensing galaxies are easily absorbed in homoeidal lens models by a change in\norientation of the lens up to 10{\\deg} with respect to the reference\norientation at the Einstein radius, and of the shear by up to 20{\\deg} with\nrespect to the input shear orientation. The ellipticity gradients, on the other\nhand, can introduce a substantial amount of shear that may impact the radial\nmass model and consequently bias $H_0$, up to 10 km/s/Mpc. However, we find\nthat light is a good tracer of azimuthal structures, meaning that direct\nimaging should be capable of diagnosing their presence. This in turn implies\nthat such a large bias is unlikely to be unaccounted for in standard modeling\npractices. Furthermore, the overall impact of twists and ellipticity gradients\naverages out at a population level.

This work uses 1565\nwide ( > 100 au) WD+WD binaries and 24 new triples containing at least two WDs\nto test the accuracy and validity of WD total age determinations. For these\n1589 wide double-WD binaries and triples, we derive total ages of each WD using\nphotometric data from all-sky surveys, in conjunction with Gaia parallaxes and\ncurrent hydrogen-atmosphere WD models. Ignoring initial-to-final-mass relations\nand considering only WD cooling ages, we find that roughly 21-36% of the more\nmassive WDs in a system have a shorter cooling age.

The difficulty\nis that there is dissipation. A self-gravitating system, confined by its own\ngravity to a bounded region, radiates some of the charges away into the\nenvironment. At a formal level, dissipation implies that some diffeomorphisms\nare not Hamiltonian. In fact, there is no Hamiltonian on phase space that would\nmove the region relative to the fields. Recently, an extension of the covariant\nphase space has been introduced to resolve the issue. On the extended phase\nspace, the Komar charges are Hamiltonian. They are generators of dressed\ndiffeomorphisms. While the construction is sound, the physical significance is\nunclear. We provide a critical review before developing a geometric approach\nthat takes into account dissipation in a novel way. Our approach is based on\nmetriplectic geometry, a framework used in the description of dissipative\nsystems. Instead of the Poisson bracket, we introduce a Leibniz bracket - a sum\nof a skew-symmetric and a symmetric bracket. The symmetric term accounts for\nthe loss of charge due to radiation.

Nesting methods based on\nheuristics are a mature technology, and currently, the only practical solution\nto this problem. However, recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer\nProgramming (MIP) solvers, together with the known limitations of the\nheuristics methods, have encouraged the exploration of exact optimization\nmodels for nesting during the last decade. Despite the research effort, the\ncurrent family of exact MIP models for nesting cannot efficiently solve both\nlarge problem instances and instances containing polygons with complex\ngeometries.

Our study is situated at the intersection of two pivotal shifts in\nworkplace dynamics: (a) the increase in online workplace communications due to\nremote work, and (b) the resurgence of the labor movement and an increase in\ncollective action in workplaces -- especially in the tech industry, where this\nphenomenon has been dubbed the tech worker movement. Through a series of\nqualitative interviews with 29 tech workers involved in collective action, we\ninvestigate how labor organizers assess and mitigate risks to privacy while\nengaging in these actions. Among the most common risks that organizers\nexperienced are retaliation from their employer, lateral worker conflict,\nemotional burnout, and the possibility of information about the collective\neffort leaking to management. Depending on the nature and source of the risk,\norganizers use a blend of digital security practices and community-based\nmechanisms. We find that digital security practices are more relevant when the\nthreat comes from management, while community management and moderation are\ncentral to protecting organizers from lateral worker conflict. Since labor\norganizing is a collective rather than individual project, individual privacy\nand collective privacy are intertwined, sometimes in conflict and often\nmutually constitutive. Notions of privacy that solely center individuals are\noften incompatible with the needs of organizers, who noted that safety in\nnumbers could only be achieved when workers presented a united front to\nmanagement. We conclude with design recommendations that can help create safer,\nmore secure and more private tools to better address the risks that organizers\nface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 18:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

In a naive implementation, the ensemble\napproach has high computational cost and high memory demand. This challenges in\nparticular modern deep learning, where even a single deep network is already\ndemanding in terms of compute and memory, and has given rise to a number of\nattempts to emulate the model ensemble without actually instantiating separate\nensemble members.

Empirically, FiLM-Ensemble outperforms other implicit\nensemble methods, and it and comes very close to the upper bound of an explicit\nensemble of networks (sometimes even beating it), at a fraction of the memory\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 18:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 13:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 13:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 07:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

The SSD\nfields have consequences for solar granular convection, basal flux, as well as\nchromospheric heating. A similar SSD mechanism is expected to be active in the\nnear-surface convection of other cool main-sequence stars, but this has never\nbeen investigated. We aim to investigate changes in stratification and\nconvection due to inclusion of SSD fields for F3V, G2V, K0V and M0V spectral\ntypes in the near-surface convection. 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of\nthe four stellar boxes, covering the subsurface convection zone up to the lower\nphotosphere in a small cartesian box, are studied using the \\textit{MURaM}\nradiative-MHD simulation code. The SSD runs are compared against reference\nhydrodynamic runs. An SSD is found to efficiently produce magnetic field with\nenergies ranging between 5\\% to 80\\% of the plasma kinetic energy at different\ndepths. This ratio tends to be larger for larger $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The\nrelative change in density and gas pressure stratification for the deeper\nconvective layers due to SSD magnetic fields is negligible, except for the\nF-star. For the F-star, there is a substantial reduction in convective\nvelocities due to Lorentz force feedback from magnetic fields, which, in turn,\nreduces the turbulent pressure. SSD in near-surface convection for cool\nmain-sequence stars introduces small but significant changes in thermodynamic\nstratification (especially for the F-star) due to reduction in convective\nvelocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 19:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Yet, improved fairness\noften comes at the expense of model accuracy. While aspects of the\nfairness-accuracy tradeoff have been studied, most work reports the fairness\nand accuracy of various models separately; this makes model comparisons nearly\nimpossible without a model-agnostic metric that reflects the balance of the two\ndesiderata. We seek to identify, quantify, and optimize the empirical Pareto\nfrontier of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. Specifically, we identify and\noutline the empirical Pareto frontier through\nTradeoff-between-Fairness-and-Accuracy (TAF) Curves; we then develop a metric\nto quantify this Pareto frontier through the weighted area under the TAF Curve\nwhich we term the Fairness-Area-Under-the-Curve (FAUC). TAF Curves provide the\nfirst empirical, model-agnostic characterization of the Pareto frontier, while\nFAUC provides the first metric to impartially compare model families on both\nfairness and accuracy. Both TAF Curves and FAUC can be employed with all group\nfairness definitions and accuracy measures. Next, we ask: Is it possible to\nexpand the empirical Pareto frontier and thus improve the FAUC for a given\ncollection of fitted models? We answer affirmately by developing a novel fair\nmodel stacking framework, FairStacks, that solves a convex program to maximize\nthe accuracy of model ensemble subject to a score-bias constraint. We show that\noptimizing with FairStacks always expands the empirical Pareto frontier and\nimproves the FAUC; we additionally study other theoretical properties of our\nproposed approach. Finally, we empirically validate TAF, FAUC, and FairStacks\nthrough studies on several real benchmark data sets, showing that FairStacks\nleads to major improvements in FAUC that outperform existing algorithmic\nfairness approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 19:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

However, in\nthe typical case where the prior and posterior are nearly mutually singular, PT\nmethods are computationally prohibitive.

The few-shot paradigm is highly relevant in medical-imaging\napplications due to the scarcity of labeled data, as annotations are expensive\nand require specialized expertise. However, in medical imaging, few-shot\nlearning research is sparse, limited to private data sets and is at its early\nstage. In particular, the few-shot setting is of high interest in histology due\nto the diversity and fine granularity of cancer related tissue classification\ntasks, and the variety of data-preparation techniques. This paper introduces a\nhighly diversified public benchmark, gathered from various public datasets, for\nfew-shot histology data classification. We build few-shot tasks and\nbase-training data with various tissue types, different levels of domain shifts\nstemming from various cancer sites, and different class-granularity levels,\nthereby reflecting realistic scenarios. We evaluate the performances of\nstate-of-the-art few-shot learning methods on our benchmark, and observe that\nsimple fine-tuning and regularization methods achieve better results than the\npopular meta-learning and episodic-training paradigm. Furthermore, we introduce\nthree scenarios based on the domain shifts between the source and target\nhistology data: near-domain, middle-domain and out-domain. Our experiments\ndisplay the potential of few-shot learning in histology classification, with\nstate-of-art few shot learning methods approaching the supervised-learning\nbaselines in the near-domain setting. In our out-domain setting, for 5-way\n5-shot, the best performing method reaches 60% accuracy.

It has become an essential element of models that describe the\nformation and evolution of baryons in massive virialized halos. The baryons'\nradiative losses in the cores of these halos might lead to massive cooling and\nvigorous star formation on the order of 10-1000 Msun/yr, whereas observations\nshow that the star formation rates are considerably less. It has now become\nclear from an observational, theoretical and simulation perspective that the\nactivity of the central SMBH compensates for gas cooling losses and prevents\nvery high star formation rates in massive galaxies, which otherwise would be\nmuch brighter than observed today. While AGN feedback is important over a broad\nrange of halo masses, the most massive objects like galaxy groups and clusters\ntruly provide outstanding laboratories for understanding the intrinsic details\nof AGN feedback. Partly, this is because in the nearby massive objects we can\ndirectly see what AGN feedback is doing to its surrounding hot halo in\nexquisite details, as opposed to less massive systems. Yet another reason is\nthat in the most massive objects, the magnitude of AGN feedback has to be\nextremely large, providing the most stringent constraints. In a nutshell, the\nAGN feedback paradigm in groups and clusters postulates that (i) a SMBH in the\ncenter of a halo can release a vast amount of energy, (ii) this energy can be\nintercepted and thermalized by the gaseous atmosphere and (iii) the system\nself-regulates so that the energy released scales with the properties of the\nhalo. A combination of multi-wavelength observations provides compelling\nevidence of the AGN feedback importance. Similarly, theoretical arguments\nsuggest that self-regulation might be a natural property of a system consisting\nof a gaseous atmosphere and a SMBH at the bottom of the potential well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 20:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

While existing\nmethods show promising performance over the conventional text-only translation\nsystems, they typically require paired text and image as input during\ninference, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this\npaper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which\nrequires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated\nvisual representations for multimodal machine translation. In particular, given\na source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to\npredict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined\ntext and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target\ntranslation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the\ntranslation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy\nlosses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency\nbetween predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments on three standard translation datasets\nwith a diverse set of language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach over both text-only baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Statistically, estimating and drawing inference on infinite\ndimensional functional parameters with sparsity (e.g., time-varying effects\nwith zero-effect time intervals) present enormous challenges. To address them,\nwe propose a new soft-thresholding operator for modeling sparse, piecewise\nsmooth and continuous time-varying coefficients in a Cox time-varying effects\nmodel. Unlike the common regularized methods, our approach enables one to\nestimate non-zero time-varying effects and detect zero regions simultaneously,\nand construct a new type of sparse confidence intervals that accommodate zero\nregions. This leads to a more interpretable model with a straightforward\ninference procedure.

With\ncarefully defined complexity parameters, we characterize this \\emph{forced\nexploration} and obtain sub-linear (logarithmic) regret of \\texttt{DNCB}.\nFurthermore, we validate our theoretical findings via experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 21:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Of particular relevance, in this\nsetting, is checking whether process executions comply with constraints of\ninterest, which at runtime calls for suitable monitoring techniques. Even\nthough event data are often stored in some sort of database, there is a lack of\ndatabase-oriented approaches to tackle compliance checking and monitoring of\n(instance-spanning) constraints. In this paper, we fill this gap by showing how\nwell-established technology from database query processing can be effectively\nused for this purpose. We propose to define an instance-spanning constraint\nthrough an ensemble of four database queries that retrieve the satisfying,\nviolating, pending-satisfying, and pending-violating cases of the constraint.\nIn this context, the problem of compliance monitoring then becomes an\napplication of techniques for incremental view maintenance, which is\nwell-developed in database query processing.

Here, we present ExD-SPIM\n(extended depth-of-field selective-plane illumination microscopy), an improved\nlight-sheet microscopy strategy that solves this limitation by extending the\ndepth of field (DOF) of high-NA detection objectives to match the thickness of\nthe illumination light sheet.

Compared to traditional SABAs, SSBAs\nare more advanced in that they have superior stealthier in bypassing mainstream\ncountermeasures that are effective against SABAs. Nonetheless, existing SSBAs\nsuffer from two major limitations. First, they can hardly achieve a good\ntrade-off between ASR (attack success rate) and FPR (false positive rate).\nBesides, they can be effectively detected by the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ncountermeasures (e.g., SCAn). To address the limitations above, we propose a\nnew class of viable source-specific backdoor attacks, coined as CASSOCK. Our\nkey insight is that trigger designs when creating poisoned data and cover data\nin SSBAs play a crucial role in demonstrating a viable source-specific attack,\nwhich has not been considered by existing SSBAs. With this insight, we focus on\ntrigger transparency and content when crafting triggers for poisoned dataset\nwhere a sample has an attacker-targeted label and cover dataset where a sample\nhas a ground-truth label.

Recent works reveal a huge\ngap between the implicit feedback and user-item relevance due to the fact that\nimplicit feedback is also closely related to the item exposure. To bridge this\ngap, existing approaches explicitly model the exposure and propose unbiased\nestimators to improve the relevance. Unfortunately, these unbiased estimators\nsuffer from the high gradient variance, especially for long-tail items, leading\nto inaccurate gradient updates and degraded model performance. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose a low-variance unbiased estimator from a probabilistic\nperspective, which effectively bounds the variance of the gradient. Unlike\nprevious works which either estimate the exposure via heuristic-based\nstrategies or use a large biased training set, we propose to estimate the\nexposure via an unbiased small-scale validation set. Specifically, we first\nparameterize the user-item exposure by incorporating both user and item\ninformation, and then construct an unbiased validation set from the biased\ntraining set. By leveraging the unbiased validation set, we adopt bi-level\noptimization to automatically update exposure-related parameters along with\nrecommendation model parameters during the learning.

To understand the material effects at the required\nlevel we have used density functional theory and modeled the electronic\nstructure of lithium atoms in different atomic environments of the\npolycrystalline Ta absorber film.

However, the total range of Li 1s shifts does not exceed 4\neV, even for extreme amorphous disorder.

Current approaches of extrapolation often assume that the treatment\neffect observed in the trial can continue indefinitely, which is unrealistic\nand may have a huge impact on decisions for resource allocation. Objective We\nintroduce a novel methodology as a possible solution to alleviate the problem\nof performing survival extrapolation with heavily censored data from clinical\ntrials. Method The main idea is to mix a flexible model (e.g., Cox\nsemi-parametric) to fit as well as possible the observed data and a parametric\nmodel encoding assumptions on the expected behaviour of underlying long-term\nsurvival. The two are \"blended\" into a single survival curve that is identical\nwith the Cox model over the range of observed times and gradually approaching\nthe parametric model over the extrapolation period based on a weight function.\nThe weight function regulates the way two survival curves are blended,\ndetermining how the internal and external sources contribute to the estimated\nsurvival over time. Results A 4-year follow-up RCT of rituximab in combination\nwith fludarabine and cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone\nfor the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is used to\nillustrate the method. Conclusion Long-term extrapolation from immature trial\ndata may lead to significantly different estimates with various modelling\nassumptions. The blending approach provides sufficient flexibility, allowing a\nwide range of plausible scenarios to be considered as well as the inclusion of\ngenuine external information, based e.g. on hard data or expert opinion. Both\ninternal and external validity can be carefully examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 00:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

One macro-level characteristic that\nhas been shown to correlate with how people perceive their inter-personal\ncommunication is personality. We specifically focus on agreeableness and\nextraversion as variables that may explain variation in ratings and therefore\nprovide a more meaningful signal for training or personalization.

Our results suggest\nthat for human-conversational agent interactions, extraversion may play a role\nin user ratings, but more data is needed to determine if the relationship is\nsignificant. Agreeableness, on the other hand, plays a statistically\nsignificant role in conversation ratings: users who are more agreeable are more\nlikely to provide a higher rating for their interaction. In addition, we found\nthat users who opted to hear the story were, in general, more likely to rate\ntheir conversational experience higher than those who did not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 00:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Accordingly,\nin this study, we propose a new method to perform Sequential learning with\nTransformer for Hand Pose (SeTHPose) estimation.

We then use a\ntransformer encoder to learn the sequential context along time or viewing\nangles and generate accurate 2D hand joint locations. Then, a graph\nconvolutional neural network with a U-Net configuration is used to convert the\n2D hand joint locations to 3D poses. Our experiments show that SeTHPose\nperforms well on both hand sequence varieties, temporal and angular.

Of particular\nsignificance is the 'cross-attention' operation, which allows a vector\nrepresentation (e.g. of an object in an image) to be learned by attending to an\narbitrarily sized set of input features. Recently, \"Masked Attention\" was\nproposed in which a given object representation only attends to those image\npixel features for which the segmentation mask of that object is active. This\nspecialization of attention proved beneficial for various image and video\nsegmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose another specialization of\nattention which enables attending over `soft-masks' (those with continuous mask\nprobabilities instead of binary values), and is also differentiable through\nthese mask probabilities, thus allowing the mask used for attention to be\nlearned within the network without requiring direct loss supervision.

While GD has optimal\nstatistical and computational complexities for estimating the true parameter\nunder the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime of the GLMs, it has\nsub-optimal complexities when the SNR is low, namely, the iterates of GD\nrequire polynomial number of iterations to reach the final statistical radius.\nThe slow convergence of GD for the low SNR case is mainly due to the local\nconvexity of the least-square loss functions of the GLMs. Even though Newton's\nmethod can be used to resolve the flat curvature of the loss functions, its\ncomputational cost is prohibitive in high-dimensional settings due to its per\niteration cost of $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$. To address the shortcomings of GD and\nNewton's method, we propose to use Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)\nquasi-Newton method to solve parameter estimation of the GLMs, which has a per\niteration cost of $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$. On the optimization side, when the SNR is\nlow, we demonstrate that iterates of BFGS converge linearly to the optimal\nsolution of the population least-square loss function, and the contraction\ncoefficient of the BFGS algorithm is comparable to that of Newton's method. On\nthe statistical side, we prove that the iterates of BFGS reach the final\nstatistical radius of the low SNR GLMs after a logarithmic number of\niterations, which is much lower than the polynomial number of iterations of GD.\nWe also present numerical experiments that match our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 03:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

However, the predetermined composition of multiple data\naugmentations brings two drawbacks. First, the artificial choice of\naugmentation types brings specific representational invariances to the model,\nwhich have different degrees of positive and negative effects on different\ndownstream tasks. Treating each type of augmentation equally during training\nmakes the model learn non-optimal representations for various downstream tasks\nand limits the flexibility to choose augmentation types beforehand. Second, the\nstrong data augmentations used in classic contrastive learning methods may\nbring too much invariance in some cases, and fine-grained information that is\nessential to some downstream tasks may be lost. This paper proposes a general\nmethod to alleviate these two problems by considering where and what to\ncontrast in a general contrastive learning framework.

This\npaper studies the problem of distributed multi-agent learning without resorting\nto centralized components or explicit communication. It examines the use of\ndistribution matching to facilitate the coordination of independent agents. In\nthe proposed scheme, each agent independently minimizes the distribution\nmismatch to the corresponding component of a target visitation distribution.\nThe theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions, each agent\nminimizing its individual distribution mismatch allows the convergence to the\njoint policy that generated the target distribution. Further, if the target\ndistribution is from a joint policy that optimizes a cooperative task, the\noptimal policy for a combination of this task reward and the distribution\nmatching reward is the same joint policy. This insight is used to formulate a\npractical algorithm (DM$^2$), in which each individual agent matches a target\ndistribution derived from concurrently sampled trajectories from a joint expert\npolicy. Experimental validation on the StarCraft domain shows that combining\n(1) a task reward, and (2) a distribution matching reward for expert\ndemonstrations for the same task, allows agents to outperform a naive\ndistributed baseline. Additional experiments probe the conditions under which\nexpert demonstrations need to be sampled to obtain the learning benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 04:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 18:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 02:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Moreover, by enlarging the dispersion of\ndifferent users/bundles, the self-discrimination of representations is\nenhanced. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin. Meanwhile, our method\nrequires minimal parameters of three set of embeddings (user, bundle, and item)\nand the computational costs are largely reduced due to more concise graph\nstructure and graph learning module. In addition, various ablation and model\nstudies demystify the working mechanism and justify our hypothesis.

Recent studies have applied graph neural network (GNN) to\ncapture the global word co-occurrence in a corpus. Existing approaches require\nthat all the nodes (training and test) in a graph are present during training,\nwhich are transductive and do not naturally generalise to unseen nodes. To make\nthose models inductive, they use extra resources, like pretrained word\nembedding. However, high-quality resource is not always available and hard to\ntrain. Under the extreme settings with no extra resource and limited amount of\ntraining set, can we still learn an inductive graph-based text classification\nmodel? In this paper, we introduce a novel inductive graph-based text\nclassification framework, InducT-GCN (InducTive Graph Convolutional Networks\nfor Text classification).

In\nparticular, ground-optimized LiDAR odometry usually employs ground segmentation\nas a preprocessing method. This is because most of the points in a 3D point\ncloud captured by a 3D LiDAR sensor on a terrestrial platform are from the\nground. However, the effect of the performance of ground segmentation on LiDAR\nodometry is still not closely examined. In this paper, a robust\nground-optimized LiDAR odometry framework is proposed to facilitate the study\nto check the effect of ground segmentation on LiDAR SLAM based on the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) method.

Most previous works measure\nthe importance of feature fields by using their corresponding continuous\nweights from the model, then remove the feature fields with small weight\nvalues. However, removing many features that correspond to small but not exact\nzero weights will inevitably hurt model performance and not be friendly to\nhot-start model training. There is also no theoretical guarantee that the\nmagnitude of weights can represent the importance, thus possibly leading to\nsub-optimal results if using these methods.\n  To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Learnable Polarizing Feature\nSelection (LPFS) method using a smoothed-$\\ell^0$ function in literature.\nFurthermore, we extend LPFS to LPFS++ by our newly designed\nsmoothed-$\\ell^0$-liked function to select a more informative subset of\nfeatures.

Black-box\nensembles that assume only query-access to the constituent models (and their\nrobustness certifiers) during prediction are particularly attractive due to\ntheir modular structure. Cascading ensembles are a popular instance of\nblack-box ensembles that appear to improve certified robust accuracies in\npractice. However, we show that the robustness certifier used by a cascading\nensemble is unsound. That is, when a cascading ensemble is certified as locally\nrobust at an input $x$ (with respect to $\\epsilon$), there can be inputs $x'$\nin the $\\epsilon$-ball centered at $x$, such that the cascade's prediction at\n$x'$ is different from $x$ and thus the ensemble is not locally robust. Our\ntheoretical findings are accompanied by empirical results that further\ndemonstrate this unsoundness.

However, most studies focus on the\nperformance improvement and hardware consumption of saturating counters, while\nignoring the security problems they may cause. In this paper, we creatively\npropose to study and design saturating counters from the defense perspective of\ndifferential privacy, so that attackers cannot distinguish the states that\nsaturating counters are in and further infer sensitive information. To obtain\ntheoretical guarantees, we use Markov chain to formalize the attack algorithm\napplied to the saturating counter, investigate into the optimal attack strategy\nand calculate the probability of successful attack. Furthermore, we find that\nthe attacker is able to accurately guess the branch execution of the victim's\nprocess in the existing saturating counters. To avoid this, we design a new\nprobabilistic saturating counter, which generalizes the existing conventional\nand probabilistic saturating counters. The guarantee of differential privacy is\napplied to deduce parameters of the new saturating counters so that the\nsecurity requirement can be satisfied. We also theoretically calculate the\nmisprediction rate when the saturating counter reaches the steady state. The\nexperimental results on testing programs show that the calculated theoretical\nresults agree with the experimental performances. Compared with the existing\nconventional and probabilistic saturating counters, when the parameters of our\ndesigned models are selected appropriately, the new saturating counters can not\nonly ensure similar operational performance, but also establish strict security\nguarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 07:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

This so-called island effect induces differential pistons, tips\nand tilts on the pupil petals, deforming the instrumental PSF, and is one of\nthe main limitations to the detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging.\nThese aberrations have different origins such as the low-wind effect or\npetaling errors in the adaptive-optics reconstruction. In this paper, we\npropose to alleviate the impact of the aberrations induced by island effects on\nhigh-contrast imaging by adapting the coronagraph design in order to increase\nits robustness to petal-level aberrations. Following a method first developed\nfor errors due to primary mirror segmentation (segment phasing errors, missing\nsegments...), we develop and test Redundant Apodized Pupils (RAP), i.e.\napodizers designed at the petal-scale, then duplicated and rotated to mimic the\npupil petal geometry. We apply this concept to the ELT architecture, made of\nsix identical petals, to yield a 10^-6 contrast in a dark region from 8 to\n40lambda/D. Both amplitude and phase apodizers proposed in this paper are\nrobust to differential pistons between petals, with minimal degradation to\ntheir coronagraphic PSFs and contrast levels. In addition, they are also more\nrobust to petal-level tip-tilt errors than apodizers designed for the whole\npupil, with which the limit of contrast of 10^-6 in the coronagraph dark zone\nis achieved for constraints up to 2 rad RMS of these petal-level modes. The RAP\nconcept proves its robustness to island effects (low-wind effect and\npost-adaptive optics petaling), with an application to the ELT architecture. It\ncan also be considered for other 8- to 30-meter class ground-based units such\nas VLT/SPHERE, Subaru/SCExAO, GMT/GMagAO-X, or TMT/PSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 07:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 07:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

The outstanding capabilities of deep learning in denoising of natural\nand medical images have recently spur a number of applications of neural\nnetworks in the context of seismic data denoising. A limitation of the majority\nof such methods is that the deep learning procedure is supervised and requires\nclean (noise-free) data as a target for training the network. Blindspot\nnetworks were recently proposed to overcome this requirement, allowing training\nto be performed directly on the noisy field data as a powerful suppressor of\nrandom noise. A careful adaptation of the blind-spot methodology allows for an\nextension to coherent noise suppression. In this work, we expand the\nmethodology of blind-spot networks to create a blind-trace network that\nsuccessfully removes trace-wise coherent noise. Through an extensive synthetic\nanalysis, we illustrate the denoising procedure's robustness to varying noise\nlevels, as well as varying numbers of noisy traces within shot gathers. It is\nshown that the network can accurately learn to suppress the noise when up to\n60% of the original traces are noisy. Furthermore, the proposed procedure is\nimplemented on the Stratton 3D field dataset and is shown to restore the\npreviously corrupted direct arrivals. Our adaptation of the blind-spot network\nfor self-supervised, trace-wise noise suppression could lead to other use-cases\nsuch as the suppression of coherent noise arising from wellsite activity,\npassing vessels or nearby industrial activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 07:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

A\ncommon solution to this problem is to use an eligibility trace to assign credit\nto recency-weighted set of experienced events. However, in many realistic\ntasks, the set of recently experienced events are only one of the many possible\naction events that could have preceded the current outcome. This suggests that\nreinforcement learning can be made more efficient by allowing credit assignment\nto any viable preceding state, rather than only those most recently\nexperienced. Accordingly, we examine ``Predecessor Features'', the fully\nbootstrapped version of van Hasselt's ``Expected Trace'', an algorithm that\nachieves this richer form of credit assignment. By maintaining a representation\nthat approximates the expected sum of past occupancies, this algorithm allows\ntemporal difference (TD) errors to be propagated accurately to a larger number\nof predecessor states than conventional methods, greatly improving learning\nspeed. The algorithm can also be naturally extended from tabular state\nrepresentation to feature representations allowing for increased performance on\na wide range of environments.

Recent Transformers tend to be Pre-LN because, in Post-LN with deep\nTransformers (e.g., those with ten or more layers), the training is often\nunstable, resulting in useless models. However, Post-LN has consistently\nachieved better performance than Pre-LN in relatively shallow Transformers\n(e.g., those with six or fewer layers). This study first investigates the\nreason for these discrepant observations empirically and theoretically and made\nthe following discoveries: 1, the LN in Post-LN is the main source of the\nvanishing gradient problem that leads to unstable training, whereas Pre-LN\nprevents it, and 2, Post-LN tends to preserve larger gradient norms in higher\nlayers during the back-propagation, which may lead to effective training.\nExploiting the new findings, we propose a method that can provide both high\nstability and effective training by a simple modification of Post-LN.

Despite the significant progress, previous deep clustering\nworks mostly tend to construct the final clustering by utilizing a single layer\nof representation, e.g., by performing $K$-means on the last fully-connected\nlayer or by associating some clustering loss to a specific layer. However, few\nof them have considered the possibilities and potential benefits of jointly\nleveraging multi-layer representations for enhancing the deep clustering\nperformance. In light of this, this paper presents a Deep Clustering via\nEnsembles (DeepCluE) approach, which bridges the gap between deep clustering\nand ensemble clustering by harnessing the power of multiple layers in deep\nneural networks. Particularly, we utilize a weight-sharing convolutional neural\nnetwork as the backbone, which is trained with both the instance-level\ncontrastive learning (via an instance projector) and the cluster-level\ncontrastive learning (via a cluster projector) in an unsupervised manner.\nThereafter, multiple layers of feature representations are extracted from the\ntrained network, upon which a set of diversified base clusterings can be\ngenerated via a highly efficient clusterer. Then, the reliability of the\nclusters in multiple base clusterings is automatically estimated by exploiting\nan entropy-based criterion, based on which the multiple base clusterings are\nfurther formulated into a weighted-cluster bipartite graph.

Chai and B.C. Shi, Phys. Rev. E 102, 023306\n(2020)], where a rectangular equilibrium distribution function (REDF) [J.H. Lu\net al, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 369, 2311-2319 (2011)] on a rectangular lattice\nis utilized. Due to the anisotropy of discrete velocities on a rectangular\nlattice, the third-order moment of REDF is inconsistent with that of popular LB\nmethod, and thus the previous unified framework of MRT-LB method cannot be\ndirectly applied to the NSEs using the REDF on the rectangular rDdQq lattice.\nThe macroscopic NSEs can be recovered from the RMRT-LB method through the\ndirect Taylor expansion method by properly selecting the relaxation sub-matrix\n$\\mathbf{S}_2$ which is related to kinetic viscosity and bulk viscosity. While\nthe rectangular lattice does not lead to the change of the zero-th, first and\nsecond-order moments of REDF, thus the unified framework of MRT-LB method can\nbe directly applied to the NCDE. It should be noted that the RMRT-LB model for\nNSEs can be derived on the rDdQq lattice, including rD2Q9, rD3Q19, and rD3Q27\nlattices, and the RMRT-LB versions (if existed) of the previous MRT-LB models\ncan be obtained, including those based on raw (natural)-moment, central-moment,\nHermite-moment, and central Hermite-moment, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 10:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Thirty-two users\nmade searches to an article collection of Finnish newspaper Uusi Suometar\n1869-1918 with ca. 1.45 million auto segmented articles. Our article search\ndatabase had two versions of each article with different quality optical\ncharacter recognition.

Analysis.\nAnalysis of the user evaluations was performed by comparing mean averages of\nevaluations scores in user sessions.

In this work, we place some dynamic\nproblems from group theory in DynFO.\n  In particular, suppose we are given an arbitrary multiplication table over n\nelements representing an unstructured binary operation (representing a\nstructure called a magma).

In previous work, we identified regions of the\nparameter space that may produce BBHs with large misalignments from natal kicks\nand high spin magnitudes from three mechanisms - tides, accretion, or\ninheritance via minimal core-envelope coupling. Here, we explore the spin\nprecession of such BBHs using five parameters that describe the amplitude and\nfrequency with which the orbital angular momentum precesses and nutates about\nthe total angular momentum, modulating the gravitational-wave emission.\nPrecession is generally possible for sufficiently strong natal kicks provided\nat least one of the black holes is spinning. Nutation is a consequence of\nspin-spin coupling and depends on the three spin-up mechanisms. Tidal\nsynchronization can leave a distinct correlation between the aligned effective\nspin and the nutation frequency, but does not produce large nutations. When a\nblack hole accretes $\\gtrsim 20\\%$ of its companion's envelope, the precession\nfrequency and amplitude are large. A much smaller amount of accretion, e.g.,\n$\\approx 2\\%$, is needed to provide a large precession frequency and amplitude\nwhen the accretor is a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. The inheritance of high natal WR\nspins ($\\gtrsim 5\\%$ of their maximum breakup value) via minimal core-envelope\ncoupling is the most promising mechanism for producing nutating BBHs, implying\nthat a measurement of nutation from gravitational-wave observations may suggest\nisolated-binary origin with minimal core-envelope coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 10:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 12:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

As a\nresult, the characteristics of these models have become sensitive intellectual\nproperties that require protection from malicious users. Extracting the\narchitecture of a DNN through leaky side-channels (e.g., memory access) allows\nadversaries to (i) clone the model, and (ii) craft adversarial attacks. DNN\nobfuscation thwarts side-channel-based architecture stealing (SCAS) attacks by\naltering the run-time traces of a given DNN while preserving its functionality.\nIn this work, we expose the vulnerability of state-of-the-art DNN obfuscation\nmethods to these attacks. We present NeuroUnlock, a novel SCAS attack against\nobfuscated DNNs. Our NeuroUnlock employs a sequence-to-sequence model that\nlearns the obfuscation procedure and automatically reverts it, thereby\nrecovering the original DNN architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nNeuroUnlock by recovering the architecture of 200 randomly generated and\nobfuscated DNNs running on the Nvidia RTX 2080 TI graphics processing unit\n(GPU). Moreover, NeuroUnlock recovers the architecture of various other\nobfuscated DNNs, such as the VGG-11, VGG-13, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32 networks.\nAfter recovering the architecture, NeuroUnlock automatically builds a\nnear-equivalent DNN with only a 1.4% drop in the testing accuracy. We further\nshow that launching a subsequent adversarial attack on the recovered DNNs\nboosts the success rate of the adversarial attack by 51.7% in average compared\nto launching it on the obfuscated versions. Additionally, we propose a novel\nmethodology for DNN obfuscation, ReDLock, which eradicates the deterministic\nnature of the obfuscation and achieves 2.16X more resilience to the NeuroUnlock\nattack. We release the NeuroUnlock and the ReDLock as open-source frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 11:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

Based on a much\nlarger statistics, we confirm that N- and SC-type carbon stars share a very\nsimilar luminosity function, while the luminosities of J-type stars (Mbol) are\nfainter by half a magnitude on average. R-hot type carbon stars have\nluminosities throughout the RGB, which favours the hypothesis of an external\norigin for their carbon enhancement. Moreover, the kinematic properties of a\nsignificant fraction of the R-hot stars are compatible with the thick-disc\npopulation, in contrast with that of N- and SC-type stars, which would belong\nmostly to the thin disk. We also derive the luminosity function of a large\nnumber of Galactic extrinsic and intrinsic (O-rich) S stars and show that the\nluminosities of the latter are typically higher than the predicted onset of the\nthird dredge-up during the AGB for solar metallicity. This result is consistent\nwith these stars being genuine thermally pulsing AGB stars. On the other hand,\nusing the so-called Gaia-2MASS diagram, we show that the overwhelming majority\nof the carbon stars identified in the LAMOST survey as AGB stars are probably\nR-hot and/or CH-type stars.

However, accurate conversion labels are revealed after a long delay,\nwhich harms the timeliness of recommender systems. Previous literature\nconcentrates on utilizing early conversions to mitigate such a delayed feedback\nproblem. In this paper, we show that post-click user behaviors are also\ninformative to conversion rate prediction and can be used to improve\ntimeliness. We propose a generalized delayed feedback model (GDFM) that unifies\nboth post-click behaviors and early conversions as stochastic post-click\ninformation, which could be utilized to train GDFM in a streaming manner\nefficiently. Based on GDFM, we further establish a novel perspective that the\nperformance gap introduced by delayed feedback can be attributed to a temporal\ngap and a sampling gap. Inspired by our analysis, we propose to measure the\nquality of post-click information with a combination of temporal distance and\nsample complexity.

This work extends\nprevious work by developing a non-linear hybrid quantum-classical CFD solver\nand using it to generate fully converged solutions. The hybrid solver uses the\nSIMPLE CFD algorithm, which is common in many industrial CFD codes, and applies\nit to the 2-dimensional lid driven cavity test case. A theme of this work is\nthe classical processing time needed to prepare the quantum circuit with a\nfocus on the decomposition of the CFD matrix into a linear combination of\nunitaries (LCU). CFD meshes with up to 65x65 nodes are considered with the\nlargest producing a LCU containing 32,767 Pauli strings. A new method for\nrapidly re-computing the coefficients in a LCU is proposed, although this\nreduces, rather than eliminates, the classical scaling issues. The quantum\nlinear equation solver uses the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm via a\nstate-vector emulator. Test matrices are sampled from the classical CFD solver\nto investigate the solution accuracy that can be achieved with HHL. For the\nsmallest 5x5 and 9x9 CFD meshes, full non-linear hybrid CFD calculations are\nperformed. The impacts of approximating the LCU and the varying the number of\nancilla rotations in the eigenvalue inversion circuit are studied. Preliminary\ntiming results indicate that the classical computer preparation time needed for\na hybrid solver is just as important to the achievement of quantum advantage in\nCFD as the time on the quantum computer. The reported HHL solutions and LCU\ndecompositions provide a benchmark for future research.

We introduce a\nclass of techniques for optimizing X-risks for deep learning. We formulate DXO\ninto three special families of non-convex optimization problems belonging to\nnon-convex min-max optimization, non-convex compositional optimization, and\nnon-convex bilevel optimization, respectively. For each family of problems, we\npresent some strong baseline algorithms and their complexities, which will\nmotivate further research for improving the existing results. Discussions about\nthe presented results and future studies are given at the end. Efficient\nalgorithms for optimizing a variety of X-risks are implemented in the LibAUC\nlibrary at www.libauc.org.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 17:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 19:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 08:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 03:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

The main reason for\nthis is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal\nconfiguration is too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is\nmodelled by a closed flux line of arbitrary shape and size then the formal\ntreatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably simplified, and\nwell-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the\nelectromagnetic, topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We\ndemonstrate that the AB phase in a closed flux line is determined by a linking\nnumber and has the same form as the AB phase in an infinitely-long flux line\nwhich is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit\ninterference shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the\nsame as that associated with an infinitely-long flux line. We emphasise the\ntopological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux line by demonstrating that\nthis phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations of\nthe closed flux line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the\nclosed flux line, and the interchange between the charge path and the closed\nflux line. We also discuss the local and nonlocal interpretations of the AB\neffect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge in which the\nvector potential vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the\nclosed flux line, implying that this potential is zero along the path of the\ncharged particle except on the crossing point where this path intersects the\nsurface bounded by the closed flux line, a result that questions the alleged\nphysical significance of the vector potential and the local interpretation of\nthe AB effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-02"}

This work investigates how we can distinguish between two\nfundamental driving mechanisms: the accumulated effect of stellar feedback\nversus the energy injection from Galactic scales. We perform a series of\nnumerical simulations describing a stratified star forming ISM subject to\nself-consistent stellar feedback. Large scale external turbulent driving of\nvarious intensities is added to mimic galactic driving mechanisms. We analyse\nthe resulting column density maps with a technique called Multi-scale\nnon-Gaussian segmentation that separates the coherent structures and the\nGaussian background. This effectively discriminates between the various\nsimulations and is a promising method to understand the ISM structure. In\nparticular the power spectrum of the coherent structures flattens above 60 pc\nwhen turbulence is driven only by stellar feedback. When large-scale driving is\napplied, the turn-over shifts to larger scales. A systematic comparison with\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is then performed. Only 1 out of 25 regions\nhas a coherent power spectrum which is consistent with the feedback-only\nsimulation. A detailed study of the turn-over scale leads us to conclude that\nregular stellar feedback is not enough to explain the observed ISM structure on\nscales larger than 60 pc. Extreme feedback in the form of supergiant shells\nlikely plays an important role but cannot explain all the regions of the LMC.\nIf we assume ISM structure is generated by turbulence, another large scale\ndriving mechanism is needed to explain the entirety of the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations\nbetween these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic\ncues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by\napplying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction\ntasks.

Some ML tasks are hard to distribute because common\napproaches to parameter management can be highly inefficient.

In this work, we explore\nwhether these two problems can be avoided. We first propose a novel intent\nsignaling mechanism that integrates naturally into existing ML stacks and\nprovides the parameter manager with crucial information about parameter\naccesses. We then describe AdaPM, a fully adaptive, zero-tuning parameter\nmanager based on this mechanism. In contrast to prior systems, this approach\nseparates providing information (simple, done by the task) from exploiting it\neffectively (hard, done automatically by AdaPM).

At low temperatures, however, conventional\nsemiconductor diodes possess a high resistivity, which yields energy loss and\nheating during operation. The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which relies\non broken inversion symmetry in a superconductor may mitigate this obstacle: in\none direction a zero-resistance supercurrent can flow through the diode, but\nfor the opposite direction of current flow, the device enters the normal state\nwith ohmic resistance. The application of a magnetic field can induce SDE in\nNb/V/Ta superlattices with a polar structure, in superconducting devices with\nasymmetric patterning of pinning centres, or in superconductor/ferromagnet\nhybrid devices with induced vortices. The need for an external magnetic field\nlimits their practical application. Recently, a field-free SDE was observed in\na NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2 junction, and it originates from asymmetric Josephson\ntunneling that is induced by the Nb3Br8 barrier and the associated NbSe2/Nb3Br8\ninterfaces.

We control the polarity of the SDE\nthrough the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic layers.

Then, an optimization problem is formulated to\nmaximize the SNR at the UE under a minimum detection probability constraint. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, a novel alternative optimization approach is\ndeveloped.

We\npresent observations of a filament formation, its failed eruption, and the\nassociated flare (SOL2019-05-09T05:51) that occurred in active region (AR)\n12740 using data from SDO, STEREO-A, IRIS, and NSO/GONG. AR 12740 was a\ndecaying region formed by a very disperse following polarity and a strong\nleading spot, surrounded by a highly dynamic zone where moving magnetic\nfeatures (MMFs) were seen constantly diverging from the spot. Our analysis\nindicates that the filament was formed by the convergence of fibrils at a\nlocation where magnetic flux cancellation was observed. Furthermore, we\nconclude that its destabilization was also related to flux cancellation\nassociated to the constant shuffling of the MMFs. A two-ribbon flare occurred\nassociated to the filament eruption; however, because the large-scale magnetic\nconfiguration of the AR was quadrupolar, two additional flare ribbons developed\nfar from the two main ones. We model the magnetic configuration of the AR using\na force-free field approach at the AR scale size. This local model is\ncomplemented by a global potential-field source-surface one. Based on the local\nmodel, we propose a scenario in which the filament failed eruption and flare\nare due to two reconnection processes, one occurring below the erupting\nfilament, leading to the two-ribbon flare, and another one above it between the\nfilament flux-rope configuration and the large-scale closed loops. Our\ncomputation of the reconnected magnetic flux added to the erupting flux rope,\ncompared to that of the large-scale field overlying it, lets us conclude that\nthe latter was large enough to prevent the filament eruption. A similar\nconjecture can be drawn from the computation of the magnetic tension derived\nfrom the global field model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 14:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

To evaluate the partition function and to compute\nobservables, we develop a Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group\nmethod, specifically tailored for this model. During the coarsening procedure,\nthe blocking of adjacent Grassmann tensors is performed analytically, and the\ntotal number of Grassmann variables in the tensor network is reduced by a\nfactor of two at each coarsening step. The coarse-site numeric tensors are\ntruncated using higher-order singular value decompositions. The method is\nvalidated by comparing the partition function, the chiral condensate and the\nbaryon density computed with the tensor method with exact analytical results on\nsmall lattices up to volumes of $4\\times4$. For larger volumes, we present\nfirst tensor results for the chiral condensate as a function of the mass and\nvolume, and observe that the chiral symmetry is not broken dynamically in two\ndimensions.

Systems of non-interacting fermions are\nideally suited to serve these purposes.

We demonstrate on a\nStillinger--Weber potential that makes predictions for the atomic energies and\nforces for silicon in a diamond configuration. Finally, we highlight some\npotential subtleties in applying and using these tools with recommendations for\npractitioners and IP developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 15:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

Accordingly, we contribute with: (i) a new neural network\narchitecture capable of modeling dynamic processes observed in spatial and\ntemporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting,\nand patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning\nmethodology for analyzing and predicting links in the scope of human mobility\nbetween all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques for identifying\ninconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most\ninfluential vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We\nobtained results sustained by sound evidence of advances to the state of the\nart in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms, and ample experimentation.\nOur findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains,\ndemonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 11:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

When they\nare employed in mission-critical applications, the ability to precisely predict\nthe end of discharge under highly variable environmental and operating\nconditions is of paramount importance in order to support operational\ndecision-making. While there are accurate predictive models of the processes\nunderlying the charge and discharge phases of batteries, the modelling of\nageing and its effect on performance remains poorly understood. Such a lack of\nunderstanding often leads to inaccurate models or the need for time-consuming\ncalibration procedures whenever the battery ages or its conditions change\nsignificantly. This represents a major obstacle to the real-world deployment of\nefficient and robust battery management systems. In this paper, we propose for\nthe first time an approach that can predict the voltage discharge curve for\nbatteries of any degradation level without the need for calibration. In\nparticular, we introduce Dynaformer, a novel Transformer-based deep learning\narchitecture which is able to simultaneously infer the ageing state from a\nlimited number of voltage/current samples and predict the full voltage\ndischarge curve for real batteries with high precision. Our experiments show\nthat the trained model is effective for input current profiles of different\ncomplexities and is robust to a wide range of degradation levels. In addition\nto evaluating the performance of the proposed framework on simulated data, we\ndemonstrate that a minimal amount of fine-tuning allows the model to bridge the\nsimulation-to-real gap between simulations and real data collected from a set\nof batteries.

Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) is\nwidely regarded as a promising framework for optimizing long-term engagement in\nsequential recommendation. However, due to expensive online interactions, it is\nvery difficult for RL algorithms to perform state-action value estimation,\nexploration and feature extraction when optimizing long-term engagement. In\nthis paper, we propose ResAct which seeks a policy that is close to, but better\nthan, the online-serving policy. In this way, we can collect sufficient data\nnear the learned policy so that state-action values can be properly estimated,\nand there is no need to perform online exploration. Directly optimizing this\npolicy is difficult due to the huge policy space. ResAct instead solves it by\nfirst reconstructing the online behaviors and then improving it. Our main\ncontributions are fourfold. First, we design a generative model which\nreconstructs behaviors of the online-serving policy by sampling multiple action\nestimators. Second, we design an effective learning paradigm to train the\nresidual actor which can output the residual for action improvement. Third, we\nfacilitate the extraction of features with two information theoretical\nregularizers to confirm the expressiveness and conciseness of features.

For over a decade, organisations have been leveraging Semantic Web\ntechnologies to design their workflows, ensure data quality, and a means for\nsharing and reusing (Linked Data). Crucially, scholarly projects that leverage\ncultural heritage data to collaboratively develop new resources would benefit\nfrom agile solutions to simplify the Linked Data production workflow via\nuser-friendly interfaces. To date, only a few pioneers have abandoned legacy\ncataloguing and archiving systems to fully embrace the Linked Open Data (LOD)\nparadigm and manage their catalogues or research products through LOD-native\nmanagement systems. In this article we present Crowdsourcing Linked Entities\nvia web Form (CLEF), an agile LOD-native platform for collaborative data\ncollection, peer-review, and publication. We detail design choices as motivated\nby two case studies, from the Cultural Heritage and scholarly domains\nrespectively, and we discuss benefits of our solution in the light of prior\nworks. In particular, the strong focus on user-friendly interfaces for\nproducing FAIR data, the provenance-aware editorial process, and the\nintegration with consolidated data management workflows, distinguish CLEF as a\nnovel attempt to develop Linked Data platforms for cultural heritage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 11:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

One of the\ncentral challenges of manipulation is partial observability, as the agent\nusually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the\nobjects it is manipulating in advance. A recently emerging theory that deals\nwith partial observability in an explicit manner is Active Inference. It does\nso by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goal-directed but also\ninformative about the environment. In this work, we apply Active Inference to a\nhard-to-explore simulated robotic manipulation tasks, in which the agent has to\nbalance a ball into a target zone. Since the reward of this task is sparse, in\norder to explore this environment, the agent has to learn to balance the ball\nwithout any extrinsic feedback, purely driven by its own curiosity. We show\nthat the information-seeking behavior induced by Active Inference allows the\nagent to explore these challenging, sparse environments systematically.\nFinally, we conclude that using an information-seeking objective is beneficial\nin sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods\nthat do not exhibit directed exploration fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2022 12:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

We take advantage of state-of-the-art natural language processing\nmodels based on transformers to learn the association between the lyrics and\nmoods. We find that a pretrained transformer-based language model in a\nzero-shot setting -- i.e., out of the box with no further training on our data\n-- is powerful for capturing song-mood associations. Moreover, we illustrate\nthat training on song-mood associations results in a highly accurate model that\npredicts these associations for unseen songs. Furthermore, by comparing the\nprediction of a model using lyrics with one using acoustic features, we observe\nthat the relative importance of lyrics for mood prediction in comparison with\nacoustics depends on the specific mood. Finally, we verify if the models are\ncapturing the same information about lyrics and acoustics as humans through an\nannotation task where we obtain human judgments of mood-song relevance based on\nlyrics and acoustics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2022 19:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}
