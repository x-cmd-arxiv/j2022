Using extensive\ndirect numerical simulations, we study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a\nwavenumber-localised instability superposed on stochastic forcing, in contrast\nto previous studies of state-independent forcing. As the contribution of the\ninstability forcing, measured by a parameter $\\gamma$, increases, the system\nundergoes two transitions. For $\\gamma$ below a first threshold, a regular\nlarge-scale vortex condensate forms. Above this threshold, shielded vortices\n(SVs) emerge within the condensate. At a second, larger value of $\\gamma$, the\ncondensate breaks down, and a gas of weakly interacting vortices with broken\nsymmetry spontaneously emerges, characterised by preponderance of vortices of\none sign only and suppressed inverse energy cascade. The latter transition is\nshown to depend on the damping mechanism. The number density of SVs in the\nbroken symmetry state slowly increases via a random nucleation process.\nBistability is observed between the condensate and mixed SV-condensate states.\nOur findings provide new evidence for a strong dependence of two-dimensional\nturbulence phenomenology on the forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 16:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 08:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

(Sub)millimeter continuum observations often show a percent-level\npolarization parallel to the disk minor axis, which is generally attributed to\nscattering by $\\sim 100\\mu$m-sized spherical grains (with a size parameter $x\n\\equiv 2\\pi a / \\lambda < 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength). Larger\nspherical grains (with $x$ greater than unity) would produce opposite\npolarization direction. However, the inferred size is in tension with the\nopacity index $\\beta$ that points to larger mm/cm-sized grains. We investigate\nthe scattering-produced polarization by large irregular grains with a range of\n$x$ greater than unity with optical properties obtained from laboratory\nexperiments. Using the radiation transfer code, RADMC-3D, we find that large\nirregular grains still produce polarization parallel to the disk minor axis. If\nthe original forsterite refractive index in the optical is adopted, then all\nsamples can produce the typically observed level of polarization. Accounting\nfor the more commonly adopted refractive index using the DSHARP dust model,\nonly grains with $x$ of several (corresponding to $\\sim$mm-sized grains) can\nreach the same polarization level. Our results suggest that grains in disks can\nhave sizes in the millimeter regime, which may alleviate the tension between\nthe grain sizes inferred from scattering and other means. Additionally, if\nlarge irregular grains are not settled to the midplane, their strong forward\nscattering can produce asymmetries between the near and far side of an inclined\ndisk, which can be used to infer their presence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 16:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 23:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Many existing DG algorithms reduce the divergence\nbetween source distributions in a representation space to potentially align the\nunseen domain close to the sources. This is motivated by the analysis that\nexplains generalization to unseen domains using distributional distance (such\nas the Wasserstein distance) to the sources. However, due to the openness of\nthe DG objective, it is challenging to evaluate DG algorithms comprehensively\nusing a few benchmark datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy\nof the models trained with DG methods varies significantly across unseen\ndomains, generated from popular benchmark datasets. This highlights that the\nperformance of DG methods on a few benchmark datasets may not be representative\nof their performance on unseen domains in the wild. To overcome this roadblock,\nwe propose a universal certification framework based on distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) that can efficiently certify the worst-case performance of\nany DG method. This enables a data-independent evaluation of a DG method\ncomplementary to the empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets. Furthermore,\nwe propose a training algorithm that can be used with any DG method to provably\nimprove their certified performance.

Often, some portion of data is more\nfrequently accessed than the rest, which causes a skew in popularity of the\ndata items. Adapting to this skew can improve performance, and this topic has\nbeen studied extensively in the past for disk-based settings. In this work, we\nconsider an in-memory data structure, namely hash table, and show how one can\nleverage the skew in popularity for higher performance. Hashing is a\nlow-latency operation, sensitive to the effects of caching, branch prediction,\nand code complexity among other factors. These factors make learning\nin-the-loop especially challenging as the overhead of performing any additional\noperations can be significant. In this paper, we propose VIP hashing, a fully\nonline hash table method, that uses lightweight mechanisms for learning the\nskew in popularity and adapting the hash table layout. These mechanisms are\nnon-blocking, and their overhead is controlled by sensing changes in the\npopularity distribution to dynamically switch-on/off the learning mechanism as\nneeded. We tested VIP hashing against a variety of workloads generated by\nWiscer, a homegrown hashing measurement tool, and find that it improves\nperformance in the presence of skew (22% increase in fetch operation throughput\nfor a hash table with one million keys under low skew, 77% increase under\nmedium skew) while being robust to insert and delete operations, and changing\npopularity distribution of keys. We find that VIP hashing reduces the\nend-to-end execution time of TPC-H query 9, which is the most expensive TPC-H\nquery, by 20% under medium skew.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 17:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

Along\nwith the improvement in performance, security and robustness of ViTs are also\nof great importance to study. In contrast to many recent works that exploit the\nrobustness of ViTs against adversarial examples, this paper investigates a\nrepresentative causative attack, i.e., backdoor. We first examine the\nvulnerability of ViTs against various backdoor attacks and find that ViTs are\nalso quite vulnerable to existing attacks. However, we observe that the\nclean-data accuracy and backdoor attack success rate of ViTs respond\ndistinctively to patch transformations before the positional encoding. Then,\nbased on this finding, we propose an effective method for ViTs to defend both\npatch-based and blending-based trigger backdoor attacks via patch processing.\nThe performances are evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including\nCIFAR10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet, which show the proposed novel defense is very\nsuccessful in mitigating backdoor attacks for ViTs.

E-PI's key equation relates proportionally the radial\ngradients of saturated moist entropy and angular momentum. Here the E-PI\nderivation is reconsidered to show that the thermal wind and slantwise\nneutrality imply zero radial gradients of saturation entropy and angular\nmomentum at an altitude where, for a given radius, the tangential wind has a\nmaximum. It is further shown that, while E-PI's key equation requires that, at\nthe point of maximum tangential wind, the air temperature must increase towards\nthe storm center, the thermal wind equation dictates the opposite. From the\nanalysis of the equations of motion at the altitude of maximum tangential wind\nin the free troposphere, it is concluded that here the air flow must be\nsupergradient. This implies that the supergradiency factor (a measure of the\ngradient-wind imbalance) must change in the free troposphere as the air flow\ntends to restore the balance. It is shown that such a change modifies the\nderivative of saturation entropy over angular momentum, which cannot therefore\nremain constant in the free troposphere as E-PI requires.

At the\nsame time, the fermionic quasiparticles remain well-defined, while the\nformation of local moments is accompanied by a deviation from the Fermi-liquid\nbehavior. In particular, the self-energy of the $t_{2g}$ states shows the\nnon-analytic frequency dependence, which is a characteristic of the\nspin-freezing behavior, while the quasiparticle damping changes approximately\nlinearly with temperature in the intermediate temperature range $200$--$700$~K.\nBy analyzing the momentum dependence of static magnetic susceptibility, we find\nincommensurate magnetic correlations, which may provide a mechanism for\nunconventional superconductivity at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 17:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 14:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

We investigate privacy threats\nfaced by recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In such\nattacks, an adversary aims to infer whether a user's data is used to train the\ntarget recommender. To achieve this, previous work has used a shadow\nrecommender to derive training data for the attack model, and then predicts the\nmembership by calculating difference vectors between users' historical\ninteractions and recommended items. State-of-the-art methods face two\nchallenging problems: (1) training data for the attack model is biased due to\nthe gap between shadow and target recommenders, and (2) hidden states in\nrecommenders are not observational, resulting in inaccurate estimations of\ndifference vectors. To address the above limitations, we propose a Debiasing\nLearning for Membership Inference Attacks against recommender systems (DL-MIA)\nframework that has four main components: (1) a difference vector generator, (2)\na disentangled encoder, (3) a weight estimator, and (4) an attack model. To\nmitigate the gap between recommenders, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based\ndisentangled encoder is devised to identify recommender invariant and specific\nfeatures.

However, one form of attack is unique to the\nPMU, the GPS-spoofing attack, where the time and /or the one second pulse that\nenables time synchronization are modified and the measurements are computed\nusing the modified time reference. This article exploits the vulnerability of\nPMUs in their GPS time synchronization signal. At first, the paper proposes an\nundetectable attack scheme which is able to bypass Bad Data Detection (BDD)\nalgorithms used with PMU data. The attack is applied by solving a convex\noptimization criterion at regular time interval, so that after a specific time\nperiod the attack vector incurs a significant change in the angle information\ndelivered by the PMU. Secondly, the impact of phase angle shift on the power\nflow calculation between two adjacent nodes of the transmission line is\nanalyzed with numerical experiment using IEEE 39 bus system. Moreover, the\nundetectibilities of the proposed attack scheme against conventional $\\chi^2$,\nWeighted Least Squares (WLS) and Kalman Filtering test on the estimation\nresiduals are investigated. Finally, the power flow results with the proposed\nattack are compared with the results using a random GPS-spoofing attack.

We prove that the\nresulting equation is part of a class of stochastic partial differential\nequations that have unique maximal strong solutions. The methodology is based\non the construction of an approximating sequence of models taking value in an\nappropriately chosen finite-dimensional Littlewood-Paley space. Finally, we\nshow that a distinguished element of this class of stochastic partial\ndifferential equations has a global weak solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

We present a new fault\ndetection method for vibration-monitored drivetrains that does not require any\nfeature engineering. Our method relies on a simple model architecture to enable\na straightforward implementation in practice. We propose to apply convolutional\nautoencoders for identifying and extracting the most relevant features from the\nhalf spectrum in an automated manner, saving time and effort. Thereby, a\nspectral model of the normal vibration response is learnt for the monitored\ncomponent from past measurements. We demonstrate that the model can\nsuccessfully distinguish damaged from healthy components and detect a damaged\ngenerator bearing and damaged gearbox parts from their vibration responses.\nUsing measurements from commercial wind turbines and a test rig, we show that\nvibration-based fault detection in wind turbine drivetrains can be performed\nwithout the usual upfront definition of spectral features. Another advantage of\nthe presented method is that the entire half spectrum is monitored instead of\nthe usual focus on monitoring individual frequencies and harmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

In this technique, two measurements are made in the ambient\nmedia on each side of a finite thickness micro-structured slab to decompose\nincoming and outgoing waves. The method is applied to an example with locally\nresonant micro-structured inclusions while paying close attention to parameters\nthat influence the extracted material parameters. It is observed that the\nextracted overall parameters converge to limiting values when the number of\nunit cells across the slab thickness or ambient media modulus are increased.\nDependence of extracted material parameters on the number of cells through\nthickness or ambient media properties are attributed to the different response\nof boundary (skin) and interior cells. A method is presented which represents a\nfinite array with different effective properties for the skin regions vs. the\ninterior regions with great success in reproducing the scattering for different\nslab thicknesses, and through which the interior regions properties become\nindependent of ambient media properties. In stop bands with lower material\nloss, challenges arise that are associated with extremely small transmission.\nThe assumption of continuity in transmission phase is enforceable to remove\nphase ambiguity, although in certain cases (associated with nearly lossless\nspecimens) this assumption appears to fail. In such cases, interference from\ncoupled shear modes may lead to apparent higher longitudinal transmission\nwithin the stop band. This work provides a proof of concept for the development\nof an experimental methodology capable of extracting the effective properties\nand dispersion behavior of heterogeneous mechanical metamaterials without any\nknowledge of the internal fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The number of images collected of each species usually\nfollows a long-tail distribution, i.e., a few classes have a large number of\ninstances, while a lot of species have just a small percentage. Although in\nmost cases these rare species are the ones of interest to ecologists, they are\noften neglected when using deep-learning models because these models require a\nlarge number of images for the training. In this work, a simple and effective\nframework called Square-Root Sampling Branch (SSB) is proposed, which combines\ntwo classification branches that are trained using square-root sampling and\ninstance sampling to improve long-tail visual recognition, and this is compared\nto state-of-the-art methods for handling this task: square-root sampling,\nclass-balanced focal loss, and balanced group softmax. To achieve a more\ngeneral conclusion, the methods for handling long-tail visual recognition were\nsystematically evaluated in four families of computer vision models (ResNet,\nMobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, and Swin Transformer) and four camera-trap\ndatasets with different characteristics. Initially, a robust baseline with the\nmost recent training tricks was prepared and, then, the methods for improving\nlong-tail recognition were applied. Our experiments show that square-root\nsampling was the method that most improved the performance for minority classes\nby around 15%; however, this was at the cost of reducing the majority classes'\naccuracy by at least 3%. Our proposed framework (SSB) demonstrated itself to be\ncompetitive with the other methods and achieved the best or the second-best\nresults for most of the cases for the tail classes; but, unlike the square-root\nsampling, the loss in the performance of the head classes was minimal, thus\nachieving the best trade-off among all the evaluated methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:30:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 15:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 21:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

This paper\naddresses this problem and presents HybridFlow, a variational motion estimation\nframework for large displacements and deformations. A multi-scale hybrid\nmatching approach is performed on the image pairs. Coarse-scale clusters formed\nby classifying pixels according to their feature descriptors are matched using\nthe clusters' context descriptors. We apply a multi-scale graph matching on the\nfiner-scale superpixels contained within each matched pair of coarse-scale\nclusters. Small clusters that cannot be further subdivided are matched using\nlocalized feature matching.

However, previous work has only considered\nfilaments with homogeneous structural properties. Filament backbone stiffness\ncan be non-uniform in many biological systems like microtubules, where the\nassociation and disassociation of proteins can lead to spatial and temporal\nchanges into structure. The consequences of such non-uniformities in the\nconfigurational stability and transport of these fibers are yet unknown. Here,\nwe use slender-body theory and Euler-Bernoulli elasticity coupled with various\nnon-uniform bending rigidity profiles to quantify this buckling instability\nusing linear stability analysis and Brownian simulations. In shear flows, we\nobserve more pronounced buckling in areas of reduced rigidity in our\nsimulations. These areas of marked deformations give rise to differences in the\nparticle extra stress, indicating a nontrivial rheological response due to the\npresence of these filaments. The fundamental mode shapes arising from each\nrigidity profile are consistent with the predictions from our linear stability\nanalysis. Collectively, these results suggest that non-uniform bending rigidity\ncan drastically alter fluid-structure interactions in physiologically relevant\nsettings, providing a foundation to elucidate the complex interplay between\nhydrodynamics and the structural properties of biopolymers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 18:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

The introduced solution consists of\ntwo parts: a filter and a controller. Firstly, an adaptive NN-based stochastic\nfilter is proposed that estimates attitude components and dynamics using\nmeasurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts\nfor measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely unknown\nbias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed loop\nsignals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be\nsemi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Secondly, a novel control\nlaw on $SO(3)$ coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control\nlaw addresses unknown disturbances.

A principal method of generating entanglement for use\nin atom interferometry is the process of spin squeezing whereupon the states\nbecome more sensitive to $SU(2)$ rotations. One possibility to generate this\nentanglement is provided by one-axis twisting (OAT), where a many-particle\nentangled state of one degree of freedom is generated by a non-linear\nHamiltonian.

But persistent memory brings considerable new challenges to\nthe programmer: only 8-byte write atomicity, out of order flush and\navailability limited by node failure. It's possible to work with the atomicity\nand ordering constraints of PMEM directly by carefully sequencing the order of\nstore operations and inserting explicit flush and fence operations at each\nordering point. But this is tedious and error-prone: too many flush operations\ndefeat the performance benefits of PMEM, and even with generous use, it is\ndifficult to prove that a given program is crash-consistent. Logging is a great\nabstraction to deal with these issues but prior work on PMEM logging has not\nsuccessfully hidden the idiosyncrasies of PMEM. Moreover, shortcomings in the\nlog interface and design have prevented attainment of full PMEM performance. We\nbelieve that a log design that hides the idiosyncrasies from programmers while\ndelivering full performance is key to success. In this paper, we present the\ndesign and implementation of Arcadia, a generic replicated log on PMEM to\naddress these problems.

Our evaluation shows that Arcadia outperforms\nstate-of-the-art PMEM logs, such as PMDK's libpmemlog, FLEX, and Query Fresh by\nseveral times while providing stronger log record durability guarantees.

Continuum time delays from accretion disks in active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) has been proposed long time ago as a tool for measuring distances to the\nmonitored sources. However, the method faces serious problems as a number of\neffects must be taken into account, including the contribution from the Broad\nLine Region (BLR). Aims. In this paper, we model the expected time delays when\nboth the disk reprocessing of the incident X-ray flux and further reprocessing\nby the BLR are included, with the aim to see if the two effects can be\ndisentangled. Methods. We use simple response function for the accretion disk,\nwithout relativistic effects, and we use a parametric description to account\nfor the BLR contribution. We include only scattering of the disk emission by\nthe BLR inter-cloud medium. We also use artificial lightcurves with 1-day\nsampling to check if the effects are likely to be seen in real data. Results.\nWe show that the effect of the BLR scattering on the predicted time delay is\nvery similar to the effect of rising height of the X-ray source, without any\nBLR contribution. This brings additional degeneracy if we want in the future to\nrecover the parameters of the system from the observed time delays in a\nspecific object. Both effects, however, modify the slope of the delay versus\nwavelength curve when plotted in log space which opens a way to obtaining bare\ndisk time delay needed for cosmology. In addition, when the disk irradiation is\nstrong, the modification of the predicted delay by the BLR scattering and by\nX-ray source height become considerably different.

However, those two\nversions of BTAI still suffer from an exponential complexity class w.r.t the\nnumber of observed and latent variables being modelled. In the present paper,\nwe resolve this limitation by first allowing the modelling of several\nobservations, each of them having its own likelihood mapping. Similarly, we\nallow each latent state to have its own transition mapping. The inference\nalgorithm then exploits the factorisation of the likelihood and transition\nmappings to accelerate the computation of the posterior. Those two\noptimisations were tested on the dSprites environment in which the metadata of\nthe dSprites dataset was used as input to the model instead of the dSprites\nimages. On this task, $BTAI_{VMP}$ (Champion et al., 2022b,a) was able to solve\n96.9\\% of the task in 5.1 seconds, and $BTAI_{BF}$ (Champion et al., 2021a) was\nable to solve 98.6\\% of the task in 17.5 seconds. Our new approach\n($BTAI_{3MF}$) outperformed both of its predecessors by solving the task\ncompletly (100\\%) in only 2.559 seconds. Finally, $BTAI_{3MF}$ has been\nimplemented in a flexible and easy to use (python) package, and we developed a\ngraphical user interface to enable the inspection of the model's beliefs,\nplanning process and behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 22:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

In picture naming, we view specific exemplars of concepts and\nthen name them with a category label, like 'dog'. In contrast, in overt\nreading, the written word expresses the category (dog), not an exemplar.\n  Here we used a decoding approach with magnetoencephalography to address\nwhether picture naming and overt word reading involve shared representations of\nsemantic categories. This addresses a fundamental question about the\nmodality-generality of conceptual representations and their temporal evolution.\nCrucially, we do this using a language production task that does not require\nexplicit categorization judgment and that controls for word form properties\nacross semantic categories. We trained our models to classify the animal/tool\ndistinction using MEG data of one modality at each time point and then tested\nthe generalization of those models on the other modality. We obtained evidence\nfor the automatic activation of modality-independent semantic category\nrepresentations for both pictures and words starting at ~150ms and lasting\nuntil about 500ms. The time course of lexical activation was also assessed\nrevealing that semantic category is represented before lexical access for\npictures but after lexical access for words. Notably, this earlier activation\nof semantic category in pictures occurred simultaneously with visual\nrepresentations.\n  We thus show evidence for the spontaneous activation of modality-independent\nsemantic categories in picture naming and word reading, supporting theories in\nwhich amodal conceptual representations exist. Together, these results serve to\nanchor a more comprehensive spatio-temporal delineation of the semantic feature\nspace during production planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 22:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 20:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

This manuscript presents an\ninformation-theory-based optimal experimental design (OED) approach that\nminimizes the uncertainty in the rate parameter, $k_{PL}$, recovered from\nHP-MRI measurements. Mutual information (MI) is employed to measure the\ninformation content of the HP measurements with respect to the first-order\nexchange kinetics of the pyruvate conversion to lactate. Flip angles of the\npulse sequence acquisition are optimized with respect to the mutual\ninformation. Further, a spatially varying model (high-fidelity) based on the\nBlock-Torrey equations is proposed and utilized as a control. A time-varying\nflip angle scheme leads to a higher parameter optimization that can further\nimprove the quantitative value of mutual information over a constant flip angle\nscheme. However, the constant flip angle scheme leads to the best accuracy and\nprecision when considering inference from noise-corrupted data. For the\nparticular MRI data examined here, pyruvate and lactate flip angles of 35 and\n28 degrees, respectively, were the best choice in terms of accuracy and\nprecision of the parameter recovery. Moreover, the recovery of rate parameter\n$k_{PL}$ from the data generated from the high-fidelity model highlights the\ninfluence of diffusion and strength of vascular source on the recovered rate\nparameter.

In this paper,\nwe propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Module Network (HGNMN) that reasons over\nmulti-layer graphs with neural modules to address the above issues.\nSpecifically, we first encode the image by multi-layer graphs from the visual,\nsemantic and commonsense views since the clues that support the answer may\nexist in different modalities. Our model consists of several well-designed\nneural modules that perform specific functions over graphs, which can be used\nto conduct multi-step reasoning within and between different graphs. Compared\nto existing modular networks, we extend visual reasoning from one graph to more\ngraphs. We can explicitly trace the reasoning process according to module\nweights and graph attentions. Experiments show that our model not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the CRIC dataset but also obtains explicit and\nexplainable reasoning procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 02:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

In the case of human action\nvideos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of\nvariation, this gap remains significant. One of the key reasons for this is\nthat sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many\nself-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively\nto avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur\ntemporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of\nmotion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based\nself-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key\ncontribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive\nsampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This\nenables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to\nsample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video\nretrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when\ndirectly transferred to HMDB51. With end-to-end finetuning for action\nclassification, SLIC achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy (+0.8%) on UCF101 and 54.5%\non HMDB51 (+1.6%). SLIC is also competitive with the state-of-the-art in action\nclassification after self-supervised pretraining on Kinetics400.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 02:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Recently, visual representation learning has been shown to be\neffective and promising for boosting sample efficiency in RL. These methods\nusually rely on contrastive learning and data augmentation to train a\ntransition model for state prediction, which is different from how the model is\nused in RL--performing value-based planning. Accordingly, the learned\nrepresentation by these visual methods may be good for recognition but not\noptimal for estimating state value and solving the decision problem. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel method, called value-consistent representation\nlearning (VCR), to learn representations that are directly related to\ndecision-making. More specifically, VCR trains a model to predict the future\nstate (also referred to as the ''imagined state'') based on the current one and\na sequence of actions. Instead of aligning this imagined state with a real\nstate returned by the environment, VCR applies a $Q$-value head on both states\nand obtains two distributions of action values. Then a distance is computed and\nminimized to force the imagined state to produce a similar action value\nprediction as that by the real state. We develop two implementations of the\nabove idea for the discrete and continuous action spaces respectively.

The\nrandomized Kaczmarz method (RK) and similar stochastic iterative methods have\nreceived considerable recent attention due to their efficient implementation\nand memory footprint. These methods can tolerate streaming data, accessing only\npart of the data at a time, and can also approximate the least squares solution\neven if the system is affected by noise. However, when data is instead affected\nby large (possibly adversarial) corruptions, these methods fail to converge, as\ncorrupted data points draw iterates far from the true solution. A recently\nproposed solution to this is the QuantileRK method, which avoids harmful\ncorrupted data by exploring the space carefully as the method iterates. The\nexploration component requires the computation of quantiles of large samples\nfrom the system and is computationally much heavier than the subsequent\niteration update.\n  In this paper, we propose an approach that better uses the information\nobtained during exploration by incorporating an averaged version of the block\nKaczmarz method. This significantly speeds up convergence, while still allowing\nfor a constant fraction of the equations to be arbitrarily corrupted. We\nprovide theoretical convergence guarantees as well as experimental supporting\nevidence. We also demonstrate that the classical projection-based block\nKaczmarz method cannot be robust to sparse adversarial corruptions, but rather\nthe blocking has to be carried out by averaging one-dimensional projections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 04:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 23:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 20:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Hence, we propose a lightweight pulse extraction network,\nFastBVP-Net, to quickly measure heart rhythm via facial videos. The proposed\nFastBVP-Net uses a multi-frequency mode signal fusion (MMSF) mechanism to\ncharacterize the different modes of the raw signals in a decompose module and\nreconstruct the blood volume pulse (BVP) signal under a complex noise\nenvironment in a compose module.

Then, the HR and HRV can be estimated based on the extracted BVP\nsignals. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets to\nvalidate the proposed FastBVP-Net.

Under cyclic shear, the system evolves towards a steady-state showing\ntraining-induced strain stiffening and plasticity. A readout reveals that the\nsystem encodes a strong memory of the training amplitude as indicated by a\nlarge change in the differential shear modulus. We observe that memory can be\nencoded for a wide range of training amplitude both above and below the\nyielding, albeit, the strength of the memory decreases with increasing the\ntraining amplitude. In-situ boundary imaging shows strain localization close to\nthe shearing boundaries, while the bulk of the sample moves like a solid plug.\nIn the steady-state, the average particle velocity (<v>) inside the solid-like\nregion slows down with respect to the moving plate as the strain approaches the\ntraining amplitude, however, as the readout strain crosses the amplitude, <v>\nsuddenly increases.

This means\nthat face recognition models or systems based on deep neural networks are also\nsusceptible to adversarial examples. However, the existing methods of attacking\nface recognition models or systems with adversarial examples can effectively\ncomplete white-box attacks but not black-box impersonation attacks, physical\nattacks, or convenient attacks, particularly on commercial face recognition\nsystems. In this paper, we propose a new method to attack face recognition\nmodels or systems called RSTAM, which enables an effective black-box\nimpersonation attack using an adversarial mask printed by a mobile and compact\nprinter. First, RSTAM enhances the transferability of the adversarial masks\nthrough our proposed random similarity transformation strategy.

However, existing\nhashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous\nfeature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly\napplied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper, we propose a\nGeneralized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two\ncrucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different\ndomains, leading to an inevitable {domain distribution gap}; 2) the features of\nthe two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional\n{feature gap}. To address the GITR problem, we propose an Asymmetric Transfer\nHashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised\nrealizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by\nthe discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the\nfeature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on\ncross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the\nbipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information\nloss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate\nnegative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is\npreserved by involving a domain affinity graph.

Deep registration methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nhave been widely used as they can perform image registration in a fast and\nend-to-end manner. However, these methods usually have limited performance for\nimage pairs with large deformations. Recently, iterative deep registration\nmethods have been used to alleviate this limitation, where the transformations\nare iteratively learned in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, iterative methods\ninevitably prolong the registration runtime, and tend to learn separate image\nfeatures for each iteration, which hinders the features from being leveraged to\nfacilitate the registration at later iterations. In this study, we propose a\nNon-Iterative Coarse-to-finE registration Network (NICE-Net) for deformable\nimage registration.

For all the data sets, a\nlinear regression based on the maximal growth rate precursor shows a\nsignificant correlation. Validation of predictions for cycles 1-24 shows high\ncorrelations between the true and predicted cycle amplitudes reaching r = 0.93\nfor the total sunspot numbers. The lead time of the predictions varies from 2\nto 49 months, with a mean value of 21 months.

However,\ntheir high zT is generally obtained deep inside the superionic phase, e.g.,\nnear 1000~K in the Cu$_2$X (X: chalcogen atom) family where the superionic\ntransition is close to 400~K. At such high temperatures, the liquid-like flow\nof the metal ions under an electric field or a temperature gradient, both of\nwhich are integral to the working of a thermoelectric device, results in device\ndegradation. To harness the full potential of the superionic thermoelectrics,\nit is, therefore, necessary to reach high zT at low temperatures where the\nmetal-ion diffusion is not an issue.

In this context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), by\nembedding the knowledge of the differential model that governs the physical\nphenomenon in the learning process, can effectively address the inverse and\nforward problem of data-driven learning and solving the corresponding epidemic\nproblem. In many circumstances, however, the spatial propagation of an\ninfectious disease is characterized by movements of individuals at different\nscales governed by multiscale PDEs. This reflects the heterogeneity of a region\nor territory in relation to the dynamics within cities and in neighboring\nzones. In presence of multiple scales, a direct application of PINNs generally\nleads to poor results due to the multiscale nature of the differential model in\nthe loss function of the neural network. To allow the neural network to operate\nuniformly with respect to the small scales, it is desirable that the neural\nnetwork satisfies an Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning\nprocess.

A series of numerical tests for\ndifferent epidemic scenarios confirms the validity of the proposed approach,\nhighlighting the importance of the AP property in the neural network when\ndealing with multiscale problems especially in presence of sparse and partially\nobserved systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 11:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

GaN hosts bright and stable single-photon\nemitters in the 600 nm to 700 nm wavelength range with strong ZPLs even at room\ntemperature. In this work, we study the temperature dependence of the ZPL\nspectra of GaN SPEs integrated with solid immersion lenses with the goal of\nunderstanding the relevant decoherence mechanisms. At temperatures below ~50 K,\nthe ZPL lineshape is found to be Gaussian and the ZPL linewidth is temperature\nindependent and dominated by spectral diffusion. Above ~50 K, the linewidth\nincreases monotonically with the temperature and the lineshape evolves into a\nLorentzian. Quite remarkably, the temperature dependence of the linewidth does\nnot follow a power law. We propose a model in which decoherence caused by\nabsorption/emission of optical phonons in an elastic Raman process determines\nthe temperature dependence of the lineshape and the linewidth.

This study proposes and develops a new\napproach to the description of the tensile stress-strain curve based on the\nYield Volume Fraction (YVF) function. The YVF description provides an excellent\nmatch to experimental stress-strain curves based on a physically meaningful\nparameter that corresponds to the cumulative volume fraction of the polycrystal\nthat undergoes yielding during monotonic deformation. The statistical nature of\nthe polycrystal yield phenomenon is highlighted by the fact that the YVF model\nachieves good agreement with observations when the lognormal and extreme value\ndistributions are employed to express the cumulative density function for the\ntotal yield volume fraction, and the probability density function for the\nincremental yield volume fraction, respectively.

With the ADM formalism, the mass of the\nblack hole vortex is calculated, and its numerical results are presented. By\nanalyzing the so-called ADM mass, it is observed that the mass of the black\nhole vortex increases as the cosmological constant becomes more negative, and\nthis coincides with the vortex core becoming smaller. Nonetheless, this mass\ntends to decrease as the solitonic profile of the matter field becomes more\ncompacted. Then, the black hole temperature study is performed using the\ntunneling formalism.

Due to the increasing popularity of\ncryptocurrencies in recent years, the question has arisen, as to whether market\ninefficiencies could be exploited in Bitcoin. Several studies we refer to here\ndiscuss this topic in the context of Bitcoin using either statistical tests or\nmachine learning methods, mostly relying exclusively on data from Bitcoin\nitself. Results regarding market efficiency vary from study to study. In this\nstudy, however, the focus is on applying various asset-related input features\nin a neural network. The aim is to investigate whether the prediction accuracy\nimproves when adding equity stock indices (S&P 500, Russell 2000), currencies\n(EURUSD), 10 Year US Treasury Note Yield as well as Gold&Silver producers index\n(XAU), in addition to using Bitcoin returns as input feature. As expected, the\nresults show that more features lead to higher training performance from 54.6%\nprediction accuracy with one feature to 61% with six features. On the test set,\nwe observe that with our neural network methodology, adding additional asset\nclasses, no increase in prediction accuracy is achieved. One feature set is\nable to partially outperform a buy-and-hold strategy, but the performance drops\nagain as soon as another feature is added. This leads us to the partial\nconclusion that weak market inefficiencies for Bitcoin cannot be detected using\nneural networks and the given asset classes as input. Therefore, based on this\nstudy, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is efficient in the sense of\nthe efficient market hypothesis during the sample period.
