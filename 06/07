In principle, isolated systems comprising\nonly massive particles could evolve unitarily indefinitely in such models. In\npractice, since photons and gravitons are ubiquitous and scatter from massive\nparticles, dynamical collapses of the former will effectively induce collapses\nof the latter. In non-relativistic models in which particle number is conserved\nand interactions are modelled by classical potentials, massive systems can be\nmodelled as collections of elementary massive particles bound by potentials,\ninteracting with an environment of photons and gravitons. In this picture,\nalthough the photon and/or graviton collapse dynamics effectively localize\nmassive systems, these collapses take the effective form of approximate\nmeasurements on the environment whose effect on the massive systems is\nindirect. We argue that these environmental collapse models, like standard\nmass-dependent spontaneous localisation models, may be consistent with quantum\nexperiments on microscopic systems while predicting very rapid effective\ncollapse of macroscopic massive systems, and hence a potential solution to the\nquantum measurement problem. However, the models considered here have different\nexperimental signatures from standard mass-dependent spontaneous localisation\nmodels. For example, they predict no deviations from standard quantum\ninterferometry for mesoscopic systems of massive particles isolated from a\ndecohering environment, nor do they predict anomalous spontaneous emission of\nradiation from isolated matter of the type prediction by standard\nmass-dependent spontaneous localization models.

Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image\npairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO\ngain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure\nand low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs\nis tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment\nbetween the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to\nmotion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a\nmethod that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images.

Test-time training (TTT) emerges as a solution to this adaptation\nunder a realistic scenario where access to full source domain data is not\navailable and instant inference on target domain is required. Despite many\nefforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus\nleading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions\nand categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols,\nwe adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which\nwe further develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable\nstronger test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and\ntarget domain and match the target clusters to the source ones to improve\ngeneralization. Pseudo label filtering and iterative updating are developed to\nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of anchored clustering.

(2) linear combination\nsignificantly limits the sampling space for generating samples. To tackle these\nproblems, we propose a novel and effective augmentation method based on global\nclustering relationships named \\textbf{Global Mixup}.

The\ntest is easy to implement with no tuning parameters, robust to heavy-tailedness\nand theoretically justified with both fixed-$n$ and sequential asymptotics\nunder both null and alternatives, where $n$ is the sample size. We demonstrate\nthat the fixed-$n$ asymptotics provide a better approximation to the finite\nsample distribution and thus should be preferred in both testing and\ntesting-based estimation. To estimate the number and locations when multiple\nchange-points are present, we propose to combine the p-value under the\nfixed-$n$ asymptotics with the seeded binary segmentation (SBS) algorithm.\nThrough numerical experiments, we show that the spatial sign based procedures\nare robust with respect to the heavy-tailedness and strong coordinate-wise\ndependence, whereas their non-robust counterparts proposed in Wang et al.\n(2022) appear to under-perform. A real data example is also provided to\nillustrate the robustness and broad applicability of the proposed test and its\ncorresponding estimation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 16:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

The recently-proposed\nframework of control improvisation (CI) provides techniques for the\ncorrect-by-construction synthesis of randomized systems subject to hard and\nsoft constraints. However, prior work on CI has focused on qualitative\nspecifications, whereas in robotic planning and other areas we often have\nquantitative quality metrics which can be traded against each other. For\nexample, a designer of a patrolling security robot might want to know by how\nmuch the average patrol time needs to be increased in order to ensure that a\nparticular aspect of the robot's route is sufficiently diverse and hence\nunpredictable. In this paper, we enable this type of application by\ngeneralizing the CI problem to support quantitative soft constraints which\nbound the expected value of a given cost function, and randomness constraints\nwhich enforce diversity of the generated traces with respect to a given label\nfunction. We establish the basic theory of labelled quantitative CI problems,\nand develop efficient algorithms for solving them when the specifications are\nencoded by finite automata. We also provide an approximate improvisation\nalgorithm based on constraint solving for any specifications encodable as\nBoolean formulas.

To this end, we\npropose a volumetric framework for (i) disentangling or separating, the\nvolumetric representation of a given foreground object from the background, and\n(ii) semantically manipulating the foreground object, as well as the\nbackground. Our framework takes as input a set of 2D masks specifying the\ndesired foreground object for training views, together with the associated 2D\nviews and poses, and produces a foreground-background disentanglement that\nrespects the surrounding illumination, reflections, and partial occlusions,\nwhich can be applied to both training and novel views.

In this Letter, we conduct three-dimensional general relativistic\nradiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of TDE accretion disks at varying\naccretion rates ranging from a few to a few tens of the Eddington accretion\nrate. We make use of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to calculate\nthe reprocessed spectra at various inclinations and at different evolutionary\nstages.

What is more, we find that disks\nwith higher accretion rates have elevated wind and disk densities, which\nincreases the reprocessing of the high-energy radiation and thus generally\naugments the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio along a particular viewing angle. This\nimplies that at later times, as the accretion level declines, we expect the\nfunnel to effectively open up and allow more X-rays to leak out along\nintermediate viewing angles. Such dynamical model for TDEs can provide a\nnatural explanation for the diversity in the emission properties observed in\nTDEs at peak and along their temporal evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The remaining emission in 2019 may\nplausibly be attributed an evolved/inflated companion or an unresolved\n($\\lesssim$3 pc), young stellar cluster. Importantly, the color evolution of SN\n2015bh rules out scenarios in which the surviving progenitor is obscured by\nnascent dust and does not clearly indicate a transition to a hotter, optically\nfaint state. The simplest explanation is that the massive progenitor did not\nsurvive. SN 2015bh likely represents a remarkable example of the terminal\nexplosion of a massive star preceded by decades of end-stage eruptive\nvariability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 18:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-25"}

The majority of protoplanetary discs are\nexposed to strong ultraviolet irradiation from nearby massive stars, which\ndrives winds and depletes the mass budget for planet formation. It remains\nunclear to what degree external photoevaporation affects the formation of\nmassive planets.

We find that even moderate FUV fluxes $F_\\mathrm{FUV}\\gtrsim 100 \\,\nG_0$ have a strong influence on planet mass and migration. By decreasing the\nlocal surface density and shutting off accretion onto the planet, external\nirradiation suppresses planet masses and halts migration early.

In this work, we provide a\nfundamental understanding of this tension by designing new algorithms that\nbalance the exploration-exploitation trade-off via carefully constructed robust\nconfidence intervals.

Here we present\nthe first detection of CO(2-1) in a galaxy lying on the main-sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies at z>6. Our target, G09-83808 at z=6.03, has a short\ndepletion time-scale of T_dep~50Myr and a relatively low gas fraction of\nM_gas/M_star=0.30 that contrasts with those measured for lower redshift\nmain-sequence galaxies. We conclude that this galaxy is undergoing a starburst\nepisode with a high star formation efficiency that might be the result of gas\ncompression within its compact rotating disk. Its starburst-like nature is\nfurther supported by its high star formation rate surface density, thus\nfavoring the use of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation as a more precise diagnostic\ndiagram for starbursts. Without further significant gas accretion, this galaxy\nwould become a compact, massive quiescent galaxy at z~5.5. In addition, we find\nthat the calibration for estimating ISM masses from dust continuum emission\nsatisfactorily reproduces the gas mass derived from the CO(2-1) transition\n(within a factor of ~2). This is in line with previous studies claiming a small\nredshift evolution in the gas-to-dust ratio of massive, metal-rich galaxies. In\nthe absence of gravitational amplification, this detection would have required\nof order ~1000h of observing time. The detection of cold molecular gas in\nunlensed star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is thus prohibitive with\ncurrent facilities and requires a ten-fold improvement in sensitivity, such as\nthat envisaged for the ngVLA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The first, global\nfusion, guides the relationship among all local optical windows to maintain the\nstructure of the recovered region consistent with the remaining cloud-free\nregions. The second, local fusion, transfers complementary information embedded\nin the SAR image that corresponds to cloudy areas to generate reliable texture\ndetails of the missing regions, and uses dynamic filtering to alleviate the\nperformance degradation caused by speckle noise. Extensive evaluation\ndemonstrates that the proposed algorithm can yield high quality cloud-free\nimages and outperform state-of-the-art cloud removal algorithms with a gain\nabout 1.7dB in terms of PSNR on SEN12MS-CR dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 10:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 09:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Very often\nsynchronization is observed in such populations if they are allowed to\ninteract. A paradigmatic model for the study of such phenomena has been the\nKuramoto model. However, considering real oscillations are rarely isochronous\nas a function of energy, it is natural to extend the model by allowing the\nnatural frequencies to vary as a function of some dynamical resource supply.\nBeyond just accounting for a dynamical supply of resources, however,\ncompetition over a \\emph{shared} resource supply is important in a variety of\nbiological systems. In neuronal systems, for example, resource competition\nenables the study of neural activity via fMRI. It is reasonable to expect that\nthis dynamical resource allocation should have consequences for the\nsynchronization behavior of the brain. This paper presents a modified Kuramoto\ndynamics which includes additional dynamical terms that provide a relatively\nsimple model of resource competition among populations of Kuramoto oscillators.\nWe design a mutlilayer system which highlights the impact of the competition\ndynamics, and we show that in this designed system, correlations can arise\nbetween the synchronization states of two populations of oscillators which\nshare no phase-coupling edges. These correlations are interesting in light of\nthe often observed variance between functional and structural connectivity\nmeasures in real systems. The model presented here then suggests that some of\nthe observed discrepancy may be explained by the way in which the brain\ndynamically allocates resources to different regions according to demand. If\ntrue, models such as this one provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the\ndifferences between structural and functional measures, and possibly implicate\ndynamical resource allocation as an integral part of the neural computation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Software\ncompartmentalization is one technique to limit the attacks' effects to the\ncompromised compartment and not the entire system. Unfortunately, the existing\nstate-of-the-art embedded hardware-software solutions do not work well to\nenforce software compartmentalization for high-end embedded systems. MPUs are\nnot fine-grained and suffer from significant scalability limitations as they\ncan only protect a small and fixed number of memory regions. On the other hand,\nMMUs suffer from non-determinism and coarse-grained protection. This paper\nintroduces CompartOS as a lightweight linkage-based compartmentalization model\nfor high-end, complex, mainstream embedded systems. CompartOS builds on CHERI,\na capability-based hardware architecture, to meet scalability, availability,\ncompatibility, and fine-grained security goals. Microbenchmarks show that\nCompartOS' protection-domain crossing is 95% faster than MPU-based IPC. We\napplied the CompartOS model, with low effort, to complex existing systems,\nincluding TCP servers and a safety-critical automotive demo. CompartOS not only\ncatches 10 out of 13 FreeRTOS-TCP published vulnerabilities that MPU-based\nprotection (e.g., uVisor) cannot catch but can also recover from them. Further,\nour TCP throughput evaluations show that our CompartOS prototype is 52% faster\nthan relevant MPU-based compartmentalization models (e.g., ACES), with a 15%\noverhead compared to an unprotected system.

The emergence of\ncoherent interfaces like CXL enables main memory expansion and offers an\nefficient solution to this problem. In such systems, the main memory can\nconstitute different memory technologies with varied characteristics. In this\npaper, we characterize memory usage patterns of a wide range of datacenter\napplications across the server fleet of Meta.

TPP employs a lightweight mechanism to identify\nand place hot/cold pages to appropriate memory tiers. It enables a proactive\npage demotion from local memory to CXL-Memory. This technique ensures a memory\nheadroom for new page allocations that are often related to request processing\nand tend to be short-lived and hot. At the same time, TPP can promptly promote\nperformance-critical hot pages trapped in the slow CXL-Memory to the fast local\nmemory, while minimizing both sampling overhead and unnecessary migrations. TPP\nworks transparently without any application-specific knowledge and can be\ndeployed globally as a kernel release.\n  We evaluate TPP in the production server fleet with early samples of new x86\nCPUs with CXL 1.1 support. TPP makes a tiered memory system performant as an\nideal baseline (<1% gap) that has all the memory in the local tier.

For the\nfairness evaluation, we build on well-known theories of distributive justice\nand on the algorithmic literature to ask what a fair distribution of utility\n(or welfare) looks like. This allows us to derive a fairness score that we then\ncompare to the decision maker's utility.

The FEP is not\na true free energy, however, it is common to treat the FEP as the free-energy\nanalog of the minimum energy path on the PES and to take the activation free\nenergy, $\\Delta F^\\ddagger_\\mathrm{RP}$, as the difference between the maximum\nof the FEP at the transition state and the minimum at R.

Since the FEP depends on the CV, it\nis therefore not unique, and different, discriminating CVs can yield different\nactivation free energies for the same reaction. We derive an exact expression\nfor the activation free energy that avoids this ambiguity with respect to the\nchoice of CV. We find $\\Delta F^\\ddagger_\\mathrm{RP}$ to be a combination of\nthe probability of the system being in the reactant state, the probability\ndensity at the transition state surface, and the thermal de~Broglie wavelength\nassociated with the transition from R to P. We then evaluate the activation\nfree energies based on our formalism for simple analytic models and realistic\nchemical systems. The analytic models show that the widespread FEP-based\napproximation applies only at low temperatures for CVs for which the effective\nmass of the associated pseudo-particle is small. Most chemical reactions of\npractical interest involve polyatomic molecules with complex, high-dimensional\nPES that cannot be treated analytically and pose the added challenge of\nchoosing a good CV, typically through heuristics.

Motivated by this issue, recent\nwork developed architectures capable of generating Proofs of Execution (PoX)\nfor the correct/expected software in potentially compromised low-end MCUs. In\npractice, this capability can be leveraged to provide \"integrity from birth\" to\nsensor data, by binding the sensed results/outputs to an unforgeable\ncryptographic proof of execution of the expected sensing process. Despite this\nsignificant progress, current PoX schemes for low-end MCUs ignore the real-time\nneeds of many applications.

We argue that lack\nof asynchronous capabilities (i.e., interrupts within PoX) can obscure PoX\nusefulness, as several applications require processing real-time and\nasynchronous events. To bridge this gap, we propose, implement, and evaluate an\nArchitecture for Secure Asynchronous Processing in PoX (ASAP).

Among those surveys, the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey\n(GES), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target\n100,000 stars using FLAMES on the ESO VLT (both Giraffe and UVES\nspectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on\nopen star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey\nimplementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data\nproducts, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and\npotential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.)\nreviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data\nreduction, organisation, and workflow. The GES has determined homogeneous\ngood-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of\nits more than 110,000 unique target stars.

However, the bufferbloat phenomenon in\nstorage backends impacts the schedulability of the system. In a storage server,\nbufferbloat happens when the server submits all requests immediately to the\nstorage backend due to a large buffer in the backend.

Then it predicts\nwhether a candidate event node in the schema graph should be added to the\ninstantiated schema subgraph by characterizing two types of local topology of\nthe schema graph: neighbors of the candidate node and the subgraph, and paths\nthat connect the candidate node and the subgraph. These two modules are later\ncombined together for the final prediction. We also propose a self-supervised\nstrategy to construct training samples, as well as an inference algorithm that\nis specifically designed to complete event graphs. Extensive experimental\nresults on four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with 4.3% to 19.4% absolute F1 gains over the\nbest baseline method on the four datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 21:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Recently, a novel manifestation of Anderson\nlocalization for wave packets launched with a finite average velocity was\nproposed, the Quantum boomerang effect (QBE). This phenomenon predicts that the\ndisorder-averaged center of mass of a particle initially moves ballistically,\nthen makes a U-turn, and finally slowly returns to its initial position. The\nQBE has been predicted to take place in several Hermitian models with Anderson\nlocalization and has been experimentally observed in the paradigmatic quantum\nkicked rotor model. In this work, we investigate the emergence of the QBE in\nnon-Hermitian systems and clarify the importance of symmetries of the\nHamiltonian and the initial state. We generalize the analytical arguments\navailable in the literature and show that even in the case of complex spectrum\na boomerang-like behavior can appear in a non-Hermitian system. We confirm our\nanalytical results through a careful numerical investigation of the dynamics\nfor several non-Hermitian models.

Previous methods require manual exemplars\nto acquire procedural planning knowledge from LLMs in the zero-shot setting.\nHowever, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in LLMs induces spurious\ncorrelations between goals and steps, which impair the model generalization to\nunseen tasks.

The seller is now faced with\na multi-parameter mechanism design problem. Computing an efficient allocation\nis computationally intractable, and therefore the standard\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction, while truthful and welfare-optimal, is\nimpractical.\n  In this paper, we tackle a fundamental problem in the design of modern ad\nauctions. We adopt a ``Myersonian'' approach and study allocation rules that\nare monotone both in the bid and set of rich ads. We show that such rules can\nbe paired with a payment function to give a truthful auction. Our main\ntechnical challenge is designing a monotone rule that yields a good\napproximation to the optimal welfare. Monotonicity doesn't hold for standard\nalgorithms, e.g. the incremental bang-per-buck order, that give good\napproximations to ``knapsack-like'' problems such as ours. In fact, we show\nthat no deterministic monotone rule can approximate the optimal welfare within\na factor better than $2$ (while there is a non-monotone FPTAS). Our main result\nis a new, simple, greedy and monotone allocation rule that guarantees a $3$\napproximation.\n  In ad auctions in practice, monotone allocation rules are often paired with\nthe so-called Generalized Second Price (GSP) payment rule, which charges the\nminimum threshold price below which the allocation changes. We prove that, even\nthough our monotone allocation rule paired with GSP is not truthful, its Price\nof Anarchy (PoA) is bounded.

Despite this fact, the\ndescription of their real-time dynamics beyond the Fermi's golden rule remains\na formiddable theoretical problem. This is due to the rapid spread of\nentanglement within the degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment. This\nis accompanied with a quantum noise (QN) acting on the mesoscopic device. In\nthis work we propose a possible way out: to exploit the fact that this QN is\nusually bandlimited. This is because its spectral density is often contained in\npeaks of localized modes and resonances, and may be constrained by bandgaps.\nInspired by the Kotelnikov sampling theorem from the theory of classical\nbandlimited signals, we put forward and explore the idea that when the QN\nspectral density has effective bandwidth $B$, the quantum noise becomes a\ndiscrete-time process, with an elementary time step $\\tau\\propto B^{-1}$. After\neach time step $\\tau$, one new QN degree of freedom (DoF) gets coupled to the\ndevice for the first time, and one new QN DoF get irreversibly decoupled. Only\na bounded number of QN DoFs are significantly coupled at any time moment. We\ncall these DoFs the \\textit{Kotelnikov modes}. As a result, the real-time\ndissipative quantum motion has a natural structure of a discrete-time matrix\nproduct state, with a bounded bond dimension. This yields a microscopically\nderived collision model. The temporal entanglement entropy appears to be\nbounded (area-law scaling) in the frame of Kotelnikov modes. The irreversibly\ndecoupled modes can be traced out as soon as they occur during the real-time\nevolution. This leads to a novel\\textit{bandlimited} input-output formalism and\nto quantum jump Monte Carlo simulation techniques for real-time motion of open\nquantum systems. We illustrate this idea on a spin-boson model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 00:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The\ntime complexity of DTW is quadratic to the length of time series, making it\ninapplicable in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel time\nseries dissimilarity measure named RobustDTW to reduce the effects of noises\nand outliers. Specifically, the RobustDTW estimates the trend and optimizes the\ntime warp in an alternating manner by utilizing our designed temporal graph\ntrend filtering. To improve efficiency, we propose a multi-level framework that\nestimates the trend and the warp function at a lower resolution, and then\nrepeatedly refines them at a higher resolution. Based on the proposed\nRobustDTW, we further extend it to periodicity detection and outlier time\nseries detection.

In response, we introduce saliency cards: structured\ndocumentation of how saliency methods operate and their performance across a\nbattery of evaluative metrics.

One such\napproach adopts structural controllability, a theory for controlling a network\n(the cell). Motivated to protect the cell from viral infections, we extended\nthis theory to total controllability and introduced a new concept of control\nhubs. Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by\nexogenous stimuli, e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug\ntargets. We developed an efficient algorithm for finding all control hubs and\napplied it to the largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction network.\nOur new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including\nthat based on structural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs\nare enriched with functions of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and\nresponses to cellular stress and nutrient levels, revealing critical pathways\ninduced by SARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to drugs in 4 major\ncategories: antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve\nsystems, and dietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their\nfunctions also provided deep insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of the\ndrugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable drug\nrepurposing method.

Models of neural dynamics often focus on either\nlow-dimensional projections of neural activity, or on learning dynamical\nsystems that explicitly relate to the neural state over time. We discuss how\nthese two approaches are interrelated by considering dynamical systems as\nrepresentative of flows on a low-dimensional manifold. Building on this\nconcept, we propose a new decomposed dynamical system model that represents\ncomplex non-stationary and nonlinear dynamics of time-series data as a sparse\ncombination of simpler, more interpretable components. The decomposed nature of\nthe dynamics generalizes over previous switched approaches and enables modeling\nof overlapping and non-stationary drifts in the dynamics.

Moreover, the\ncorresponding enzyme needs to recognize not only mismatches but also correct\nmatches. The accuracy of recognizing correct matches should be very high\nbecause mistaking correct matches for mismatches would introduce extra errors\ndue to repair mistakes. Thus, non-equilibrium should play a role because it has\nthe ability to give rise to high recognition accuracy by consuming adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP). Here we explore this possibility. Since the knowledge of\nactual MMR enzymes is incomplete, we construct a hypothetical enzyme, which is\na quantum system having three discrete energy levels.

We show that our model stabilizes a HL composed of two\npairs of left- and right-handed helices, resulting in no net scalar spin\nchirality, in stark contrast to the noncentrosymmetric case. We find that the\nHL turns into topologically-trivial conical states in an applied magnetic\nfield. From the detailed analyses of the constituent spin helices, we clarify\nthat the ellipticity and angles of the helical planes change gradually while\nincreasing the magnetic field. We discuss the results in comparison with the\nexperiments for a centrosymmetric cubic metal SrFeO$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 06:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

An essential facet of turbulence is the space-time intermittency of\nthe cascade of energy that leads to coherent structures of high dissipation.\nAims. In this work, we attempt to investigate systematically the physical\nnature of the intense dissipation regions in decaying isothermal\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence. Methods. We probe the turbulent\ndissipation with grid based simulations of compressible isothermal decaying MHD\nturbulence. We take unprecedented care at resolving and controlling\ndissipation: we design methods to locally recover the dissipation due to the\nnumerical scheme. We locally investigate the geometry of the gradients of the\nfluid state variables. We develop a method to assess the physical nature of the\nlargest gradients in simulations and to estimate their travelling velocity.\nFinally we investigate their statistics. Results. We find that intense\ndissipation regions mainly correspond to sheets: locally, density, velocity and\nmagnetic fields vary primarily across one direction. We identify these highly\ndissipative regions as fast/slow shocks or Alfv{\\'e}n discontinuities (Parker\nsheets or rotational discontinuities). On these structures, we find the main\ndeviation from 1D planar steady-state is mass loss in the plane of the\nstructure. We investigate the effect of initial conditions which yield\ndifferent imprints at early time on the relative distributions between these\nfour categories. However, these differences fade out after about one turnover\ntime, when they become dominated by weakly compressible Alfv{\\'e}n\ndiscontinuities. We show that the magnetic Prandtl number has little influence\non the statistics of these discontinuities, but it controls the Ohmic vs\nviscous heating rates within them. Finally, we find the entrance\ncharacteristics of the structures (such as entrance velocity and magnetic\npressure) are strongly correlated. Conclusions. These new methods allow to\nconsider developed compressible turbulence as a statistical collection of\nintense dissipation structures. This can be used to post-process 3D turbulence\nwith detailed 1D models apt for comparison with observations. It could also\nreveal useful as a framework to formulate new dynamical properties of\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 06:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Given the richness of the established\nassimilation algorithms, and the abundance of the approaches through which\nhyper-parameters are introduced to the assimilation algorithms, one may ask\nwhether it is possible to develop a sound and generic method to efficiently\nchoose various types of (sometimes high-dimensional) hyper-parameters. This\nwork aims to explore a feasible, although likely partial, answer to this\nquestion. Our main idea is built upon the notion that a data assimilation\nalgorithm with hyper-parameters can be considered as a parametric mapping that\nlinks a set of quantities of interest (e.g., model state variables and/or\nparameters) to a corresponding set of predicted observations in the observation\nspace. As such, the choice of hyper-parameters can be recast as a parameter\nestimation problem, in which our objective is to tune the hyper-parameters in\nsuch a way that the resulted predicted observations can match the real\nobservations to a good extent. From this perspective, we propose a\nhyper-parameter estimation workflow and investigate the performance of this\nworkflow in an ensemble Kalman filter. In a series of experiments, we observe\nthat the proposed workflow works efficiently even in the presence of a\nrelatively large amount (up to $10^3$) of hyper-parameters, and exhibits\nreasonably good and consistent performance under various conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 06:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

However, conventional CPU-based servers cannot\nhandle excessive computational requirements of deep neural network (DNN)\nmodels, while GPU-based servers suffer from huge power consumption and high\noperating cost. In this paper, we present a scalable systolic-vector\narchitecture that can cope with dynamically changing DNN workloads in cloud\ndatacenters. We first devise a lightweight DNN model description format called\nunified model format (UMF) that enables general model representation and fast\ndecoding in hardware accelerator. Based on this model format, we propose a\nheterogeneous architecture that features a load balancer that performs a\nhigh-level workload distribution and multiple systolic-vector clusters, in\nwhich each cluster consists of a programmable scheduler, throughput-oriented\nsystolic arrays, and function-oriented vector processors. We also propose a\nheterogeneity-aware scheduling algorithm that enables concurrent execution of\nmultiple DNN workloads while maximizing heterogeneous hardware utilization\nbased on computation and memory access time estimation. Finally, we build an\narchitecture simulation framework based on actual synthesis and place-and-route\nimplementation results and conduct design space exploration for the proposed\narchitecture. As a result, the proposed systolic-vector architecture achieves\n10.9x higher throughput performance and 30.17x higher energy efficiency than a\ncompatible GPU on realistic ML workloads. The proposed heterogeneity-aware\nscheduling algorithm improves the throughput and energy efficiency by 81% and\n20%, respectively, compared to a standard round-robin scheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 07:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In this paper, a\nSequential MetAmoRphic Testing Smart framework is proposed based on metamorphic\ntesting, a mainstream software testing approach. In metamorphic testing,\nmetamorphic groups are constructed by selecting multiple inputs according to\nthe so-called metamorphic relations, which are basically the system's necessary\nproperties; the violation of certain relations by some corresponding\nmetamorphic groups implies the detection of erroneous system behaviors.

The conducted\nexperiments reveal a large number of undesirable behaviors in these top-ranked\ndeep learning models in the scenarios.

However, we find that IoT security\ndiscussions can also be buried inside non-security discussions in SO. In this\npaper, we aim to understand the challenges IoT developers face while applying\nsecurity practices and techniques to IoT devices.

First, we download 53K posts from SO that contain\ndiscussions about IoT. Second, we manually labeled 5,919 sentences from 53K\nposts as 1 or 0.

Computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CAD) using the deep learning method has the potential to solve the\nproblem of insufficient pathology staffing. However, the cancerous patterns of\nROSE images vary greatly between different samples, making the CAD task\nextremely challenging. Besides, due to different staining qualities and various\ntypes of acquisition devices, the ROSE images also have compli-cated\nperturbations in terms of color distribution, brightness, and contrast. To\naddress these challenges, we proposed a novel multiple instance learning (MIL)\napproach using shuffle patches containing the instances, which adopts the\npatch-based learning strategy of Vision Transformers. With the re-grouped bags\nof shuffle instances and their bag-level soft labels, the approach utilizes a\nMIL head to make the model focus on the features from the pancreatic cancer\ncells, rather than that from various perturbations in ROSE images.\nSimultaneously, combined with a classification head, the model can effectively\nidentify the gen-eral distributive patterns across different instances. The\nresults demonstrate the significant improvements in the classification accuracy\nwith more accurate at-tention regions, indicating that the diverse patterns of\nROSE images are effec-tively extracted, and the complicated perturbations of\nROSE images are signifi-cantly eliminated. It also suggests that the MIL with\nshuffle instances has great potential in the analysis of cytopathological\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 07:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In\ncontrast to the most popular Online Social Networks, which are based on\ncentralized architectures (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), DOSNs are\nnot based on a single service provider acting as a central authority. Indeed,\nthe contents that are published on DOSNs are stored on the devices made\navailable by their users, which cooperate to execute the tasks needed to\nprovide the service. To continuously guarantee their availability, the contents\npublished by a user could be stored on the devices of other users, simply\nbecause they are online when required. Consequently, such contents must be\nproperly protected by the DOSN infrastructure, in order to ensure that they can\nbe really accessed only by users who have the permission of the publishers.

To achieve both\nhigh sensitivity and precision, bucketing methods are desired to assign similar\nsequences into the same bucket while assigning dissimilar sequences into\ndistinct buckets. Existing $k$-mer-based bucketing methods have been efficient\nin processing sequencing data with low error rate, but encounter much reduced\nsensitivity on data with high error rate. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)\nschemes are able to mitigate this issue through tolerating the edits in similar\nsequences, but state-of-the-art methods still have large gaps. Here we\ngeneralize the LSH function by allowing it to hash one sequence into multiple\nbuckets. Formally, a bucketing function, which maps a sequence (of fixed\nlength) into a subset of buckets, is defined to be $(d_1, d_2)$-sensitive if\nany two sequences within an edit distance of $d_1$ are mapped into at least one\nshared bucket, and any two sequences with distance at least $d_2$ are mapped\ninto disjoint subsets of buckets. We construct locality-sensitive bucketing\n(LSB) functions with a variety of values of $(d_1,d_2)$ and analyze their\nefficiency with respect to the total number of buckets needed as well as the\nnumber of buckets that a specific sequence is mapped to. We also prove lower\nbounds of these two parameters in different settings and show that some of our\nconstructed LSB functions are optimal. These results provide theoretical\nfoundations for their practical use in analyzing sequences with high error rate\nwhile also providing insights for the hardness of designing ungapped LSH\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 08:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 16:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In this work, we propose Dual\nSwin-Transformer based Mutual Interactive Network. We adopt Swin-Transformer as\nthe feature extractor for both RGB and depth modality to model the long-range\ndependencies in visual inputs. Before fusing the two branches of features into\none, attention-based modules are applied to enhance features from each\nmodality.

Recent learning-based methods, trained to directly predict\ntransformations between two images, run much faster, but suffer from\nperformance deficiencies due to model generalization and the inefficiency in\nhandling individual image specific deformations. Here we present a new neural\nnet based image registration framework, called NIR (Neural Image Registration),\nwhich is based on optimization but utilizes deep neural nets to model\ndeformations between image pairs. NIR represents the transformation between two\nimages with a continuous function implemented via neural fields, receiving a 3D\ncoordinate as input and outputting the corresponding deformation vector. NIR\nprovides two ways of generating deformation field: directly output a\ndisplacement vector field for general deformable registration, or output a\nvelocity vector field and integrate the velocity field to derive the\ndeformation field for diffeomorphic image registration. The optimal\nregistration is discovered by updating the parameters of the neural field via\nstochastic gradient descent. We describe several design choices that facilitate\nmodel optimization, including coordinate encoding, sinusoidal activation,\ncoordinate sampling, and intensity sampling. Experiments on two 3D MR brain\nscan datasets demonstrate that NIR yields state-of-the-art performance in terms\nof both registration accuracy and regularity, while running significantly\nfaster than traditional optimization-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 08:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 20:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

In\nthis setting, candidates' rewards may not be directly comparable between\ngroups, for example when the agent is an employer hiring candidates from\ndifferent ethnic groups and some groups have a lower reward due to\ndiscriminatory bias and/or social injustice. We propose a notion of fairness\nthat states that the agent's policy is fair when it selects a candidate with\nhighest relative rank, which measures how good the reward is when compared to\ncandidates from the same group. This is a very strong notion of fairness, since\nthe relative rank is not directly observed by the agent and depends on the\nunderlying reward model and on the distribution of rewards. Thus we study the\nproblem of learning a policy which approximates a fair policy under the\ncondition that the contexts are independent between groups and the distribution\nof rewards of each group is absolutely continuous. In particular, we design a\ngreedy policy which at each round constructs a ridge regression estimate from\nthe observed context-reward pairs, and then computes an estimate of the\nrelative rank of each candidate using the empirical cumulative distribution\nfunction. We prove that, despite its simplicity and the lack of an initial\nexploration phase, the greedy policy achieves, up to log factors and with high\nprobability, a fair pseudo-regret of order $\\sqrt{dT}$ after $T$ rounds, where\n$d$ is the dimension of the context vectors. The policy also satisfies\ndemographic parity at each round when averaged over all possible information\navailable before the selection. Finally, we use simulated settings and\nexperiments on the US census data to show that our policy achieves sub-linear\nfair pseudo-regret also in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 09:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 11:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 14:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

In this paper, we explore a more practical protocol, shuffled check-in,\nto resolve the aforementioned issues.

Edge devices are typically\nlimited in their computational resources, yet, often multiple edge devices are\ndeployed in the same environment and can reliably communicate with each other.\nIn this work we propose to facilitate the application of DNNs on the edge by\nallowing multiple users to collaborate during inference to improve their\naccuracy. Our mechanism, coined {\\em edge ensembles}, is based on having\ndiverse predictors at each device, which form an ensemble of models during\ninference. To mitigate the communication overhead, the users share quantized\nfeatures, and we propose a method for aggregating multiple decisions into a\nsingle inference rule. We analyze the latency induced by edge ensembles,\nshowing that its performance improvement comes at the cost of a minor\nadditional delay under common assumptions on the communication network.

This\narticle presents a novel theory -- Representational Systems Theory -- that is\ndesigned to abstractly encode a wide variety of representations from three core\nperspectives: syntax, entailment, and their properties. By introducing the\nconcept of a construction space, we are able to encode each of these core\ncomponents under a single, unifying paradigm. Using our Representational\nSystems Theory, it becomes possible to structurally transform representations\nin one system into representations in another. An intrinsic facet of our\nstructural transformation technique is representation selection based on\nproperties that representations possess, such as their relative cognitive\neffectiveness or structural complexity. A major theoretical barrier to\nproviding general structural transformation techniques is a lack of terminating\nalgorithms. Representational Systems Theory permits the derivation of partial\ntransformations when no terminating algorithm can produce a full\ntransformation. Since Representational Systems Theory provides a universal\napproach to encoding representational systems, a further key barrier is\neliminated: the need to devise system-specific structural transformation\nalgorithms, that are necessary when different systems adopt different\nformalisation approaches. Consequently, Representational Systems Theory is the\nfirst general framework that provides a unified approach to encoding\nrepresentations, supports representation selection via structural\ntransformations, and has the potential for widespread practical application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 10:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Here we\nused the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset to construct a correlation\nnetwork of countries/regions and studied its global community structure.\nSpecifically, we selected countries/regions that had at least 100,000\ncumulative positive cases from the dataset and generated a 7-day moving average\ntime series of new positive cases reported for each country/region. We then\ncalculated a time series of daily change exponents by taking the day-to-day\ndifference in log of the number of new positive cases. We constructed a\ncorrelation network by connecting countries/regions that had positive\ncorrelations in their daily change exponent time series using their Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient as the edge weight. Applying the modularity\nmaximization method revealed that there were three major communities: (1)\nMainly Europe + North America + Southeast Asia that showed similar six-peak\npatterns during the pandemic, (2) mainly Near/Middle East + Central/South Asia\n+ Central/South America that loosely followed Community 1 but had a notable\nincrease of activities because of the Delta variant and was later impacted\nsignificantly by the Omicron variant, and (3) mainly Africa + Central/East\nCanada + Australia that did not have much activities until a huge spike was\ncaused by the Omicron variant. These three communities were robustly detected\nunder varied settings. Constructing a 3D \"phase space\" by using the median\ncurves in those three communities for x-y-z coordinates generated an effective\nsummary trajectory of how the global pandemic progressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 11:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 21:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 13:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

A ground vehicle\nneeds to look for traversable terrains that are explorable by wheels. Then, to\nmake safe navigation decisions, the segmentation of objects positioned on those\nterrains has to be followed up. However, over-segmentation and\nunder-segmentation can negatively influence such navigation decisions. To that\nend, we propose TRAVEL, which performs traversable ground detection and object\nclustering simultaneously using the graph representation of a 3D point cloud.\nTo segment the traversable ground, a point cloud is encoded into a graph\nstructure, tri-grid field, which treats each tri-grid as a node. Then, the\ntraversable regions are searched and redefined by examining local convexity and\nconcavity of edges that connect nodes. On the other hand, our above-ground\nobject segmentation employs a graph structure by representing a group of\nhorizontally neighboring 3D points in a spherical-projection space as a node\nand vertical/horizontal relationship between nodes as an edge. Fully leveraging\nthe node-edge structure, the above-ground segmentation ensures real-time\noperation and mitigates over-segmentation. Through experiments using\nsimulations, urban scenes, and our own datasets, we have demonstrated that our\nproposed traversable ground segmentation algorithm outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of the conventional metrics and that our\nnewly proposed evaluation metrics are meaningful for assessing the above-ground\nsegmentation.

AIMS: We\npresent some observational evidences to guide future hydrodynamical simulations\nand common envelope studies.

These two\ncomponents likely have orthogonal geometry with the 2008 mass loss displaying a\ndust-laden bipolar ejecta produced by a time limited rapidly accelerating wind\nand the circumbinary gas having a donut-like shape. A central source powers\nthem both, having produced a fluorescent light pulse, but we cannot precisely\ndetermine the time it started or its spectral energy distribution.

Here, we present novel analyses and a\nnew framework to address (1)-(2) for a broad range of multi-scale, nonlinear\nsystems. Our approach combines spectral analyses of the systems' data with\nspectral analyses of convolutional NN's activations and kernels, explaining the\ninner-workings of TL in terms of the system's nonlinear physics. Using\nsubgrid-scale modeling of several setups of 2D turbulence as test cases, we\nshow that the learned kernels are combinations of low-, band-, and high-pass\nfilters, and that TL learns new filters whose nature is consistent with the\nspectral differences of base and target systems. We also find the shallowest\nlayers are the best to re-train in these cases, which is against the common\nwisdom guiding TL in machine learning literature. Our framework identifies the\nbest layer(s) to re-train beforehand, based on physics and NN theory. Together,\nthese analyses explain the physics learned in TL and provide a framework to\nguide TL for wide-ranging applications in science and engineering, such as\nclimate change modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 11:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In order to learn a fair unified\nrepresentation, we send it to each platform storing fairness-sensitive features\nand apply adversarial learning to remove bias from the unified representation\ninherited from the biased data. Moreover, for protecting user privacy, we\nfurther propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to remove private\ninformation from the unified representation in server before sending it to the\nplatforms keeping fairness-sensitive features.

Nonetheless, social\nrobotics still faces many challenges. One bottleneck is that robotic behaviors\nneed to be often adapted as social norms depend strongly on the environment.\nFor example, a robot should navigate more carefully around patients in a\nhospital compared to workers in an office. In this work, we investigate\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) as a potential solution. Here, robot\nbehaviors are learned via reinforcement learning where a reward function needs\nto be chosen so that the robot learns an appropriate behavior for a given\nenvironment. We propose to use a variational meta-RL procedure that quickly\nadapts the robots' behavior to new reward functions. As a result, given a new\nenvironment different reward functions can be quickly evaluated and an\nappropriate one selected. The procedure learns a vectorized representation for\nreward functions and a meta-policy that can be conditioned on such a\nrepresentation. Given observations from a new reward function, the procedure\nidentifies its representation and conditions the meta-policy to it. While\ninvestigating the procedures' capabilities, we realized that it suffers from\nposterior collapse where only a subset of the dimensions in the representation\nencode useful information resulting in a reduced performance. Our second\ncontribution, a radial basis function (RBF) layer, partially mitigates this\nnegative effect. The RBF layer lifts the representation to a higher dimensional\nspace, which is more easily exploitable for the meta-policy. We demonstrate the\ninterest of the RBF layer and the usage of meta-RL for social robotics on four\nrobotic simulation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 12:08:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 09:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 16:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

Accurate diagnosis\nand prognosis of this disease are essential to design an appropriate treatment\nplan, increasing the life expectancy of the patient. Intense research has been\nconducted on the use of machine learning to identify Alzheimer's Disease from\nneuroimaging data, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging. In recent\nyears, advances of deep learning in computer vision suggest a new research\ndirection for this problem. Current deep learning-based approaches in this\nfield, however, have a number of drawbacks, including the interpretability of\nmodel decisions, a lack of generalizability information and a lower performance\ncompared to traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we design a\ntwo-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the first stage, an\nensemble of 125 U-Nets is used to grade the input image, producing a 3D map\nthat reflects the disease severity at voxel-level. This map can help to\nlocalize abnormal brain areas caused by the disease. In the second stage, we\nmodel a graph per individual using the generated grading map and other\ninformation about the subject. We propose to use a graph convolutional neural\nnetwork classifier for the final classification. As a result, our framework\ndemonstrates comparative performance to the state-of-the-art methods in\ndifferent datasets for both diagnosis and prognosis. We also demonstrate that\nthe use of a large ensemble of U-Nets offers a better generalization capacity\nfor our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 13:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 10:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

The Bayesian approach is powerful for\nsolving such problems; one formulates a prior distribution for the parameter\nstate that is updated with the observations to compute the posterior parameter\ndistribution. Solving for the posterior distribution can be challenging when,\ne.g., prior and posterior significantly differ from one another and/or the\nparameter space is high-dimensional. We use a sequence of importance sampling\nmeasures that arise by tempering the likelihood to approach inverse problems\nexhibiting a significant distance between prior and posterior. Each importance\nsampling measure is identified by cross-entropy minimization as proposed in the\ncontext of Bayesian inverse problems in Engel et al. (2021). To efficiently\naddress problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces we set up the\nminimization procedure in a low-dimensional subspace of the original parameter\nspace. The principal idea is to analyse the spectrum of the second-moment\nmatrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood function to identify a suitable\nsubspace. Following Zahm et al. (2021), an upper bound on the\nKullback-Leibler-divergence between full-dimensional and subspace posterior is\nprovided, which can be utilized to determine the effective dimension of the\ninverse problem corresponding to a prescribed approximation error bound. We\nsuggest heuristic criteria for optimally selecting the number of model and\nmodel gradient evaluations in each iteration of the importance sampling\nsequence. We investigate the performance of this approach using examples from\nengineering mechanics set in various parameter space dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 13:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

The mutational signatures can be\nfound using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To extract the mutational\nsignatures we have to assume a distribution for the observed mutational counts\nand a number of mutational signatures. In most applications, the mutational\ncounts are assumed to be Poisson distributed, and the rank is chosen by\ncomparing the fit of several models with the same underlying distribution and\ndifferent values for the rank using classical model selection procedures.\nHowever, the counts are often overdispersed, and thus the Negative Binomial\ndistribution is more appropriate. We propose a Negative Binomial NMF with a\npatient specific dispersion parameter to capture the variation across patients.\nWe also introduce a novel model selection procedure inspired by\ncross-validation to determine the number of signatures.

So, one interesting question arises: $\\textit{\"Can we find\nsub-manifold(s) of data in normalizing flows and estimate the density of the\ndata on the sub-manifold(s)?\"}$. In this paper, we introduce two approaches,\nnamely per-pixel penalized log-likelihood and hierarchical training, to answer\nthe mentioned question. We propose a single-step method for joint manifold\nlearning and density estimation by disentangling the transformed space obtained\nby normalizing flows to manifold and off-manifold parts. This is done by a\nper-pixel penalized likelihood function for learning a sub-manifold of the\ndata. Normalizing flows assume the transformed data is Gaussianizationed, but\nthis imposed assumption is not necessarily true, especially in high dimensions.\nTo tackle this problem, a hierarchical training approach is employed to improve\nthe density estimation on the sub-manifold.

We consider a platform that operates a fleet\nof autonomous vehicles (AVs) and determines the pricing, rebalancing, and fleet\nsizing strategies over the transportation network in response to demand\nfluctuations. A network flow model is formulated to characterize the evolution\nof system states over space and time. Fundamental elements in AMoD markets are\ncaptured, including demand elasticity, passenger waiting time,\nvehicle-passenger matching, proactive vehicle rebalancing, and dynamic fleet\nsizing. The platform's profit maximization problem is cast as a constrained\noptimal control problem, which is highly nonconvex due to the nonlinear demand\nmodel and passenger-vehicle matching model. An integrated decomposition and\ndynamic programming approach is developed to tackle this optimal control\nproblem, where we first relax the problem through a change of variables, then\nseparate the relaxed problem into a few small-scale subproblems via dual\ndecomposition, and finally obtain the exact solution to each relaxed subproblem\nthrough dynamic programming. Despite the non-convexity, the proposed method\nestablishes a theoretical upper bound to evaluate the optimality gap of the\nobtained solution. The proposed approach is validated with numerical studies\nusing real data from New York City. We find that the platform adopts distinct\noperation strategies in core and non-core areas of the city because of the\nasymmetric demand pattern. Furthermore, we also find that low-demand areas are\nless resilient than high-demand ones when demand surges unexpectedly, because\nthe operator prioritizes supporting high-demand areas at the sacrifice of\nservice quality in low-demand areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 13:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

PyTSK can also be easily extended and customized for more\ncomplicated algorithms, such as modifying the structure of TSK fuzzy systems,\ndeveloping more sophisticated training algorithms, and combining TSK fuzzy\nsystems with neural networks.

Hope is a positive attitude oriented toward a possible (yet\nuncertain), desired outcome. Though hope is a virtue, hopelessness is\nwidespread and seems related not only to current events but also to information\nabout current events. This paper examines how hope can be sparked through\ninformation. Method. This study uses the philosophical methods of conceptual\nanalysis and design to advance a theoretical argument. Analysis. First, a\nconceptualization of hope is offered, drawing on work primarily in virtue\nethics. Then, four types of information sources for hope are theorized,\nbuilding on and synthesizing work from philosophy and psychology. Results. Four\ncategories of information source conducive to hopefulness are identified:\ninformation for forming beliefs about the past or future; information for\nengaging the moral imagination regarding possibilities for the future;\ninformation for sparking desire for particular moral outcomes; and information\nfor metacognition, or about how we become informed with respect to hope.\nConclusions. Hope is, in many cases, responsive to information. This suggests a\nmoral opportunity for information professionals and scholars to work toward\nconnecting people with information for hope, particularly in difficult times.\nAvenues for further research, particularly in information behavior and\npractices, are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 16:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 15:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In such scenarios, the adversary is more likely\nto have access to the distribution of a particular subject than actual records.\nFurthermore, in settings like cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), a subject's\ndata can be embodied by multiple data records that are spread across multiple\norganizations. Nearly all of the existing private FL literature is dedicated to\nstudying privacy at two granularities -- item-level (individual data records),\nand user-level (participating user in the federation), neither of which apply\nto data subjects in cross-silo FL. This insight motivates us to shift our\nattention from the privacy of data records to the privacy of data subjects,\nalso known as subject-level privacy.

The theory is constructed as to have\nonly two degrees of freedom in the gravity sector. In order to perform this\nstep we first introduce a precursor theory endowed with a general graviton mass\nterm, to which, at the level of the Hamiltonian, we add two extra constraints\nas to remove the unwanted degrees of freedom, which otherwise would typically\nlead to ghosts and/or instabilities. On analyzing the number of independent\nconstraints and the properties of tensor mode perturbations, we see that the\ngravitational waves are the only propagating gravitational degrees of freedom\nwhich do acquire a non-trivial mass, as expected. In order to understand how\nthe effective gravitational force works for this theory we then investigate\ncosmological scalar perturbations in the presence of a pressureless fluid. We\nthen restrict the whole class of models by imposing the following conditions at\nall times: 1) it is possible to define an effective gravitational constant,\n$G_{{\\rm eff}}$; 2) the value $G_{\\text{eff}}/G_{N}$ is always finite but not\nalways equal to unity (as to allow some non-trivial modifications of gravity,\nbesides the massive tensorial modes); and 3) the square of mass of the graviton\nis always positive. These constraints automatically make also the ISW-effect\ncontributions finite at all times. Finally we focus on a simple subclass of\nsuch theories, and show they already can give a rich and interesting\nphenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 14:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

A common\nchallenge in these data sets is to ensure that each sample meets minimum\nquality requirements devoid of significant artefacts. Despite a wide range of\nexisting automatic methods having been developed to identify imperfections and\nartefacts in medical imaging, they mostly rely on data-hungry methods. In\nparticular, the lack of sufficient scans with artefacts available for training\nhas created a barrier in designing and deploying machine learning in clinical\nresearch. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework having four main\ncomponents: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance\nphysics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of\nabstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature\nselection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve\nclassification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nclassifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are\nthreefold: first, we use the novel physics-based artefact generators to\ngenerate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts as a data\naugmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and\nlabelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool\nof abstract and engineered image features developed to identify 9 different\nartefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature\nselection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features\nthat provide the best classification performance.

The main task of SISR is to recover the\ninformation loss caused by the degradation procedure. According to the Nyquist\nsampling theory, the degradation leads to aliasing effect and makes it hard to\nrestore the correct textures from low-resolution (LR) images. In practice,\nthere are correlations and self-similarities among the adjacent patches in the\nnatural images. This paper considers the self-similarity and proposes a\nhierarchical image super-resolution network (HSRNet) to suppress the influence\nof aliasing.

To explore the texture with local image prior, we design a\nhierarchical exploration block (HEB) and progressive increase the receptive\nfield.

In the materials\nscience and engineering context, where the\nprocess-structure-property-performance linkage is well known to be the only\nroad mapping from manufacturing to engineering performance, numerous integrated\ncomputational materials engineering (ICME) models have been developed across a\nwide spectrum of length-scales and time-scales to relieve the burden of\nresource-intensive experiments. Within the structure-property linkage, crystal\nplasticity finite element method (CPFEM) models have been widely used since\nthey are one of a few ICME toolboxes that allow numerical predictions,\nproviding the bridge from microstructure to properties and performances.\nSeveral constitutive models have been proposed to capture the mechanics and\nplasticity behavior of materials. While some UQ studies have been performed,\nthe robustness and uncertainty of these constitutive models have not been\nrigorously established. In this work, we apply a stochastic collocation (SC)\nmethod to quantify the uncertainty of the three most commonly used constitutive\nmodels in CPFEM, namely phenomenological models (with and without twinning),\nand dislocation-density-based constitutive models, for three different types of\ncrystal structures, namely face-centered cubic (fcc) copper (Cu), body-centered\ncubic (bcc) tungsten (W), and hexagonal close packing (hcp) magnesium (Mg).

Our\napproach consists of modeling the swarm configuration as a dynamic Gibbs Random\nField (GRF) and setting constraints on the neighborhood system inspired by\nchemistry rules that dictate binding polarity between particles. Using the GRF\nmodel, we determine velocities for each robot, resulting in behaviors that lead\nto the creation of patterns or shapes.

Yet, the model owner may want to\nexport the trained model periodically from the remote repository and a question\narises whether this may cause is a risk of data leakage. In this paper, we\nintroduce the concept of data stealing attack during the export of neural\nnetworks. It consists in hiding some information in the exported network that\nallows the reconstruction outside the data lake of images initially stored in\nthat data lake. More precisely, we show that it is possible to train a network\nthat can perform lossy image compression and at the same time solve some\nutility tasks such as image segmentation. The attack then proceeds by exporting\nthe compression decoder network together with some image codes that leads to\nthe image reconstruction outside the data lake.

This enables to build privacy-aware distributed\nmachine learning models, among others. The goal is the optimization of a\nstatistical model's parameters by minimizing a cost function of a collection of\ndatasets which are stored locally by a set of clients. This process exposes the\nclients to two issues: leakage of private information and lack of\npersonalization of the model. On the other hand, with the recent advancements\nin various techniques to analyze data, there is a surge of concern for the\nprivacy violation of the participating clients. To mitigate this, differential\nprivacy and its variants serve as a standard for providing formal privacy\nguarantees. Often the clients represent very heterogeneous communities and hold\ndata which are very diverse. Therefore, aligned with the recent focus of the FL\ncommunity to build a framework of personalized models for the users\nrepresenting their diversity, it is also of utmost importance to protect the\nclients' sensitive and personal information against potential threats. To\naddress this goal we consider $d$-privacy, also known as metric privacy, which\nis a variant of local differential privacy, using a a metric-based obfuscation\ntechnique that preserves the topological distribution of the original data.

MAXI J0637-430 is\nlocated at unusually high Galactic latitude; if it belongs to the Galactic\nthick disk, we suggest a most likely distance <7 kpc. Compared with other black\nhole transients, MAXI J0637-430 is also unusual for other reasons: a fast\ntransition to the thermal dominant state at the start of the outburst; a low\npeak temperature and luminosity (we estimate them at ~ 0.7 keV and <0.1 times\nEddington, respectively); a short decline timescale; a low soft-to-hard\ntransition luminosity (<0.01 times Eddington).

Human mobility serves as a surrogate for human contacts and compliance\nto NPIs. In Nordic countries, NPIs have mostly been advised and sometimes made\nmandatory. It is unclear if making NPIs mandatory further reduced mobility.\n  Aim: We investigated the effect of non-compulsory and follow-up mandatory\nmeasures in major cities and rural regions on human mobility in Norway. We\nidentified NPI categories that most affected mobility.\n  Methods: We used mobile phone mobility data from the largest Norwegian\noperator. We analysed non-compulsory and mandatory measures with before-after\nand synthetic difference-in-differences approaches. By regression, we\ninvestigated the impact of different NPIs on mobility.\n  Results: Nationally and in less populated regions, follow-up mandatory\nmeasures further decreased time, but not distance travelled. In urban areas,\nhowever, follow-up mandates also decreased distance, and the effect exceeded\nthat of initial non-compulsory measures. Stricter metre rules, gyms closing and\nreopening, restrictions on guests in homes, and face mask recommendations most\nimpacted distance travelled. Time travelled was most affected by gyms closing\nand restaurants and shops reopening.\n  Conclusion: Overall, non-compulsory measures appeared to decrease distance\ntravelled from home, while mandates further decreased this metric in urban\nareas. Time travelled is reduced more by mandates than by non-compulsory\nmeasures for all regions and interventions. Stricter distancing and restricted\nnumber of guests were associated with decreases in mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 18:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

The\nmodel is inspired by the cubic curvature invariant formed by the contraction of\nthree Riemann tensors.

Such a\nconstruction is extremely useful since the evolution does not depend on the\npast or future features of the universe, but completely on its present\nfeatures. Moreover, the use of invariants makes the theory more fundamental in\nnature.

It is seen that the holographic dark\nenergy model can exhibit the entire thermal history of the universe,\nsequentially starting from radiation in the early universe, followed by matter,\nand finally the dark energy dominated epoch at late times.

Several recent works tackle this challenge by\nlearning embeddings for entities and relations, then employing them to predict\nnew relations among the entities. Despite their aggrandizement, most of those\nmethods focus only on the local neighbors of a relation to learn the\nembeddings.

Our empirical findings draw insights into how attention\nmechanisms can improve entities' context representation and how combining\nentities and semantic path contexts improves the general representation of\nentities and the relation predictions.

The scenario consists, mostly, of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and\nnanosatellites. Thanks to the thin Martian atmosphere, CubeSats can stably\norbit at very-low-altitude. This allows to meet strict delay requirements to\nsplit functions of the baseband processing between drones and CubeSats. The\ndetailed analytical study, presented in this paper, confirmed the viability of\nthe proposed 3D architecture, under some constraints and trade-off concerning\nthe involved Space communication infrastructures, that are discussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 19:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

For energy demand management (EDM), the SG network\nrequires computing a large amount of data generated by massive\nInternet-of-things sensors and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with\nminimal latency. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nresource allocation scheme in a 6G-enabled SG edge network to offload\nresource-consuming EDM computation to edge servers. Automatic resource\nprovisioning is achieved by harnessing the computational capabilities of smart\nmeters in the dynamic edge network. To enforce DRL-assisted policies in dense\n6G networks, the state information from multiple edge servers is required.\nHowever, adversaries can \"poison\" such information through false state\ninjection (FSI) attacks, exhausting SG edge computing resources. Toward\naddressing this issue, we investigate the impact of such FSI attacks with\nrespect to abusive utilization of edge resources, and develop a lightweight FSI\ndetection mechanism based on supervised classifiers. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the efficacy of DRL in dynamic resource allocation, the impact of\nthe FSI attacks, and the effectiveness of the detection technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 20:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2022 10:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-08"}

Despite\nrecent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on\ncapturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, we observe that\nthe performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network\ninitialization. To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this\nphenomenon and find two major limitations of existing works. First, there is a\nnoticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and profitable investment\nstrategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual\npredictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent\nwith the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations,\nwe first reformulate quantitative investment as a multi-task learning problem.\nLater on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE)\nframework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading\nstrategy design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple\nindependent trading experts are jointly optimized with an individual\nuncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train neural routers\n(corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these\nexperts on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is\napplicable to various backbone network architectures with consistent\nperformance gains. Through extensive experiments on long-term real-world data\nspanning over five years on two of the most influential financial markets (US\nand China), we demonstrate that AlphaMix significantly outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 08:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-18"}

For a long time, its low-temperature symmetry-broken phase in ${\\rm\nUNi_4B}$ has been considered to be a magnetic toroidal order forming\natomic-scale vortices lattice with disordered sites at each center of the\nvortices. However, recent observation of current-induced magnetizations offers\na reinvestigation about the validity of this order parameter because of the\ncontradiction in their anisotropy. Our model takes into account the quadrupole\ndegrees of freedom, whose importance is recently evidenced by the\nsound-velocity softening. We find that the quadrupole moments play an important\nrole in determining the magnetic structure in the ordered states. For a wide\nrange of parameter space, we obtain two triple-$\\mathcal{Q}$ magnetic orders in\nour 36-site mean-field analysis: toroidal order and another one with the same\nnumber of disordered sites as in the toroidal order. We name the latter\n``triforce'' order after its magnetic structure. Importantly, the triforce\norder possesses exactly the same spin structure factor as the toroidal order\ndoes, while the phase factors in the superposition of the triple-$\\mathcal{Q}$\nstructure are different. We show that the triforce order is consistent with the\nobserved current-induced magnetization when the realistic crystal structure of\n${\\rm UNi_4B}$ is taken into account.
