Recently, multi-solitonic configurations\ninterpreted as static chains of multiple Boson Stars bound by gravity and\ncarrying no angular momentum were reported. We propose to generalize those\nsolutions to the stationary case by constructing chains of rotating Boson Stars\nand analyze their properties. The non-linear elliptic field equations are\nsolved using the finite element method. We find that chains with an even number\nof constituents exhibit the same spiral-like frequency dependence of their\nmass, angular momentum and Noether charge as single Boson Stars. In contrast,\nsequences of chains with an odd number of constituents show nontrivial loops\nstarting and ending at the flat vacuum. As a consequence, such solutions cannot\nbe uniquely parametrized by a single parameter. We conjecture that all rotating\nchains correspond to excitations of single Boson Stars or pairs of them.

In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional\nnovel sparse array configurations to estimate both azimuth and elevation angle\nof arrival of the signal. We propose a new class of rectangular two-dimensional\narrays with sensors on a plane, whose difference co-array can give rise to a\nvirtual two-dimensional planar array with a much larger number of elements,\nleading to an increase in the fully augmentable range of the array. The\ndifference co-array of the proposed rectangular array gives a contiguous dense\nstructure which leads to a reduction in holes within the planar array as\ncompared to the traditional methods of CPA geometry in which there are many\nholes present in the outer dimension of the array structure as well as within\nthe array as well. Moreover, we know that the angular resolution of an array is\nhighly dependent on its beamwidth which itself is inversely proportional to\narray size or effective array aperture. Hence by increasing the array dimension\na higher resolution can be achieved. The proposed arrays provide a higher DOF\nfor the given number of physical sensors.

The intention of hate speech\nnormalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a\nstepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to\nmonitor any improvement in the user's behavior.\n  To this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their\nnormalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We\nintroduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that\noperates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the\noriginal sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally,\nit reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans.

This could inadvertently lead to an over-determined parameter\nestimation with no clear relation between the identified parameters and their\ninfluence on the experimental data. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of\nviscoelastic characterization in polymeric samples to the experimental\nobservables of multi-frequency intermodulation AFM.

It is found that similar to the nonlinear Hall effect,\nthe electron transport depends on the Berry curvature dipole. Our analysis\nreveals that the electro-optic effect modifies the optical conductivity of the\nmaterial, breaking the electromagnetic reciprocity and yielding a dynamical\nresponse that imitates that of a transistor but in a distributed volume.\nFurthermore, the effective conductivity tensor can be non-Hermitian, opening\nthe possibility of optical gain. To maximize the non-Hermitian response, we\nexplore the specific case of strained twisted bilayer graphene. Our analysis\nreveals that the optical gain for incident light transmitted through the biased\nsystem depends on the light polarization, and can be quite large, especially\nfor multilayer configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 17:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

However, when\na property is violated by a trace, engineers usually inspect the trace to\nunderstand the cause of the violation; such manual diagnostic is time-consuming\nand error-prone. Existing approaches that complement trace-checking tools with\ndiagnostic capabilities either produce low-level explanations that are hardly\ncomprehensible by engineers or do not support complex signal-based temporal\nproperties. In this paper, we propose TD-SB-TemPsy, a trace-diagnostic approach\nfor properties expressed using SB-TemPsy-DSL. Given a property and a trace that\nviolates the property, TD-SB-TemPsy determines the root cause of the property\nviolation. TD-SB-TemPsy relies on the concepts of violation cause, which\ncharacterizes one of the behaviors of the system that may lead to a property\nviolation, and diagnoses, which are associated with violation causes and\nprovide additional information to help engineers understand the violation\ncause. As part of TD-SB-TemPsy, we propose a language-agnostic methodology to\ndefine violation causes and diagnoses. In our context, its application resulted\nin a catalog of 34 violation causes, each associated with one diagnosis,\ntailored to properties expressed in SB-TemPsy-DSL.

The key idea is to produce high-quality images by\nrecurrently adding Gaussian noises and gradients to a Gaussian sample until\nconverging to the target distribution, a.k.a. the diffusion sampling. To ensure\nstability of convergence in sampling and generation quality, however, this\nsequential sampling process has to take a small step size and many sampling\niterations (e.g., 2000). Several acceleration methods have been proposed with\nfocus on low-resolution generation. In this work, we consider the acceleration\nof high-resolution generation with SGMs, a more challenging yet more important\nproblem. We prove theoretically that this slow convergence drawback is\nprimarily due to the ignorance of the target distribution.

We\nhighlight two challenges posed by ML: (1) the same set of workers can serve\nmultiple roles and provide many sorts of information; and (2) compared to the\nlife sciences and social sciences, ML research tends to embrace a dynamic\nworkflow, where research questions are seldom stated ex ante and data sharing\nopens the door for future studies to ask questions about different targets from\nthe original study. In particular, our analysis exposes a potential loophole in\nthe Common Rule, where researchers can elude research ethics oversight by\nsplitting data collection and analysis into distinct studies. We offer several\npolicy recommendations to address these concerns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 17:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

When the functional form of such a model can not be deduced from first\nprinciples, one has to make a choice between different possible models. A\ncommon approach in such cases is to minimise the information loss in the model\nby trying to reduce the number of fit variables (or the model flexibility,\nrespectively) as much as possible while still yielding an acceptable fit to the\ndata. Model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) provides such\nan implementation of Occam's razor. We argue that the same principles can be\napplied to optimise the penalty-strength of a penalised maximum-likelihood\nmodel. However, while in typical applications AIC is used to choose from a\nfinite, discrete set of maximum-likelihood models the penalty optimisation\nrequires to select out of a continuum of candidate models and these models\nviolate the maximum-likelihood condition. We derive a generalised information\ncriterion AICp that encompasses this case. It naturally involves the concept of\neffective free parameters which is very flexible and can be applied to any\nmodel, be it linear or non-linear, parametric or non-parametric, and with or\nwithout constraint equations on the parameters. We show that the generalised\nAICp allows an optimisation of any penalty-strength without the need of\nseparate Monte-Carlo simulations.

This field theory is relevant to spin-1/2 fermions on honeycomb\nor $\\pi$-flux lattices, for example, near the transition points between an\n$s$-wave superconductor and a charge-density wave, on one side, and N\\'eel\norder, on the other. Two triplets of such order parameters always allow for a\ncommon pair of two other order parameters that would complete them to the\nmaximal set of compatible (anticommuting) orders of five.

To take first steps\ntowards uncovering the influence quantum matter has on spin foam models, we\ncouple free, massive scalar lattice field theory to a restricted,\nsemi-classical 4d spin foam model, called quantum cuboids. This model can be\nunderstood as a superposition of hypercuboidal (and thus irregular) lattices.\nBoth theories are coupled by defining scalar lattice field theory on irregular\nlattices via discrete exterior calculus and then superimposing these theories\nby summing over spin foam configurations. We compute expectation values of\ngeometric and matter observables using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.\nFrom the observables, we identify a regime in parameter space, in which the\nspin foam possesses a finite total volume and looks on average like a regular\nlattice with an emergent lattice spacing dependent on the mass of the scalar\nfield. We also measure the 2-point correlation function and correlation length\nof the scalar field in relation to the geodesic distance encoded in the spin\nfoam. Our results are consistent with the correlation function of ordinary\nscalar lattice field theory defined on a fixed regular lattice with the\nemergent lattice spacing and the same mass.

In particular, the band geometry leads to a\nnonlinear $T$-dependence in the high-$T$ equipartition regime, complicating the\nusual $T^4$ to $T$ Bloch-Gr\\\"{u}neisen crossover. Our focus on BBG and RTG is\nmotivated by recent experiments in these systems that have discovered several\nexotic low-$T$ superconductivity proximate to complicated hierarchies of\nisospin-polarized phases. These interaction-driven phases are intimately\nrelated to the geometric features of the band structures, highlighting the\nimportance of understanding the influence of band geometry on transport. While\nresolving the effects of the anisotropic band geometry on the scattering times\nrequires nontrivial numerical solution, our approach is rooted in intuitive\nBoltzmann theory. We compare our results with recent experiment and discuss how\nour predictions can be used to elucidate the relative importance of various\nscattering mechanisms in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 18:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

One realization of this scenario predicts that\nthe companion may survive the explosion and reside within the remnant as a fast\nmoving ($V_{peculiar} >1000$ km s$^{-1}$), overluminous ($L > 0.1 L_\\odot$)\nwhite dwarf. Recently, three objects which appear to have these unusual\nproperties have been discovered in the Gaia survey. We obtained photometric\nobservations of the SN Ia remnant SN 1006 with the Dark Energy Camera over four\nyears to attempt to discover a similar star. We present a deep, high precision\nastrometric proper motion survey of the interior stellar population of the\nremnant. We rule out the existence of a high proper motion object consistent\nwith our tested realization of the D6 scenario ($V_{transverse} > 600$ km\ns$^{-1}$ with $m_r < 21$ corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of $L >\n0.0176 L_\\odot$).

Although the initial\nexpressions resulting from the integration usually simplify, it is often\ndifficult to know which identities to apply and in what order. To address this\nbottleneck, we explore to what extent machine learning methods can help. We\nconsider both a reinforcement learning approach, where the identities are\nanalogous to moves in a game, and a transformer network approach, where the\nproblem is viewed analogously to a language-translation task. While both\nmethods are effective, the transformer network appears more powerful and holds\npromise for practical use in symbolic manipulation tasks in mathematical\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 18:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

By simulating our model on synthetic\nsquare lattices and small-world networks, we show that the presence of social\nnetwork structure enables fake news spreaders to be self-organized into echo\nchambers, thereby providing a boost to the efficacy of fake news and thus its\nresistance to fact-checking efforts.

The survey, fielded in late 2019, elicited\nforecasts for near-term AI development milestones and high- or human-level\nmachine intelligence, defined as when machines are able to accomplish every or\nalmost every task humans are able to do currently. As part of this study, we\nre-contacted respondents from a highly-cited study by Grace et al. (2018), in\nwhich AI/ML researchers gave forecasts about high-level machine intelligence\nand near-term milestones in AI development. Results from our 2019 survey show\nthat, in aggregate, AI/ML researchers surveyed placed a 50% likelihood of\nhuman-level machine intelligence being achieved by 2060. The results show\nresearchers newly contacted in 2019 expressed similar beliefs about the\nprogress of advanced AI as respondents in the Grace et al. (2018) survey. For\nthe recontacted participants from the Grace et al. (2018) study, the aggregate\nforecast for a 50% likelihood of high-level machine intelligence shifted from\n2062 to 2076, although this change is not statistically significant, likely due\nto the small size of our panel sample. Forecasts of several near-term AI\nmilestones have reduced in time, suggesting more optimism about AI progress.\nFinally, AI/ML researchers also exhibited significant optimism about how\nhuman-level machine intelligence will impact society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 19:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

First, the lower-density `halo' of\nmaterial outside of the traditional photosphere in 3D models leads to a shock\nbreakout at lower densities than 1D models. This would prolong the duration of\nthe shock breakout flash at any given location on the surface to $\\approx$1-2\nhours.

As real-world events have different\ngranularities, from the top-level themes to key events and then to event\nmentions corresponding to concrete actions, there are generally two lines of\nresearch: (1) theme detection identifies from a news corpus major themes (e.g.,\n\"2019 Hong Kong Protests\" vs. \"2020 U.S. Presidential Election\") that have very\ndistinct semantics; and (2) action extraction extracts from one document\nmention-level actions (e.g., \"the police hit the left arm of the protester\")\nthat are too fine-grained for comprehending the event. In this paper, we\npropose a new task, key event detection at the intermediate level, aiming to\ndetect from a news corpus key events (e.g., \"HK Airport Protest on Aug.\n12-14\"), each happening at a particular time/location and focusing on the same\ntopic.

The low atomic number\nof silicon leads to a significant number of incident photons being Compton\nscattered in the detector, depositing a part of their energy and potentially\nbeing counted multiple times. Although the physics of Compton scatter is well\nestablished, the effects of Compton interactions in the detector on image\nquality for an edge-on-irradiated silicon detector have still not been\nthoroughly investigated.\n  Purpose: To investigate and explain effects of Compton scatter on\nzero-frequency DQE for photon-counting CT using edge-on-irradiated silicon\ndetectors.\n  Methods: We extend an existing Monte Carlo model of an edge-on-irradiated\nsilicon detector to develop projection and image domain performance metrics for\npure density and pure spectral imaging tasks. We show that the lowest energy\nthreshold of the detector can be used as an effective discriminator of primary\ncounts and cross-talk caused by Compton scatter.

We introduce a search algorithm, generalizing\n$A^*$, that solves such planning problems, and additional algorithmic\nextensions. In addition to theoretical guarantees, extensive experiments show\nconsiderable savings in runtime compared to alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 21:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 08:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

Their contribution at early times in the evolution of the Universe,\nhowever, is unclear due to poorly constrained nuclear reaction rates. The\ncompeting $^{17}$O($\\alpha,\\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\\alpha,n$)$^{20}$Ne\nreactions strongly impact weak s-process yields from rotating massive stars at\nlow metallicities. Abundant $^{16}$O absorbs neutrons, removing flux from the\ns-process, and producing $^{17}$O. The $^{17}$O($\\alpha,n$)$^{20}$Ne reaction\nreleases neutrons, allowing continued s-process nucleosynthesis, if the\n$^{17}$O($\\alpha,\\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction is sufficiently weak. While\npublished rates are available, they are based on limited indirect experimental\ndata for the relevant temperatures and, more importantly, no uncertainties are\nprovided. The available nuclear physics has been evaluated, and combined with\ndata from a new study of astrophysically relevant $^{21}$Ne states using the\n$^{20}$Ne($d,p$)$^{21}$Ne reaction. Constraints are placed on the ratio of the\n($\\alpha,n$)/($\\alpha,\\gamma$) reaction rates with uncertainties on the rates\nprovided for the first time. The new rates favour the ($\\alpha,n$) reaction and\nsuggest that the weak s-process in rotating low-metallicity stars is likely to\ncontinue up to barium and, within the computed uncertainties, even to lead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 21:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

This motivates us to quantify the breaking\nof the shift invariance that characterizes the couplings of an axion-like\nparticle (ALP), and to identify proper order parameters associated to this\nbreaking. Focusing on the flavorful effective Yukawa couplings to Standard\nModel fermions, we work out explicit conditions for them to maintain an exact\naxion shift symmetry. Those conditions are given in terms of Jarlskog-like\nflavor-invariants and can be directly evaluated from the values of the\ndifferent Yukawa couplings. Therefore, they represent order parameters for the\nbreaking of the axion shift symmetry. We illustrate this construction by\nmatching the axion EFT to UV models, and by showing that the renormalization\ngroup running closes on those shift-breaking flavor-invariants, as it should on\nany complete set of order parameters.

The algorithmic topology of partitions is\nhighly unique, and was recently exploited to accelerate multiplication (11x\nwith 32 partitions) and sorting (14x with 16 partitions). Yet, the physical\nimplementation of memristive partitions, such as the peripheral decoders and\nthe control message, has never been considered and may lead to vast\nimpracticality. This paper overcomes that challenge with several novel\ntechniques, presenting efficient practical designs of memristive partitions. We\nbegin by formalizing the algorithmic properties of memristive partitions into\nserial, parallel, and semi-parallel operations. Peripheral overhead is\naddressed via a novel technique of half-gates that enables efficient decoding\nwith negligible overhead. Control overhead is addressed by carefully reducing\nthe operation set of memristive partitions, while resulting in negligible\nperformance impact, by utilizing techniques such as shared indices and pattern\ngenerators. Ultimately, these efficient practical solutions, combined with the\nvast algorithmic potential, may revolutionize digital memristive\nprocessing-in-memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 00:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

To address this issue, we propose an\nintelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cell-free MEC system consisting\nof multiple BSs and IRSs for improving the transmission environment.\nConsequently, we formulate a min-max latency optimization problem by jointly\ndesigning multi-user detection (MUD) matrices, IRSs' reflecting beamforming\nvectors, WDs' transmit power and edge computing resource, subject to\nconstraints on edge computing capability and IRSs phase shifts. To solve it, an\nalternating optimization algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD)\ntechnique is proposed, in which the original non-convex problem is decoupled\ninto two subproblems for alternately optimizing computing and communication\nparameters.

Numerical\nresults show that employing IRSs in cell-free MEC systems outperforms\nconventional MEC systems, resulting in up to about 60% latency reduction can be\nattained.

In this sense, the modified\ngravity parameter acts as not only an enhanced gravitational effect but also a\ngravitational repulsive force contribution to a test particle moving around the\nblack hole.

In this study, we introduce the\nEdgeworth Accountant, an analytical approach to composing differential privacy\nguarantees of private algorithms. The Edgeworth Accountant starts by losslessly\ntracking the privacy loss under composition using the $f$-differential privacy\nframework, which allows us to express the privacy guarantees using privacy-loss\nlog-likelihood ratios (PLLRs). As the name suggests, this accountant next uses\nthe Edgeworth expansion to the upper and lower bounds the probability\ndistribution of the sum of the PLLRs.

The 4-body MB-pol (TTM4-F) interaction fails at a\nvery short range and for the water hexamer errors up to 0.84 kcal/mol are seen\nfor some isomers, owing mainly to 4-body errors. We apply $\\Delta$-ML for the\n4-body interaction, using a recent dataset of CCSD(T) 4-body energies that we\nused to develop a new water potential, q-AQUA. This 4-body correction is shown\nto improve the accuracy of the MB-pol potential for the relative energies of 8\nisomers of the water hexamer as well as the harmonic frequencies.

Here, we present\na series of experiments to characterize the thermal desorption of HCN in\nastrophysically relevant conditions, with a focus on predicting the HCN\nsublimation fronts in protoplanetary disks. We derive HCN-HCN and HCN-H2O\nbinding energies of 3207\\pm197 K and 4192\\pm68 K, which translate to disk\nmidplane sublimation temperatures around 85 K and 103 K.

Additionally, in H2O-dominated mixtures (20:1 H2O:HCN), we find\nthat the majority of HCN remains trapped in the ice until H2O crystallizes.\nThus, HCN may be retained in disk ices at almost all radii where H2O-rich\nplanetesimals form. This implies that icy body impacts to planetary surfaces\nshould commonly deliver this potential prebiotic ingredient. A remaining\nunknown is the extent to which HCN is pure or mixed with H2O in astrophysical\nices, which impacts the HCN desorption behavior as well as the outcomes of\nice-phase chemistry. Pure HCN and HCN:H2O mixtures exhibit distinct IR bands,\nraising the possibility that the James Webb Space Telescope will elucidate the\nmixing environment of HCN in star- and planet-forming regions and address these\nopen questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 04:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Note\nthat most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods were developed for\nsynthetically distorted images, which may not work for SRIs since their\ndistortions are more diverse and complicated. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a no-reference deep-learning image quality assessment method based on\nfrequency maps because the artifacts caused by SISR algorithms are quite\nsensitive to frequency information. Specifically, we first obtain the\nhigh-frequency map (HM) and low-frequency map (LM) of SRI by using Sobel\noperator and piecewise smooth image approximation. Then, a two-stream network\nis employed to extract the quality-aware features of both frequency maps.\nFinally, the features are regressed into a single quality value using fully\nconnected layers.

Recently, it was shown\nthat the same conic program altered to be over the separable cone admits an\noperational interpretation in terms of communicating classical information over\na quantum channel. In this work, we generalize this framework of replacing the\ncone to determine which results in quantum information theory rely upon the\npositive semidefinite cone and which can be generalized. We show the fully\nquantum Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property break down if the\ncone exponentially increases in resourcefulness but never approximates the\npositive semidefinite cone. However, we show for CQ states, the separable cone\nis sufficient to recover the asymptotic theory, thereby drawing a strong\ndistinction between the fully and partial quantum settings.

This in turn influences the formation of\nplanets by changing the elemental compositions of solids and affecting the\ncollisional properties and outcomes of dust grains. Snowlines can also reveal\naccretion bursts, providing insight into the formation process of stars.\n  Methods: A numerical chemical network coupled with a grid of\ncylindrical-symmetric physical models was used to identify what physical\nparameters alter the CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. The investigated\nparameters are the initial molecular abundances, binding energies of CO and\nH$_2$O, heating source, cloud core density, outflow cavity opening angle, and\ndisk geometry. Simulated molecular line emission maps were used to quantify the\nchange in the snowline location with each parameter.\n  Conclusions: The models presented in this work show that the CO and H$_2$O\nsnowline locations do not occur at a single, well-defined temperature as is\ncommonly assumed. Instead, the snowline position depends on luminosity, cloud\ncore density, and whether a disk is present or not.

We note that N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ emission serve as good\nobservational tracers of CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. However, constraints\non whether or not a disk is present, the observation of additional molecular\ntracers, and estimating envelope density will help in accurately determining\nthe cause of the observed snowline position.

Multi-photon microscopy relies on multi-photon\nabsorption, enabling the use of different imaging modalities that strongly\ndepends on the properties of the sample structure, the selected fluorophore and\nthe excitation laser. However, versatile and tunable laser excitation for\nmulti-photon absorption is still a challenge, limited by e.g. the narrow\nbandwidth of typical laser gain medium or by the tunability of wavelength\nconversion offered by optical parametric oscillators or amplifiers. As an\nalternative, supercontinuum generation can provide broadband excitationspanning\nfrom the ultra-violet to far infrared domains and integrating numerous\nfluorophore absorption peaks, in turn enabling different imaging modalities or\npotential multiplexed spectroscopy. Here, we report on the use of machine\nlearning to optimize the spectro-temporal properties of supercontinuum\ngeneration in order to selectively enhance multi-photon excitation signals\ncompatible with a variety of fluorophores (or modalities) for multi-photon\nmicroscopy. Specifically, we numerically explore how the use of reconfigurable\n(femtosecond) pulse patterns can be readily exploited to control the nonlinear\npropagation dynamics and associated spectral broadening occurring in a\nhighly-nonlinear fiber. In this framework, we show that the use of multiple\npulses to seed optical fiber propagation can trigger a variety of nonlinear\ninteractions and complex propagation scenario. This approach, exploiting the\ntemporal dimension as an extended degree of freedom, is used to maximize\ntypical multi-photon excitations at selected wavelengths, here obtained in a\nversatile and reconfigurable manner suitable for imaging applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 07:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Thus, we\npropose Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation (CFA) which accomplishes\nsophisticated anomaly localization using features adapted to the target\ndataset. CFA consists of (1) a learnable patch descriptor that learns and\nembeds target-oriented features and (2) scalable memory bank independent of the\nsize of the target dataset. And, CFA adopts transfer learning to increase the\nnormal feature density so that abnormal features can be clearly distinguished\nby applying patch descriptor and memory bank to a pre-trained CNN.

In this paper, we propose a Spatiotemporal Information-Preserving\nand Perception-Augmented Model (STIP) to solve the above two problems. To solve\nthe information loss problem, the proposed model aims to preserve the\nspatiotemporal information for videos during the feature extraction and the\nstate transitions, respectively. Firstly, a Multi-Grained Spatiotemporal\nAuto-Encoder (MGST-AE) is designed based on the X-Net structure. The proposed\nMGST-AE can help the decoders recall multi-grained information from the\nencoders in both the temporal and spatial domains. In this way, more\nspatiotemporal information can be preserved during the feature extraction for\nhigh-resolution videos. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Gated Recurrent Unit (STGRU)\nis designed based on the standard Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) structure, which\ncan efficiently preserve spatiotemporal information during the state\ntransitions. The proposed STGRU can achieve more satisfactory performance with\na much lower computation load compared with the popular Long Short-Term (LSTM)\nbased predictive memories. Furthermore, to improve the traditional MSE loss\nfunctions, a Learned Perceptual Loss (LP-loss) is further designed based on the\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can help obtain a satisfactory\ntrade-off between the objective quality and the perceptual quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed STIP can predict videos with more\nsatisfactory visual quality compared with a variety of state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Focusing on the\noffline RL setting, we aim to build a simple and discrete world model that\nabstracts the original environment. RL methods are applied to our world model\ninstead of the environment data for simplified policy learning. Our world\nmodel, dubbed Value Memory Graph (VMG), is designed as a directed-graph-based\nMarkov decision process (MDP) of which vertices and directed edges represent\ngraph states and graph actions, separately. As state-action spaces of VMG are\nfinite and relatively small compared to the original environment, we can\ndirectly apply the value iteration algorithm on VMG to estimate graph state\nvalues and figure out the best graph actions.

However, it\nfaces challenges including statistical heterogeneity of clients' datasets and\nresource constraints of client devices, which severely impact the training\nperformance and user experience. Prior works have tackled these challenges by\ncombining personalization with model compression schemes including quantization\nand pruning. However, the pruning is data-dependent and thus must be done on\nthe client side which requires considerable computation cost. Moreover, the\npruning normally trains a binary supermask $\\in \\{0, 1\\}$ which significantly\nlimits the model capacity yet with no computation benefit. Consequently, the\ntraining requires high computation cost and a long time to converge while the\nmodel performance does not pay off. In this work, we propose HideNseek which\nemploys one-shot data-agnostic pruning at initialization to get a subnetwork\nbased on weights' synaptic saliency. Each client then optimizes a sign\nsupermask $\\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ multiplied by the unpruned weights to allow faster\nconvergence with the same compression rates as state-of-the-art.

Recently, a growing\nnumber of studies on deep meta-learning based recommenddation systems have\nemerged for improving the performance under recommendation scenarios where\navailable data is limited, e.g. user cold-start and item cold-start. Therefore,\nthis survey provides a timely and comprehensive overview of current deep\nmeta-learning based recommendation methods. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy\nto discuss existing methods according to recommendation scenarios,\nmeta-learning techniques, and meta-knowledge representations, which could\nprovide the design space for meta-learning based recommendation methods. For\neach recommendation scenario, we further discuss technical details about how\nexisting methods apply meta-learning to improve the generalization ability of\nrecommendation models. Finally, we also point out several limitations in\ncurrent research and highlight some promising directions for future research in\nthis area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 11:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Whereas NHST\ncomes with long-run error rate guarantees, its main inferential tool -- the\n$p$-value -- is only an indirect measure of evidence against the null\nhypothesis. The main reason is that the $p$-value is based on the assumption\nthe null hypothesis is true, whereas the likelihood of the data under any\nalternative hypothesis is ignored. If the goal is to quantify how much evidence\nthe data provide for or against the null hypothesis it is unavoidable that an\nalternative hypothesis be specified (Goodman & Royall, 1988). Paradoxes arise\nwhen researchers interpret $p$-values as evidence. For instance, results that\nare surprising under the null may be equally surprising under a plausible\nalternative hypothesis, such that a $p=.045$ result (`reject the null') does\nnot make the null any less plausible than it was before. Hence, $p$-values have\nbeen argued to overestimate the evidence against the null hypothesis.\nConversely, it can be the case that statistically non-significant results\n(i.e., $p>.05)$ nevertheless provide some evidence in favor of the alternative\nhypothesis. It is therefore crucial for researchers to know when statistical\nsignificance and evidence collide, and this requires that a direct measure of\nevidence is computed and presented alongside the traditional $p$-value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 11:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

To address the issue, we propose\nan effective image generation framework of Draft-and-Revise with Contextual\nRQ-transformer to consider global contexts during the generation process. As a\ngeneralized VQ-VAE, RQ-VAE first represents a high-resolution image as a\nsequence of discrete code stacks. After code stacks in the sequence are\nrandomly masked, Contextual RQ-Transformer is trained to infill the masked code\nstacks based on the unmasked contexts of the image. Then, Contextual\nRQ-Transformer uses our two-phase decoding, Draft-and-Revise, and generates an\nimage, while exploiting the global contexts of the image during the generation\nprocess. Specifically. in the draft phase, our model first focuses on\ngenerating diverse images despite rather low quality. Then, in the revise\nphase, the model iteratively improves the quality of images, while preserving\nthe global contexts of generated images. In experiments, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on conditional image generation. We also validate that\nthe Draft-and-Revise decoding can achieve high performance by effectively\ncontrolling the quality-diversity trade-off in image generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 12:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

The working mechanism behind it, however, remains\nmysterious. GNN models are designed to learn effective representations for\ngraph-structured data, which intrinsically coincides with the principle of\ngraph signal denoising (GSD). Algorithm unrolling, a \"learning to optimize\"\ntechnique, has gained increasing attention due to its prospects in building\nefficient and interpretable neural network architectures. In this paper, we\nintroduce a class of unrolled networks built based on truncated optimization\nalgorithms (e.g., gradient descent and proximal gradient descent) for GSD\nproblems. They are shown to be tightly connected to many popular GNN models in\nthat the forward propagations in these GNNs are in fact unrolled networks\nserving specific GSDs. Besides, the training process of a GNN model can be seen\nas solving a bilevel optimization problem with a GSD problem at the lower\nlevel. Such a connection brings a fresh view of GNNs, as we could try to\nunderstand their practical capabilities from their GSD counterparts, and it can\nalso motivate designing new GNN models. Based on the algorithm unrolling\nperspective, an expressive model named UGDGNN, i.e., unrolled gradient descent\nGNN, is further proposed which inherits appealing theoretical properties.\nExtensive numerical simulations on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nUGDGNN can achieve superior or competitive performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 12:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

RHIRL addresses two key challenges of IRL: scalability and\nrobustness. To handle high-dimensional continuous systems, RHIRL matches the\ninduced optimal trajectories with expert demonstrations locally in a receding\nhorizon manner and 'stitches' together the local solutions to learn the cost;\nit thereby avoids the 'curse of dimensionality'. This contrasts sharply with\nearlier algorithms that match with expert demonstrations globally over the\nentire high-dimensional state space. To be robust against imperfect expert\ndemonstrations and control noise, RHIRL learns a state-dependent cost function\n'disentangled' from system dynamics under mild conditions.

In fact, these weaknesses are quite common and are well\nillustrated by the flaws in the hand-written proofs of existing blockchain\nconsensus protocols [63]. Paradoxically, until now, no blockchain consensus has\nbeen holistically verified using model checking.\n  In this paper, we remedy this paradox by model checking for the first time a\nblockchain consensus used in industry.

We then\nautomatically check the inner broadcasting algorithm, under a carefully\nidentified fairness assumption.

We do find a correlation\nbetween mergers/close pericentric passages of massive satellites and bursts of\nthe star formation in the in-situ component. Massive mergers sharply increase\nthe disc velocity dispersion of the in-situ stars, however, the latest\nsignificant merger often heats up the disk up to the numbers when the\ncontribution of the previous ones is less prominent in the age-velocity\ndispersion relation. In the HESTIA galaxies, the in-situ halo is an important\ncomponent of the inner stellar halo where its fraction is about 30-40%, while\nin the outer parts it typically does not exceed ~5% beyond 15 kpc. The\nsimulations suggest that this component of the stellar haloes continues to grow\nwell after mergers conclude; however, the most significant contribution comes\nfrom stars formed recently before the merger. The orbital analysis of the\nHESTIA galaxies suggests that wedges in Rmax-Zmax space are mainly populated by\nthe stars born in between significant mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

However, the null energy condition can be\nviolated, even classically, when the non-minimal coupling of matter fields to\ngravity is considered. Considering small dynamical perturbations around\nstationary black holes in diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity with\nnon-minimal coupling to scalar or gauge fields, we prove that an entropy\ncurrent with non-negative divergence can still be constructed. The additional\nnon-minimal couplings that we have incorporated contribute to the entropy\ncurrent, which may even survive in the equilibrium limit. We also obtain a\nspatial current on the horizon apart from the entropy density in\nout-of-equilibrium situations. We achieve this by using a boost symmetry of the\nnear horizon geometry, which constraints the off-shell structure of a specific\ncomponent of the equations of motion with newer terms due to the non-minimal\ncouplings. The final expression for the entropy current is $U(1)$\ngauge-invariant for gauge fields coupled to gravity. We explicitly check that\nthe entropy current obtained from our abstract arguments is consistent with the\nexpressions already available in the literature for specific model theories\ninvolving non-minimal coupling of matter with higher derivative theories of\ngravity. Finally, we also argue that the physical process version of the first\nlaw holds for these theories with arbitrary non-minimal matter couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2022 13:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-08"}

The corona and\nits interaction with the disc play an essential role in the evolution of the\nsystem and are potentially responsible for many observed features. However many\nintrinsic properties of the corona are still poorly understood, especially for\nthe geometrical configurations. The traditional spectral fitting method is not\npowerful enough to distinguish various configurations. In this paper we intent\nto investigate the possible configurations by modeling the polarization\nproperties of X-ray radiations. The geometries of the corona include the slab,\nsphere and cylinder. The simulations are implemented through the publicly\navailable code, LEMON, which can deal with the polarized radiative transfer and\ndifferent electron distributions readily. The results demonstrate clearly that\nthe observed polarizations are dependent on the geometry of the corona heavily.\nThe slab-like corona produces the highest polarization degrees, the following\nare the cylinder and sphere. One of the interesting things is that the\npolarization degrees first increase gradually and then decrease with the\nincrease of photon energy. For slab geometry there exists a zero point where\nthe polarization vanishes and the polarization angle rotates for $90^\\circ$.\nThese results may potentially be verified by the upcoming missions for\npolarized X-ray observations, such as $IXPE$ and $eXTP$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

By contrast, when demonstrating a task,\nhuman teachers deviate from optimal demonstrations and pedagogically modify\ntheir behavior by giving demonstrations that best disambiguate the goal they\nwant to demonstrate. Analogously, human learners excel at pragmatically\ninferring the intent of the teacher, facilitating communication between the two\nagents. These mechanisms are critical in the few demonstrations regime, where\ninferring the goal is more difficult. In this paper, we implement pedagogy and\npragmatism mechanisms by leveraging a Bayesian model of Goal Inference from\ndemonstrations (BGI). We highlight the benefits of this model in multi-goal\nteacher-learner setups with two artificial agents that learn with\ngoal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning.

Existing methods try to extract environment-specified information $Z$\nfrom past transition segments to make the dynamics prediction model\ngeneralizable to different dynamics. However, because environments are not\nlabelled, the extracted information inevitably contains redundant information\nunrelated to the dynamics in transition segments and thus fails to maintain a\ncrucial property of $Z$: $Z$ should be similar in the same environment and\ndissimilar in different ones. As a result, the learned dynamics prediction\nfunction will deviate from the true one, which undermines the generalization\nability. To tackle this problem, we introduce an interventional prediction\nmodule to estimate the probability of two estimated $\\hat{z}_i, \\hat{z}_j$\nbelonging to the same environment.

Moreover, according to the number of\nremaining layers, proper computing configurations (i.e., frequency and voltage)\nare selected to execute the network to further save energy. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that Predictive Exit achieves up to 96.2%\ncomputation reduction and 72.9% energy-saving compared with classic deep\nlearning networks; and 12.8% computation reduction and 37.6% energy-saving\ncompared with the early exit under state-of-the-art exiting strategies, given\nthe same inference accuracy and latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 04:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 11:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-29"}

Those with LC deformations superior to 4% were considered\nfragile, while those with deformations inferior to 4% robust. Learning from\nthese data, we compared three AI algorithms to predict ONH robustness strictly\nfrom a baseline (undeformed) OCT volume: (1) a random forest classifier; (2) an\nautoencoder; and (3) a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN). The latter algorithm also\nallowed us to identify what critical 3D structural features make a given ONH\nrobust.\n  $\\mathbf{Results}$: All 3 methods were able to predict ONH robustness from 3D\nstructural information alone and without the need to perform biomechanical\ntesting.

Detection\nof anomalies based on smart meter data is crucial to identify potential risks\nand unusual events at an early stage, which can serve as a reference for timely\ninitiation of appropriate actions and improving management. However, smart\nmeter data from energy systems often lack labels and contain noise and various\npatterns without distinctively cyclical.

Many traditional\nunsupervised anomaly detection algorithms such as cluster-based or\ndistance-based models are not robust to noise and not fully exploit the\ntemporal dependency in a time series as well as other dependencies amongst\nmultiple variables (sensors).

Firstly, the AI system needs to follow guidelines or well-defined\nprocesses set by experts; the data alone will not be adequate. For example, to\ndiagnose the severity of depression, mental healthcare providers use Patient\nHealth Questionnaire (PHQ-9). So if an AI system were to be used for diagnosis,\nthe medical guideline implied by the PHQ-9 needs to be used. Likewise, a\nnutritionist's knowledge and steps would need to be used for an AI system that\nguides a diabetic patient in developing a food plan. Second, the BlackBox\nnature typical of many current AI systems will not work; the user of an AI\nsystem will need to be able to give user-understandable explanations,\nexplanations constructed using concepts that humans can understand and are\nfamiliar with. This is the key to eliciting confidence and trust in the AI\nsystem. For such applications, in addition to data and domain knowledge, the AI\nsystems need to have access to and use the Process Knowledge, an ordered set of\nsteps that the AI system needs to use or adhere to.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 14:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

It is essential to\nprotect privacy-sensitive data at every phase; at rest, at run, and while\ncomputations are executed on data. The zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) schemes are a\ncryptographic tool toward this aim. ZKP allows a party to securely ensure the\ndata's authenticity and precision without revealing confidential or\nprivacy-sensitive information during communication or computation. The power of\nzero-knowledge protocols is based on intractable problems. There is a\nrequirement to design more secure and efficient zero-knowledge proofs. This\ndemand raises the necessity of determining appropriate intractable problems to\ndevelop novel ZKP schemes. In this paper, we present a brief outline of ZKP\nschemes, the connection of these structures to group-theoretic intractable\nproblems, and annotate a list of intractable problems in group theory that can\nbe employed to devise new ZKP schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 20:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 13:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 15:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

We find that the\nAC-GAN discriminator is generally competitive with other machine learning\ntechniques. We also evaluate the utility of the GAN generative model for\nadversarial attacks on image-based malware detection.

Continual care deferral in\npopulations may lead to a decline in population health and compound health\nissues leading to higher social and financial costs in the long term.\nConsequently, identification of patients who may be at risk of deferring care\nis important towards improving population health and reducing care total costs.\nAdditionally, minority and vulnerable populations are at a greater risk of care\ndeferral due to socioeconomic factors. In this paper, we (a) address the\nproblem of predicting care deferral for well-care visits; (b) observe that\nsocial determinants of health are relevant explanatory factors towards\npredicting care deferral, and (c) compute how fair the models are with respect\nto demographics, socioeconomic factors and selected comorbidities. Many health\nsystems currently use rules-based techniques to retroactively identify patients\nwho previously deferred care. The objective of this model is to identify\npatients at risk of deferring care and allow the health system to prevent care\ndeferrals through direct outreach or social determinant mediation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 01:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}
