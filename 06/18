This is especially the case for time series, as this data type\nis hard to describe and cannot be fully understood when using for example\nsummary statistics. To realize effective time series visualization, four\nrequirements have to be met; a tool should be (1) interactive, (2) scalable to\nmillions of data points, (3) integrable in conventional data science\nenvironments, and (4) highly configurable. We observe that open source Python\nvisualization toolkits empower data scientists in most visual analytics tasks,\nbut lack the combination of scalability and interactivity to realize effective\ntime series visualization. As a means to facilitate these requirements, we\ncreated Plotly-Resampler, an open source Python library. Plotly-Resampler is an\nadd-on for Plotly's Python bindings, enhancing line chart scalability on top of\nan interactive toolkit by aggregating the underlying data depending on the\ncurrent graph view. Plotly-Resampler is built to be snappy, as the reactivity\nof a tool qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze data.\nA benchmark task highlights how our toolkit scales better than alternatives in\nterms of number of samples and time series. Additionally, Plotly-Resampler's\nflexible data aggregation functionality paves the path towards researching\nnovel aggregation techniques. Plotly-Resampler's integrability, together with\nits configurability, convenience, and high scalability, allows to effectively\nanalyze high-frequency data in your day-to-day Python environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 16:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2022 09:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-19"}

It is usually\nthe case that large masses concentrated in small regions of space have a great\nimpact on the collective movement of the group. For this reason, many models in\nmathematical biology have incorporated crowding effects and managed to\nunderstand their implications. Here, we build on a previously developed\nframework for random walks on networks to show that in the continuum limit, the\nunderlying stochastic process can be identified with a diffusion partial\ndifferential equation. The diffusion coefficient of the emerging equation is in\ngeneral density-dependent, and can be directly related to the transition\nprobabilities of the random walk. Moreover, the relaxation time of the\nstochastic process is directly linked to the diffusion coefficient and also to\nthe network structure, as it usually happens in the case of linear diffusion.\nAs a specific example, we study the equivalent of a porous-medium type equation\non networks, which shows similar properties to its continuum equivalent. For\nthis equation, self-similar solutions on a lattice and on homogeneous trees can\nbe found, showing finite speed of propagation in contrast to commonly used\nlinear diffusion equations.

For\nnon-cooperative networked control systems, analytical performance comparisons\nof time- and event-triggered control support this finding under certain\nassumptions.

We compared the luminosity and mass weighted stellar\npopulations of the bulges and discs, finding that bulges are generally older\nand more metal rich than their discs. When considering the mass and environment\nof each galaxy, we found that the galaxy stellar mass plays a more significant\nrole on the formation of the bulges. Bulges in galaxies with masses\n$\\geq10^{10}M_\\odot$ built up the majority of their mass rapidly early in their\nlifetimes, while those in lower mass galaxies formed over more extended\ntimescales and more recently. No clear difference was found in the formation or\nquenching processes of the discs as a function of galaxy environment. We\nconclude that more massive S0 galaxies formed through an inside-out scenario,\nwhere the bulge formed first and evolved passively while the disc underwent a\nmore extended period of star formation. In lower mass S0s, the bulges and discs\neither formed together from the same material, or through an outside-in\nscenario.

In this paper, we consider sensor data sharing and\nfusion in a vehicular network with both, vehicle-to-infrastructure and\nvehicle-to-vehicle communication.

To this end, we propose a novel Control\nTransformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do\nnot have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between\nvisual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask\nrepresentation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting.\nSecondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to\ntrain CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is\nimportant in control problems.

To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be\nissued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a\ncontract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners\nin the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that\nblock to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and\ncode execution. It is crucial for Dapp developers to be able to precisely\nestimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define\nand provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the\ntransactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different\nfactors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time\nestimation services are used by Dapp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet,\nthese services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing\ntimes. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum\nblockchain, changes in processing times are hard for Dapp developers to\npredict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build\nrandom forest models to understand the factors that are associated with\ntransaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture\nblockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction\nissuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas\npricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing\ntimes. Based on our empirical results, we provide Dapp developers with concrete\ninsights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 17:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

However, virtual avatars also need\nto be controllable even to a novel pose that may not have been observed.\nTraditional techniques, such as LBS, provide such a function; yet it usually\nrequires a hand-designed body template, 3D scan data, and limited appearance\nmodels. On the other hand, neural representation has been shown to be powerful\nin representing visual details, but are under explored on deforming dynamic\narticulated actors. In this paper, we propose TAVA, a method to create T\nemplate-free Animatable Volumetric Actors, based on neural representations. We\nrely solely on multi-view data and a tracked skeleton to create a volumetric\nmodel of an actor, which can be animated at the test time given novel pose.\nSince TAVA does not require a body template, it is applicable to humans as well\nas other creatures such as animals. Furthermore, TAVA is designed such that it\ncan recover accurate dense correspondences, making it amenable to\ncontent-creation and editing tasks. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed method generalizes well to novel poses as well as\nunseen views and showcase basic editing capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 03:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

We consider all possible production regimes:\npurely gravitational, weak direct coupling (perturbative), and strong direct\ncoupling (non-perturbative). For each regime, we use different approaches to\ndetermine the dark matter phase space distribution and the corresponding relic\nabundance. For the purely gravitational regime, scalar dark matter quanta are\ncopiously excited during inflation resulting in an infrared (IR) dominated\ndistribution function and a relic abundance which overcloses the universe for a\nreheating temperature $T_\\text{reh}>34 ~\\text{GeV}$. A non-vanishing direct\ncoupling induces an effective DM mass and suppresses the large IR modes in\nfavor of ultraviolet (UV) modes and a minimal scalar abundance is generated\nwhen the interference between the direct and gravitational couplings is\nmaximal. For large direct couplings, backreaction on the inflaton condensate is\naccounted for by using the Hartree approximation and lattice simulation\ntechniques.

These applications are known as Dapps. When\nengineering Dapps, developers need to translate requests captured in the\nfront-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions.\nDevelopers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the\nhigher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed.\nTherefore developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction\nfees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have\nbeen developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., Dapp developers) with an\nestimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas\nprice. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several\npopular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, their accuracy has not\nbeen empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the\ntransaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between\nprocessing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of\nstate-of-the-practice estimation services. We find that transactions are\nprocessed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed\nwithin 8m. The higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times\nwith diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in\nprocessing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. In terms of\naccuracy of processing time estimation services, we note that they are\nequivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, Etherscan's\nGas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap\ntransaction. EthGasStation's Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate\nestimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 18:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Many real-wold interactive settings involve general nonlinear\nstate and input constraints which couple agents' decisions with one another. In\nthis work, we develop an efficient and fast planner for interactive planning in\nconstrained setups using a constrained game-theoretical framework. Our key\ninsight is to leverage the special structure of agents' objective and\nconstraint functions that are common in multi-agent interactions for fast and\nreliable planning. More precisely, we identify the structure of agents' cost\nfunctions under which the resulting dynamic game is an instance of a\nconstrained potential dynamic game. Constrained potential dynamic games are a\nclass of games for which instead of solving a set of coupled constrained\noptimal control problems, a Nash equilibrium can be found by solving a single\nconstrained optimal control problem. This simplifies constrained interactive\ntrajectory planning significantly.

The moving average, or process\nconvolutions, construction of GPs allows some additional flexibility, but still\nrequires choosing a proper smoothing kernel, which is non-trivial. Previous\napproaches have built covariance functions by using GP priors over the\nsmoothing kernel, and by extension the covariance, as a way to bypass the need\nto specify it in advance. However, such models have been limited in several\nways: they are restricted to single dimensional inputs, e.g. time; they only\nallow modelling of single outputs and they do not scale to large datasets since\ninference is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric\nprocess convolution formulation for GPs that alleviates these weaknesses by\nusing a functional sampling approach based on Matheron's rule to perform fast\nsampling using interdomain inducing variables. Furthermore, we propose a\ncomposition of these nonparametric convolutions that serves as an alternative\nto classic deep GP models, and allows the covariance functions of the\nintermediate layers to be inferred from the data. We test the performance of\nour model on benchmarks for single output GPs, multiple output GPs and deep GPs\nand find that our approach can provide improvements over standard GP models,\nparticularly for larger datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 19:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 17:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Indeed, the user may want to emphasize the\nresults toward integrity or interpretability and a specific data resolution.\nThis paper proposes a new method to choose the best dimensionality reduction\nmethod in a supervised learning context.

The method\napplies a regression or a classification, evaluates the results, and gives a\ndiagnosis about the best dimensionality reduction process in this specific\nsupervised learning context.

Evaluating the\nperformance of data imputation and data augmentation can be similar since both\ngenerated data can be compared with an original distribution. Although, the\ntypical evaluation metrics have the same flaw: They calculate the feature's\nerror and the global error on the generated data without weighting the error\nwith the feature importance. The result can be good if all of the feature's\nimportance is similar. However, in most cases, the importance of the features\nis imbalanced, and it can induce an important bias on the features and global\nerrors. This paper proposes a novel metric named \"Explainable Global Error\nWeighted on Feature Importance\"(xGEWFI). This new metric is tested in a whole\npreprocessing method that 1. detects the outliers and replaces them with a null\nvalue. 2. imputes the data missing, and 3. augments the data. At the end of the\nprocess, the xGEWFI error is calculated. The distribution error between the\noriginal and generated data is calculated using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS\ntest) for each feature.

The second part involves applying a\nfilter that selects a range of minimum and maximum membership values,\nemphasizing the border data. A {\\mu} parameter defines the amplitude of this\nrange.

The result is a\nlist of data and clusters that regroup data sharing the same intersection,\nintersecting two features or more. ck-means allows extracting the very similar\ndata that does not naturally fall in the same cluster but at the intersection\nof two clusters or more.

Experiments and visualizations show that the method is able\nto generate multiple possible solutions that are consistent with the\nobservation of the shadow.

In particular, the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) of a block Hankel matrix formed from successive delay\nembeddings of the state of a dynamical system lies at the heart of several\npopular reduced-order modeling methods. In this paper, we show that the left\nsingular vectors of this Hankel matrix are a discrete approximation of\nclassical space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, and the\nsingular values are square roots of the POD energies. This connection\nestablishes a clear interpretation of the Hankel modes grounded in classical\ntheory, and we gain insights into the Hankel modes by instead analyzing the\nequivalent discrete space-time POD modes in terms of the correlation matrix\nformed by multiplying the Hankel matrix by its conjugate transpose. These\ninsights include the distinct meaning of rows and columns, the implied norm in\nwhich the modes are optimal, the impact of the time step between snapshots on\nthe modes, and an interpretation of the embedding dimension/height of the\nHankel matrix in terms of the time window on which the modes are optimal.\nMoreover, the connections we establish offer opportunities to improve the\nconvergence and computation time in certain practical cases, and to improve the\naccuracy of the modes with the same data. Finally, popular variants of POD,\nnamely the standard space-only POD and spectral POD, are recovered in the\nlimits that snapshots used to form each column of the Hankel matrix represent\nflow evolution over short and long times, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 20:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

The first one is the lack of a\nwell-behaved expression that is valid at both high-temperature and $T \\to 0$ K\nlimits. Specifically, if the partition function and the propagator are\nconsidered separately, then thermal vibrational correlation functions may have\nan indeterminate form 0/0 in the limit $T \\to 0$ K. This difficulty is resolved\nwhen the partition function and the propagator are jointly considered in the\nharmonic approximation, which allows a problematic term that emanates from the\nzero-point energy to be cancelled out thereby producing a thermal correlation\nfunction with a determinate form in $T \\to 0$ K limit. The second difficulty is\nrelated to the multivaluedness of the vibrational correlation function.

Here, we use molecular simulations to show how\nslight alterations of a molecular motor's structure can cause the motor's\ntypical dynamical behavior to reverse directions. Inspired by autonomous\nsynthetic catenane motors, we study the molecular dynamics of a minimal motor\nmodel, consisting of a shuttling ring that moves along a track containing\ninterspersed binding sites and catalytic sites. The binding sites attract the\nshuttling ring while the catalytic sites speed up a reaction between molecular\nspecies, which can be thought of as fuel and waste. When that fuel and waste\nare held in a nonequilibrium steady state, the free energy from the reaction\ndrives directed motion of the shuttling ring along the track.

So far it has only been investigated within the\nnon-relativistic theoretical approaches, and available experimental data are\nrather limited. Purpose: We aim to investigate the properties of M2 transitions\nin closed and open-shell nuclei using the framework of relativistic nuclear\nenergy density functional. The calculated M2 transition strengths could be used\nto constrain the quenching of the spin gyromagnetic factors. Methods: The M2\nexcitations are described using the relativistic quasiparticle random phase\napproximation (RQRPA) with the residual interaction extended with the\nisovector-pseudovector term. Results: The M2 transition strength distributions\nare described and analyzed for closed and open shell nuclei. The results are\ncompared with available experimental data and the strength missing from the\nexperiment is discussed. The evolution of M2 transition properties has been\ninvestigated within the $^{36-64} \\rm Ca$ isotope chain. Conclusion: The main\nM2 transitions have rather rich underlying structure and their collectivity\nincreases with the mass number due to larger number of contributing\nparticle-hole configurations. Pairing correlations in open shell nuclei have\nstrong effect, causing the M2 strength reduction and shifting of the centroid\nenergies to higher values. The analysis of M2 transition strengths indicate\nthat considerable amount of experimental strength may be missing, mainly due to\nlimitations to rather restricted energy ranges. The calculated M2 strengths for\nCa isotopes, together with the future experimental data will allow constraining\nthe quenching of the $g$ factors in nuclear medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 22:18:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

This study aimed to develop a deep learning framework for\ngenerating synthetic lesions that can be used to enhance network training. The\nlesion synthesis network is a modified generative adversarial network (GAN).\nSpecifically, we innovated a partial convolution strategy to construct an\nUnet-like generator. The discriminator is designed using Wasserstein GAN with\ngradient penalty and spectral normalization. A mask generation method based on\nprincipal component analysis was developed to model various lesion shapes.

Most existing methods learn such similarities in the embedding\nspace over image sets using a single metric learner. Images, however, have a\nvariety of object attributes such as color, shape, or artifacts. Encoding such\nattributes using a single metric learner is inadequate and may fail to\ngeneralize. Instead, multiple learners could focus on separate aspects of these\nattributes in subspaces of an overarching embedding. This, however, implies the\nnumber of learners to be found empirically for each new dataset. This work,\nDynamic Subspace Learners, proposes to dynamically exploit multiple learners by\nremoving the need of knowing apriori the number of learners and aggregating new\nsubspace learners during training. Furthermore, the visual interpretability of\nsuch subspace learning is enforced by integrating an attention module into our\nmethod. This integrated attention mechanism provides a visual insight of\ndiscriminative image features that contribute to the clustering of image sets\nand a visual explanation of the embedding features. The benefits of our\nattention-based dynamic subspace learners are evaluated in the application of\nimage clustering, image retrieval, and weakly supervised segmentation.

One of the main reasons for this is the conventional belief that\na player's luck tends to even out over the course of a season. The other main\nreason is the difficulties of finding a sensible algorithm to both quantify the\nstrengths of the opponents and incorporate such quantifications into a\nrenormalization of a player's statistics.\n  In this paper, we first argue that certain statistics, such as Earned Run\nAverage (ERA) or Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) can be significantly\nskewed by opponents' strengths in the MLB. We then present an algorithm to\nrenormalize such statistics, using FIP as the main example. This is achieved by\nobserving that certain opponent statistics for all 30 teams in the MLB (e.g.\nthe collection of each game's opponent FIP value over the course of a season)\nfollow a universal distribution, up to scaling and shift.\n  This enables us to establish a data set for a hypothetical average team and\nto develop a pitching statistic based on FIP which accounts for the strength of\na pitcher's schedule through methods based on equipercentile equating. It is\ncalled aFIP, which measures what a pitcher's FIP would have been if he had\nfaced a league-average offensive team every time he pitched.\n  We find that there is a significant difference between aFIP and FIP for some\npitchers during the 2019 season and other seasons as well, adding a new tool\nfor player evaluation. This could make millions of dollars of difference in\nplayer contracts and in profits for teams as they enhance the accuracy with\nwhich they make player acquisitions. The universal distribution we observed\nalso has many possible future applications throughout the sports world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 01:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Suppose that an agent utilizing one\nor more sensors is placed in an unknown environment, and based on its sensory\ninput, the agent needs to assign some label to the perceived scene. The agent\ncan adjust its sensor(s) to capture additional details about the scene, but\nthere is a cost associated with sensor manipulation, and as such, it is\nimportant for the agent to understand the scene in a fast and efficient manner.\nIt is also important that the agent understand not only the global state of a\nscene (e.g., the category of the scene or the major events taking place in the\nscene) but also the characteristics/properties of the scene that support\ndecisions and predictions made about the global state of the scene.

A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population\nsize). If the population size is too small, the update of the probabilistic\nmodel builds on few samples, leading to the undesired effect of genetic drift.\nToo large population sizes avoid genetic drift, but slow down the process.\n  Building on a recent quantitative analysis of how the population size leads\nto genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping\nruns when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in\ngood parameter regimes.\n  Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee\nfor this smart-restart scheme. This in particular shows that in many situations\nwhere the optimal (problem-specific) parameter values are known, the restart\nscheme automatically finds these, leading to the asymptotically optimal\nperformance.\n  We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmark\nproblems, we clearly observe the critical influence of the population size on\nthe performance, and we find that the smart-restart scheme leads to a\nperformance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. Our\nresults also show that previous theory-based suggestions for the optimal\npopulation size can be far from the optimal ones, leading to a performance\nclearly inferior to the one obtained via the smart-restart scheme. We also\nconduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on two combinatorial\noptimization problems from the literature, the max-cut problem and the\nbipartition problem.

If mass outflow and vertical mixing are sufficiently weak, the\naccreted dust produces a constant mixing ratio of atoms and remnant dust grains\nbelow the stopping layer. When vertical mixing is included along with settling,\nthe solutions interpolate between the mixing ratio due to the meteoric source\nabove the homopause, and that of the well-mixed deeper atmosphere below the\nhomopause. The line opacity from atoms and continuum opacity from remnant dust\nmay be observable in transmission spectra for sufficiently large dust accretion\nrates, a grain size distribution tilted toward the blowout size, and\nsufficiently weak vertical mixing. If mixing is strong, the meteoric source may\nstill act to augment heavy elements mixed up from the deep atmosphere as well\nas provide nucleation sites for the formation of larger particles. The possible\nrole of the Lorentz drag force in limiting the flow speeds and mixing\ncoefficient for pressures $\\la 1\\, \\rm mbar$ is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 02:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Here we introduce a novel game-theoretic framework,\nstatistical teleodynamics, that accounts for this feature explicitly and show\nhow it can be integrated with conventional statistical mechanics to develop a\nunified theory of arbitrage equilibrium in active and passive matter. We\npropose a spectrum of self-actualizing capabilities, going from none to\ncompletely strategic decision-making, and envision the various examples of\nactive matter systems occupying someplace in this spectrum. We show how\nstatistical teleodynamics reduces to familiar results in statistical mechanics\nin the limit of zero self-actualization. At the other extreme, in an economic\nsetting, it provides novel insights about the emergence of income distributions\nand their fairness in an ideal free-market society. As examples of agents in\nbetween these limits, we show how our theory predicts the behavior of active\nBrownian particles, the emergence of ant craters, and phase equilibria in\nsocial segregation dynamics.

A key step in graphite formation is the\nremoval of defects at high temperature ($>$2300~$^{\\circ}$C) that allow\ngraphenic fragments to rearrange into ordered crystallites. We find the\ncritical defect controlling graphitisation is a screw dislocation that winds\nthrough the layers like a spiral staircase, inhibiting lateral growth of the\ngraphenic crystallites ($L_a$) and preventing AB stacking of Bernal graphite.\nHigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) identifies screws as\ninterdigitated fringes with narrow focal depth in graphitising polyvinyl\nchloride (PVC). Molecular dynamics simulations of parallel graphenic fragments\nconfirm that screws spontaneously form during heating, with higher annealing\ntemperature driving screw annihilation and crystallite growth. The time\nevolution of graphitisation is tracked via X-ray diffraction (XRD), showing the\ngrowth of $L_a$ and reduction of the interlayer spacing consistent with\nmolecular dynamics of screw annihilation.

Unfortunately, nearly all previous works coarsely consider\ntraffic signals entirely as the outcome of the diffusion, while neglecting the\ninherent signals, which impacts model performance negatively. To improve\nmodeling performance, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Framework\n(DSTF) that separates the diffusion and inherent traffic information in a\ndata-driven manner, which encompasses a unique estimation gate and a residual\ndecomposition mechanism. The separated signals can be handled subsequently by\nthe diffusion and inherent modules separately. Further, we propose an\ninstantiation of DSTF, Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network\n(D2STGNN), that captures spatial-temporal correlations and also features a\ndynamic graph learning module that targets the learning of the dynamic\ncharacteristics of traffic networks. Extensive experiments with four real-world\ntraffic datasets demonstrate that the framework is capable of advancing the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 04:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 07:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 01:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

How to integrate the CM and ASV together remains an open\nquestion. A spoofing aware speaker verification (SASV) challenge has recently\ntaken place with the argument that better performance can be delivered when\nboth CM and ASV subsystems are optimized jointly. Under the challenge's\nscenario, the integrated systems proposed by the participants are required to\nreject both impostor speakers and spoofing attacks from target speakers, which\nintuitively and effectively matches the expectation of a reliable,\nspoofing-robust ASV system.

To deal with this challenge, we explore\nthe idea of Thompson Sampling (TS) that uses independent random samples instead\nof the upper confidence bounds, and design the first TS-based algorithm\nTS-Explore for (combinatorial) pure exploration. In TS-Explore, the sum of\nindependent random samples within arm set $S$ will not exceed the tight upper\nconfidence bound of $S$ with high probability. Hence it solves the above\nchallenge, and achieves a lower complexity upper bound than existing efficient\nUCB-based algorithms in general combinatorial pure exploration.

About 10 hours\nbefore the flare, a small sunspot in the active region NOAA 11818 started to\nmove northeast along a magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), creating a\nshearing motion that changed the quasi-static state of the active region. A\nfilament right above the PIL was activated following the movement of the\nsunspot and then got partially erupted. The eruption eventually led to the M3.3\nflare. The sunspot was then suddenly pulled back to the opposite direction upon\nthe flare onset. During the backward motion, the Lorentz force underwent a\nsimultaneous impulsive change both in magnitude and direction. Its directional\nchange is found to be conformable with the retraction motion. The observation\nprovides direct evidence for the role of the shearing motion of the sunspot in\npowering and triggering the flare.

However, two key challenges seriously\nhinder the further research of GraphNAS. First, since there is no consensus for\nthe experimental setting, the empirical results in different research papers\nare often not comparable and even not reproducible, leading to unfair\ncomparisons. Secondly, GraphNAS often needs extensive computations, which makes\nit highly inefficient and inaccessible to researchers without access to\nlarge-scale computation. To solve these challenges, we propose NAS-Bench-Graph,\na tailored benchmark that supports unified, reproducible, and efficient\nevaluations for GraphNAS. Specifically, we construct a unified, expressive yet\ncompact search space, covering 26,206 unique graph neural network (GNN)\narchitectures and propose a principled evaluation protocol. To avoid\nunnecessary repetitive training, we have trained and evaluated all of these\narchitectures on nine representative graph datasets, recording detailed metrics\nincluding train, validation, and test performance in each epoch, the latency,\nthe number of parameters, etc. Based on our proposed benchmark, the performance\nof GNN architectures can be directly obtained by a look-up table without any\nfurther computation, which enables fair, fully reproducible, and efficient\ncomparisons. To demonstrate its usage, we make in-depth analyses of our\nproposed NAS-Bench-Graph, revealing several interesting findings for GraphNAS.\nWe also showcase how the benchmark can be easily compatible with GraphNAS open\nlibraries such as AutoGL and NNI. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the\nfirst benchmark for graph neural architecture search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 10:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Before the stars arrive on\nthe zero-age main sequence, they form in the collapses of molecular clouds,\ngain matter through accretion processes, and compress their cores until\nhydrogen can burn in full equilibrium. Although this evolutionary phase lasts a\nrelatively short time, it is the imprint of these important physical processes\nthat is often ignored by simplified assumptions. While asteroseismology offers\na great tool to investigate these physical processes, studying pre-MS\noscillations in turn has the potential to further advance the field.\nAsteroseismology of pre-main sequence stars faces observational and theoretical\nchallenges. The remnants of their birth environment which is often still\nsurrounding the young stars causes variability that can interfere with the\nsignal of pulsations. The lack of long time-base satellite observations in\naddition limits the applications of the method. Theoretical models of pre-main\nsequence stars include several assumptions and simplifications that influence\nthe calculation of pulsation frequencies and excitation properties of pulsation\nmodes.

An improved understanding of the structure of\nyoung stellar objects has the potential to answer some of the open questions of\nstellar evolution, including angular momentum transport and the formation of\nmagnetic fields. While gyrochronology, for example, struggles to determine the\nages of the youngest clusters, pulsations in pre-main sequence stars can\nfunction as an independent age indicator yielding higher precision for single\nstars. The increasing interest of stellar astrophysics in general to\ninvestigate the formation and early evolution of stars and planets illustrates\nthe growing importance of pre-main sequence asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 10:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Knowledge of this curve\nyields a phase dynamics description of the oscillator for arbitrary weak\nforcing. Similar, though much less studied characteristic, is the amplitude\nresponse that can be defined either using an ad hoc approach to amplitude\nestimation or via the isostable variables. Here, we discuss the problem of the\nphase and amplitude response inference from observations using test\nstimulation. Although PRC determination for noise-free neuronal-like\noscillators perturbed by narrow pulses is a well-known task, the general case\nremains a challenging problem. Even more challenging is the inference of the\namplitude response. This characteristic is crucial, e.g., for controlling the\namplitude of the collective mode in a network of interacting units -- a task\nrelevant to neuroscience. Here, we compare the performance of different\ntechniques suitable for inferring the phase and amplitude response,\nparticularly with application to macroscopic oscillators.

Most of the previous researches of CTR models built based on Wide \\&\ndeep structure and gradually evolved into parallel structures with different\nmodules. However, the simple accumulation of parallel structures can lead to\nhigher structural complexity and longer training time. Based on the Sigmoid\nactivation function of output layer, the linear addition activation value of\nparallel structures in the training process is easy to make the samples fall\ninto the weak gradient interval, resulting in the phenomenon of weak gradient,\nand reducing the effectiveness of training. To this end, this paper proposes a\nParallel Heterogeneous Network (PHN) model, which constructs a network with\nparallel structure through three different interaction analysis methods, and\nuses Soft Selection Gating (SSG) to feature heterogeneous data with different\nstructure. Finally, residual link with trainable parameters are used in the\nnetwork to mitigate the influence of weak gradient phenomenon. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PHN in a large number of comparative\nexperiments, and visualize the performance of the model in training process and\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 11:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Combining deep learning (DL) and portable\nfundus cameras will enable CVD risk estimation in various scenarios and improve\nhealthcare democratization. However, there are still significant issues to be\nsolved. One of the top priority issues is the different camera differences\nbetween the databases for research material and the samples in the production\nenvironment. Most high-quality retinography databases ready for research are\ncollected from high-end fundus cameras, and there is a significant domain\ndiscrepancy between different cameras. To fully explore the domain discrepancy\nissue, we first collect a Fundus Camera Paired (FCP) dataset containing\npair-wise fundus images captured by the high-end Topcon retinal camera and the\nlow-end Mediwork portable fundus camera of the same patients. Then, we propose\na cross-laterality feature alignment pre-training scheme and a self-attention\ncamera adaptor module to improve the model robustness. The cross-laterality\nfeature alignment training encourages the model to learn common knowledge from\nthe same patient's left and right fundus images and improve model\ngeneralization. Meanwhile, the device adaptation module learns feature\ntransformation from the target domain to the source domain. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on both the UK Biobank database and our FCP data.

Towards building machines\nthat can learn and think like people, one natural question for us to ask is:\nwhether the intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a scientific\nthinking process, and if any, at what level. In this work, we devise the EST\nenvironment for evaluating the scientific thinking ability in artificial\nagents. Motivated by the stream of research on causal discovery, we build our\ninteractive EST environment based on Blicket detection. Specifically, in each\nepisode of EST, an agent is presented with novel observations and asked to\nfigure out all objects' Blicketness. At each time step, the agent proposes new\nexperiments to validate its hypothesis and updates its current belief. By\nevaluating Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents on both a symbolic and visual\nversion of this task, we notice clear failure of today's learning methods in\nreaching a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Such inefficacy of\nlearning in scientific thinking calls for future research in building humanlike\nintelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 13:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Existing source\nlocalization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules.\nUnfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many\napplications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have\nexpressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. This paper\naims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for\nsource localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion\n(IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage\nknowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an\nend-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred\nsources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically,\nfirst, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph\nresidual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with\ntheoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism\nthat learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure\nthe validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have\nbeen devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly\nencoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization\ntechnique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The\nconvergence of the proposed IVGD is proven theoretically. Extensive experiments\non nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed IVGD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art comparison methods significantly.

Classical methods generally adopt the discrete choice model\n(DCM) framework with linear utility functions and high-level route\ncharacteristics. While several recent studies have started to explore the\napplicability of deep learning for route choice modeling, they are limited to\npath-based models with relatively simple model architectures and relying on\npredefined choice sets. Existing link-based models can capture the dynamic\nnature of link choices within the trip without the need for choice set\ngeneration, but still assume linear relationships and link-additive features.\nTo address these issues, this study proposes a general deep inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) framework for link-based route choice modeling,\nwhich is capable of incorporating diverse features (of the state, action and\ntrip context) and capturing complex relationships.

We propose the first 1-nearest\nneighbor (NN) image retrieval algorithm, RetrievalGuard, which is provably\nrobust against adversarial perturbations within an $\\ell_2$ ball of calculable\nradius. The challenge is to design a provably robust algorithm that takes into\nconsideration the 1-NN search and the high-dimensional nature of the embedding\nspace. Algorithmically, given a base retrieval model and a query sample, we\nbuild a smoothed retrieval model by carefully analyzing the 1-NN search\nprocedure in the high-dimensional embedding space. We show that the smoothed\nretrieval model has bounded Lipschitz constant and thus the retrieval score is\ninvariant to $\\ell_2$ adversarial perturbations. Experiments on image retrieval\ntasks validate the robustness of our RetrievalGuard method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 16:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

In this general PF approach, N independent order\nparameters are used for describing the austenite (A)<->martensite (M)\ntransformations and N(>1) martensitic variants, and another M independent order\nparameters are considered for describing M(>1) grains in the polycrystalline\nsamples. The change in the GB energy due to its structural rearrangement during\nMTs is considered using variable energy for the GB(s) as a function of the\norder parameter related to the A<->M transformation. A rich plot for the\ntemperatures of transformations between the A, premartensite, and M in a\nbicrystal with a symmetric planar tilt GB are plotted for the varying\naustenitic GB width. The strong effects of the parameters, including the\naustenitic GB width, change in GB energy due to MTs, GB misorientation, applied\nstrains, and sample size on heterogeneous nucleation of the phases and the\nsubsequent complex martensitic microstructures evolution are explored in\nvarious bicrystals with symmetric or asymmetric planar or circular tilt GBs\nduring the forward and reverse transformations. The triple junction (TJ) energy\nand the energy and width of the adjacent GBs are also shown to strongly\ninfluence the nucleation and microstructures using the tricrystals having three\nsymmetric planar tilt GBs.

Evaluating the effectiveness of technical analysis has\nbecome more feasible due to increasing computing capability and blooming public\ndata, which indie investors can perform stock analysis and backtest their own\ntrading strategy conveniently. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)\nindicator is one of the popular technical indicators that are widely used in\ndifferent strategies. In order to verify the MACD effectiveness, in this\nthesis, I use the MACD indicator with traditional parameters (12, 26, 9) to\nbuild various trading strategies. Then, I apply these strategies to stocks\nlisted on three indices in the US stock market (i.e., Dow-Jones, Nasdaq, and\nS&P 500) and evaluate its performance in terms of win rate, profitability,\nSharpe ratio, number of trades and maximum drawdown. The backtesting is\nprogrammed using Python, covering the period between 01/01/2015 and 28-08-2021.\nThe result shows that the win-rate of the strategy with only the MACD indicator\nis less than 50%. However, the win-rate is improved for the trading strategies\nthat combine the MACD indicator with other momentum indicators like the Money\nFlow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Based on this result, I\nredesign the MACD mathematical formula by taking the trading volume and daily\nprice volatility into consideration to derive a new indicator called VPVMA. The\nresults show that the win-rate and risk-adjust performance of this new trading\nstrategy have been improved significantly. In general, the findings suggest\nthat while all the MACD trading strategies mentioned above can generate\npositive returns, the performance is not good without using other momentum\nindicators. Hence, the VPVMA indicator performs better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 11:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In this paper, we show\nthat a minimally 1-tough graph $ G $ with girth $ g\\geq 5 $ has minimum degree\nat most $ \\lfloor\\frac{n}{g+1}\\rfloor+g-1$, and a minimally $ 1 $-tough graph\nwith girth $ 4 $ has minimum degree at most $ \\frac{n+6}{4}$. We also prove\nthat the minimum degree of minimally $\\frac{3}2$-tough claw-free graphs is $ 3\n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

To appraise the current state of data sharing, as well as learn\nabout opportunities for stimulating such sharing at a faster pace, a virtual\nworkshop was held on May 21st and 26th, 2021, sponsored by the National Science\nFoundation and National Institute of Standards and Technologies, where a\nmultinational collection of researchers and practitioners were brought together\nto discuss their experiences and learn about recently developed technologies\nfor managing privacy while sharing data. The workshop specifically focused on\nchallenges and successes in government data sharing at various levels. The\nfirst day focused on successful examples of new technology applied to sharing\nof public data, including formal privacy techniques, synthetic data, and\ncryptographic approaches. Day two emphasized brainstorming sessions on some of\nthe challenges and directions to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 17:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

This work performs simulations on both CPU and GPU in the same\npackage under the same manufacturing process of low power mobile devices. The\nexperiment with simple pincell benchmark problems with fresh fuel gives\nconsistent results between CPU and GPU. In the meanwhile, it finds that the\nApple M1 GPU is as twice capable as M1 CPU, while entitled with a 5 times\nadvantage in power consumption. The particle sorting algorithm optimized for\nGPU improves computing efficiency by 28\\%, while prominently reducing GPU power\nconsumption. Such advantage of sorting algorithm is expected to be greater for\ndepleted fuel problems than fresh fuel problem. The kernel reconstruction\nDoppler broadening algorithm designed for continuously varying materials is\ndemonstrated to produce consistent Doppler coefficients with the reference code\nand the algorithm can be efficiently implemented on GPU. Compared with the\nreference code with double precision floating point numbers, the testing codes\nwith single precision floating point numbers could underestimate the\nK-effective values by about 500 pcm, and the Doppler coefficients of the fuel\nare well reproduced though. The conclusion may strengthen the argument that it\nis helpful for high performance computer to adopt GPU in order to reduce gross\npower consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 09:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}
