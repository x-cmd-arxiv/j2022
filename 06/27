In this paper, we provide insights for calibration of neural\nstate-space training algorithms based on extensive experimentation and analyses\nperformed on two recognized system identification benchmarks. Particular focus\nis given to the choice and the role of the initial state estimation. We\ndemonstrate that advanced initial state estimation techniques are really\nrequired to achieve high performance on certain classes of dynamical systems,\nwhile for asymptotically stable ones basic procedures such as zero or random\ninitialization already yield competitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 17:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

We introduce two encoder-decoder\nsub-networks that are fed with the blurry image and the estimated blur map,\nrespectively, and produce as output the deblurred (deconvolved) image. Each\nsub-network presents several skip connections that allow data propagation from\nlayers spread apart, and also inter-subnetwork skip connections that ease the\ncommunication between the modules. The network is trained with synthetically\nblur kernels that are augmented to emulate blur maps produced by existing blur\nestimation methods, and our experimental results show that our method works\nwell when combined with a variety of blur estimation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 17:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Here we consider a generalization\nof the frustrated KS model that exhibits new transitions to synchronization.\nThe model is identical in form to the original Kuramoto model, but written in\nterms of unit vectors. Replacing the coupling constant by a coupling matrix\nbreaks the rotational symmetry and forces the order parameter to point in the\ndirection of the eigenvector with highest eigenvalue, when the eigenvalues are\nreal. For complex eigenvalues the module of order parameter oscillates while it\nrotates around the unit circle, creating active states.

The decisions of DMs can be nudged or manipulated when\ntheir risk preferences are influenced by factors like the perception of losses\nand the availability of information about the uncertainties. In this work, we\npropose a Stackelberg risk preference design (STRIPE) problem to capture a\ndesigner's incentive to influence DMs' risk preferences. STRIPE consists of two\nlevels. In the lower-level, individual DMs in a population, known as the\nfollowers, respond to uncertainties according to their risk preference types\nthat specify their risk measures. In the upper-level, the leader influences the\ndistribution of the types to induce targeted decisions and steers the\nfollower's preferences to it. Our analysis centers around the solution concept\nof approximate Stackelberg equilibrium that yields suboptimal behaviors of the\nplayers. We show the existence of the approximate Stackelberg equilibrium. The\nprimitive risk perception gap, defined as the Wasserstein distance between the\noriginal and the target type distributions, is important in estimating the\noptimal design cost. We connect the leader's optimality tolerance on the cost\nwith her ambiguity tolerance on the follower's approximate solutions leveraging\nLipschitzian properties of the lower-level solution mapping. To obtain the\nStackelberg equilibrium, we reformulate STRIPE into a single-level optimization\nproblem using the spectral representations of law-invariant coherent risk\nmeasures. We create a data-driven approach for computation and study its\nperformance guarantees. We apply STRIPE to contract design problems to mitigate\nthe intensity of moral hazard. Moreover, we connect STRIPE with meta-learning\nproblems and derive adaptation performance estimates of the meta-parameter\nusing the sensitivity of the optimal value function in the lower-level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 18:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

An offline attacker who\nhas stolen the cryptographic hash of a user's password can check as many\npassword guesses as s/he likes limited only by the resources that s/he is\nwilling to invest to crack the password. Pepper and key-stretching are two\ntechniques that have been proposed to deter an offline attacker by increasing\nguessing costs. Pepper ensures that the cost of rejecting an incorrect password\nguess is higher than the (expected) cost of verifying a correct password guess.\nThis is useful because most of the offline attacker's guesses will be\nincorrect. Unfortunately, as we observe the traditional peppering defense seems\nto be incompatible with modern memory hard key-stretching algorithms such as\nArgon2 or Scrypt. We introduce an alternative to pepper which we call\nCost-Asymmetric Memory Hard Password Authentication which benefits from the\nsame cost-asymmetry as the classical peppering defense i.e., the cost of\nrejecting an incorrect password guess is larger than the expected cost to\nauthenticate a correct password guess. When configured properly we prove that\nour mechanism can only reduce the percentage of user passwords that are cracked\nby a rational offline attacker whose goal is to maximize (expected) profit\ni.e., the total value of cracked passwords minus the total guessing costs. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our mechanism on empirical password datasets\nagainst a rational offline attacker. Our empirical analysis shows that our\nmechanism can reduce significantly the percentage of user passwords that are\ncracked by a rational attacker by up to 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 20:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Established retrieval systems running at scale are usually\nwell understood in terms of effectiveness and costs, such as query latency,\nindexing throughput, or storage requirements. In this work, we propose a\nframework with a set of criteria that go beyond simple effectiveness measures\nto thoroughly compare two retrieval systems with the explicit goal of assessing\nthe readiness of one system to replace the other. This includes careful\ntradeoff considerations between effectiveness and various cost factors.\nFurthermore, we describe guardrail criteria, since even a system that is better\non average may have systematic failures on a minority of queries.

In that scenario,\nstate-of-the-art DR models have surprisingly strong results, not only on\naverage performance but passing an extensive set of guardrail tests, showing\nrobustness on different query characteristics, lexical matching,\ngeneralization, and number of regressions.

The 3GPP LTE standard uses the\nnumber of handovers made by a UE during a predefined time period to estimate\nthe speed and the mobility state efficiently. In this paper, we introduce an\napproximation to the probability mass function of handover count (HOC) as a\nfunction of a cellular-connected UAV's height and velocity, HOC measurement\ntime window, and different ground base station (GBS) densities. Afterward, we\nderive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the speed estimate of a UAV, and\nalso provide a simple biased estimator for the UAV's speed which depends on the\nGBS density and HOC measurement period. Interestingly, for a low\ntime-to-trigger (TTT) parameter, the biased estimator turns into a minimum\nvariance unbiased estimator (MVUE). By exploiting this speed estimator, we\nstudy the problem of detecting the mobility state of a UAV as low, medium, or\nhigh mobility as per the LTE specifications. Using CRLBs and our proposed MVUE,\nwe characterize the accuracy improvement in speed estimation and mobility state\ndetection as the GBS density and the HOC measurement window increase.

In appropriately\ndesigned experiments, if the scalar field in the model accounts for the\naccelerated expansion of the Universe entirely, the field will result in an\nobservable fifth force. Meanwhile, the trapped quintessence model still\nsatisfies all experimental bounds on deviations from general relativity due to\nboth the saturation effect and the short interaction range of the scalar field.\nThe scalar saturates at a value corresponding to the cosmological constant when\nthe microscopic nonrelativistic matter density is large enough.

In this work, motivated by recent\ncold atom experiments on probing quantum many-body dynamics of a\none-dimensional XXZ spin chain, we study the strong interaction limit of the\none-dimensional spinless fermion model, which is dual to the XXZ spin chain. We\ndevelop a highly efficient computation algorithm for simulating the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of this system exactly, and examine the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics starting from a density modulation quantum state. We\nfind ballistic transport in this strongly correlated setting, and show a\nplane-wave description emerges at long-time evolution. We also observe sharp\ndistinction between transport velocities in short and long times as induced by\ninteraction effects, and provide a quantitative interpretation for the\nlong-time transport velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 02:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

To be\nspecific, we first compute a similarity matrix based on current embedded\nfeatures to capture the local structure of training data. Then, the noisy\nsupervision signals carried by mislabeled data are overwhelmed by nearby\ncorrectly labeled ones (\\textit{i.e.}, label noise dilution), of which the\neffectiveness is guaranteed by the inherent robustness of feature embedding.\nFinally, the training data with diluted labels are further used to train a\nrobust classifier.

As\nthe graph convolution is a local operation, it can only utilize the short-range\njoint dependencies and short-term trajectory but fails to directly model the\ndistant joints relations and long-range temporal information that are vital to\ndistinguishing various actions. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale\nspatial graph convolution (MS-GC) module and a multi-scale temporal graph\nconvolution (MT-GC) module to enrich the receptive field of the model in\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Concretely, the MS-GC and MT-GC modules\ndecompose the corresponding local graph convolution into a set of sub-graph\nconvolution, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing\nadditional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of\nsub-graph convolutions, and each node could complete multiple spatial and\ntemporal aggregations with its neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive\nfield is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of capturing both short- and\nlong-range dependencies in spatial and temporal domains. By coupling these two\nmodules as a basic block, we further propose a multi-scale spatial temporal\ngraph convolutional network (MST-GCN), which stacks multiple blocks to learn\neffective motion representations for action recognition. The proposed MST-GCN\nachieves remarkable performance on three challenging benchmark datasets, NTU\nRGB+D, NTU-120 RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, for skeleton-based action\nrecognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 03:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

In the area of digital watermarking,\ndeep-learning-based watermarking technique is being extensively studied. Most\nexisting approaches adopt a similar encoder-driven scheme which we name END\n(Encoder-NoiseLayer-Decoder) architecture. In this paper, we revamp the\narchitecture and creatively design a decoder-driven watermarking network dubbed\nDe-END which greatly outperforms the existing END-based methods. The motivation\nfor designing De-END originated from the potential drawback we discovered in\nEND architecture: The encoder may embed redundant features that are not\nnecessary for decoding, limiting the performance of the whole network. We\nconducted a detailed analysis and found that such limitations are caused by\nunsatisfactory coupling between the encoder and decoder in END. De-END\naddresses such drawbacks by adopting a Decoder-Encoder-Noiselayer-Decoder\narchitecture. In De-END, the host image is firstly processed by the decoder to\ngenerate a latent feature map instead of being directly fed into the encoder.\nThis latent feature map is concatenated to the original watermark message and\nthen processed by the encoder. This change in design is crucial as it makes the\nfeature of encoder and decoder directly shared thus the encoder and decoder are\nbetter coupled. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that\nthis framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) END-based deep\nlearning watermarking both in visual quality and robustness. On the premise of\nthe same decoder structure, the visual quality (measured by PSNR) of De-END\nimproves by 1.6dB (45.16dB to 46.84dB), and extraction accuracy after JPEG\ncompression (QF=50) distortion outperforms more than 4% (94.9% to 99.1%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 03:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

One scheme is to introduce\nferromagnetic dopants in topological insulators. However, it is generally\nchallenging and requires carefully engineered growth/heterostructures or\nrelatively low temperatures to observe the QAHI due to issues such as the added\ndisorder with ferromagnetic dopants. Another promising scheme is using the\nmagnetic proximity effect with a magnetic insulator to magnetize the\ntopological insulator. Most of these heterostructures are synthesized so far by\ngrowth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and metallic organic chemical\nvapor deposition.

Despite such benefits, a data owner may feel reluctant to\noutsource anomaly detection without sufficient privacy protection. To that end,\nmost existing privacy solutions would face a novel challenge, i.e., preserving\nprivacy usually requires the difference between data entries to be eliminated\nor reduced, whereas anomaly detection critically depends on that difference.\nSuch a conflict is recently resolved under a local analysis setting with\ntrusted analysts (where no outsourcing is involved) through moving the focus of\ndifferential privacy (DP) guarantee from \"all\" to only \"benign\" entries.

A common roadblock to process\nmining is that event logs may contain private information that cannot be used\nfor analysis without consent. An approach to overcome this roadblock is to\nanonymize the event log so that no individual represented in the original log\ncan be singled out based on the anonymized one. Differential privacy is an\nanonymization approach that provides this guarantee. A differentially private\nevent log anonymization technique seeks to produce an anonymized log that is as\nsimilar as possible to the original one (high utility) while providing a\nrequired privacy guarantee. Existing event log anonymization techniques operate\nby injecting noise into the traces in the log (e.g., duplicating, perturbing,\nor filtering out some traces). Recent work on differential privacy has shown\nthat a better privacy-utility tradeoff can be achieved by applying subsampling\nprior to noise injection. In other words, subsampling amplifies privacy. This\npaper proposes an event log anonymization approach called Libra that exploits\nthis observation. Libra extracts multiple samples of traces from a log,\nindependently injects noise, retains statistically relevant traces from each\nsample, and composes the samples to produce a differentially private log. An\nempirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach leads to a considerably\nhigher utility for equivalent privacy guarantees relative to existing\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 05:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The stimuli in the conduction path that will address the myelin\nsheath that has lost its function are received by the axons and are conveyed\nexternally to the target organ, aiming to solve the problem of decreased nerve\nconduction.

Most of the\nrealizations use plasmonic platforms, and some also use all-dielectric\nnanoantennas, but hybrid dielectric-plasmonic (subwavelength) nanostructures\nhave been very little explored. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate\nsingle subwavelength hybrid dielectric-plasmonic optical nanoantennas coupled\nto localized quantum dot emitters that constitute efficient and bright\nunidirectional photon sources under optical pumping. To achieve this, we\ndevised a silicon nanoring sitting on a gold mirror with a 10 nm gap\nin-between, where an assembly of colloidal quantum dots is embedded. Such a\nstructure supports both (radiative) antenna mode and (nonradiative) gap mode\nresonances, which we exploit for the dual purpose of out-coupling the light\nemitted by the quantum dots into the far-field with out-of-plane directivity,\nand for enhancing the excitation of the dots by the optical pump. Moreover,\nalmost independent control of the resonance spectral positions can be achieved\nby simple tuning of geometrical parameters such as the ring inner and outer\ndiameters, allowing us to conveniently adjust these resonances with respect to\nthe quantum dots emission and absorption wavelengths. Using the proposed\narchitecture, we obtain experimentally average fluorescence enhancement factors\nup to $654\\times$ folds mainly due to high radiative efficiencies, and\nassociated with a directional emission of the photoluminescence into a cone of\n$\\pm 17\\degree$ in the direction normal to the sample plane.

The present contrastive learning methods treat\neach sample as a single class, which suffers from class collision problems,\nespecially in the domain of histopathology image analysis.

This process becomes difficult when\nsupervision is noisy as the distilled information might not be relevant. In\nfact, recent research shows that networks can easily overfit all labels\nincluding those that are corrupted, and hence can hardly generalize to clean\ndatasets. In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning with noisy labels\nand introduce compression inductive bias to network architectures to alleviate\nthis over-fitting problem. More precisely, we revisit one classical\nregularization named Dropout and its variant Nested Dropout. Dropout can serve\nas a compression constraint for its feature dropping mechanism, while Nested\nDropout further learns ordered feature representations w.r.t. feature\nimportance. Moreover, the trained models with compression regularization are\nfurther combined with Co-teaching for performance boost.\n  Theoretically, we conduct bias-variance decomposition of the objective\nfunction under compression regularization. We analyze it for both single model\nand Co-teaching. This decomposition provides three insights: (i) it shows that\nover-fitting is indeed an issue for learning with noisy labels; (ii) through an\ninformation bottleneck formulation, it explains why the proposed feature\ncompression helps in combating label noise; (iii) it gives explanations on the\nperformance boost brought by incorporating compression regularization into\nCo-teaching.

In most real-world scenarios, however, linear regression problems\nare often ill-posed or the underlying model suffers from overfitting, leading\nto erroneous or trivial solutions. This is often dealt with by adding extra\nconstraints, known as regularization. In this paper, we use the frameworks of\nblock-encoding and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) to design the\nfirst quantum algorithms for quantum least squares with general\n$\\ell_2$-regularization. These include regularized versions of quantum ordinary\nleast squares, quantum weighted least squares, and quantum generalized least\nsquares. Our quantum algorithms substantially improve upon prior results on\nquantum ridge regression (polynomial improvement in the condition number and an\nexponential improvement in accuracy), which is a particular case of our result.\n  To this end, we assume approximate block-encodings of the underlying matrices\nas input and use robust QSVT algorithms for various linear algebra operations.\nIn particular, we develop a variable-time quantum algorithm for matrix\ninversion using QSVT, where we use quantum eigenvalue discrimination as a\nsubroutine instead of gapped phase estimation. This ensures that substantially\nfewer ancilla qubits are required for this procedure than prior results. Owing\nto the generality of the block-encoding framework, our algorithms are\napplicable to a variety of input models and can also be seen as improved and\ngeneralized versions of prior results on standard (non-regularized) quantum\nleast squares algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 09:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 07:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 16:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

VSNs are mobile social\nnetworks that aim to create social links among travellers on the roads. Besides\nmatching interests between two users, social trust is essential to successfully\nestablish and nurture a social relationship. However, the unique\ncharacteristics of VSNs pose many challenges such as uncertainty, subjectivity\nand intransitivity to indirect social trust modelling. Furthermore, the current\ntrust models in the literature inadequately address trust propagation in VSNs.\nWe propose a novel indirect social trust model for VSNs using evolving graph\ntheory and the Paillier cryptosystem. We consider the VSN as a highly dynamic\nsocial evolving graph where social ties among vehicles hold a trustworthiness\nfactor that evolves over time. This factor is estimated based on the\nbehaviours, opinions, distances, and communication metrics of the parties\ninvolved. Employing the homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem, the\nproposed model targets the subjectivity problem when combining multiple\nopinions to establish an indirect trusted relationship. Through analysis of\ncomputational and communication complexities, we show the viability of the\nproposed model and the efficiency of its indirect trust computation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 09:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

However, as increasingly\nmore sensitive data is being accrued, the need to natively integrate privacy\ncontrols into the storage is growing in relevance. Today, due to the poor\nobject storage interface, privacy controls are enforced by data curators with\nfull access to data in the clear. This motivates the need for a new approach to\ndata privacy that can provide strong assurance and control to data owners. To\nfulfill this need, this paper presents EGEON, a novel software-defined data\nprotection framework for object storage. EGEON enables users to declaratively\nset privacy policies on how their data can be shared. In the privacy policies,\nthe users can build complex data protection services through the composition of\ndata transformations, which are invoked inline by EGEON upon a read request. As\na result, data owners can trivially display multiple views from the same data\npiece, and modify these views by only updating the policies. And all without\nrestructuring the internals of the underlying object storage system. The EGEON\nprototype has been built atop OpenStack Swift. Evaluation results shows promise\nin developing data protection services with little overhead directly into the\nobject store. Further, depending on the amount of data filtered out in the\ntransformed views, end-to-end latency can be low due to the savings in network\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

However, operation at mmWave bands\nraises two challenges: high penetration loss and susceptibility to objects\nblocking the line-of-sight. As a remedy, transmitters point their antennas to\ntheir receivers using beamforming to contain the signal in the direction of the\nintended receiver. To avoid loss of connectivity due to blockers or other\nfactors such as rain, users can be connected to multiple base stations (BS).\nWhile these two features, beamforming and multi-connectivity, can mitigate the\nchallenges of mmWave bands, it is not trivial to find the optimal user\nassociation which can maintain the minimum rate requirements of the users. In\nthis paper, we first formulate a throughput-maximizing user association scheme\nconsidering beamforming and multi-connectivity, and investigate the behavior of\nthe optimal scheme to devise a simple, yet efficient heuristic that does not\nrequire global network information. Our proposal, dubbed beam-align, which only\nuses local information at a BS, performs close to the optimal in terms of\nper-user capacity and user satisfaction levels and has only polynomial\ncomplexity. Our numerical analysis shows that beam-align outperforms the\nfrequently-used association schemes based on SNR. To investigate the\nperformance of beam-align also under various challenging settings, we consider\nthree scenarios: presence of blockers, different levels of rain intensity, and\npresence of clustered users. From simulations, we observe that beam-align is\nrobust against different conditions, as it maintains a stable performance under\nthe studied scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

A further suppression with\nincreasing pressure is impeded due to the occurrence of a pressure-induced\nstructural transition at $p \\geq$ 104 MPa, accompanied by a strong dimerization\nof Ru-Ru bonds, which gives rise to a collapse of the magnetic susceptibility.\nWhereas the dimerization transition is strongly first order, as reflected by\nlarge discontinuous changes in $\\chi$ and pronounced hysteresis effects, the\nmagnetic transition under varying pressure and magnetic field also reveals\nindications for a weakly first-order transition. We assign this observation to\na strong magnetoelastic coupling in this system. Measurements of $\\chi$ under\nvarying pressure in the paramagnetic regime ($T > T_N$) and before dimerization\n($p <$ 100 MPa) reveal a considerable increase of $\\chi$ with pressure. These\nexperimental observations are consistent with the results of ab-initio Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) calculations on the pressure-dependent structure and\nthe corresponding pressure-dependent magnetic model. Comparative susceptibility\nmeasurements on a second crystal showing two consecutive magnetic transitions\ninstead of one, indicating the influence of stacking faults. Using different\ntemperature-pressure protocols the effect of these stacking faults can be\ntemporarily overcome, transforming the magnetic state from a multiple-$T_N$\ninto a single-$T_N$ state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

To counter this, we have developed a\nself-consistent approach to study magnetised and radiatively cooled\ntwo-temperature accretion flows around a Kerr black hole in two spatial\ndimensions. The approach includes several heating processes, radiative cooling,\nand a coupling between the electrons and the ions via Coulomb interaction. We\ntest our approach by performing axisymmetric GRMHD simulations of magnetised\ntori accreting onto a Kerr black hole under various astrophysical scenarios. In\nthis way, we find that the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction and the\nradiative cooling impacts the thermodynamical properties of both the ions and\nelectrons, changing significantly the temperature distribution of the latter,\nand underlining the importance of a two-temperature approach when imaging these\nflows.

Unfortunately, the lack of proposals undermines these\nobjectives.\n  Objective. The main goal of our work is to provide researchers in CS, and in\nother areas of research, with a systematic, tool-supported approach for the\nreporting of changes in the replications of their empirical studies.\n  Method: Applying DSR, we have developed and validated a composite artifact\nconsisting of (i) a metamodel of the relevant concepts of replications and\ntheir changes; (ii) templates and linguistic patterns for reporting those\nconcepts; and (iii) a proof-of-concept model-based software tool that supports\nthe proposed approach. For its validation, we have carried out a multiple case\nstudy including 9 families of empirical studies from CS and Agrobiology. The 9\nfamilies encompass 23 replication studies and 92 replication changes, for which\nwe have analyzed the suitability of our proposal.\n  Results: The multiple case study revealed some initial limitations of our\napproach related to threats to experimental validity or context variables.\nAfter several improvement iterations, all the 92 replication changes could be\nproperly specified, including also their qualitatively estimated effects on\nexperimental validity across the family of experiments and its corresponding\nvisualization.\n  Conclusions: Our proposal for the specification of replication changes seems\nto fit the needs not only of replications in CS, but also in other research\nareas.

The main challenge of this task\ncomes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and the\nlack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus on\nsolving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing\nnoisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this\npaper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to\nintroduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide\nessential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning\nvia prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection\ntask, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of\nmapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a\nvector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the\nstance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing\nwith varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill\nthe information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the\nsuperior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 12:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Many theoretical\nstudies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative\ntraits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimum phenotype, whose\nvalue is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population\nfate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the\nmoving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the\nsystem of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their\ninteractions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative\nmeasures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from\nthe entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its\nshape.We investigate two different models of reproduction (asexual and\ninfinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with general forms of selection.In\nparticular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away\nfrom the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse\nof the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our\nunified framework furthermore allows highlighting the underlying mechanisms\nthat lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities\nand discrepancies between the two reproduction models, the latter being\nultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the\nphenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population\ncrucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the sexual\ninfinitesimal model, in contrast with the asexual model.In the asexual model,\nwe also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels\nwith higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness,\nespecially in fast changing environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 12:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Diagnosing depression based on the\ninterview is usually in the form of questions and answers. In this process, the\naudio signals and their text transcripts of a subject are correlated to\ndepression cues and easily recorded. Therefore, it is feasible to build an\nAutomatic Depression Detection (ADD) model based on the data of these\nmodalities in practice. However, there are two major challenges that should be\naddressed for constructing an effective ADD model. The first challenge is the\norganization of the textual and audio data, which can be of various contents\nand lengths for different subjects. The second challenge is the lack of\ntraining samples due to the privacy concern. Targeting to these two challenges,\nwe propose the TOpic ATtentive transformer-based ADD model, abbreviated as\nTOAT. To address the first challenge, in the TOAT model, topic is taken as the\nbasic unit of the textual and audio data according to the question-answer form\nin a typical interviewing process. Based on that, a topic attention module is\ndesigned to learn the importance of of each topic, which helps the model better\nretrieve the depressed samples. To solve the issue of data scarcity, we\nintroduce large pre-trained models, and the fine-tuning strategy is adopted\nbased on the small-scale ADD training data. We also design a two-branch\narchitecture with a late-fusion strategy for building the TOAT model, in which\nthe textual and audio data are encoded independently. We evaluate our model on\nthe multimodal DAIC-WOZ dataset specifically designed for the ADD task.\nExperimental results show the superiority of our method. More importantly, the\nablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in the TOAT\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 12:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

A direct estimation using\nsimulations of microscopic trajectories over long time scales is typically\ncomputationally intractable in metastable situations. To overcome this issue,\nseveral numerical methods rely on a potential-theoretic identity, sometimes\nattributed to Hill in the computational statistical physics litterature, which\nexpresses statistics of transitions in terms of the invariant measure of the\nsequence of configurations by which the underlying process enters metastable\nsets. The use of this identity then allows to replace the long time simulation\nproblem with a rare event sampling problem, for which efficient algorithms are\navailable. In this article, we rigorously analyse such a method for molecular\nsystems modelled by the Langevin dynamics. Our main contributions are twofold.\nFirst, we prove the Hill relation in the fairly general context of positive\nHarris recurrent chains, and show that this formula applies to the Langevin\ndynamics.

This limits the investigation of the growth\nprocess typically to grain sizes smaller than about 200 nm. Using 3D polarized\nradiative transfer simulations, however, it is possible to consider multiple\nscattering and to analyze the properties of dense particle clouds.\n  We study the impact of various properties of dust clouds on the scattering\npolarization, namely the optical depth of the cloud, the spatial density\ndistribution of the particles, their refractive index as well as the particle\nsize dispersion. We find that ambiguities can occur regarding optical depth and\nspatial density distribution as well as regarding refractive index and particle\nsize dispersion.

In contrast,\nthere is a trend towards employing deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a joint\nspatial and tempo-spectral non-linear filter, which means that the restriction\nof a linear processing model and that of a separate processing of spatial and\ntempo-spectral information can potentially be overcome. However, the internal\nmechanisms that lead to good performance of such data-driven filters for\nmulti-channel speech enhancement are not well understood. Therefore, in this\nwork, we analyse the properties of a non-linear spatial filter realized by a\nDNN as well as its interdependency with temporal and spectral processing by\ncarefully controlling the information sources (spatial, spectral, and temporal)\navailable to the network. We confirm the superiority of a non-linear spatial\nprocessing model, which outperforms an oracle linear spatial filter in a\nchallenging speaker extraction scenario for a low number of microphones by 0.24\nPOLQA score. Our analyses reveal that in particular spectral information should\nbe processed jointly with spatial information as this increases the spatial\nselectivity of the filter.

Otherwise, if\nobserved and calculated numbers of LBHs roughly agree, then the hypothesis of\nprimordial black hole existence gets strong observational support, and in\naddition their collisions with neutron stars may be considered a natural\ncreation channel for the LBHs, solving the problem of their origin, as it is\nknown that they cannot be a product of standard stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 14:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 16:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

However, the data is commonly assumed to\noriginate from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling\nreal-world dynamical processes, the data distribution often shifts due to\nchanges in the underlying system dynamics. Continual learning of these\nprocesses aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt system changes without forgetting\nprevious dynamical regimes. This work proposes an approach to continual\nlearning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art method for training\nrecurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems.\nReservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot be\nforgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose\nto train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by\nneuroscience's predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate,\nlaterally inhibiting and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting\ninduced by interfering parameter updates. We show that this multi-head\nreservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic forgetting on several\ndynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the chaotic Lorenz\nattractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our results\nsuggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for the\ncontinual learning of dynamical systems.

Thus, an adversary should not be able to maliciously interact with\none's account. However, this is only true if one considers a weak adversary. In\nparticular, since most current solutions only authenticate a session and not\nindividual transactions, they are noneffective if one's device is infected with\nmalware.

In describing system behavior, actions and states\nare two of the most commonly used concepts. In this paper, we focus on the\nnotion of action. It generally held that the meaning of the concept of action\nis not that easy to grasp. According to some researchers, many existing systems\ndo involve the notion of action, but in an obscure way. In Unified Modeling\nLanguage (UML), an action is a single atomic step within an activity, i.e., it\nis not further decomposed within the activity. Activity represents a behavior\nthat is composed of actions. This paper contributes to the establishment of a\nbroader interdisciplinary understanding of the notion of action in conceptual\nmodeling based on a model called the thinging machine (TM). The TM uses only\nfive primitive actions: create, process, release, transfer, and receive. The\ngoal of such a venture is to improve the process of developing conceptual\nmodels by refining basic concepts such as action and event. To demonstrate how\nTM modeling represents actions, UML activity and Business Process Model and\nNotation (BPMN) diagrams are re-modeled in terms of the five TM actions. The\nresults reveal the viability of the TM s five actions in modeling and relate\nthem to other important notions such as activity, event, and behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Dust\nmasses in other galaxies are generally derived from the FIR/submm using the\nemission properties of these MW-calibrated models. Aims: We seek to derive the\nFIR/submm emissivity in nine nearby spiral galaxies to check its compatibility\nwith MW cirrus measurements. Methods: We obtained values of the emissivity at\n70 to 500 um, using maps of dust emission from the Herschel satellite and of\ngas surface density from the THINGS and HERACLES surveys on a scale generally\ncorresponding to 440 pc. We studied the variation of the emissivity with the\nsurface brightness ratio I(250um)/I(500um), a proxy for the intensity of the\ninterstellar radiation field heating the dust. Results: We find that the\naverage value of the emissivity agrees with MW estimates for pixels sharing the\nsame color as the cirrus, namely, for I(250um)/I(500um) = 4.5. For\nI(250um)/I(500um) > 5, the measured emissivity is instead up to a factor ~2\nlower than predicted from MW dust models heated by stronger radiation fields.\nRegions with higher I(250um)/I(500um) are preferentially closer to the galactic\ncenter and have a higher overall (stellar+gas) surface density and molecular\nfraction. The results do not depend strongly on the adopted CO-to-molecular\nconversion factor and do not appear to be affected by the mixing of heating\nconditions. Conclusions: Our results confirm the validity of MW dust models at\nlow density, but are at odds with predictions for grain evolution in higher\ndensity environments. If the lower-than-expected emissivity at high\nI(250um)/I(500um) is the result of intrinsic variations in the dust properties,\nit would imply an underestimation of the dust mass surface density of up to a\nfactor ~2 when using current dust models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

To tackle the above limitations, we\npropose a novel light-weight anchor-free text detection framework called\nTextDCT, which adopts the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to encode the text\nmasks as compact vectors. Further, considering the imbalanced number of\ntraining samples among pyramid layers, we only employ a single-level head for\ntop-down prediction.

Most\nimportantly, we prove that the proposed transmit pulse is orthogonal with\nrespect to the DD plane's resolutions and therefore a realizable DD plane\northogonal pulse does exist. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance\nof the proposed ODDM modulation in terms of out-of-band radiation and bit error\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The present challenge\nis to experimentalists: we will send you samples of two materials (one smoother\nand one rougher); you determine the surface topography of these materials. We\ncall on you to measure such surfaces however you wish, using contact-based\ntechniques, light scattering, microscopy, or other techniques. Examples of\nquantities of interest are: root-mean-square (RMS) parameters; the power\nspectral density (PSD); or the autocorrelation function (ACF).

However, deep networks lack generalisability, that is, they\nwill not perform as good as in a new (testing) set drawn from a different\ndistribution due to the domain shift. In order to tackle this known issue,\nseveral transfer learning approaches have been proposed, where the knowledge of\na trained model is transferred into another to improve performance with\ndifferent data. However, most of these approaches require additional training\nsteps, or they suffer from catastrophic forgetting that occurs when a trained\nmodel has overwritten previously learnt knowledge. We address both problems\nwith a novel transfer learning approach that uses network aggregation. We train\ndataset-specific networks together with an aggregation network in a unified\nframework. The loss function includes two main components: a task-specific loss\n(such as cross-entropy) and an aggregation loss. The proposed aggregation loss\nallows our model to learn how trained deep network parameters can be aggregated\nwith an aggregation operator. We demonstrate that the proposed approach learns\nmodel aggregation at test time without any further training step, reducing the\nburden of transfer learning to a simple arithmetical operation. The proposed\napproach achieves comparable performance w.r.t. the baseline. Besides, if the\naggregation operator has an inverse, we will show that our model also\ninherently allows for selective forgetting, i.e., the aggregated model can\nforget one of the datasets it was trained on, retaining information on the\nothers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

Cyclic loading tests show large hysteresis in axial\nstress-strain behaviour that can be explained entirely by slip. Elastic wave\nvelocity variations are observed only past a yield point, and show hysteresis\nwith incomplete reversibility upon unloading.

This fast pre-computation\nfor the dimensions $0$ and $(d - 1)$ enables an aggressive specialization of\n[4] to the 3D case, which results in a drastic reduction of the number of input\nsimplices for the computation of $D_1(f)$, the intermediate layer of the\nsandwich. Finally, we document several performance improvements via\nshared-memory parallelism. We provide an open-source implementation of our\nalgorithm for reproducibility purposes. We also contribute a reproducible\nbenchmark package, which exploits three-dimensional data from a public\nrepository and compares our algorithm to a variety of publicly available\nimplementations. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by\ntwo orders of magnitude the time performance of the seminal \"PairSimplices\"\nalgorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and time\nperformance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial\ngain over the fastest available approaches, while producing a strictly\nidentical output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 10:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 11:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Yet, underlying mechanisms and their relative\ncontributions remain insufficiently understood, especially on decadal to\ncentennial timescales. Important reasons for this are difficulties in isolating\ninternal and externally-forced variability. Here, we provide a\nphysically-motivated emulation of global mean surface temperature (GMST)\nvariability, which allows for the separation of internal and external\nvariations. To this end, we introduce the ``ClimBayes'' software package, which\ninfers climate parameters from a stochastic energy balance model (EBM) with a\nBayesian approach. We apply our method to GMST data from temperature\nobservations and 20 last millennium simulations from climate models of\nintermediate to high complexity. This yields the best estimates of the EBM's\nforced and forced + internal response, which we refer to as emulated\nvariability. The timescale-dependent variance is obtained from spectral\nanalysis. In particular, we contrast the emulated forced and forced + internal\nvariance on interannual to centennial timescales with that of the GMST target.\nOur findings show that a stochastic EBM closely approximates the power spectrum\nand timescale-dependent variance of GMST as simulated by modern climate models.\nSmall deviations at interannual timescales can be attributed to the simplified\nrepresentation of internal variability and, in particular, the absence of\n(pseudo-)oscillatory modes in the stochastic EBM. Altogether, we demonstrate\nthe potential of combining Bayesian inference with conceptual climate models to\nemulate statistics of climate variables across timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 06:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a class of\nneuro-symbolic systems based on a differentiable, first-order logic grounded\ninto a deep neural network. LTNs replace the classical concept of training set\nwith a knowledge base of fuzzy logical axioms. By defining a set of\ndifferentiable operators to approximate the role of connectives, predicates,\nfunctions and quantifiers, a loss function is automatically specified so that\nLTNs can learn to satisfy the knowledge base. We focus here on the subsumption\nor \\texttt{isOfClass} predicate, which is fundamental to encode most semantic\nimage interpretation tasks. Unlike conventional LTNs, which rely on a separate\npredicate for each class (e.g., dog, cat), each with its own set of learnable\nweights, we propose a common \\texttt{isOfClass} predicate, whose level of truth\nis a function of the distance between an object embedding and the corresponding\nclass prototype.

Given two metastable\nconformational states of a molecular system, eg. a folded and unfolded protein,\nwe aim to sample the most likely transition path between the two states.\nSampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the\nexistence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent\nthis, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along\nspecific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables (CVs). However,\nfinding CVs is not trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger\nmolecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these CV-based methods\nbiases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. Instead, this work\nproposes a method for sampling transition paths that consider the entire\ngeometry of the molecules. To achieve this, we first relate the problem to\nrecent work on the Schrodinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control.\nUsing this relation, we construct a method that takes into account important\ncharacteristics of molecular systems such as second-order dynamics and\ninvariance to rotations and translations. We demonstrate our method on the\ncommonly studied Alanine Dipeptide, but also consider larger proteins such as\nPolyproline and Chignolin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 14:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

The uncertainty in such mass\nmeasurement is currently ~$1\\times 10^{-8} $. We show how the same Kibble\nbalance can be used to measure the $inertial$ mass of a test mass, that too\nwith potentially 50% better measurement uncertainty, i.e., ~$5\\times 10^{-9} $.\nFor measuring the inertial mass, the weight of the test mass and the assembly\nholding it is precisely balanced by a counterweight. The application of the\nknown electromagnetic force accelerates the test mass. Measuring the velocity\nafter a controlled elapsed time provides the acceleration and, consequently,\nthe inertial mass of the accelerated assembly comprising the Kibble balance\ncoil and the mass holding pan. Repeating the measurement with the test mass\nadded to the assembly and taking the difference between the two measurements\nyields the inertial mass of the test mass. Thus, the extreme precision inertial\nand gravitational mass measurement of a test mass with a Kibble balance could\nprovide a test of the equivalence principle.
