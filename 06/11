Within our model baryogenesis, neutrino mass, strong CP and\ndark matter puzzles are related. The common ingredient in connecting these\npuzzles is the Kalb-Ramond field, a two form present in the gravitational\nmultiplet in the theory of closed strings. Leptons are fermions which we need\nto couple to gravitational degrees of freedom using a vierbein formalism. The\npresence of torsion provided by a Kalb-Ramond background leads us to firstly an\neffective model involving the Einstein-Cartan formulation of gravity, a gauge\ntheory, in which coupling to fermions is via a covariant derivative and\nsecondly to a mechanism for CPT violation. This picture emerges from a low\nenergy string effective action obtained from a closed bosonic string theory\nafter compactification to four dimensions. The Kalb-Ramond field in four\ndimensions can be identified with a pseudoscalar gravitational axion. Because\nof the presence of an axial anomaly this axion can couple with the gluon field,\nand in this way allows a connection with the strong CP problem and axionic dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 16:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

It is well known, however, that when\nself-interactions are present, direct application of the dynamical cavity\nmethod is cumbersome, due to the presence of strong memory effects, which\nprevent explicit analysis of the dynamics beyond a few time steps. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we show that it is possible to map a system of $N$ variables\nto an equivalent bipartite system of $2N$ variables, for which the dynamical\ncavity method can be used under the usual one time approximation scheme.

To\nconstrain the origin of the soft excess in the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 926, we\ncarry out an multi-epoch X-ray spectral study using observations from Suzaku\n(2009), XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (2016), and NuSTAR and Swift-XRT (2021).

An observation for NLP is\nthat emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events, appealing\nto an empathetic, intersubjective understanding of events, even without\nexplicitly mentioning an emotion name. In psychology, the class of emotion\ntheories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the link between events\nand emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a\ncognitive evaluation by people living through an event that they consider\nrelevant. They include the assessment if an event is novel, if the person\nconsiders themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with the own goals,\nand many others. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on\nan event, e.g., that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with\nuncertain consequences could evoke fear. We analyze the suitability of\nappraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal of understanding\nif appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can\nbe predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify\nemotion categories. To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to\ntextually describe events that triggered particular emotions and to disclose\ntheir appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions and appraisals\nfrom the text. This setup allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can\nbe recovered purely from text and provides a human baseline. Our comparison of\ntext classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably\ndetect emotions and appraisals with similar performance. Therefore, appraisals\nconstitute an alternative computational emotion analysis paradigm and further\nimprove the categorization of emotions in text with joint models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 17:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 15:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 16:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 06:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 06:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 09:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-10"}

However, understanding and generating code requires a\nmore rigorous comprehension of the code syntax and semantics.

The computational\nchallenge in these systems arises when interactions become comparable to other\nenergy scales, which makes the state of each particle depend on all other\nparticles. The lack of general solutions for the 3-body problem and acceptable\ntheory for strongly correlated electrons shows that our understanding of\ncorrelated systems fades when the particle number or the interaction strength\nincreases. One of the hallmarks of interacting systems is the formation of\nmulti-particle bound states. In a ring of 24 superconducting qubits, we develop\na high fidelity parameterizable fSim gate that we use to implement the periodic\nquantum circuit of the spin-1/2 XXZ model, an archetypal model of interaction.\nBy placing microwave photons in adjacent qubit sites, we study the propagation\nof these excitations and observe their bound nature for up to 5 photons. We\ndevise a phase sensitive method for constructing the few-body spectrum of the\nbound states and extract their pseudo-charge by introducing a synthetic flux.\nBy introducing interactions between the ring and additional qubits, we observe\nan unexpected resilience of the bound states to integrability breaking.

Moreover, for time-sensitive prediction, we perform an early\ndetection of sequence goal via a constrained margin-based optimization\nprocedure. This in-turn allows ProActive to predict the sequence goal using a\nlimited number of actions.

One of the major challenges at Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes\n(IACTs) designed to look for VHE gamma rays, is the separation of air showers\ninitiated by CCRs which form a background to gamma ray searches. Two other less\nwell studied problems at IACTs are a) the classification of different primary\nnuclei among the CCR events and b) identification of anomalous events initiated\nby Beyond Standard Model particles that could give rise to shower signatures\nwhich differ from the standard images of either gamma rays or CCR showers. The\nproblems of categorizing the primary particle that initiates a shower image, or\nthe problem of tagging anomalous shower events in a model independent way, are\nproblems that are well suited to a machine learning (ML) approach. Traditional\nstudies that have explored gamma ray/CCR separation have used a multivariate\nanalysis based on derived shower properties, which contains significantly\nreduced information about the shower. In our work, we address the problems\noutlined above by using ML architectures trained on full simulated shower\nimages, as opposed to training on just a few derived shower properties.

Contrary to\nthe massive dark photon, a massless dark photon can only couple to the standard\nmodel sector by means of effective higher dimensional operators. Massless\ndark-photon production at colliders will then in general be suppressed at low\nenergy by a UV energy scale, which is of the order of the masses of portal\n(messenger) fields connecting the dark and the observable sectors. A violation\nof this expectation is provided by dark-photon production mediated by the Higgs\nboson, thanks to the non-decoupling Higgs properties. Higgs-boson production at\ncolliders, followed by the Higgs decay into a photon and a dark photon,\nprovides then a very promising production mechanism for the dark photon\ndiscovery, being insensitive in particular regimes to the UV scale of the new\nphysics. This decay channel gives rise to a peculiar signature characterized by\na monochromatic photon with energy half the Higgs mass (in the Higgs rest\nframe) plus missing energy.

We present X-ray (XMM-Newton, 100 ks) follow-up observations of a\n$z\\approx6$ QSO, J1641+3755, which was found to be remarkably X-ray bright in a\n2018 Chandra dataset. J1641+3755 is not detected in the 2021 XMM-Newton\nobservation, implying that its X-ray flux decreased by a factor $\\gtrsim7$ on a\nnotably short timescale (i.e., $\\approx115$ rest-frame days), making it the\n$z>4$ QSO with the largest variability amplitude. We also obtained rest-frame\nUV spectroscopic and photometric data with textit{LBT}, and compared them with\narchival datasets. Surprisingly, we found that J1641+3755 became brighter in\nthe rest-frame UV band from 2003 to 2016, while no strong variation occurred\nfrom 2016 to 2021. Multiple narrow absorption features are detected in its\nrest-frame UV spectrum, and several of them can be associated with an\nintervening system at $z=5.67$. The variability properties of J1641+3755 can be\ndue to intrinsic variations of the accretion rate, a small-scale obscuration\nevent, gravitational lensing due to an intervening object, or an unrelated\nX-ray transient in a foreground galaxy in 2018. Accounting for all of the $z>6$\nQSOs with multiple X-ray observations separated by $>10$ rest-frame days, we\nfound an enhancement of strongly (i.e., by a factor $>3$) X-ray variable\nobjects compared to QSOs at later cosmic times. This finding may be related to\nthe physics of fast accretion in high-redshift QSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 18:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

The latent overlapping group lasso can achieve the goal of\nincorporating some types of selection dependencies into variable selection by\nassigning coefficients to different groups of penalties. However, when the\nselection dependencies are complex, there is no roadmap for how to specify the\ngroups of penalties. Wang et al. (2021) proposed a general framework for\nstructured variable selection, and provided a condition to verify whether a\npenalty grouping respects a set of selection dependencies. Based on this\nprevious work, we construct roadmaps to derive the grouping specification for\nsome common selection dependencies and apply them to the problem of\nconstructing a prediction model for major bleeding among hypertensive patients\nrecently hospitalized for atrial fibrillation and then prescribed oral\nanticoagulants. In the application, we consider a proxy of adherence to\nanticoagulant medication and its interaction with dose and oral anticoagulants\ntype, respectively. We also consider drug-drug interactions. Our method allows\nfor algorithmic identification of the grouping specification even under the\nresulting complex selection dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 19:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

While passive IRS nodes\nincorporate a great number of phase-shifting elements and a controller entity,\nthe phase-shifts are typically determined by the cellular base station (BS) due\nto its computational capability. Since the fine granularity control of the\nlarge number of phase-shifters may become prohibitive in practice, it is\nimportant to reduce the control overhead between the BS and the IRS controller.\nTo this end, in this paper we propose a low-rank approximation of the\nnear-optimal phase-shifts, which would incur prohibitively high communication\noverhead on the BS-IRS controller links. The key idea is to represent the\npotentially large IRS phase-shift vector using a low-rank tensor model. This is\nachieved by factorizing a tensorized version of the IRS phase-shift vector,\nwhere each component is modeled as the Kronecker product of a predefined number\nof factors of smaller sizes, which can be obtained via tensor decomposition\nalgorithms.

For a\ngiven $n$-process task $\\Pi$ and a given computational model $M$, we define a\nnew task, called the closure of $\\Pi$ with respect to $M$. The asynchronous\nspeedup theorem states that if a task $\\Pi$ is solvable in $t\\geq 1$ rounds in\n$M$, then its closure w.r.t. $M$ is solvable in $t-1$ rounds in $M$. We prove\nthis theorem for iterated models, as long as the model allows solo executions.\nWe illustrate the power of our asynchronous speedup theorem by providing a new\nproof of the wait-free impossibility of consensus using read/write registers,\nand a new proof of the wait-free impossibility of solving consensus using\nregisters and test\\&set objects for $n>2$. The proof is merely by showing that,\nin each case, the closure of consensus (w.r.t. the corresponding model) is\nconsensus itself. Our main application is the study of the power of additional\nobjects, namely test\\&set and binary consensus, for wait-free solving\napproximate agreement faster. By analyzing the closure of approximate agreement\nw.r.t. each of the two models, we show that while these objects are more\npowerful than read/write registers from the computability perspective, they are\nnot more powerful as far as helping solving approximate agreement faster is\nconcerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 21:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 15:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-21"}

While high-resolution weather models can forecast many\ntypes of extreme events on synoptic timescales, long-term climatological risk\nassessment is an altogether different problem. A once-in-a-century event takes,\non average, 100 years of simulation time to appear just once, far beyond the\ntypical integration length of a weather forecast model. Therefore, this task is\nleft to cheaper, but less accurate, low-resolution or statistical models. But\nthere is untapped potential in weather model output: despite being short in\nduration, weather forecast ensembles are produced multiple times a week.\nIntegrations are launched with independent perturbations, causing them to\nspread apart over time and broadly sample phase space. Collectively, these\nintegrations add up to thousands of years of data. We establish methods to\nextract climatological information from these short weather simulations. Using\nensemble hindcasts by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting\n(ECMWF) archived in the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) database, we characterize\nsudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with multi-centennial return times.\nConsistent results are found between alternative methods, including basic\ncounting strategies and Markov state modeling. By carefully combining\ntrajectories together, we obtain estimates of SSW frequencies and their\nseasonal distributions that are consistent with reanalysis-derived estimates\nfor moderately rare events, but with much tighter uncertainty bounds, and which\ncan be extended to events of unprecedented severity that have not yet been\nobserved historically.

In this work, we\nexplore the task of ranking textual rationales (supporting evidences) for\nmodel-agnostic explainable recommendation.

While most countries have large-scale screening programs,\nthere is no consensus on a single globally accepted guideline for breast cancer\nscreening. The complex nature of the disease; the limited availability of\nscreening methods such as mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and\nultrasound; and public health policies all factor into the development of\nscreening policies. Resource availability concerns necessitate the design of\npolicies which conform to a budget, a problem which can be modelled as a\nconstrained partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP). In this\nstudy, we propose a multi-objective CPOMDP model for breast cancer screening\nwhich allows for supplemental screening methods to accompany mammography. The\nmodel has two objectives: maximize the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and\nminimize lifetime breast cancer mortality risk (LBCMR). We identify the Pareto\nfrontier of optimal solutions for average and high-risk patients at different\nbudget levels, which can be used by decision-makers to set policies in\npractice.

Despite\nits significance for non-Hermitian topological phases, the relevance of the\nskin effect to quantum entanglement and critical phenomena has remained\nunclear. Here, we find that the skin effect induces a nonequilibrium quantum\nphase transition in the entanglement dynamics. We show that the skin effect\ngives rise to a macroscopic flow of particles and suppresses the entanglement\npropagation and thermalization, leading to the area law of the entanglement\nentropy in the nonequilibrium steady state. Moreover, we reveal an entanglement\nphase transition induced by the competition between the unitary dynamics and\nthe skin effect even without disorder or interactions. This entanglement phase\ntransition accompanies nonequilibrium quantum criticality characterized by a\nnonunitary conformal field theory whose effective central charge is extremely\nsensitive to the boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that it originates\nfrom an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the concomitant\nscale invariance of the skin modes localized according to the power law.\nFurthermore, we show that the skin effect leads to the purification and the\nreduction of von Neumann entropy even in Markovian open quantum systems\ndescribed by the Lindblad master equation.

Self-supervised learning\nmethods can help avoid the requirement of large annotated training datasets,\nhowever, to be useful in real-world applications, they should achieve good\nsegmentation quality. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-based method\nthat uses self-supervision for high-quality fish segmentation. Our proposed\nmodel is trained on videos -- without any annotations -- to perform fish\nsegmentation in underwater videos taken in situ in the wild. We show that when\ntrained on a set of underwater videos from one dataset, the proposed model\nsurpasses previous CNN-based and Transformer-based self-supervised methods and\nachieves performance relatively close to supervised methods on two new unseen\nunderwater video datasets. This demonstrates the great generalisability of our\nmodel and the fact that it does not need a pre-trained model. In addition, we\nshow that, due to its dense representation learning, our model is\ncompute-efficient. We provide quantitative and qualitative results that\ndemonstrate our model's significant capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 01:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

An important parameter required in the design of many He II based\ncooling systems is the peak heat flux $q^*$, which refers to the threshold heat\nflux above which boiling spontaneously occurs in He II. Past experimental and\nnumerical studies showed that $q^*$ increases when the heating time $t_h$ is\nreduced, which leads to an intuitive expectation that very high $q^*$ may be\nachievable at sufficiently small $t_h$. Knowledge on how $q^*$ actually behaves\nat small $t_h$ is important for applications such as laser ablation in He II.\nHere we present a numerical study on the evolution of the thermodynamic state\nof the He II in front of a planar heater by solving the He II two-fluid\nequations of motion. For an applied heat flux, we determine the heating time\nbeyond which the He II near the heater transits to the vapor phase. As such, a\ncurve correlating $q^*$ and $t_h$ can be obtained, which nicely reproduces some\nrelevant experimental data. Surprisingly, we find that there exists a critical\npeak heat flux $q^*_c$, above which boiling occurs nearly instantaneously\nregardless of $t_h$. We reveal that the boiling in this regime is essentially\ncavitation caused by the combined effects of the first-sound and the\nsecond-sound waves in He II. Based on this physical picture, an analytical\nmodel for $q^*_c$ is developed, which reproduces the simulated $q^*_c$ values\nat various He II bath temperatures and hydrostatic head pressures.

Social VR aims to increase levels of\n(co-)presence and interaction quality by overcoming the limitations of 2D\nwindowed representations in traditional multi-party video conferencing tools,\nalthough most existing solutions rely on 3D avatars to represent users. This\narticle presents a social VR platform that supports real-time volumetric\nholographic representations of users that are based on point clouds captured by\noff-the-shelf RGB-D sensors, and it analyzes the platform's potential for\nconducting interactive holomeetings (i.e., holoconferencing scenarios). This\nwork evaluates such a platform's performance and readiness for conducting\nmeetings with up to four users, and it provides insights into aspects of the\nuser experience when using single-camera and low-cost capture systems in\nscenarios with both frontal and side viewpoints. Overall, the obtained results\nconfirm the platform's maturity and the potential of holographic communications\nfor conducting interactive multi-party meetings, even when using low-cost\nsystems and single-camera capture systems in scenarios where users are sitting\nor have a limited translational movement along the X, Y, and Z axes within the\n3D virtual environment (commonly known as 3 Degrees of Freedom plus, 3DoF+)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 05:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

First of all, this paper\nproposes a novel joint active device separation (the message recovery of active\ndevice) and channel estimation architecture for the RIS-aided URA.\nSpecifically, the RIS passive reflection is optimized before the successful\ndevice separation. Then, by associating the data sequences to multiple rank-one\ntensors and exploiting the angular sparsity of the RIS-BS channel, the\ndetection problem is cast as a high-order coupled tensor decomposition problem\nwithout the need of exploiting pilot sequences. However, the inherent coupling\namong multiple sparse device-RIS channels, together with the unknown number of\nactive devices make the detection problem at hand deviate from the widely-used\ncoupled tensor decomposition format. To overcome this challenge, this paper\njudiciously devises a probabilistic model that captures both the element-wise\nsparsity from the angular channel model and the low-rank property due to the\nsporadic nature of URA. Then, based on such a probabilistic model, a iterative\ndetection algorithm is developed under the framework of sparse variational\ninference, where each update iteration is obtained in a closed-form and the\nnumber of active devices can be automatically estimated for effectively\navoiding the overfitting of noise.

In this work, we solve questions from final exams that differ from\nproblem sets in several ways: the questions are longer, have multiple parts,\nare more complicated, and span a broader set of topics. We provide a new\ndataset and benchmark of questions from machine learning final exams and code\nfor automatically answering these questions and generating new questions. To\nmake our dataset a reproducible benchmark, we use automatic checkers for\nmultiple choice questions, questions with numeric answers, and questions with\nexpression answers, and evaluate a large free language model, Meta's OPT, and\ncompare the results with Open AI's GPT-3, ChatGPT, and Codex. A student survey\ncomparing the quality, appropriateness, and difficulty of machine-generated\nquestions with human-written questions shows that across multiple aspects,\nmachine-generated questions are indistinguishable from human-generated\nquestions and are suitable for final exams. We perform ablation studies\ncomparing zero-shot learning with few-shot learning, chain-of-thought\nprompting, GPT-3, ChatGPT, and OPT pre-trained on text and Codex fine-tuned on\ncode on a range of machine learning topics and find that few-shot learning\nmethods perform best. We make our data and code publicly available for the\nmachine learning community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 06:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 23:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 19:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 18:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2022 13:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-26"}

In this study, I apply new\neconophysics models of wealth exchange and redistribution to quantitatively\ncompare these characteristics to those of capitalism and evaluate wealth\ndistribution and disparity using a simulation. Specifically, regarding\nexchange, I propose a loan interest model representing finance capitalism and\nriba and a joint venture model representing shareholder capitalism and\nmudaraba; regarding redistribution, I create a transfer model representing\ninheritance tax and waqf. As exchanges are repeated from an initial uniform\ndistribution of wealth, wealth distribution approaches a power-law distribution\nmore quickly for the loan interest than the joint venture model; and the Gini\nindex, representing disparity, rapidly increases. The joint venture model's\nGini index increases more slowly, but eventually, the wealth distribution in\nboth models becomes a delta distribution, and the Gini index gradually\napproaches 1. Next, when both models are combined with the transfer model to\nredistribute wealth in every given period, the loan interest model has a larger\nGini index than the joint venture model, but both converge to a Gini index of\nless than 1. These results quantitatively reveal that in the Islamic economy,\ndisparity is restrained by prohibiting riba and promoting reciprocal exchange\nin mudaraba and redistribution through waqf. Comparing Islamic and capitalist\neconomies provides insights into the benefits of economically embracing the\nethical practice of mutual aid and suggests guidelines for an alternative to\ncapitalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 06:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 09:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

However, its original uncorrected formulation overestimates the\nforces near the tip of the blades and does not reproduce well forces on\ntranslating wings. The recently proposed vortex-based smearing correction for\nthe ALM is a correction based on physical and mathematical properties of the\nsimulation that allows for a more accurate and general ALM. So far, to correct\nthe forces on the blades, the smearing correction depended on an iterative\nprocess at every time step, which is usually slower, less stable and less\ndeterministic than direct methods. In this work, a non-iterative process is\nproposed and validated. First, we propose a formulation of the non-linear\nlifting line that is equivalent to the ALM with smearing correction, showing\nthat their results are practically identical for a translating wing. Then, by\nlinearizing the lifting line method, the iterative process of the correction is\nsubstituted by the direct solution of a small linear system. No significant\ndifference is observed in the results of the iterative and non-iterative\ncorrections, both in wing and rotor simulations.

We tackle the complexity by training a neural network (NN)\nand accelerate the NN inference using a neural processing unit (NPU). While\nsuch NN accelerators are becoming increasingly widespread on end devices, they\nare so far only used to accelerate user applications. In contrast, we use an\nexisting accelerator on a real platform to accelerate NN-based resource\nmanagement. Our evaluation on a HiKey 970 board with an Arm big.LITTLE CPU and\nan NPU shows significant temperature reductions at a negligible run-time\noverhead, with unseen applications and different cooling than used for\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 08:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

However,\nexisting KD based models usually suffer from the capacity gap issue, resulting\nin the performance of the student network being limited by the teacher network.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel review mechanism\nfollowing KD models, motivated by the review mechanism of human-beings during\nthe study. Thus, the proposed model is dubbed ReviewKD. The proposed model\nconsists of an instruction phase and a review phase, where we firstly exploit a\nwell-trained heavy teacher network to transfer its latent feature to a\nlightweight student network in the instruction phase, then in the review phase\nyield a refined estimate of the density map based on the learned feature\nthrough a review mechanism. The effectiveness of ReviewKD is demonstrated by a\nset of experiments over six benchmark datasets via comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art models. Numerical results show that ReviewKD outperforms\nexisting lightweight models for crowd counting, and can effectively alleviate\nthe capacity gap issue, and particularly has the performance beyond the teacher\nnetwork.

Scanning-based methods achieve a lower\napproximation error at the cost of higher I/O and more time. Sampling-based\nestimation is preferable in applications with a large data volume and a\npermissible error restriction due to its higher scalability.

While they tend to be\nlocated slightly closer than the non-boundary-crossing ones to the CH\nboundaries, nearly 40% (20%) of them in PF (MHD) CHs are not located in the\nboundary regions. The CHs without open field lines are often smaller and less\nunipolar than those with open field lines. The MHD model indicates higher\ntemperature variations along the boundary-crossing field lines than the\nnon-boundary crossing ones. The main difference between the results of the two\nmodels is that the dominant field lines in the PF and MHD CHs are closed and\nopen field lines, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 09:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

It can be observed from recent research that a variety of\ntransformer-based models have shown remarkable results in time-series\nforecasting. However, there are still some issues that limit the ability of\ntransformer-based models on time-series forecasting tasks: (i) learning\ndirectly on raw data is susceptible to noise due to its complex and unstable\nfeature representation; (ii) the self-attention mechanisms pay insufficient\nattention to changing features and temporal dependencies. In order to solve\nthese two problems, we propose a transformer-based differentially reconstructed\nattention model DRAformer. Specifically, DRAformer has the following\ninnovations: (i) learning against differenced sequences, which preserves clear\nand stable sequence features by differencing and highlights the changing\nproperties of sequences; (ii) the reconstructed attention: integrated distance\nattention exhibits sequential distance through a learnable Gaussian kernel,\ndistributed difference attention calculates distribution difference by mapping\nthe difference sequence to the adaptive feature space, and the combination of\nthe two effectively focuses on the sequences with prominent associations; (iii)\nthe reconstructed decoder input, which extracts sequence features by\nintegrating variation information and temporal correlations, thereby obtaining\na more comprehensive sequence representation. Extensive experiments on four\nlarge-scale datasets demonstrate that DRAformer outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 10:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

To\naddress these issues, we establish a new high-quality dataset named\nRealRain-1k, consisting of $1,120$ high-resolution paired clean and rainy\nimages with low- and high-density rain streaks, respectively. Images in\nRealRain-1k are automatically generated from a large number of real-world rainy\nvideo clips through a simple yet effective rain density-controllable filtering\nmethod, and have good properties of high image resolution, background\ndiversity, rain streaks variety, and strict spatial alignment.

Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model,\ncalled the unconstrained feature representation, in which the model is assumed\nto have \"infinite expressivity\" and can map each data point to any arbitrary\nrepresentation. In this work, we propose a more realistic variant of the\nunconstrained feature representation that takes the limited expressivity of the\nnetwork into account. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of\nnoisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse.\nUsing a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one\nmechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the\ntrained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a\nmodification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization\neffect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 13:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 12:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

By defining the connectable node cloud, this novel meshless\nmethod uses the integral of the diffusion term and generalized difference\noperators to derive overdetermined equations of the node control volumes. An\nempirical method of calculating reliable node control volumes and a\ntriangulation-based method to determine the connectable point cloud are\ndeveloped. NCDMM only focuses on the volume of the node control domain rather\nthan the specific shape, so the construction of node control domains is called\nvirtual, which will not increase the computational cost. To our knowledge, this\nis the first time to construct node control volumes in the meshless framework,\nso this novel method is named a node control domains-based meshless method,\nabbreviated as NCDMM, which can also be regarded as an extended finite volume\nmethod (EFVM). Taking two-phase porous flow problems as an example, the NCDMM\ndiscrete schemes meeting local mass conservation are derived by integrating the\ngeneralized finite difference schemes of governing equations on each node\ncontrol domain. Finally, existing commonly used low-order finite volume method\n(FVM) based nonlinear solvers for various porous flow models can be directly\nemployed in the proposed NCDMM, significantly facilitating the general-purpose\napplications of the NCDMM. Four numerical cases are implemented to test the\ncomputational accuracy, efficiency, convergence, and good adaptability to the\ncalculation domain with complex geometry and various boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 13:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 02:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 14:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Finding a good test case that can reveal the potential\nfailure in these trained systems can help to retrain these models to increase\ntheir correctness. For a well-trained model, the occurrence of a failure is\nrare. Consequently, searching these rare scenarios by evaluating each sample in\ninput search space or randomized search would be costly and sometimes\nintractable due to large search space, limited computational resources, and\navailable time. In this paper, we tried to address this challenge of finding\nthese failure scenarios faster than traditional randomized search.

The all-sky Gaia chemical cartography allows a powerful\nand precise chemo-dynamical view of the Milky Way with unprecedented spatial\ncoverage and statistical robustness. First, it reveals the strong vertical\nsymmetry of the Galaxy and the flared structure of the disc. Second, the\nobserved kinematic disturbances of the disc -- seen as phase space correlations\n-- and kinematic or orbital substructures are associated with chemical patterns\nthat favour stars with enhanced metallicities and lower [alpha/Fe] abundance\nratios compared to the median values in the radial distributions. This is\ndetected both for young objects that trace the spiral arms and older\npopulations. Several alpha, iron-peak elements and at least one heavy element\ntrace the thin and thick disc properties in the solar cylinder. Third, young\ndisc stars show a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. Fourth,\nthe largest chemo-dynamical sample of open clusters analysed so far shows a\nsteepening of the radial metallicity gradient with age, which is also observed\nin the young field population. Finally, the Gaia chemical data have the\nrequired coverage and precision to unveil galaxy accretion debris and heated\ndisc stars on halo orbits through their [alpha/Fe] ratio, and to allow the\nstudy of the chemo-dynamical properties of globular clusters. Gaia DR3\nchemo-dynamical diagnostics open new horizons before the era of ground-based\nwide-field spectroscopic surveys. They unveil a complex Milky Way that is the\noutcome of an eventful evolution, shaping it to the present day (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 13:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

This chirality thereby acts as a generalized\nspin-orbit interaction, which leads to the discovery of various chiral\ninteractions between magnetic, phononic, electronic, photonic, and plasmonic\nexcitations in spintronics that mediate the excitation of quasiparticles into a\nsingle direction, leading to phenomena such as chiral spin and phonon pumping,\nchiral spin Seebeck, spin skin, magnonic trap, magnon Doppler, and spin diode\neffects. Intriguing analogies with electric counterparts in the nano-optics and\nplasmonics exist. After a brief review of the concepts of chirality that\ncharacterize the ground state chiral magnetic textures and chirally coupled\nmagnets in spintronics, we turn to the chiral phenomena of excited states. We\npresent a unified electrodynamic picture for dynamical chirality in spintronics\nin terms of generalized spin-orbit interaction and compare it with that in\nnano-optics and plasmonics.

Gaia DR3 contains the parametrisation of RVS data performed by the\nGeneral Stellar Parametriser-spectroscopy, module. Here we describe the\nparametrisation of the first 34 months of RVS observations. GSP-spec estimates\nthe chemo-physical parameters from combined RVS spectra of single stars. The\nmain analysis workflow described here, MatisseGauguin, is based on projection\nand optimisation methods and provides the stellar atmospheric parameters; the\nindividual chemical abundances of N, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, FeI, FeII, Ni, Zr,\nCe and Nd; the differential equivalent width of a cyanogen line; and the\nparameters of a DIB feature. Another workflow, based on an artificial neural\nnetwork, provides a second set of atmospheric parameters that are useful for\nclassification control. We implement a detailed quality flag chain considering\ndifferent error sources. With about 5.6 million stars, the Gaia DR3 GSP-spec\nall-sky catalogue is the largest compilation of stellar chemo-physical\nparameters ever published and the first one from space data. Internal and\nexternal biases have been studied taking into account the implemented flags. In\nsome cases, simple calibrations with low degree polynomials are suggested. The\nhomogeneity and quality of the estimated parameters enables chemo-dynamical\nstudies of Galactic stellar populations, interstellar extinction studies from\nindividual spectra, and clear constraints on stellar evolution models. We\nhighly recommend that users adopt the provided quality flags for scientific\nexploitation . The Gaia DR3 GSP-spec catalogue is a major step in the\nscientific exploration of Milky Way stellar populations, confirming the Gaia\npromise of a new Galactic vision (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Humans have\nevolved a biological perception algorithm capable of driving cars, operating\nmachinery, piloting aircraft, and navigating ships over millions of years.\nAutomating these capabilities for computers is critical for various\napplications, including self-driving cars, augmented reality, and architectural\nsurveying. Near-field visual perception in the context of self-driving cars can\nperceive the environment in a range of $0-10$ meters and 360{\\deg} coverage\naround the vehicle. It is a critical decision-making component in the\ndevelopment of safer automated driving. Recent advances in computer vision and\ndeep learning, in conjunction with high-quality sensors such as cameras and\nLiDARs, have fueled mature visual perception solutions. Until now, far-field\nperception has been the primary focus. Another significant issue is the limited\nprocessing power available for developing real-time applications. Because of\nthis bottleneck, there is frequently a trade-off between performance and\nrun-time efficiency. We concentrate on the following issues in order to address\nthem: 1) Developing near-field perception algorithms with high performance and\nlow computational complexity for various visual perception tasks such as\ngeometric and semantic tasks using convolutional neural networks. 2) Using\nMulti-Task Learning to overcome computational bottlenecks by sharing initial\nconvolutional layers between tasks and developing optimization strategies that\nbalance tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In addition, the\ndistributed sensors, energy generators and storage devices, and networking have\nled to a huge increase in attack vectors that make the grid vulnerable to a\nvariety of attacks. The interconnection between computational and physical\ncomponents through a largely open, IP-based communication network enables an\nattacker to cause physical damage through remote cyber-attacks or attack on\nsoftware-controlled grid operations via physical- or cyber-attacks.

The analysis is presented for state-based\nperidynamic operators for isotropic homogeneous media in any spatial dimension.\nWe provide explicit formulas for the eigenvalues in terms of the space\ndimension, the nonlocal parameters, and the material properties.\n  The approach we follow is based on the Fourier multiplier analysis developed\nfor the nonlocal Laplacian. The Fourier multipliers of linear peridynamic\noperators are second-order tensor fields, which are given through integral\nrepresentations. It is shown that the eigenvalues of the peridynamic operators\ncan be derived directly from the eigenvalues of the Fourier multiplier tensors.\n  We reveal a simple structure for the Fourier multipliers in terms of\nhypergeometric functions, which allows for providing integral representations\nas well as hypergeometric representations of the eigenvalues. These\nrepresentations are utilized to show the convergence of the eigenvalues of\nlinear peridynamics to the eigenvalues of the Navier operator of linear\nelasticity in the limit of vanishing nonlocality. Moreover, the hypergeometric\nrepresentation of the eigenvalues is utilized to compute the spectrum of linear\nperidynamic operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 20:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) can, for instance, be used\nto perform bathymetry and environmental data collection tasks to ensure\nunder-keel clearance and to monitor the quality of the water. Similarly,\nRemotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) can be deployed to inspect ship hulls and\ntypical port infrastructure elements, such as quay and sheet pilling walls. In\nthis paper we present the complete system deployed for the small-scale\ndemonstrations of the Robotic Vessels as-a-Service (RoboVaaS) project, which\nintroduces an on-demand service-based cloud system that dispatches Unmanned\nVehicles (UVs) capable of performing the required service either autonomously\nor piloted.

Most existing fake news detection\nalgorithms focus on building supervised training models on a large amount of\nmanually labeled data, which is expensive to acquire or often unavailable. In\nthis work, we propose a novel label noise-resistant mean teaching approach\n(LNMT) for weakly supervised fake news detection. LNMT leverages unlabeled news\nand feedback comments of users to enlarge the amount of training data and\nfacilitates model training by generating refined labels as weak supervision.\nSpecifically, LNMT automatically assigns initial weak labels to unlabeled\nsamples based on semantic correlation and emotional association between news\ncontent and the comments. Moreover, in order to suppress the noises in weak\nlabels, LNMT establishes a mean teacher framework equipped with label\npropagation and label reliability estimation. The framework measures a weak\nlabel similarity matrix between the teacher and student networks, and\npropagates different valuable weak label information to refine the weak labels.\nMeanwhile, it exploits the consistency between the output class likelihood\nvectors of the two networks to evaluate the reliability of the weak labels and\nincorporates the reliability into model optimization to alleviate the negative\neffect of noisy weak labels. Extensive experiments show the superior\nperformance of LNMT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 16:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-27"}

In this work, we consider the\nwealth of antibody inhibition data against variants of the influenza virus. Due\nto this viru's genetic diversity and evolvability, the variants examined in one\nstudy will often have little-to-no overlap with other studies, making it\ndifficult to discern common patterns or unify datasets for further analysis. To\nthat end, we develop a computational framework that predicts how an antibody or\nserum would inhibit any variant from any other study. We use this framework to\ngreatly expand seven influenza datasets utilizing hemagglutination inhibition,\nvalidating our method upon 200,000 existing measurements and predicting\n2,000,000 new values along with their uncertainties. With these new values, we\nquantify the transferability between seven vaccination and infection studies in\nhumans and ferrets, show that the serum potency is negatively correlated with\nbreadth, and present a tool for pandemic preparedness. This data-driven\napproach does not require any information beyond each virus's name and\nmeasurements, and even datasets with as few as 5 viruses can be expanded,\nmaking this approach widely applicable. Future influenza studies using\nhemagglutination inhibition can directly utilize our curated datasets to\npredict newly measured antibody responses against ~80 H3N2 influenza viruses\nfrom 1968-2011, whereas immunological studies utilizing other viruses or a\ndifferent assay only need a single partially-overlapping dataset to extend\ntheir work. In essence, this approach enables a shift in perspective when\nanalyzing data from \"what you see is what you get\" into \"what anyone sees is\nwhat everyone gets.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 20:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2022 12:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-01"}
