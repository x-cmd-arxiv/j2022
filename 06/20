Typical pasta\nstructures (droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble) are obtained, which form\nvarious crystalline configurations. The properties of those nuclear pastas are\nexamined in a three-dimensional geometry with reflection symmetry, where the\noptimum lattice constants are fixed by reproducing the droplet/bubble density\nthat minimizes the free energy adopting spherical or cylindrical approximations\nfor Wigner-Seitz cells. It is found that different crystalline structures can\nevolve into each other via volume conserving deformations. For fixed densities\nand temperatures, the differences of the free energies per baryon of nuclear\npasta in various shapes and lattice structures are typically on the order of\ntens of keV, suggesting the possible coexistence of those structures. As\ntemperature increases, the thermodynamic fluctuations are expected to disrupt\nthe long-range ordering in nuclear pasta structures. We then estimate the\ncritical conditions for nuclear pasta to become disordered and behave like\nliquid, which are found to be sensitive to the densities, temperatures, proton\nfractions, and nuclear shapes. If we further increase temperature, eventually\nthe nonuniform structures of nuclear pasta become unstable and are converted\ninto uniform nuclear matter. The phase diagrams of nuclear matter are then\nestimated, which should be useful for understanding the evolutions of neutron\nstars, supernova dynamics, and binary neutron star mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 16:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 11:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Though ANN2NN provides a\nlow-cost way to train SNNs, it requires many inference steps to mimic the\nwell-trained ANN for good performance. In this paper, we propose a SNN-to-ANN\n(SNN2ANN) framework to train the SNN in a fast and memory-efficient way.

Secondly, the spiking mapping units ensure that the\nactivation values of the ANN are the spiking features. As a result, the\nclassification error of the SNN can be optimized by training the ANN branch.\nBesides, we design an adaptive threshold adjustment (ATA) algorithm to address\nthe noisy spike problem.

For the purpose we analyse the direct polarized\nimages for different inclination angles, the strongly lensed indirect images,\nand the polarized radiation which reaches the asymptotic observer through the\nwormhole throat, and compare to the Schwarzschild black hole. For small\ninclination angles the two types of compact objects lead to a very similar\npolarization pattern of the direct images. More significant distinctions are\nobserved for the strongly lensed indirect images, where the polarization\nintensity in the wormhole spacetimes can grow up to an order of magnitude\ncompared to the Schwarzschild black hole. Detecting radiation from the region\nacross the wormhole throat leads to the formation of an additional structure of\nring images with distinct polarization properties. The twist of the\npolarization vector around the ring is less pronounced, thus modifying the\npolarization pattern, and the polarization intensity can increase with an order\nof magnitude compared to the radiation from our universe. Thus, while it could\nbe difficult to distinguish wormhole spacetimes by their direct polarized\nimages, the strongly lensed images and the polarization of the radiation\nthrough the wormhole throat provide characteristic signatures which can serve\nas probes for horizonless objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 17:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

We achieve\nthis by learning a single search policy over a predefined set of semantics\npreserving text alterations, on many texts. This formulation is universal in\nthat the policy is successful in finding adversarial examples on new texts\nefficiently. Our approach uses text perturbations which were extensively shown\nto produce natural attacks in the non-universal setup (specific synonym\nreplacements).

We\nalso analyse the situation in the non-simply laced cases, where a new Garside\nstructure is discovered.\n  Furthermore, we obtain a complete classification of whether the interval\ngroup we consider is isomorphic or not to the related Artin group.

In contrast to the fully\ndecentralized manner of guaranteeing privacy in the local model, the shuffle\nmodel requires a central, trusted shuffler. To avoid this central shuffler,\nrecent work of Liew et al. (2022) proposes shuffling locally randomized data in\na decentralized manner, via random walks on the communication network\nconstituted by the clients. The privacy amplification bound it thus provides\ndepends on the topology of the underlying communication network, even for\ninfinitely long random walks. It does not match the state-of-the-art privacy\namplification bound for the shuffle model (Feldman et al., 2021).\n  In this work, we prove that the output of~$n$ clients' data, each perturbed\nby an ${\\epsilon}_0$-local randomizer, and shuffled by random walks with a\nlogarithmic number of steps, is $( {O} ( (1 - e^{-\\epsilon_0} ) \\sqrt{ (\ne^{\\epsilon_0} / n ) \\ln (1 / \\delta ) } ), O(\\delta) )$-differentially\nprivate. Importantly, this bound is independent of the topology of the\ncommunication network, and asymptotically closes the gap between the privacy\namplification bounds for the network shuffle model (Liew et al., 2022) and the\nshuffle model (Feldman et al., 2021). Our proof is based on a reduction to the\nshuffle model, and an analysis of the distribution of random walks of finite\nlength. Building on this, we further show that if each client is sampled\nindependently with probability~$p$, the privacy guarantee of the network\nshuffle model can be further improved to $( {O} ( (1 - e^{-\\epsilon_0} )\n\\sqrt{p ( e^{\\epsilon_0} / n ) \\ln (1 / \\delta ) } ) , O(\\delta) )$.\nImportantly, the subsampling is also performed in a fully decentralized manner\nthat does not require a trusted central entity; compared with related bounds in\nprior work, our bound is stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Here we propose a power analysis procedure that\naddresses these three challenges by: using for simulation a Gaussian copula\nmodel with factor analytical structure, fitted to pilot data; assuming a common\neffect size across all taxa, but applied in different directions according to\nexpert opinion (to \"increaser\", \"decreaser\" or \"no effect\" taxa); using a\ncritical value approach to estimate power, which reduces computation time by a\nfactor of 500 with little loss of accuracy. 3.

We show how the global predictive posterior can be\napproximated using client predictive posteriors. This is unlike other works\nwhich aggregate the local model space posteriors into the global model space\nposterior, and are susceptible to high approximation errors due to the\nposterior's high dimensional multimodal nature. In contrast, our method\nperforms the aggregation on the predictive posteriors, which are typically\neasier to approximate owing to the low-dimensionality of the output space. We\npresent an algorithm based on this idea, which performs MCMC sampling at each\nclient to obtain an estimate of the local posterior, and then aggregates these\nin one round to obtain a global ensemble model. Through empirical evaluation on\nseveral classification and regression tasks, we show that despite using one\nround of communication, the method is competitive with other FL techniques, and\noutperforms them on heterogeneous settings.

Revealing\nthe evolutionary mechanism of the network is essential for link prediction, and\nhow to effectively utilize the historical information for temporal links and\nefficiently extract the high-order patterns of network structure remains a\nvital challenge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel\ntemporal link prediction model with adjusted sigmoid function and 2-simplex\nstructure (TLPSS). The adjusted sigmoid decay mode takes the active, decay and\nstable states of edges into account, which properly fits the life cycle of\ninformation.

They have been extensively studied\nin the context of resonators with purely cubic (Kerr-type) nonlinearity that\nare externally-driven with a monochromatic continuous wave laser -- in such\nsystems, the solitons manifest themselves as unique attractors whose carrier\nfrequency coincides with that of the external driving field. Recent experiments\nhave, however, shown that a qualitatively different type of temporal CS can\narise via parametric down-conversion in resonators with simultaneous quadratic\nand cubic nonlinearity. In contrast to conventional CSs in pure-Kerr\nresonators, these \\emph{parametrically-driven cavity solitons} come in two\ndifferent flavours with opposite phases, and they are spectrally centred at\nhalf of the frequency of the driving field. Here, we theoretically and\nnumerically show that, under conditions of bichromatic driving, such\nparametrically-driven CSs can also arise in dispersive resonators with pure\nKerr nonlinearity. In this case, the solitons arise through parametric\nfour-wave mixing, come with two distinct phases, and have a carrier frequency\nin between the two external driving fields.

While actions and action time intervals are\ninterdependent, it is challenging to integrate them because they have different\nnatures: time and action. To overcome this challenge, we propose a unified\nmethod that analyzes user actions with intertemporal information (time\ninterval). We simultaneously embed the user's action sequence and its time\nintervals to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the action along with\nintertemporal information. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method\nenables us to characterize user actions in terms of temporal context, using\nthree real-world data sets.

The sample consists of 43 optically selected galaxy clusters\nwith a richness $>40$ in $0.16<z<0.89$. We systematically analyzed the X-ray\nimages and spectra using the eROSITA data.

We studied the\nluminosity-temperature and mass-luminosity relations based on eROSITA X-ray\nspectra and HSC weak-lensing data analyses. Based on the these measurements,\nthe fraction of relaxed clusters is $2(<39)$%, which is smaller than that of\nthe X-ray-selected cluster samples.

The effect of the stimulated emissions\non the line profiles is also investigated. Methods. Our previous nl-model for\ncalculating level populations of hydrogen atoms and hydrogen recombination\nlines is improved. The effects of line and continuum radiation fields on the\nlevel populations are considered in the improved model. By using this method\nthe properties of simulated hydrogen recombination lines and level populations\nare used in analyses. Results. The simulations show that hydrogen radio\nrecombination lines are often emitted from the energy level with an inverted\npopulation. The widths of Hn$\\alpha$ lines can be significantly narrowed by\nstrong stimulated emissions to be even less than 10 km s$^{-1}$. The\namplification of hydrogen recombination lines is more affected by the line\noptical depth than by the total optical depth.

While detecting 2D human-object\ninteraction (HOI) and reconstructing 3D human pose and shape (HPS) have enjoyed\nsignificant progress, reasoning about 3D human-scene contact from a single\nimage is still challenging. Existing HSC detection methods consider only a few\ntypes of predefined contact, often reduce body and scene to a small number of\nprimitives, and even overlook image evidence. To predict human-scene contact\nfrom a single image, we address the limitations above from both data and\nalgorithmic perspectives.

A key feature of RICH is that it also contains accurate\nvertex-level contact labels on the body. Using RICH, we train a network that\npredicts dense body-scene contacts from a single RGB image. Our key insight is\nthat regions in contact are always occluded so the network needs the ability to\nexplore the whole image for evidence. We use a transformer to learn such\nnon-local relationships and propose a new Body-Scene contact TRansfOrmer\n(BSTRO). Very few methods explore 3D contact; those that do focus on the feet\nonly, detect foot contact as a post-processing step, or infer contact from body\npose without looking at the scene.

By reducing the latency of\nindividual GPUs and the overall inference process for large-scale language\nmodels, LUT-GEMM provides significant performance improvements in inference.\nThe impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios\nthrough low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations, which\ndecreases the number of required GPUs.

In such\ncases, the vortices either accelerate and leave the cylinder behind or, more\ninterestingly, leave their leading positions and are attracted towards the\ntrailing positions. In other words, the cylinder in such cases threads through\nthe leading vortices, overtakes them and the vortices are observed to trail the\ncylinder again. The symmetry of the inviscid dynamics about the perpendicular\naxis is thus broken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 03:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Due to the importance of\nNavier-Stokes equations, the development on efficient numerical schemes is\nimportant for both science and engineer. Recently, with the development of AI\ntechniques, several approaches have been designed to integrate deep neural\nnetworks in simulating and inferring the fluid dynamics governed by\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which can accelerate the simulation or\ninferring process in a mesh-free and differentiable way.

We develop two types of\ncontrols to accomplish this task. One works for small damping and is based on\nlinearizing the undamped system by a suitable preliminary feedback control. The\nother works for large damping. In the steady state, the resulting closed-loop\nsystem describes a harmonically driven damped pendulum (a simple system known\nfor its complex behavior), including chaotic motion for some parameter values.\nTo address such complexities, we build free parameters into the controls, then\nadjust them based on simulations to avoid chaos and achieve regular\noscillations that are seen on playgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 05:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, called Domain Adaptation with Structured\nKnowledge (DASK), to enhance domain adaptation by exploiting word-level\nsemantic relationships. DASK first builds a knowledge graph to capture the\nrelationship between pivot terms (domain-independent words) and non-pivot terms\nin the target domain. Then during training, DASK injects pivot-related\nknowledge graph information into source domain texts. For the downstream task,\nthese knowledge-injected texts are fed into a BERT variant capable of\nprocessing knowledge-injected textual data. Thanks to the knowledge injection,\nour model learns domain-invariant features for non-pivots according to their\nrelationships with pivots. DASK ensures the pivots to have domain-invariant\nbehaviors by dynamically inferring via the polarity scores of candidate pivots\nduring training with pseudo-labels.

This paper proposes a new\nmathematical paradigm to analyze discrete-time MFGs without any of these\nrestrictions.\n  The key idea is to reformulate the problem of finding NE solutions in MFGs as\nsolving an equivalent optimization problem, called MF-OMO, with bounded\nvariables and trivial convex constraints. It is built on the classical work of\nreformulating a Markov decision process as a linear program, and by adding the\nconsistency constraint for MFGs in terms of occupation measures, and by\nexploiting the complementarity structure of the linear program.\n  This equivalence framework enables finding multiple (and possibly all) NE\nsolutions of MFGs by standard algorithms such as projected gradient descent,\nand with convergence guarantees under appropriate conditions. In particular,\nanalyzing MFGs with linear rewards and with mean-field independent dynamics is\nreduced to solving a finite number of linear programs, hence solvable in finite\ntime.\n  This optimization reformulation of MFGs can be extended to variants of MFGs\nsuch as personalized MFGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 07:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 23:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Recent development of coupled Colloidal\nQuantum Dots Molecules (CQDM), where two core-shell CQDs are fused to form two\nemission centers in close proximity, allows to explore how charge carriers in\none CQD affect the charge carriers in the other CQD. Cryogenic single particle\nspectroscopy reveals that while CQD monomers manifest a simple emission\nspectrum comprising a main emission peak with well-defined phonon sidebands,\nCQDMs exhibit a complex spectrum with multiple peaks that are not all spaced\naccording to the known phonon frequencies. Based on complementary emission\npolarization and time-resolved analysis, this is assigned to fluorescence of\nthe two coupled emission centers. Moreover, the complex peak structure shows\ncorrelated spectral diffusion indicative of the coupling between the two\nemission centers. Utilizing Schrodinger-Poisson self-consistent calculations,\nwe directly map the spectral behavior, alternating between neutral and charged\nstates of the CQDM. Spectral shifts related to electrostatic interaction\nbetween a charged emission center and the second emission center are thus fully\nmapped. Furthermore, effects of moving surface charges are identified, whereby\nthe emission center proximal to the charge shows larger shifts. Instances where\nthe two emission centers are negatively charged simultaneously are also\nidentified. Such detailed mapping of charging states is enabled by the coupling\nwithin the CQDM and its anisotropic structure.

However, most existing stochastic\nexploration approaches either explore new actions heuristically regardless of\nQ-values or inevitably introduce bias into the learning process to couple the\nsampling with Q-values. In this paper, we propose a novel preference-guided\n$\\epsilon$-greedy exploration algorithm that can efficiently learn the action\ndistribution in line with the landscape of Q-values for DQN without introducing\nadditional bias. Specifically, we design a dual architecture consisting of two\nbranches, one of which is a copy of DQN, namely the Q-branch. The other branch,\nwhich we call the preference branch, learns the action preference that the DQN\nimplicit follows. We theoretically prove that the policy improvement theorem\nholds for the preference-guided $\\epsilon$-greedy policy and experimentally\nshow that the inferred action preference distribution aligns with the landscape\nof corresponding Q-values. Consequently, preference-guided $\\epsilon$-greedy\nexploration motivates the DQN agent to take diverse actions, i.e., actions with\nlarger Q-values can be sampled more frequently whereas actions with smaller\nQ-values still have a chance to be explored, thus encouraging the exploration.\nWe assess the proposed method with four well-known DQN variants in nine\ndifferent environments.

Despite being commonly used, composite endpoints entail\nchallenges in designing and interpreting results. Given that the components may\nbe of different relevance and have different effect sizes, the choice of\ncomponents must be made carefully. Especially, sample size calculations for\ncomposite binary endpoints depend not only on the anticipated effect sizes and\nevent probabilities of the composite components, but also on the correlation\nbetween them. However, information on the correlation between endpoints is\nusually not reported in the literature which can be an obstacle for planning of\nfuture sound trial design. We consider two-arm randomized controlled trials\nwith a primary composite binary endpoint and an endpoint that consists only of\nthe clinically more important component of the composite endpoint.

We investigate the statistical power\nand significance level under the proposed design through simulations. We show\nthat the adaptive design is equally or more powerful than designs without\nadaptive modification on the primary endpoint. The targeted power is achieved\neven if the correlation is misspecified while maintaining the type 1 error.

These are continuous and ubiquitous across broad regions of the corona,\nincluding the quiet Sun. The aim of this paper is to present an improved,\nefficient method to create velocity vector field maps, based on the direction\nand magnitude of the PD as observed in time series of extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nimages. The method is presented here for use with the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA)/Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) EUV channels, and takes as\ninput \\app2 hours of images at the highest 12s cadence. Data from a region near\ndisk center is extracted, and a process called time normalization applied to\nthe co-aligned data. Following noise reduction using \\atrous\\ decomposition,\nthe PD are effectively revealed. A modified Lucas Kanade algorithm is then used\nto map the velocity field. The method described here runs comfortably on a\ndesktop computer in a few minutes, and offers an order of magnitude improvement\nin efficiency compared to a previous implementation. Applied to a region of the\nquiet Sun, we find that the velocity field describes a mosaic of cells of\ncoherent outwardly-diverging PD flows, of typical size 50 to 100\\arcsec\\ (36 to\n72Mm). The flows originate from points and narrow corridors in the cell\ncentres, and end in the narrow boundaries between cells. Visual comparison with\nultraviolet AIA images shows that the flow sources are correlated with the\nbright photospheric supergranular network boundaries. Assuming that the PD\nfollow the local magnetic field, the velocity flow field is a proxy for the\nplane-of-sky distribution of the coronal magnetic field, and therefore the maps\noffer a unique insight into the topology of the corona. These are particularly\nvaluable for quiet Sun regions where the appearance of structures in EUV images\nis hard to interpret.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 08:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Deep learning models had proven to be the\ngreatest solutions in different fields nowadays, so we believe they could be\ntried and applied to the prediction problem in baseball. Hence, the predicting\nabilities of deep learning models are set to be our research problem in this\npaper. As a beginning, we select numbers of home runs as the target because it\nis one of the most critical indexes to understand the power and the talent of\nbaseball hitters. Moreover, we use the sequential model Long Short-Term Memory\nas our main method to solve the home run prediction problem in Major League\nBaseball. We compare models' ability with several machine learning models and a\nwidely used baseball projection system, sZymborski Projection System. Our\nresults show that Long Short-Term Memory has better performance than others and\nhas the ability to make more exact predictions.

This has become common in oncology, impacting\nthe approval pathway of health technology assessment agencies. We aimed to\nprovide some guidance for indirect comparison to external controls to improve\nthe level of evidence following such uncontrolled designs. METHODS We used the\nillustrative example of blinatumomab, a bispecific antibody for the treatment\nof B-cell ALL in complete remission (CR) with persistent minimal residual\ndisease (MRD). Its approval relied on a single-arm trial conducted in 86 adults\nwith B-cell ALL in CR, with undetectable MRD after one cycle as the main\nendpoint. To maximize the validity of indirect comparisons, a 3-step process\nfor incorporating external control data to such single-arm trial data is\nproposed and detailed, with emphasis on the example. RESULTS The first step\nincludes the definition of estimand, i.e. the treatment effect reflecting the\nclinical question. The second step relies on the adequate selection of external\ncontrols, from previous RCT or real-world data (RWD) obtained from patient\ncohort, registries, or electronic patient files. The third step consists in\nchosing the statistical approach targeting the treatment effect of interest,\neither in the whole population or restricted to the single-arm trial or the\nexternal controls, and depending on the available individual-level or\naggregrated external data. CONCLUSION Validity of treatment effect derived from\nindirect comparisons heavily depends on carefull methodological considerations\nthat are included in the proposed 3-step procedure. Because the level of\nevidence of a well conducted RCT cannot be guaranteed, post-market\nauthorization evaluation is even more important than in standard settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 09:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

A\nmechanism for such damping is proposed by a combination of inter-stellar\ngravitational interactions, and interactions with the Oort clouds and exo-Oort\nobjects associated with each star. Analysis of the gravitational interactions\nbetween two stars is a three-body problem, because the stars are also in orbit\nround the large virtual mass of the galaxy. These mechanisms may produce rapid\ndamping of large perturbations within a time period that is short on the scale\nof observational look-back time, but long on the scale of the disk rotational\nperiod for stars with small perturbations.

In the context exoplanetary systems, therefore,\nthe prevalence of short-lived radioisotopes is key to interpreting the observed\nbulk volatile budget and atmospheric diversity among low-mass exoplanets. White\ndwarfs that have accreted planetary material provide a unique means to infer\nthe frequency of iron core formation in extrasolar planetesimals, and hence the\nubiquity of planetary systems forming with high short-lived radioisotope\nabundances.

This\nextra freedom gives a new, richer notion of joint systems that can be applied\nto categorical formulations of spacetime. Whereas previous formulations have\nrelied on partial monoidal structure that is only defined on pairs of\nindependent (i.e. spacelike separated) systems, here we give a concrete\nformulation of spacetime where the notion of a joint system is defined for any\npair of systems as a presheaf.

In a\ntypical setting, the classification loss forces the semantic segmentation model\nto greedily learn the representations that capture inter-class variations in\norder to determine the decision (class) boundary. Due to the domain shift, this\ndecision boundary is unaligned in the target domain, resulting in noisy pseudo\nlabels adversely affecting self-supervised domain adaptation. To overcome this\nlimitation, along with capturing inter-class variation, we capture pixel-level\nintra-class variations through class-aware multi-modal distribution learning\n(MMDL). Thus, the information necessary for capturing the intra-class\nvariations is explicitly disentangled from the information necessary for\ninter-class discrimination. Features captured thus are much more informative,\nresulting in pseudo-labels with low noise. This disentanglement allows us to\nperform separate alignments in discriminative space and multi-modal\ndistribution space, using cross-entropy based self-learning for the former.

Predicting the lifestyle of phages helps\ndecipher their interactions with their bacterial hosts, aiding phages'\napplications in fields such as phage therapy. Because experimental methods for\nannotating the lifestyle of phages cannot keep pace with the fast accumulation\nof sequenced phages, computational method for predicting phages' lifestyles has\nbecome an attractive alternative. Despite some promising results, computational\nlifestyle prediction remains difficult because of the limited known annotations\nand the sheer amount of sequenced phage contigs assembled from metagenomic\ndata. In particular, most of the existing tools cannot precisely predict\nphages' lifestyles for short contigs. In this work, we develop PhaTYP (Phage\nTYPe prediction tool) to improve the accuracy of lifestyle prediction on short\ncontigs. We design two different training tasks, self-supervised and\nfine-tuning tasks, to overcome lifestyle prediction difficulties. We rigorously\ntested and compared PhaTYP with four state-of-the-art methods: DeePhage,\nPHACTS, PhagePred, and BACPHLIP. The experimental results show that PhaTYP\noutperforms all these methods and achieves more stable performance on short\ncontigs.

The optically red to near\ninfra-red emission (`red' component) of AT2017gfo was readily explained as\nproduced by the decay of newly created nuclei produced by rapid neutron capture\n(a kilonova). However, the ultra-violet to optically blue emission (`blue'\ncomponent) that was dominant at early times (up to 1.5 days) received no\nconsensus regarding its driving physics. Among many explanations, two leading\ncontenders are kilonova radiation from a lanthanide-poor ejecta component or\nshock interaction (cocoon emission). In this work, we simulate AT2017gfo-like\nlight curves and perform a Bayesian analysis to study whether an ultra-violet\nsatellite capable of rapid gravitational wave follow-up, could distinguish\nbetween physical processes driving the early `blue' component. We find that a\nDorado-like ultra-violet satellite, with a 50 sq. deg. field of view and a\nlimiting magnitude (AB) of 20.5 for a 10 minute exposure is able to distinguish\nradiation components up to at least 160 Mpc if data collection starts within\n3.2 or 5.2 hours for two possible AT2017gfo-like light curve scenarios. We also\nstudy the degree to which parameters can be constrained with the obtained\nphotometry. We find that, while ultra-violet data alone constrains parameters\ngoverning the outer ejecta properties, the combination of both ground-based\noptical and space-based ultra-violet data allows for tight constraints for all\nbut one parameter of the kilonova model up to 160 Mpc. These results imply that\nan ultra-violet mission like Dorado would provide unique insights into the\nearly evolution of the post-merger system and its driving emission physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 10:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Although undetected in\nindividual images, Phaethon was visible in stacks combined from the same\nperihelion observations, yet only at small ($\\lesssim$30\\deg) but not large\n($\\gtrsim$150\\deg) phase angles. The observations are in line with the\ncontribution from a bare nucleus, thereby seriously contradicting the\ninterpretation based on HI-1 observations that attributes the perihelion\nactivity to the ejection of \\micron-sized dust. We obtained an upper limit to\nthe effective cross-section of \\micron-sized dust to be $\\lesssim \\! 10^{5}$\nm$^{2}$, at least three orders of magnitude smaller than earlier estimates\nbased on HI-1 data. On the contrary, the COR2 observations cannot rule out the\nexistence of mm-sized or larger debris around Phaethon. However, the fact that\nno postperihelion debris tail has ever been detected for Phaethon suggests the\nunimportance of such dust in the perihelion activity. We thus conclude that the\nperihelion activity of Phaethon is highly unlikely relevant to the ejection of\ndust. Rather, we deduce that the activity is associated with gas emissions,\npossibly Fe I and/or Na D lines. To verify our conjecture and to fully\nunderstand the perihelion activity of Phaethon, more observations at small\nheliocentric distances are desired.

For each HII region, we compute the pressure of ionised gas ($P_{\\rm\nion}$) and the direct radiation pressure ($P_{\\rm dir}$) acting in the region,\nand investigate how they vary with galactocentric distance, with the physical\nproperties of the region, and with the pressure of the galactic environment\n($P_\\mathrm{DE}$).

We find that $P_{\\rm ion}$ dominates over $P_{\\rm\ndir}$ by at least a factor of 10 on average over the disk. Both pressure terms\nare strongly enhanced and become almost comparable in the central starburst\nregion. In the disk ($R \\geq 0.15~R_e$), we observe that $P_{\\rm dir}$ stays\napproximately constant with galactocentric distance. $P_{\\rm dir}$ is\npositively correlated with an increase in radiation field strength (linked to\nthe negative metallicity gradient in the galaxy), while it decreases in low\nextinction regions. $P_{\\rm ion}$ decreases constantly for increasing\ngalactocentric distances. In general, we observe that HII regions near the\ncenter are underpressured with respect to their surroundings, whereas regions\nin the disk are overpressured and hence expanding. We find that regions hosting\nyounger clusters or having more mass in young star clusters have a higher\ninternal pressure, indicating that clustered star formation is likely playing a\ndominant role in setting the pressure.

Yet, there\nare few success stories when it comes to deploying those algorithms to\nreal-world scenarios. One of the reasons is the lack of guarantees when dealing\nwith and avoiding unsafe states, a fundamental requirement in critical control\nengineering systems. In this paper, we introduce Guided Safe Shooting (GuSS), a\nmodel-based RL approach that can learn to control systems with minimal\nviolations of the safety constraints. The model is learned on the data\ncollected during the operation of the system in an iterated batch fashion, and\nis then used to plan for the best action to perform at each time step. We\npropose three different safe planners, one based on a simple random shooting\nstrategy and two based on MAP-Elites, a more advanced divergent-search\nalgorithm. Experiments show that these planners help the learning agent avoid\nunsafe situations while maximally exploring the state space, a necessary aspect\nwhen learning an accurate model of the system. Furthermore, compared to\nmodel-free approaches, learning a model allows GuSS reducing the number of\ninteractions with the real-system while still reaching high rewards, a\nfundamental requirement when handling engineering systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 12:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

In this paper, a joint angle and delay estimation (JADE)\nscheme is designed for 5G picocell base stations (gNBs) which addresses two\ncrucial issues to make it both effective and efficient in realistic indoor\nenvironments. Firstly, the direction-dependence of the array modeling error for\npicocell gNB as well as its impact on JADE is revealed. This error is mitigated\nby fitting the array response measurements to a vector-valued function and\npre-calibrating the ideal steering-vector with the fitted function. Secondly,\nbased on the deployment reality that 5G picocell gNBs only have a small-scale\nantenna array but have a large signal bandwidth, the proposed scheme decouples\nthe estimation of time-of-arrival (TOA) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) to\nreduce the huge complexity induced by two-dimensional joint processing.

By further exploiting a dimension-reducing\npre-processing module and accelerating spectrum computing by fast Fourier\ntransforms, an efficient implementation is achieved for real-time JADE.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in\nterms of DOA estimation accuracy.

To achieve a high-accuracy delay estimation, a\nnumber of multiband-based algorithms have been proposed recently, which exploit\nthe channel state information (CSI) measurements over multiple non-contiguous\nfrequency bands. However, to the best of our knowledge, there still lacks an\nefficient scheme that fully exploits the multiband gains when the phase\ndistortion factors caused by hardware imperfections are considered, due to that\nthe associated multi-parameter estimation problem contains many local optimums\nand the existing algorithms can easily get stuck in a \"bad\" local optimum. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel two-stage global estimation (TSGE)\nscheme for multiband delay estimation. In the coarse stage, we exploit the\ngroup sparsity structure of the multiband channel and propose a Turbo Bayesian\ninference (Turbo-BI) algorithm to achieve a good initial delay estimation based\non a coarse signal model, which is transformed from the original multiband\nsignal model by absorbing the carrier frequency terms. The estimation problem\nderived from the coarse signal model contains less local optimums and thus a\nmore stable estimation can be achieved than directly using the original signal\nmodel. Then in the refined stage, with the help of coarse estimation results to\nnarrow down the search range, we perform a global delay estimation using a\nparticle swarm optimization-least square (PSO-LS) algorithm based on a refined\nmultiband signal model to exploit the multiband gains to further improve the\nestimation accuracy.

Clinical variables were recorded.\nFollowing segmentation of the lung field, a total of 26 texture features were\nextracted using a lattice-based approach (TM model).

Since the target domain usually lacks labeled data, and domain\nshifts exist at acoustic and linguistic levels, it is challenging to perform\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for ASR. Previous work has shown that\nself-supervised learning (SSL) or pseudo-labeling (PL) is effective in UDA by\nexploiting the self-supervisions of unlabeled data. However, these\nself-supervisions also face performance degradation in mismatched domain\ndistributions, which previous work fails to address. This work presents a\nsystematic UDA framework to fully utilize the unlabeled data with\nself-supervision in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. On the one hand,\nwe apply continued pre-training and data replay techniques to mitigate the\ndomain mismatch of the SSL pre-trained model. On the other hand, we propose a\ndomain-adaptive fine-tuning approach based on the PL technique with three\nunique modifications: Firstly, we design a dual-branch PL method to decrease\nthe sensitivity to the erroneous pseudo-labels; Secondly, we devise an\nuncertainty-aware confidence filtering strategy to improve pseudo-label\ncorrectness; Thirdly, we introduce a two-step PL approach to incorporate target\ndomain linguistic knowledge, thus generating more accurate target domain\npseudo-labels. Experimental results on various cross-domain scenarios\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively boost the cross-domain\nperformance and significantly outperform previous approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 14:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

How these processes\ncontribute to the observables of the reaction is investigated. The distorted\nwave impulse approximation is extended in twofold. The elementary processes of\nthe ($p,pd$), i.e., the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering and $d(p,p)pn$ reaction, are\ndescribed with an impulse picture employing a nucleon-nucleon effective\ninteraction. The three-body scattering waves in the final state of the ($p,pd$)\nreaction are calculated with the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method.\nThe triple differential cross section (TDX) of the ($p,pd$) reaction is\ncalculated with the new model.

Several fields of research are\nprone to small imbalanced tabular data. Supervised Machine Learning on such\ndata is often difficult due to class imbalance. Synthetic data generation,\ni.e., oversampling, is a common remedy used to improve classifier performance.\nState-of-the-art linear interpolation approaches, such as LoRAS and ProWRAS can\nbe used to generate synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority\nclass to improve classifier performance in such cases. Deep generative networks\nare common deep learning approaches for synthetic sample generation, widely\nused for synthetic image generation. However, their scope on synthetic tabular\ndata generation in the context of imbalanced classification is not adequately\nexplored. In this article, we show that existing deep generative models perform\npoorly compared to linear interpolation based approaches for imbalanced\nclassification problems on smaller tabular datasets. To overcome this, we\npropose a deep generative model, ConvGeN that combines the idea of convex space\nlearning with deep generative models.

The nature of the early martian\nclimate is still somewhat mysterious, but evidence for one or more early oceans\nimplies long-lasting periods of habitability. The primary evidence supporting\nearly oceans is a set of proposed remnant shorelines circling large fractions\nof the planet. The features are thought to be older than 3.6 Ga and possibly as\nold as 4 Ga, which would make them some of the oldest large-scale features\nstill identifiable on the surface of Mars. One question that has not been\nthoroughly addressed, however, is whether shorelines this old could survive\nmodification and destruction processes like impact craters, tectonics,\nvolcanism, and hydrology in recognizable form. Here we address one of these\nprocesses -- impact cratering -- in detail. We use standard crater counting age\nmodels to generate synthetic, global populations of craters and intersect them\nwith hypothetical shorelines, tracking portions of the shoreline that are\ndirectly impacted. The oldest shorelines (>= 4 Ga) are at least 70 % destroyed\nby direct impacts. Shorelines of any age >3.6 Ga are dissected into relatively\nshort, discontinuous segments no larger than about 40 km when including the\neffects of craters larger than 100 m in radius. When craters smaller than 500 m\nin radius are excluded, surviving segment lengths can be as large as ~1000 km.\nThe oldest shorelines exhibit fractal structure after impacts, presenting as a\ndiscontinuous collection of lines over a range of scales. If the features are\ntruly shorelines, high-resolution studies should find similar levels of\ndestruction and discontinuity. However, our results indicate that observing\nshorelines as old as 4 Ga, should they exist, is a significant challenge and\nraises questions about prior mapping efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 14:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The largest radio flare is\npreceded by a phase of optical oscillations and followed one day later by a\nsmaller but optically thin flare, likely due to ejecta interacting with the\ninterstellar medium.

Correlation with the optical flux\ndensities is weak at short timescales, but becomes significant on timescales\ngreater than a few hours.

In this work, we develop a pair of novel\nquaternion variational integrators (QVIs) showing these properties, and\ndemonstrate their capability for simulating inertial maneuvering in a\nbiomimetic UAV showing complex multibody-dynamics coupling. Being\nquaternion-valued, these QVIs are innately singularity-free; and being\nvariational, they can show excellent energy and momentum conservation\nproperties. We explore the effect of variational integration order\n(left-rectangle vs. midpoint) on the conservation properties of integrator, and\nconclude that, in complex coupled systems in which canonical momenta may be\ntime-varying, the midpoint integrator is required. The resulting midpoint QVI\nis well-suited to the analysis of inertial maneuvering in a biomimetic UAV - a\nfeature that we demonstrate in simulation - and of other complex dynamical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 08:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 11:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

These\nrelationships lead to two important types of effects for video quality.\nFirstly, some temporal variations (such as shaking, flicker, and abrupt scene\ntransitions) are causing temporal distortions and lead to extra quality\ndegradations, while other variations (e.g. those related to meaningful\nhappenings) do not. Secondly, the human visual system often has different\nattention to frames with different contents, resulting in their different\nimportance to the overall video quality. Based on prominent time-series\nmodeling ability of transformers, we propose a novel and effective\ntransformer-based VQA method to tackle these two issues. To better\ndifferentiate temporal variations and thus capture the temporal distortions, we\ndesign a transformer-based Spatial-Temporal Distortion Extraction (STDE)\nmodule. To tackle with temporal quality attention, we propose the\nencoder-decoder-like temporal content transformer (TCT).

One technique to\ntackle this problem is goal reasoning, where the agent not only reasons about\nits actions, but also about which goals to pursue. While goal reasoning for\nsingle agents has been researched extensively, distributed, multi-agent goal\nreasoning comes with additional challenges, especially in a distributed\nsetting. In such a context, some form of coordination is necessary to allow for\ncooperative behavior. Previous goal reasoning approaches share the agent's\nworld model with the other agents, which already enables basic cooperation.\nHowever, the agent's goals, and thus its intentions, are typically not shared.\n  In this paper, we present a method to tackle this limitation. Extending an\nexisting goal reasoning framework, we propose enabling cooperative behavior\nbetween multiple agents through promises, where an agent may promise that\ncertain facts will be true at some point in the future. Sharing these promises\nallows other agents to not only consider the current state of the world, but\nalso the intentions of other agents when deciding on which goal to pursue next.\nWe describe how promises can be incorporated into the goal life cycle, a\ncommonly used goal refinement mechanism. We then show how promises can be used\nwhen planning for a particular goal by connecting them to timed initial\nliterals (TILs) from PDDL planning. Finally, we evaluate our prototypical\nimplementation in a simplified logistics scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Most mainstream methods treat each local observation as an\nentirety when modeling the decentralized local utility functions. However, they\nignore the fact that local observation information can be further divided into\nseveral entities, and only part of the entities is helpful to model inference.\nMoreover, the importance of different entities may change over time. To improve\nthe performance of decentralized policies, the attention mechanism is used to\ncapture features of local information. Nevertheless, existing attention models\nrely on dense fully connected graphs and cannot better perceive important\nstates. To this end, we propose a sparse state based MARL (S2RL) framework,\nwhich utilizes a sparse attention mechanism to discard irrelevant information\nin local observations. The local utility functions are estimated through the\nself-attention and sparse attention mechanisms separately, then are combined\ninto a standard joint value function and auxiliary joint value function in the\ncentral critic.

A\ndetail analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared\n(FTIR) spectrometer data by deconvoluting the peaks were carried out for\nassigning and accurately identifying the peaks associated to a particular PVDF\nphase.

Thereafter, the text network properties\nare investigated along modern statistical physics approaches of networks,\nthereby relating network topology and algebraic properties, to literary texts\ncontents. As a practical illustration, the first chapter of the Genesis in the\nBible is mapped into a 10 node network, as in the Kabbalah approach, mentioning\nGod ($\\equiv Elohim$). The characteristics of the network are studied starting\nfrom its adjacency matrix, and the corresponding Laplacian matrix. Triplets of\nnodes are particularly examined in order to emphasize the ''textual (community)\nconnexions'' of each agent \"emanation\", through the so called clustering\ncoefficients and the overlap index, whence measuring the ''semantic flow''\nbetween the different nodes. It is concluded that this graph is a small-world\nnetwork, weakly dis-assortative, because its average local clustering\ncoefficient is significantly higher than a random graph constructed on the same\nvertex set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 10:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

It is claimed that there is fractional\ncharge at the boundary of the nontrivial phase while none at that of trivial\nphase. However, this conclusion is in direct contradiction to the modern theory\nof polarization(MTP). We solve this paradox by showing that the polarization of\nSSH model depends only on the distribution of the positive charges and is\nirrelevant to the Zak phase defined in previous works. Thus the distribution of\npositive charges alone determines whether the SSH chain is topological or not.\nSimilarly, we show the polarization defined by Berry connection can not be used\nto characterize topological property of a 2D generalization of SSH model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 08:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
