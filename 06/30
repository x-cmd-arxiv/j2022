Therefore, we\ncould consider them as Potential Technical Debt (PTD) since PTD will evolve\ninto TD when it is injected into software systems without being resolved.

This implies that any\nsimulations used to constrain the SIDM cross sections for galaxies with stellar\nmasses between $10^8$ and at least $10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ will require baryons to\nmake accurate predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Classification based on omics\ndata is one of the central problems in biomedical research. However, omics data\nusually has a limited sample size but high feature dimensions, and it is\nassumed that only a few features (biomarkers) are active, i.e. informative to\ndiscriminate between different categories (cancer subtypes,\nresponder/non-responder to treatment, for example). Identifying active\nbiomarkers for classification has therefore become fundamental for omics data\nanalysis. Focusing on binary classification, we propose an innovative feature\nselection method aiming at dealing with the high correlations between the\nbiomarkers. Various research has shown the notorious influence of correlated\nbiomarkers and the difficulty of accurately identifying active ones. Our\nmethod, WLogit, consists in whitening the design matrix to remove the\ncorrelations between biomarkers, then using a penalized criterion adapted to\nthe logistic regression model to select features. The performance of WLogit is\nassessed using synthetic data in several scenarios and compared with other\napproaches. The results suggest that WLogit can identify almost all active\nbiomarkers even in the cases where the biomarkers are highly correlated, while\nthe other methods fail, which consequently leads to higher classification\naccuracy. The performance is also evaluated on the classification of two\nLymphoma subtypes, and the obtained classifier also outperformed other methods.\nOur method is implemented in the \\texttt{WLogit} R package available from the\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 18:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In practice, test error often continues to decrease with\nincreasing over-parameterization, referred to as double descent. This allows\npractitioners to instantiate large models without having to worry about\nover-fitting. Despite its benefits, however, prior work has shown that\nover-parameterization can exacerbate bias against minority subgroups. Several\nfairness-constrained DNN training methods have been proposed to address this\nconcern. Here, we critically examine MinDiff, a fairness-constrained training\nprocedure implemented within TensorFlow's Responsible AI Toolkit, that aims to\nachieve Equality of Opportunity. We show that although MinDiff improves\nfairness for under-parameterized models, it is likely to be ineffective in the\nover-parameterized regime. This is because an overfit model with zero training\nloss is trivially group-wise fair on training data, creating an \"illusion of\nfairness,\" thus turning off the MinDiff optimization (this will apply to any\ndisparity-based measures which care about errors or accuracy. It won't apply to\ndemographic parity). Within specified fairness constraints, under-parameterized\nMinDiff models can even have lower error compared to their over-parameterized\ncounterparts (despite baseline over-parameterized models having lower error).\nWe further show that MinDiff optimization is very sensitive to choice of batch\nsize in the under-parameterized regime. Thus, fair model training using MinDiff\nrequires time-consuming hyper-parameter searches. Finally, we suggest using\npreviously proposed regularization techniques, viz. L2, early stopping and\nflooding in conjunction with MinDiff to train fair over-parameterized models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 18:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Cross-speaker emotion\ntransfer is a common approach to generating emotional speech when speech with\nemotion labels from target speakers is not available for model training. This\npaper presents a novel cross-speaker emotion transfer system, named iEmoTTS.\nThe system is composed of an emotion encoder, a prosody predictor, and a timbre\nencoder. The emotion encoder extracts the identity of emotion type as well as\nthe respective emotion intensity from the mel-spectrogram of input speech. The\nemotion intensity is measured by the posterior probability that the input\nutterance carries that emotion. The prosody predictor is used to provide\nprosodic features for emotion transfer. The timber encoder provides\ntimbre-related information for the system. Unlike many other studies which\nfocus on disentangling speaker and style factors of speech, the iEmoTTS is\ndesigned to achieve cross-speaker emotion transfer via disentanglement between\nprosody and timbre. Prosody is considered as the main carrier of\nemotion-related speech characteristics and timbre accounts for the essential\ncharacteristics for speaker identification. Zero-shot emotion transfer, meaning\nthat speech of target speakers are not seen in model training, is also realized\nwith iEmoTTS. Extensive experiments of subjective evaluation have been carried\nout. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of iEmoTTS as compared with\nother recently proposed systems of cross-speaker emotion transfer.

Previous\nstudies of GRB host galaxies at low redshift showed that high surface densities\nof stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) can potentially enhance the GRB\nproduction. We assess how the size, the stellar mass and SFR surface densities\nof distant galaxies affect their probability to host a long GRB, using a sample\nof GRB hosts at $z > 1$ and a control sample of star-forming sources from the\nfield. We gather a sample of 45 GRB host galaxies at $1 < z < 3.1$ observed\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 camera in the near-infrared. Using the\nGALFIT parametric approach, we model the GRB host light profile and derive the\nhalf-light radius for 35 GRB hosts, which we use to estimate the SFR and\nstellar mass surface densities of each object. We compare the distribution of\nthese physical quantities to the SFR-weighted properties of a complete sample\nof star-forming galaxies from the 3D-HST deep survey at comparable redshift and\nstellar mass. We show that, similarly to $z < 1$, GRB hosts are smaller in size\nand they have higher stellar mass and SFR surface densities than field galaxies\nat $1 < z < 2$. Interestingly, this result is robust even when considering\nseparately the hosts of GRBs with optically-bright afterglows and the hosts of\ndark GRBs. At $z > 2$ though, GRB hosts appear to have sizes and stellar mass\nsurface densities more consistent with those characterizing the field galaxies.\nIn addition to a possible trend toward low metallicity environment, other\nenvironmental properties such as stellar density appears to play a role in the\nformation of long GRBs, at least up to $z \\sim 2$.

Here, I describe a mechanism of circulation formation due\nto a non-hydrostatic pressure gradient resulting from centripetal acceleration,\nwhich is created by the rotation of the Earth. The effect is similar to the\ncurvature of a water surface in a rotating vessel. This causes the unevenly\nheated air to move in a meridional direction.

The technique is based on the use of a single\npolycrystalline diamond particle containing silicon-vacancy (SiV) color\ncenters. Due to the presence of amorphous carbon at its intercrystalline\nboundaries, such a particle is an efficient light absorber and becomes a local\nheat source when illuminated by a laser. Furthermore, the temperature of such a\nlocal heater is tracked by the spectral shift of the zero-phonon line of SiV\ncenters [2]. Thus, the diamond particle acts simultaneously as a heater and a\nthermometer. In the current work, we demonstrate the ability of such a Diamond\nHeater-Thermometer (DHT) to locally alter the temperature, one of the numerous\nparameters that play a decisive role for the living organisms at the nanoscale.\nIn particular, we show that the local heating of 11-12 {\\deg}C relative to the\nambient temperature (22 {\\deg}C) next to individual HeLa cells and neurons,\nisolated from the mouse hippocampus, leads to a change in the intracellular\ndistribution of the concentration of free calcium ions.

Biological and artificial multi-agent\nsystems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often\nneed to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which\nthe performance or even the survival of the group are at stake. Breaking\nindecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state agents are not\nbiased toward any specific option and therefore the agent group is maximally\nsensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we\ndevelop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of\nindecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network\nbifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in\ninfluence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an\noption. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely,\ndeadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of\nsynchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in\ninfluence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value\npatterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the\ninfluence networks. Third, we show that there are also many `exotic' dissensus\nvalue patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture, but not\nby network symmetries, through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This\nis the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical\nsimulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 20:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In this\nwork we develop a many-body approach based on the thermal discrete dipole\napproximation (TDDA) that is able to describe the NFRHT between nonreciprocal\nobjects of arbitrary size and shape. We illustrate the potential and the\nrelevance of this approach with the analysis of two related phenomena, namely\nthe existence of persistent thermal currents and the photon thermal Hall\neffect, in a system with several magneto-optical bodies. Our many-body TDDA\napproach paves the way for closing the gap between experiment and theory that\nis hindering the progress of the topic of NFRHT in many-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 21:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Lottery winners claimed land in the order in which their names were\ndrawn, so the draw number is an approximate rank ordering of lottery wealth.\nThis mechanism allows for the estimation of a dose-response function, which\nrelates each draw number to the expected outcome under each draw. I estimate\ndose-response functions on a linked dataset of lottery winners and land patent\nrecords, and find the probability of purchasing land from the government to be\ndecreasing as a function of lottery wealth, which is evidence for the presence\nof liquidity constraints. I find female winners were more effective in\nleveraging lottery wealth to purchase additional land, as evidenced by\nsignificantly higher median dose-responses compared to those of male winners.\nFor a sample of winners linked to the 1910 Census, I find that male winners\nhave higher median dose-responses compared to female winners in terms of farm\nor home ownership. These results suggest that liquidity constraints may have\nbeen more binding for female entrepreneurs in the market economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 21:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 04:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 03:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

With a 75 sq cm surface,\nour link budget calculations predict a 4 dB and 24 dB improvement in the SNR of\na link entering the window of a rural home in comparison to the free-space path\nand brick wall penetration, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 22:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

These rhythms are\nbelieved to underlie information processing and cognitive functions and have\nbeen subjected to intense experimental and theoretical scrutiny. Computational\nmodeling has provided a framework for the emergence of network-level\noscillatory behavior from the interaction of spiking neurons. However, due to\nthe strong nonlinear interactions between highly recurrent spiking populations,\nthe interplay between cortical rhythms in multiple frequency bands has rarely\nbeen theoretically investigated. Many studies invoke multiple physiological\ntimescales or oscillatory inputs to produce rhythms in multi-bands. Here we\ndemonstrate the emergence of multi-band oscillations in a simple network\nconsisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory neuronal population driven by\nconstant input. First, we construct a data-driven, Poincar\\'e section theory\nfor robust numerical observations of single-frequency oscillations bifurcating\ninto multiple bands. Then we develop model reductions of the stochastic,\nnonlinear, high-dimensional neuronal network to capture the appearance of\nmulti-band dynamics and the underlying bifurcations theoretically. Furthermore,\nwhen viewed within the reduced state space, our analysis reveals conserved\ngeometrical features of the bifurcations on low-dimensional dynamical\nmanifolds. These results suggest a simple geometric mechanism behind the\nemergence of multi-band oscillations without appealing to oscillatory inputs or\nmultiple synaptic or neuronal timescales. Thus our work points to unexplored\nregimes of stochastic competition between excitation and inhibition behind the\ngeneration of dynamic, patterned neuronal activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 23:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

A strong piezoelectric effect and\nthe presence of self-polarization were confirmed by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy, while simulation work clarified the role of vibration on band\nbending deriving from the former.

We\nconsider the linearly bounded subgradients assumption for the objective\nfunction, which is more general than the traditional Lipschitz continuity\nassumption, to account for practical scenarios. We then conduct thorough\nconvergence analysis for RCS in both convex and nonconvex cases based on this\ngeneralized Lipschitz-type assumption.

They have applications in economics, finance, and\ngame theory. Normalizing flows (NFs) are a family of deep generative models\nthat compute data likelihoods by using an invertible mapping, which is\ntypically parameterized by using neural networks. They are useful for density\nmodeling and data generation. While active research has been conducted on both\nmodels, few noted the relationship between the two. In this work, we unravel\nthe connections between MFGs and NFs by contextualizing the training of an NF\nas solving the MFG. This is achieved by reformulating the MFG problem in terms\nof agent trajectories and parameterizing a discretization of the resulting MFG\nwith flow architectures. With this connection, we explore two research\ndirections. First, we employ expressive NF architectures to accurately solve\nhigh-dimensional MFGs, sidestepping the curse of dimensionality in traditional\nnumerical methods. Compared with other deep learning approaches, our\ntrajectory-based formulation encodes the continuity equation in the neural\nnetwork, resulting in a better approximation of the population dynamics.\nSecond, we regularize the training of NFs with transport costs and show the\neffectiveness on controlling the model's Lipschitz bound, resulting in better\ngeneralization performance. We demonstrate numerical results through\ncomprehensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-life datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 02:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

For example, in\nautonomous driving scenarios, different driving environments may bring obvious\ndomain shifts, which lead to biases in model predictions. Federated learning\nthat has emerged in recent years can enable multi-party collaborative training\nwithout leaking client data. In this paper, we focus on a special cross-domain\nscenario where the server contains large-scale data and multiple clients only\ncontain a small amount of data; meanwhile, there exist differences in data\ndistributions among the clients. In this case, traditional federated learning\ntechniques cannot take into account the learning of both the global knowledge\nof all participants and the personalized knowledge of a specific client. To\nmake up for this limitation, we propose a cross-domain federated object\ndetection framework, named FedOD. In order to learn both the global knowledge\nand the personalized knowledge in different domains, the proposed framework\nfirst performs the federated training to obtain a public global aggregated\nmodel through multi-teacher distillation, and sends the aggregated model back\nto each client for finetuning its personalized local model. After very few\nrounds of communication, on each client we can perform weighted ensemble\ninference on the public global model and the personalized local model. With the\nensemble, the generalization performance of the client-side model can\noutperform a single model with the same parameter scale. We establish a\nfederated object detection dataset which has significant background differences\nand instance differences based on multiple public autonomous driving datasets,\nand then conduct extensive experiments on the dataset.

The training process tries to\noptimize the weights assigned to those connections, together with the biases of\nthe neurons, to better fit the training data. However, the definition of the\nactivation functions is, in general, determined in the design process and not\nmodified during the training, meaning that their behavior is unrelated to the\ntraining data set. In this paper we propose the definition and utilization of\nan implicit, parametric, non-linear activation function that adapts its shape\nduring the training process. This fact increases the space of parameters to\noptimize within the network, but it allows a greater flexibility and\ngeneralizes the concept of neural networks. Furthermore, it simplifies the\narchitectural design since the same activation function definition can be\nemployed in each neuron, letting the training process to optimize their\nparameters and, thus, their behavior. Our proposed activation function comes\nfrom the definition of the consensus variable from the optimization of a linear\nunderdetermined problem with an $L_p^q$ regularization term, via the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We define the neural\nnetworks using this type of activation functions as $pq-$networks.

We used spectroscopic observations from\nSOFIA, Herschel, and Spitzer of the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC\n253, as well as photometric observations from GALEX, 2MASS, Spitzer, and\nHerschel in order to derive physical properties such as the optical depth to\ncorrect for extinction, as well as the gas density and metallicity of the\ncentral region. Methods. Ratios of the integrated line fluxes of several\nspecies were utilised to derive the gas density and metallicity. The [O iii]\nalong with the [S iii] and [N ii] line flux ratios for example, are sensitive\nto the gas density but nearly independent of the local temperature.

We propose to marginalize over a family of mean functions and\nover the hyperparameters to effectively remove their impact on the\nreconstructions. We further explore the validity and consistency of the results\nconsidering different kernel functions and show that our method is unbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

We combine two recent techniques\nfrom this area: Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al., 2017) and prefix-free parsing\n(PFP, Boucher et al., 2019). Wheeler graphs (WGs) are a general framework\nencompassing several indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), such\nas the FM-index. Wheeler graphs admit a succinct representation which can be\nfurther compacted by employing the idea of tunnelling, which exploits\nredundancies in the form of parallel, equally-labelled paths called blocks that\ncan be merged into a single path. The problem of finding the optimal set of\nblocks for tunnelling, i.e. the one that minimizes the size of the resulting\nWG, is known to be NP-complete and remains the most computationally challenging\npart of the tunnelling process.\n  To find an adequate set of blocks in less time, we propose a new method based\non the prefix-free parsing (PFP). The idea of PFP is to divide the input text\ninto phrases of roughly equal sizes that overlap by a fixed number of\ncharacters. The original text is represented by a sequence of phrase ranks (the\nparse) and a list of all used phrases (the dictionary). In repetitive texts,\nthe PFP of the text is generally much shorter than the original. To speed up\nthe block selection for tunnelling, we apply the PFP to obtain the parse and\nthe dictionary of the text, tunnel the WG of the parse using existing\nheuristics and subsequently use this tunnelled parse to construct a compact WG\nof the original text. Compared with constructing a WG from the original text\nwithout PFP, our method is much faster and uses less memory on collections of\npangenomic sequences. Therefore, our method enables the use of WGs as a\npangenomic reference for real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

We call such problems \"continuous\", to distinguish from \"discrete\"\nclustering where candidate centers are specified. For many objectives, one can\nreduce the continuous case to the discrete case, and use an\n$\\alpha$-approximation algorithm for the discrete case to get a\n$\\beta\\alpha$-approximation for the continuous case, where $\\beta$ depends on\nthe objective: e.g. for $k$-median, $\\beta = 2$, and for $k$-means, $\\beta =\n4$. Our motivating question is whether this gap of $\\beta$ is inherent, or are\nthere better algorithms for continuous clustering than simply reducing to the\ndiscrete case? In a recent SODA 2021 paper, Cohen-Addad, Karthik, and Lee prove\na factor-$2$ and a factor-$4$ hardness, respectively, for continuous $k$-median\nand $k$-means, even when the number of centers $k$ is a constant. The discrete\ncase for a constant $k$ is exactly solvable in polytime, so the $\\beta$ loss\nseems unavoidable in some regimes.\n  In this paper, we approach continuous clustering via the round-or-cut\nframework. For four continuous clustering problems, we outperform the reduction\nto the discrete case. Notably, for the problem $\\lambda$-UFL, where $\\beta = 2$\nand the discrete case has a hardness of $1.27$, we obtain an approximation\nratio of $2.32 < 2 \\times 1.27$ for the continuous case. Also, for continuous\n$k$-means, where the best known approximation ratio for the discrete case is\n$9$, we obtain an approximation ratio of $32 < 4 \\times 9$. The key challenge\nis that most algorithms for discrete clustering, including the state of the\nart, depend on linear programs that become infinite-sized in the continuous\ncase. To overcome this, we design new linear programs for the continuous case\nwhich are amenable to the round-or-cut framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 08:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 08:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 19:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

However, numerical\ncalculations performed for the models mentioned above indicate that other\naspects of this kind of phase transition are more important and can render the\nLBC method less effective. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that in some cases the\nsame aspects allow us to use the LBC method to identify the order of a phase\ntransition\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 08:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Most existing literature have investigated the conventional\n3D-BPP, in which the shape of items are typically considered as regular shapes,\ne.g., rectangular-shaped rigid boxes or cylindrical-shaped containers. However,\n3D-BPP for non-rectangular shaped items are quite common in varies delivery\nschemes, especially in fresh food delivery, and few published studies focusing\non these issues. In this paper, we address a novel 3D-BPP variant in which the\nshape changing factor of non-rectangular and deformable items is incorporated\nto further enhance the loading efficiency and reduce the operational cost of\nrelated companies. Motivated by the compression process of item-loading, we\npropose a constructive heuristic (i.e., an improved dynamic-volume-based\npacking algorithm) to solve the studied problem.

We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient\ntransfer learning, which is impossible in the kernel regime.\n  Specifically, we consider the problem of learning polynomials which depend on\nonly a few relevant directions, i.e. of the form $f^\\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U:\n\\R^d \\to \\R^r$ with $d \\gg r$.

However, expressive, nonlinear neural mass models are often\ndifficult to fit to empirical data without additional simplifying assumptions:\ne.g., that the system can be modelled as linear perturbations around a fixed\npoint. In this study we offer a mathematical analysis of neural mass models,\nspecifically the canonical microcircuit model, providing analytical solutions\ndescribing dynamical itinerancy.

Various exciting applications of these concepts\nhave been recently demonstrated, ranging from exotic mechanical properties to\ndevice-like and adaptive functionalities. The vast majority of the studies\npublished to date have, however, focused on the quasi-static behavior of such\ndevices, neglecting their rich dynamic behavior. Recently, we proposed a new\nclass of strain rate-dependent mechanical metamaterials that are made from\nbi-beams (i.e., viscoelastic bilayer beams). The buckling direction of such\nbi-beams can be controlled with the applied strain rate. The proposed approach,\nhowever, suffers from a major limitation: 3D printing of such bi-beams with\nsuch a 'strong' differential strain rate-dependent response is very\nchallenging. Here, we propose an alternative approach that only requires a\n'weak' differential response and a rationally designed geometric artifact to\ncontrol the buckling direction of bi-beams. We present an analytical model that\ndescribes the landscape of all possible combinations of geometric designs and\nhyperelastic as well as viscoelastic properties that lead to the desired strain\nrate-dependent switching of the buckling direction. We also demonstrate how\nmulti- and single-material 3D printing techniques can be used to fabricate the\nproposed bi-beams with microscale and submicron resolutions. More importantly,\nwe show how the requirement for a weak differential response eliminates the\nneed for multi-material 3D printing, as the change in the laser processing\nparameters is sufficient to achieve effective differential responses. Finally,\nwe use the same 3D printing techniques to produce strain rate-dependent gripper\nmechanisms as showcases of potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 09:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) are an\nestablished approach to learn from time-invariant network data. The graph\nconvolution operation offers a principled approach to aggregate multiresolution\ninformation. However, extending the convolution principled learning and\nrespective analysis to the spatiotemporal domain is challenging because\nspatiotemporal data have more intrinsic dependencies. Hence, a higher\nflexibility to capture jointly the spatial and the temporal dependencies is\nrequired to learn meaningful higher-order representations. Here, we leverage\nproduct graphs to represent the spatiotemporal dependencies in the data and\nintroduce Graph-Time Convolutional Neural Networks (GTCNNs) as a principled\narchitecture to aid learning. The proposed approach can work with any type of\nproduct graph and we also introduce a parametric product graph to learn also\nthe spatiotemporal coupling. The convolution principle further allows a similar\nmathematical tractability as for GCNNs. In particular, the stability result\nshows GTCNNs are stable to spatial perturbations but there is an implicit\ntrade-off between discriminability and robustness; i.e., the more complex the\nmodel, the less stable. Extensive numerical results on benchmark datasets\ncorroborate our findings and show the GTCNN compares favorably with\nstate-of-the-art solutions.

Studies of Lyman-alpha radiation\ndetermined the parameters of interstellar hydrogen within a few astronomical\nunits from the Sun. The interstellar hydrogen atoms appeared to be decelerated,\nheated, and shifted compared to the helium atoms.

Incremental learning has been proposed to retain the\nknowledge of old classes while learning to identify new classes. A typical\napproach is to use a few exemplars to avoid forgetting old knowledge. In such a\nscenario, data imbalance between old and new classes is a key issue that leads\nto performance degradation of the model. Several strategies have been designed\nto rectify the bias towards the new classes due to data imbalance. However,\nthey heavily rely on the assumptions of the bias relation between old and new\nclasses. Therefore, they are not suitable for complex real-world applications.\nIn this study, we propose an assumption-agnostic method, Multi-Granularity\nRegularized re-Balancing (MGRB), to address this problem. Re-balancing methods\nare used to alleviate the influence of data imbalance; however, we empirically\ndiscover that they would under-fit new classes. To this end, we further design\na novel multi-granularity regularization term that enables the model to\nconsider the correlations of classes in addition to re-balancing the data. A\nclass hierarchy is first constructed by grouping the semantically or visually\nsimilar classes. The multi-granularity regularization then transforms the\none-hot label vector into a continuous label distribution, which reflects the\nrelations between the target class and other classes based on the constructed\nclass hierarchy. Thus, the model can learn the inter-class relational\ninformation, which helps enhance the learning of both old and new classes.\nExperimental results on both public datasets and a real-world fault diagnosis\ndataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 11:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

Our interest was\nin examining whether body ownership illusion-based body scaling could affect\nthe plausibility of rigid body dynamics similarly to altering VR users' scale\nby manipulating their virtual interpupillary distance and viewpoint height. The\nprocedure involved the conceptual replication of two previous studies. We\ninvestigated physics plausibility with 40 participants under two conditions. In\nour synchronous condition, we used visuo-tactile stimuli to elicit a body\nownership illusion of inhabiting an invisible doll-sized body on participants\nreclining on an exam table. Our asynchronous condition was otherwise similar,\nbut the visuo-tactile stimuli were provided asynchronously to prevent the onset\nof the body ownership illusion. We were interested in whether the correct\napproximation of physics (true physics) or physics that are incorrect and\nappearing as if the environment is five times larger instead (movie physics)\nappear more realistic to participants as a function of body scale. We found\nthat movie physics did appear more realistic to participants under the body\nownership illusion condition. However, our hypothesis that true physics would\nappear more realistic in the asynchronous condition was unsupported. Our\nexploratory analyses revealed that movie physics were perceived as plausible\nunder both conditions. Moreover, we were not able to replicate previous\nfindings from literature concerning object size estimations while inhabiting a\nsmall invisible body. However, we found a significant opposite effect regarding\nsize estimations; the object sizes were on average underestimated during the\nsynchronous visuo-tactile condition when compared to the asynchronous\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 12:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

We present the first study of long weakly-nonlinear internal\nring waves in a three-layer fluid in the presence of a background linear shear\ncurrent. The leading order of this theory leads to the angular adjustment\nequation - a nonlinear first-order differential equation describing the\ndependence of the linear long wave speed on the angle to the direction of the\ncurrent. Ring waves correspond to singular solution (envelope of the general\nsolution) of this equation, and they can exist only under certain conditions.\nThe constructed solutions reveal qualitative differences in the shapes of the\nwavefronts of the two baroclinic modes: the wavefront of the faster mode is\nelongated in the direction of the current, while the wavefront of the slower\nmode is squeezed. Moreover, different regimes are identified according to the\nvorticity strength. When the vorticity is weak, part of the wavefront is able\nto propagate upstream. However, when the vorticity is strong enough, the whole\nwavefront propagates downstream. A richer behaviour can be observed for the\nslower mode. As the vorticity increases, singularities of the swallowtail-type\nmay arise and, eventually, solutions with compact wavefronts crossing the\ndownstream axis cease to exist. We show that the latter is related to the\nlong-wave instability of the base flow. We obtain analytical expressions for\nthe coefficients of the cKdV-type amplitude equation, and numerically model the\nevolution of the waves for both modes. The initial evolution is in agreement\nwith the leading-order predictions for the deformations of the wavefronts.\nThen, as the wavefronts expand, strong dispersive effects in the upstream\ndirection are revealed. Moreover, when nonlinearity is enhanced, fission of\nwaves can occur in the upstream part of the ring waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 12:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Not only is their satisfiability decidable in polynomial time,\nbut even their models can be counted in closed form. This stands in stark\ncontrast with other polynomial-time decidable classes, which usually have\nalgorithms based on backtracking and resolution and for which model counting\nremains hard, like 2-SAT and Horn-SAT. However, those resolution-based\nalgorithms usually easily imply an upper bound on resolution complexity, which\nis missing for hitting formulas. Are hitting formulas hard for resolution?\n  In this paper we take the first steps towards answering this question. We\nshow that the resolution complexity of hitting formulas is dominated by\nso-called irreducible hitting formulas, first studied by Kullmann and Zhao,\nthat cannot be composed of smaller hitting formulas. However, by definition,\nlarge irreducible unsatisfiable hitting formulas are difficult to construct; it\nis not even known whether infinitely many exist. Building upon our theoretical\nresults, we implement an efficient algorithm on top of the Nauty software\npackage to enumerate all irreducible unsatisfiable hitting formulas with up to\n14 clauses. We also determine the exact resolution complexity of the generated\nhitting formulas with up to 13 clauses by extending a known SAT encoding for\nour purposes.

Using a\nwidely-used gait recognition dataset, we demonstrate that our approach is\ncapable of producing over an order of magnitude more realistic personalized\ngaits than existing methods, even when used with sources that were not\navailable during training. As part of our solution, we present a detector that\ndetermines whether a video is real or generated by our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 12:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 05:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2022 09:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 12:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Walks are sequences of\nadjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or\nnon-strictly increasingly (i.e., non-decreasing) depending on the scenario.\nPaths are temporal walks where each vertex is not traversed twice. A temporal\nvertex is a pair $(u,i)$ where $u$ is a vertex and $i\\in[\\tau]$ a timestep. In\nthis paper we focus on the questions: (i) are there at least $k$ paths from a\nsingle source $s$ to a single target $t$, no two of which internally intersect\non a temporal vertex? (ii) are there at most $h$ temporal vertices whose\nremoval disconnects $s$ from $t$? Let $k^*$ be the maximum value $k$ for which\nthe answer to (i) is YES, and let $h^*$ be the minimum value $h$ for which the\nanswer to (ii) is YES. In static graphs, $k^*$ and $h^*$ are equal by Menger's\nTheorem and this is a crucial property to solve efficiently both (i) and (ii).\nIn temporal graphs such equality has been investigated only focusing on\ndisjoint walks rather than disjoint paths. We prove that, when dealing with\nnon-strictly increasing temporal paths, $k^*$ is equal to $h^*$ if and only if\n$k^*$ is 1.

Inspired by recent progress in neural rendering, we present a novel\nframework for deformable tissue reconstruction from binocular captures in\nrobotic surgery under the single-viewpoint setting.

Although some researchers use Vision Transformers for\nreinforcement learning tasks, their experiments remain at a small scale due to\nthe high computational cost. Experiments conducted at a large scale, on the\nother hand, have to rely on techniques to cut the costs of Vision Transformers,\nwhich also yield inferior results.\n  To address this challenge, this article presents the first online\nreinforcement learning scheme that is based on Swin Transformers: Swin DQN.\nSwin Transformers are promising as a backbone in neural networks by splitting\ngroups of image pixels into small patches and applying local self-attention\noperations inside the (shifted) windows of fixed sizes.

Current methods for grading seizure\nseverity rely on qualitative interpretations from patients and clinicians.\nQuantitative measures of seizure severity would complement existing approaches,\nfor EEG monitoring, outcome monitoring, and seizure prediction. Therefore, we\ndeveloped a library of quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) markers that\nassess the spread and intensity of abnormal electrical activity during and\nafter seizures. Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 1056\nseizures from 63 patients. For each seizure, we computed 16 markers of seizure\nseverity that capture the signal magnitude, spread, duration, and post-ictal\nsuppression of seizures. Results: Quantitative EEG markers of seizure severity\ndistinguished focal vs. subclinical and focal vs. FTBTC seizures across\npatients. In individual patients, 71% had a moderate to large difference\n(ranksum r > 0.3) between focal and subclinical seizures in three or more\nmarkers. Circadian and longer-term changes in severity were found for 67% and\n53% of patients, respectively. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of\nusing quantitative iEEG markers to measure seizure severity. Our quantitative\nmarkers distinguish between seizure types and are therefore sensitive to\nestablished qualitative differences in seizure severity. Our results also\nsuggest that seizure severity is modulated over different timescales.

Using high-speed imaging\nwe show how incoming liquid deforms the air bubble enclosed in such a geometry,\nand how an impact peak is registered inside the bubble, which can be traced\nback to the impact of a liquid jet onto the pressure sensor. We compare the\nmeasured pressures to a Bagnold model, and discuss the dominant resonances in\nthe bubble.

The current challenges and potential\nfuture research directions are discussed. Various methods are needed to narrow\nthe gap in swimming performance between robot fishes and fish. This paper is a\nfirst step to bring together roboticists and marine biologists interested in\nlearning state-of-the-art research on bionic robot fishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 14:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

One method for variance estimation is the classical Delta-method\nbut there is a knowledge gap as this method is not routinely included in\ntraining for applied medical statistics and its uses are not widely understood.\nGiven that a smooth function of an asymptotically normal estimator is also\nasymptotically normally distributed, the Delta-method allows approximating the\nlarge-sample variance of a function of an estimator with known large-sample\nproperties. In a more general setting, it is a technique for approximating the\nvariance of a functional (i.e., an estimand) that takes a function as an input\nand applies another function to it (e.g. the expectation function).\nSpecifically, we may approximate the variance of the function using the\nfunctional Delta-method based on the influence function (IF). The IF explores\nhow a functional $\\phi(\\theta)$ changes in response to small perturbations in\nthe sample distribution of the estimator and allows computing the empirical\nstandard error of the distribution of the functional.

Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age,\nas well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can\nestimate ages using techniques like white dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology,\nand lithium abundance.

However, little attention has been paid to highly-parallel\napplications with unbalanced and irregular workloads. Typically, these\nworkloads have been kept out of the cloud due to the impossibility of\nanticipating their computing resources ahead of time, frequently leading to\nsevere resource over- and underprovisioning situations. Our main insight in\nthis article is, however, that the elasticity and ease of management of\nserverless computing technology can be a key enabler for effectively running\nthese problematic workloads for the first time in the cloud. More concretely,\nwe demonstrate that with a simple serverless executor pool abstraction one can\nachieve a better cost-performance trade-off than a Spark cluster of static size\nbuilt upon large EC2 virtual machines. To support this conclusion, we evaluate\nthree irregular algorithms: Unbalanced Tree Search (UTS), Mandelbrot Set using\nthe Mariani-Silver algorithm and Betweenness Centrality (BC) on a random graph.\nFor instance, our serverless implementation of UTS is able to outperform Spark\nby up to 55% with the same cost. We also show that a serverless environment can\noutperform a large EC2 in the BC algorithm by a 10% using the same amount of\nvirtual CPUs. This provides the first concrete evidence that highly-parallel,\nirregular workloads can be efficiently executed using purely stateless\nfunctions with almost zero burden on users i.e., no need for users to\nunderstand non-obvious system-level parameters and optimizations. Furthermore,\nwe show that UTS can benefit from the FaaS pay-as-you-go billing model, which\nmakes it worth for the first time to enable certain application-level\noptimizations that can lead to significant improvements (e.g. of 41%) with\nnegligible increase in cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 14:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

In the ``classical'' isolated binary evolution\nscenario for double compact objects, the CE is usually the second mass transfer\nphase. Thus, the donor star of the CE is the product of a previous binary\ninteraction, often stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF). Because of the accretion\nof mass during the first RLOF, the main-sequence core of the accretor star\ngrows and is ``rejuvenated''. This modifies the core-envelope boundary region\nand decreases significantly the envelope binding energy for the remaining\nevolution. Comparing accretor stars from self-consistent binary models to stars\nevolved as single, we demonstrate that the rejuvenation can lower the energy\nrequired to eject a CE by $\\sim 42-96\\%$ for both black hole and neutron star\nprogenitors, depending on the evolutionary stage and final orbital separation.\nTherefore, binaries experiencing first stable mass transfer may more easily\nsurvive subsequent CE events and result in possibly wider final separations\ncompared to current predictions. Despite their high mass, our accretors also\nexperience extended ``blue loops'', which may have observational consequences\nfor low-metallicity stellar populations and asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 15:12:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 09:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 21:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Motivated by the so-called opposition control (Choi\net al. 1993), in which a control input is applied so as to cancel the\nwall-normal velocity fluctuation on a detection plane at a certain distance\nfrom the wall, we consider wall blowing and suction as a control input, and its\nspatial distribution is determined by the instantaneous streamwise and\nwall-normal velocity fluctuations at the distance of 15 wall units above the\nwall. Deep neural network is used to express the complex relationship between\nthe sensing information and the control input, and it is trained so as to\nmaximize the expected long-term reward, i.e., drag reduction. When only the\nwall-normal velocity fluctuation is measured and a linear network is used, the\npresent framework successfully reproduces the optimal linear weight for the\nopposition control reported in the previous study (Chung & Talha 2011). In\ncontrast, when a non-linear network is used, more complex control strategies\nbased on the instantaneous streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations are\nobtained. Specifically, the obtained control strategies abruptly switch between\nstrong wall blowing and suction for downwelling of a high-speed fluid toward\nthe wall and upwelling of a low-speed fluid away from the wall, respectively.\nThe obtained control policies lead to drag reduction rates as high as 37 %,\nwhich is higher than 23 % achieved by the conventional opposition control at\nthe same Reynolds number. The present results indicate that reinforcement\nlearning can be a novel framework for the development of effective control\nstrategies through systematic learning based on a large number of trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 15:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Despite many\nadvances, there is still a controversial debate on which combination of\nchemical treatment and capping dielectric layer can best reproducibly protect\nthe crystal surface of III-Vs, while being compatible with readily available\nplasma deposition methods. This work reports on a systematic experimental study\non the role of sulfide ammonium chemical treatment followed by dielectric\ncoating in the passivation effect of GaAs/AlGaAs nanopillars. Our results\nconclusively show that the best surface passivation is achieved using ammonium\nsulfide followed by encapsulation with a thin layer of silicon nitride by low\nfrequency plasma enhanced chemical deposition.

For both, we wish to minimize the number of\ninterventions performed. For the first problem, we give a characterization of a\nminimal sized set of atomic interventions that is necessary and sufficient to\ncheck the correctness of a claimed causal graph. Our characterization uses the\nnotion of $\\textit{covered edges}$, which enables us to obtain simple proofs\nand also easily reason about earlier known results.

For all the above settings, we provide the first known\nprovable algorithms for efficiently computing (near)-optimal verifying sets on\ngeneral graphs.

Understanding the\nstructural and functional mechanisms of the brain has long been an intriguing\npursuit for neuroscience research and clinical disorder therapy.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged\nas a potential method for modeling complex network data.

First, the 3D governing system\nfor a general multi-layered hyperelastic plate is established, which\nincorporates the growth effect, and the material and geometrical parameters of\nthe different layers. Then, a series expansion-truncation approach is adopted\nto eliminate the thickness variables in the 3D governing system. An elaborate\ncalculation scheme is applied to derive the iteration relations of the\ncoefficient functions in the series expansions. Through some further\nmanipulations, a 2D vector plate equation system with the associated boundary\nconditions is established, which only contains the unknowns in the bottom layer\nof the plate. To show the efficiency of the current plate theory, three typical\nexamples regarding the growth-induced deformations and instabilities of\nmulti-layered plate samples are studied. Some analytical and numerical\nsolutions to the plate equation are obtained, which can provide accurate\npredictions on the growth behaviors of the plate samples. Furthermore, the\nproblem of `shape-programming' of multi-layered hyperelastic plates through\ndifferential growth is studied. The explicit formulas of shape-programming for\nsome typical multi-layered plates are derived, which involve the fundamental\nquantities of the 3D target shapes. By using these formulas, the shape\nevolutions of the plates during the growing processes can be controlled\naccurately. The results obtained in the current work are helpful for the design\nof intelligent soft devices with multi-layered plate structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 08:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In contrast to parameter calibration,\nthis work seeks corrections to the structure of the model by a) inferring\naugmentation fields that are consistent with the underlying model, and b)\ntransforming these fields into corrective model forms. The proposed approach\ncouples the inference and learning steps in a weak sense via an alternating\noptimization approach. This coupling ensures that the augmentation fields\nremain learnable and maintain consistent functional relationships with local\nmodeled quantities across the training dataset. An iterative solution procedure\nis presented in this paper, removing the need to embed the augmentation\nfunction during the inference process.
