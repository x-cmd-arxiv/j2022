However, this approach increases both the footprint and the\nparasitic cross-coupling and is ultimately limited by radiation losses - a\npotential roadblock for scaling up quantum processors to millions of qubits. In\nthis work we present transmon qubits with sizes as low as 36$ \\times $39$\n\\mu$m$^2$ with $\\gtrsim$100 nm wide vacuum gap capacitors that are\nmicro-machined from commercial silicon-on-insulator wafers and shadow\nevaporated with aluminum. After the release in HF vapor we achieve a vacuum\nparticipation ratio up to 99.6\\% in an in-plane design that is compatible with\nstandard coplanar circuits. Qubit relaxation time measurements for small gaps\nwith high vacuum electric fields of up to 22 V/m reveal a double exponential\ndecay indicating comparably strong coupling to long-lived two-level-systems\n(TLS). The exceptionally high selectivity of $>$20 dB to the\nsuperconductor-vacuum surface allows to precisely back out the\nsub-single-photon dielectric loss tangent of aluminum oxide exposed to ambient\nconditions.

The current studies focus on the\nsearch for new superconductors with higher Tcs to understand the ultimate limit\nof conventional superconductivity, and high-Tc superconductors at lower\npressures. However, high pressure conditions put serious limitations on\nexperimental studies. Electrical transport measurements have long been the\nprimary experimental technique for reliable detection of superconductivity at\nhigh pressures, whereas magnetic susceptibility measurements continue to be a\nchallenge. Here, we dramatically changed the protocol of magnetic measurements\nto probe the trapped magnetic flux. We tested this technique on samples of H3S\nand LaH10 and propose it for a routine examination of superconductivity at high\npressures. Using the temperature- and magnetic field dependences of the trapped\nflux we estimated Tc ~195 K, a lower critical field ~0.36 T, an irreversibility\nfield ~1.7 T, a full penetration field ~8.8 T, the London penetration depth ~37\nnm, and critical current densities jc(T) in H3S at ~155 GPa in a wide\ntemperature range. The trapped flux method is found to be sensitive to a\nparticular phase in a mixture of superconducting phases: concomitant phases of\nsulfur and hydrogen-depleted LaHx were detected. In contrast to the Meissner\nstate occurring at low external magnetic fields, a magnetic response from the\ntrapped flux at zero applied magnetic field is in tens times stronger and is\nnot contaminated by the magnetic background of a bulky diamond anvil cell. This\ntechnique can be a powerful tool for the screening of new superconducting\nmaterials, the study of multiphase, contaminated samples, or samples with a low\nsuperconducting fraction at ambient pressure too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 18:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

We argue that complete and tidy clustering of the data improves the\ndecision maker's understanding of the business cycle and, by extension, the\nquality of economic decisions. We define the business cycles by applying a\nwavelet approach to drift-adjusted gross value added data spanning over 2000Q1\nto 2021Q2. For the application of the synchronization analysis, we propose the\nnovel soft-clustering approach, which adjusts hierarchical clustering in\nseveral aspects. First, the method relies on synchronicity dissimilarity\nmeasures, noting that, for time series data, the feature space is the set of\nall points in time. Then, the ``soft'' part of the approach strengthens the\nsynchronization signal by using silhouette measures. Finally, we add a\nprobabilistic sparsity algorithm to drop out the most asynchronous ``noisy''\ndata improving the silhouette scores of the most and less synchronous groups.\nThe method, hence, splits the sectoral-regional data into three groups: the\nsynchronous group that shapes the EU business cycle; the less synchronous group\nthat may hint at cycle forecasting relevant information; the asynchronous group\nthat may help investors to diversify through-the-cycle risks of the investment\nportfolios.

Using data from the All-Sky\nAutomated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and \\textit{Gaia} -- the only two\nall-sky surveys to report classical nova candidates -- we find 39 confirmed\nGalactic novae and 7 additional unconfirmed candidates discovered from\n2019--2021, yielding a nova discovery rate of $\\approx 14$ yr$^{-1}$. Using\naccurate Galactic stellar mass models, three-dimensional dust maps, and\nincorporating realistic nova light curves, we have built a sophisticated\nGalactic nova model that allows an estimate of the recovery fraction of\nGalactic novae from these surveys over this time period. The observing\ncapabilities of each survey are distinct: the high cadence of ASAS-SN makes it\nsensitive to fast novae, while the broad observing filter and high spatial\nresolution of \\textit{Gaia} make it more sensitive to highly reddened novae\nacross the entire Galactic plane and bulge. Despite these differences, we find\nthat ASAS-SN and \\textit{Gaia} give consistent Galactic nova rates, with a\nfinal joint nova rate of $26 \\pm 5$ yr$^{-1}$. This inferred nova rate is\nsubstantially lower than found by many other recent studies. Critically\nassessing the systematic uncertainties in the Galactic nova rate, we argue that\nthe role of faint fast-fading novae has likely been overestimated, but that\nsubtle details in the operation of transient alert pipelines can have large,\nsometimes unappreciated effects on transient recovery efficiency. Our predicted\nnova rate can be directly tested with forthcoming red/near-infrared transient\nsurveys in the southern hemisphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The\nnon-gradient magnetic helicity flux is proportional to a nonlinear effective\nvelocity (which vanishes in the absence of the density stratification)\nmultiplied by small-scale magnetic helicity, while the gradient contributions\ndescribe turbulent magnetic diffusion of the small-scale magnetic helicity. In\naddition, the turbulent magnetic helicity fluxes contain source terms\nproportional to the kinetic $\\alpha$ effect or its gradients, and also\ncontributions caused by the large-scale shear (solar differential rotation). We\nhave demonstrated that the turbulent magnetic helicity fluxes due to the\nkinetic $\\alpha$ effect and its radial derivative in combination with the\nnonlinear magnetic diffusion of the small-scale magnetic helicity are dominant\nin the solar convective zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2022 09:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Model stealing defenses\nseek to resolve this dilemma by making models harder to steal while preserving\nutility for benign users. However, existing defenses have poor performance in\npractice, either requiring enormous computational overheads or severe utility\ntrade-offs. To meet these challenges, we present a new approach to model\nstealing defenses called gradient redirection. At the core of our approach is a\nprovably optimal, efficient algorithm for steering an adversary's training\nupdates in a targeted manner. Combined with improvements to surrogate networks\nand a novel coordinated defense strategy, our gradient redirection defense,\ncalled GRAD${}^2$, achieves small utility trade-offs and low computational\noverhead, outperforming the best prior defenses.

The aim is to determine the global maximum value of the secrecy\nfunction, called (strong) secrecy gain.\n  We further apply lattice-like packings to coset coding for the Gaussian\nwiretap channel and show that the family of formally unimodular packings shares\nthe same secrecy function behavior as unimodular and isodual lattices. We\npropose a universal approach to determine the secrecy gain of a Construction A\nformally unimodular packing obtained from a formally self-dual code. From the\nweight distribution of a code, we provide a necessary condition for a formally\nself-dual code such that its Construction A formally unimodular packing is\nsecrecy-optimal. Finally, we demonstrate that formally unimodular\npackings/lattices can achieve higher secrecy gain than the best-known\nunimodular lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

On the other hand, learning inside of simulators fails to capture\nthe complexity of the real world, is prone to simulator inaccuracies, and the\nresulting behaviors do not adapt to changes in the world. The Dreamer algorithm\nhas recently shown great promise for learning from small amounts of interaction\nby planning within a learned world model, outperforming pure reinforcement\nlearning in video games. Learning a world model to predict the outcomes of\npotential actions enables planning in imagination, reducing the amount of trial\nand error needed in the real environment.

On two different robotic\narms, Dreamer learns to pick and place multiple objects directly from camera\nimages and sparse rewards, approaching human performance. On a wheeled robot,\nDreamer learns to navigate to a goal position purely from camera images,\nautomatically resolving ambiguity about the robot orientation. Using the same\nhyperparameters across all experiments, we find that Dreamer is capable of\nonline learning in the real world, establishing a strong baseline.

In a sense to be made\nprecise in the paper, the starting datum in the gauging procedure is a Klein\npair corresponding to a homogeneous space. What the gauging procedure amounts\nto is the construction of a Cartan geometry modelled on that Klein geometry,\nwith the gauge field defining a Cartan connection. The lagrangian itself\nconsists of all gauge-invariant top-forms constructed from the Cartan\nconnection and its curvature. After demonstrating that this procedure produces\nfour-dimensional General Relativity upon gauging Minkowski spacetime, we\nproceed to gauge all four-dimensional maximally symmetric carrollian spaces:\nCarroll, (anti-)de Sitter--Carroll and the lightcone. For the first three of\nthese spaces, our lagrangians generalise earlier first-order lagrangians. The\nresulting theories of carrollian gravity all take the same form, which seems to\nbe a manifestation of model mutation at the level of the lagrangians. The odd\none out, the lightcone, is not reductive and this means that although the\nequations of motion take the same form as in the other cases, the geometric\ninterpretation is different. For all carrollian theories of gravity we obtain\nanalogues of the Gauss--Bonnet, Pontryagin and Nieh--Yan topological terms, as\nwell as two additional terms that are intrinsically carrollian and seem to have\nno lorentzian counterpart.

However, when the\nwarping and the segmentation generation stages operate individually without\ninformation exchange, the misalignment between the warped clothes and the\nsegmentation map occurs, which leads to the artifacts in the final image. The\ninformation disconnection also causes excessive warping near the clothing\nregions occluded by the body parts, so-called pixel-squeezing artifacts. To\nsettle the issues, we propose a novel try-on condition generator as a unified\nmodule of the two stages (i.e., warping and segmentation generation stages).

We analysed here in a\nhomogeneous way the properties of a sample of more than one thousand BCGs in\nthe redshift range 0.15 < z < 0.7, based on images from the Canada France\nHawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. Based on the cluster catalogue of 1371 clusters\nby Sarron et al. (2018), we applied our automatic BCG detection algorithm and\nidentified successfully 70% of the BCGs in our sample. We analysed their 2D\nphotometric properties with GALFIT. We also compared the position angles of the\nBCG major axes with those of the overall cluster to which they belong. We found\nno evolution of the BCG properties with redshift up to z = 0.7, in agreement\nwith previous results by Chu et al. (2021), who analysed an order of magnitude\nsmaller sample, but reaching a redshift z = 1.8. The Kormendy relation for BCGs\nis tight and consistent with that of normal elliptical galaxies and BCGs\nmeasured by other authors. The position angles of the BCGs and of the cluster\nto which they belong agree within 30 degrees for 55% of the objects with well\ndefined position angles. The study of this very large sample of more than one\nthousand BCGs shows that they were mainly formed before z = 0.7, as we find no\nsignificant growth for the luminosities and sizes of central galaxies. We\ndiscuss the importance of the intracluster light in the interpretation of these\nresults. We highlight the role of image depth in the modelisation of the\nluminosity profiles of BCGs, and give evidence for the presence of an inner\nstructure which can only be resolved on deep surveys with limiting apparent\nmagnitude at 80% completeness m80 > 26 mag/arcsec2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

We find that void clustering constraints on $h$ and $\\Omega_b$\nare competitive with galaxy lensing alone, while errors on $n_s$ decrease\nthanks to the orthogonality of the two probes in the 2D-projected parameter\nspace. We also note that, as a whole, the inclusion of the void-lensing\ncross-correlation signal improves parameter constraints by $10-15\\%$, and\nenhances the joint void clustering and galaxy lensing Figure of Merit (FoM) by\n$10\\%$ and $25\\%$, in the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively.\nFinally, when further combining with the spectroscopic galaxy clustering,\nassumed as an independent probe, we find that, in the most competitive case,\nthe FoM increases by a factor of 4 with respect to the combination of weak\nlensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering taken as independent probes.

These quantities are also closely related to solving\nlinear systems of equations in quantum linear algebra. Here we present three\nrelated algorithms for calculating transition probabilities with respect to\narbitrary operators and states. First, we extend a previously published\nshort-depth algorithm, allowing for the two input quantum states to be\nnon-orthogonal. The extension comes at the cost of one ancilla qubit and at\nmost only a constant four additional two-qubit gates. Building on this first\nprocedure, we then derive a higher-depth approach based on Trotterization and\nRichardson extrapolation that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, we\nintroduce a tunable approach that in effect interpolates between the low-depth\nmethod and the method of fewer circuit evaluations. This tunability between\ncircuit depth and measurement complexity allows the algorithm to be tailored to\nspecific hardware characteristics. Finally, we implement proof-of-principle\nnumerics for toy models in physics and chemistry and for use a subroutine in\nvariational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of our\napproaches are that (a) arbitrary non-orthogonal states may now be used with\nnegligible increases in quantum resources, (b) we entirely avoid subroutines\nsuch as the Hadamard test that may require three-qubit gates to be decomposed,\nand (c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art in NISQ algorithms for transition\nprobabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

In the previous studies, CoRoT-7\nwas found to have two planets, CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c with orbital periods of\n0.85 and 3.69 days, and a potential third planet with a period of $\\sim$9 days.\nThe existence of the third planet has been questioned as potentially being an\nactivity-induced artefact. Mass of the transiting planet CoRoT-7b has been\nestimated to have widely different values owing to the activity level of the\nparent star, the consequent Radial Velocity (RV) 'jitter', and the methods used\nto rectify this ambiguity. Here we present an analysis of the HARPS archival RV\ndata of CoRoT-7 using a new wavelength-domain technique, scalpels, to correct\nfor the stellar activity-induced spectral line-shape changes. Simultaneous\nmodelling of stellar activity and orbital motions, identified using the l1-\nperiodogram, shows that scalpels effectively reduce the contribution of stellar\nvariability to the RV signal and enhance the detectability of exoplanets around\nactive stars. Using kima nested-sampling package, we modelled the system\nincorporating a Gaussian Process together with scalpels.

Traditional probabilistic clustering models\nsuch as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) assume a global mixture of component\ndistributions, which may not be realistic for observations from different\npatients. The GLDA model borrows the individual-specific mixture structure from\na popular topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in Natural Language\nProcessing and merges it with the Gaussian component distributions of GMM to\nsuit continuous type data.

Hence, contrary to previous works, we\nconsider frequency division duplexing (FDD) to study the performance of an\nIRS-assisted mMIMO system.

For this reason we employ the joint spatial division\nand multiplexing (JSDM) approach exploiting the structure of the correlation of\nthe channel vectors to reduce the channel state information (CSI) uplink\nfeedback, and thus, allowing the use even of a large number of antennas at the\nbase station.

Three regimes have\nbeen investigated in this context: standard misalignment, large misalignment\nand kinetic misalignment. The latter applies if the axion inherits a large\ninitial velocity in the early universe, such that the field rolls through many\nwiggles during its evolution, before it gets trapped in one minimum. This\nlargely opens the region of parameter space for ALP dark matter towards higher\nvalues for the axion-photon coupling, which can be probed by the whole set of\nnext decade's upcoming experiments. In fact, almost the entire parameter space\nin the [mass, decay constant] plane can now accommodate dark matter. In this\npaper, we show that in kinetic misalignment, the axion field is almost always\nentirely fragmented, meaning that the energy density of the homogeneous field\nis redistributed over higher-mode axions. We present a general\nmodel-independent analytical description of kinetic fragmentation, including\ndiscussion of the modified initial conditions for the mode functions due to the\naxion's initial velocity, and how they impact the growth of the adiabatic\nfluctuations. We calculate precisely the parameter regions corresponding\nrespectively to standard misalignment, kinetic misalignment with weak\nfragmentation, fragmentation after trapping and fragmentation before trapping.\nWhile axion fragmentation can impact the precise determination of the relic\nabundance, another main observational implication is the formation of much\ndenser compact axion halos, that is described in a companion paper. We also\npoint out a new gravitational-wave signature that arises in the large\nmisalignment regime with complete fragmentation and could be seen in\nmeasurements of $\\mu$ distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 19:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Many methods for semi-supervised deep learning have been\ndeveloped, including pseudolabeling, consistency regularization, and\ncontrastive learning techniques. Pseudolabeling methods however are highly\nsusceptible to confounding, in which erroneous pseudolabels are assumed to be\ntrue labels in early iterations, thereby causing the model to reinforce its\nprior biases and thereby fail to generalize to strong predictive performance.\nWe present a new approach to suppress confounding errors through a method we\ndescribe as Semi-supervised Contrastive Outlier removal for Pseudo Expectation\nMaximization (SCOPE). Like basic pseudolabeling, SCOPE is related to\nExpectation Maximization (EM), a latent variable framework which can be\nextended toward understanding cluster-assumption deep semi-supervised\nalgorithms. However, unlike basic pseudolabeling which fails to adequately take\ninto account the probability of the unlabeled samples given the model, SCOPE\nintroduces an outlier suppression term designed to improve the behavior of EM\niteration given a discrimination DNN backbone in the presence of outliers. Our\nresults show that SCOPE greatly improves semi-supervised classification\naccuracy over a baseline, and furthermore when combined with consistency\nregularization achieves the highest reported accuracy for the semi-supervised\nCIFAR-10 classification task using 250 and 4000 labeled samples. Moreover, we\nshow that SCOPE reduces the prevalence of confounding errors during\npseudolabeling iterations by pruning erroneous high-confidence pseudolabeled\nsamples that would otherwise contaminate the labeled set in subsequent\nretraining iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 19:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

In many\napplications, such as predicting cell responses to treatments, pairs of\ninput/output data measures $(\\mu, \\nu)$ that define optimal transport problems\ndo not arise in isolation but are associated with a context $c$, as for\ninstance a treatment when comparing populations of untreated and treated cells.\nTo account for that context in OT estimation, we introduce CondOT, a multi-task\napproach to estimate a family of OT maps conditioned on a context variable,\nusing several pairs of measures $\\left(\\mu_i, \\nu_i\\right)$ tagged with a\ncontext label $c_i$.

Tools built on the message\npassing interface (MPI), such as ScaLAPACK and SLATE, have better scaling\nproperties, but these solutions require specialized knowledge to use. In this\nwork, we present NumS, an array programming library which optimizes NumPy-like\nexpressions on task-based distributed systems. This is achieved through a novel\nscheduler called Load Simulated Hierarchical Scheduling (LSHS). LSHS is a local\nsearch method which optimizes operator placement by minimizing maximum memory\nand network load on any given node within a distributed system. Coupled with a\nheuristic for load balanced data layouts, our approach is capable of attaining\ncommunication lower bounds on some common numerical operations, and our\nempirical study shows that LSHS enhances performance on Ray by decreasing\nnetwork load by a factor of 2x, requiring 4x less memory, and reducing\nexecution time by 10x on the logistic regression problem. On terabyte-scale\ndata, NumS achieves competitive performance to SLATE on DGEMM, up to 20x\nspeedup over Dask on a key operation for tensor factorization, and a 2x speedup\non logistic regression compared to Dask ML and Spark's MLlib.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 20:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 01:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

It is\na waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are\nunable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher\npower transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level.\nAnother major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation. The\nhydrogen mix or pure hydrogen pipeline can both transfer and store the energy\nin the form of hydrogen. However, its potential of accelerating renewable\nintegration has not been investigated. In this paper, hydrogen pipeline\nnetworks, combined with power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P)\nfacilities, are organized to form a Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion\nSystem (HETCS). We investigate the operation of power systems coupled with\nHETCS, and propose the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)\nwith HETCS. The SCUC simulation is conducted on a modified IEEE 24-bus power\nsystem with HETCS. Simulation results show HETCS can substantially reduce the\nrenewable curtailment, CO2 emission, load payment and total operational cost.\nThis study validates the HETCS can be a promising solution to achieve net-zero\nrenewable grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 20:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

For example, brain dynamics are not accurately modeled by\ndifferential equations since their behavior is non-Markovian, i.e. dynamics are\nin part dictated by history. Here, we introduce the Neural IDE (NIDE), a novel\ndeep learning framework based on the theory of IDEs where integral operators\nare learned using neural networks. We test NIDE on several toy and brain\nactivity datasets and demonstrate that NIDE outperforms other models. These\ntasks include time extrapolation as well as predicting dynamics from unseen\ninitial conditions, which we test on whole-cortex activity recordings in freely\nbehaving mice. Further, we show that NIDE can decompose dynamics into their\nMarkovian and non-Markovian constituents via the learned integral operator,\nwhich we test on fMRI brain activity recordings of people on ketamine. Finally,\nthe integrand of the integral operator provides a latent space that gives\ninsight into the underlying dynamics, which we demonstrate on wide-field brain\nimaging recordings. Altogether, NIDE is a novel approach that enables modeling\nof complex non-local dynamics with neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 20:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 18:05:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 16:42:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 03:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-01"}

In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including\nat $\\approx 700$ d, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at\n$0.8-240$ GHz, steeper than $F_\\nu\\propto t^5$ relative to the time of optical\ndiscovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of\nan outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden\nincrease in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our\nmulti-frequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of\nthe radio-emitting outflow, showing that it was launched $\\approx 750$ d after\noptical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with\n$\\beta\\approx 0.25$ and $\\approx 0.6$ for a spherical and a $10^\\circ$ jet\ngeometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is $E_K\\approx 5.8\\times\n10^{49}$ and $\\approx 6.3\\times 10^{49}$ erg, respectively.

Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the\ndelayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past\nnon-relativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE\nSw\\,J1644+57.

Even carefully designed domain-specialized solvers\ncan fail quickly due to the exponential search space on hard instances. Recent\nworks that combine traditional search methods, such as best-first search and\nMonte Carlo tree search, with Deep Neural Networks' (DNN) heuristics have shown\npromising progress and can solve a significant number of hard planning\ninstances beyond specialized solvers. To better understand why these approaches\nwork, we studied the interplay of the policy and value networks of DNN-based\nbest-first search on Sokoban and show the surprising effectiveness of the\npolicy network, further enhanced by the value network, as a guiding heuristic\nfor the search. To further understand the phenomena, we studied the cost\ndistribution of the search algorithms and found that Sokoban instances can have\nheavy-tailed runtime distributions, with tails both on the left and right-hand\nsides. In particular, for the first time, we show the existence of \\textit{left\nheavy tails} and propose an abstract tree model that can empirically explain\nthe appearance of these tails. The experiments show the critical role of the\npolicy network as a powerful heuristic guiding the search, which can lead to\nleft heavy tails with polynomial scaling by avoiding exploring exponentially\nsized subtrees. Our results also demonstrate the importance of random restarts,\nas are widely used in traditional combinatorial solvers, for DNN-based search\nmethods to avoid left and right heavy tails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 21:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

We first define the relatedness network of chess openings\nthat quantifies how similar two openings are to play. In this network, we spot\ncommunities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their\nmutual relationships, information which is hard to obtain from the existing\nclassification of openings. Moreover, we use the relatedness network to\nforecast the future openings players will start to play and we back-test these\npredictions, obtaining performances considerably higher than those of a random\npredictor.

While the proposed\nnovel 2d-NTMDI has the capability of mitigating bi-directional vibrations\nsimultaneously, the system nonlinearity complicates the optimization. A\nnumerical search method is adopted to determine the optimum design parameters\nof the 2d-NTMDI. To evaluate the effectiveness, the proposed 2d-NTMDI is\ndeployed in a 5MW-wind turbine blade suffering from bi-directional vibrations\nin the edgewise and flapwise directions. To this end, an analytical model of a\nwind turbine blade with a 2d-NTMDI is established. The wind loading is computed\nusing blade element momentum theory.

Also, the fatigue damage of the\nwind turbine blades is calculated according to the rain-flow cycle counting\napproach and Miner's law. It is concluded that the optimized design 2d-NTMDI\ncan prolong the blade fatigue life by $35\\%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 23:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Recent experiments imply upper bounds on bulk dielectric loss\ntangents on the order of $100$ parts-per-billion, but because these inferences\nare drawn from fully fabricated devices with many loss channels, they do not\ndefinitively implicate or exonerate the dielectric. To resolve this ambiguity,\nwe have devised a measurement method capable of separating and resolving bulk\ndielectric loss with a sensitivity at the level of $5$ parts per billion. The\nmethod, which we call the dielectric dipper, involves the in-situ insertion of\na dielectric sample into a high-quality microwave cavity mode. Smoothly varying\nthe sample's participation in the cavity mode enables a differential\nmeasurement of the sample's dielectric loss tangent. The dielectric dipper can\nprobe the low-power behavior of dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures, and does\nso without the need for any lithographic process, enabling controlled\ncomparisons of substrate materials and processing techniques. We demonstrate\nthe method with measurements of EFG sapphire, from which we infer a bulk loss\ntangent of $62(7) \\times 10^{-9}$ and a substrate-air interface loss tangent of\n$12(2) \\times 10^{-4}$. For a typical transmon, this bulk loss tangent would\nlimit device quality factors to less than $20$ million, suggesting that bulk\nloss is likely the dominant loss mechanism in the longest-lived transmons on\nsapphire. We also demonstrate this method on HEMEX sapphire and bound its bulk\nloss tangent to be less than $15(5) \\times 10^{-9}$. As this bound is about 3\ntimes smaller than the bulk loss tangent of EFG sapphire, use of HEMEX sapphire\nas a substrate would lift the bulk dielectric coherence limit of a typical\ntransmon qubit to several milliseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 03:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

The most unique features of SS433 are the presence of\nthe precessing, mildly relativistic jets and the obscuration of the central\nengine, which are considered to be due to a supercritical accretion on to the\ncentral compact object. The jets are likely to be ejected from the innermost\nregion of the accretion flow. The concept of the accretion ring (Inoue 2021,\nPASJ, 73,795) is applied to the outer boundary of the accretion flow and the\nring is supposed to have a precession. The accretion ring is expected to extend\na two-layer outflow of a thin excretion disk and a thick excretion flow, as\nwell as the accretion flow. The thin excretion disk is discussed to eventually\nform the optically thick excretion belt along the Roche lobe around the compact\nobject, contributing to the obscuration of the central engine. The thick\nexcretion flow is likely to turn to the supersonic wind (disk wind) with the\nterminal velocity of $\\sim 10^{8}$ cm s$^{-1}$ and to collide with the SNR\nmatter at the distance of $\\sim 10^{18}$ cm. The interactions of the jets with\nthe disk wind are considered to cause the features of the jets observed at the\ndistances of 10$^{14} \\sim 10^{15}$ cm and $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm. Finally, it is\ndiscussed that the jets are braked by the SNR matter at the distance of\n$\\sim$10 pc and the momentum carried by the jet is transferred to the SNR\nmatter shoved by the jet. The SNR matter pushed to the inside of the precession\ncone is expected to gather along the cone axis and to form the elongated\nstructures in the east and west directions from the main W50 structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 01:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Moreover, it is shown that the theory can be applied\nto dynamical systems.\n  Besides, new interpretations on solvability of polynomials and solvability of\nhomogeneous linear differential equations are introduced, and these ideas are\nroughly generalized for \"general\" equation solving in terms of the generalized\nGalois theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 02:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 10:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 10:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 09:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 12:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 02:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

The efficiency of graph storage is crucial for these\napplications. Generally speaking, the tune tasks of graph storage rely on the\ndatabase administrators (DBAs) to find the best graph storage. However, DBAs\nmake the tune decisions by mainly relying on their experiences and intuition.\nDue to the limitations of DBAs's experiences, the tunes may have an uncertain\nperformance and conduct worse efficiency. In this paper, we observe that an\nestimator of graph workload has the potential to guarantee the performance of\ntune operations. Unfortunately, because of the complex characteristics of graph\nevaluation task, there exists no mature estimator for graph workload. We\nformulate the evaluation task of graph workload as a classification task and\ncarefully design the feature engineering process, including graph data\nfeatures, graph workload features and graph storage features. Considering the\ncomplex features of graph and the huge time consumption in graph workload\nexecution, it is difficult for the graph workload estimator to obtain enough\ntraining set. So, we propose an active auto-estimator (AAE) for the graph\nworkload evaluation by combining the active learning and deep learning. AAE\ncould achieve good evaluation efficiency with limited training set. We test the\ntime efficiency and evaluation accuracy of AAE with two open source graph data,\nLDBC and Freebase. Experimental results show that our estimator could\nefficiently complete the graph workload evaluation in milliseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 02:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

The X-ray\nluminosity in 13 objects are newly processed by ourself, while the other 2\nsources are gathered from archival data. Results. It is found that the average\nX-ray flux of AGNs with EUV deficit are 4.5 times larger than that of\nradio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs), while the slope of relationship between the\noptical-UV luminosity ($L_{\\rm UV}$) and the X-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm X}$) is\nfound to be similar with that of RQAGNs. For comparison, the average X-ray flux\nof radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) without EUV deficit is about 2-3 times larger than\nthat of RQAGNs. A strong positive correlation between $\\alpha_{\\rm EUV}$ and\nradio-loudness ($R_{\\rm UV}$) is also reported. However, there is no strong\nrelationship between $L_{\\rm X}$ and the radio luminosity ($L_{\\rm R}$).\nConclusions. Both the excess of X-ray emission of RLAGNs with EUV deficit and\nthe strong $\\alpha_{\\rm EUV}$-$R_{\\rm UV}$ relationship can be qualitatively\nexplained with MAD scenario, which can help to constrain the theoretical model\nof MAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 03:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

We find that\nthe corona height changes from h ~ 3 $\\ r_{\\rm g}$ during the lowest luminosity\nstate to ~ $25 \\ r_{\\rm g}$ during the highest luminosity state. This provides\nfurther evidence that the source height from the reverberation data is\nsignificantly larger than what constrained by the spectral analysis.\nFurthermore, as the corona height increases, the energy spectrum tends to be\nsofter while the observed fractional excess variance, $F_{\\rm var}$, reduces.\nWe find that the PSD normalization is strongly correlated with $F_{\\rm var}$,\nand moderately correlated with the PSD bending index. Therefore, the\nnormalization is dependent on accretion rate that controls the intrinsic shape\nof the PSD. While the intrinsic variability of the disk is manifested by the\nreverberation signals, the disk and corona may evolve independently. Our\nresults suggest that, during the source height increases, the disk itself\ngenerates less overall variability power but more high-frequency variability\nresulting in the PSD spectrum that flattens out (i.e. the inner disk becomes\nmore active). Using the luminosity-bin data, the hint of Lorentzian component\nis seen, with the peak appearing at lower frequencies with increasing\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 03:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Currently, acoustic wave manipulation typically relies on either\nacoustic metasurfaces or phased array transducers. The elements of metasurfaces\nare designed and optimized for a target frequency, which thus limits their\nbandwidth. Phased array transducers, suffering from high-cost and complex\ncontrol circuits, are usually limited by the array size and the filling ratio\nof the control units. In this work, we introduce active coding piezoelectric\nmetasurfaces; demonstrate commonly implemented acoustic wave manipulation\nfunctionalities such as beam steering, beam focusing and vortex beam focusing,\nacoustic tweezers; and eventually realize ultrasound imaging. The information\ncoded on the piezoelectric metasurfaces herein is frequency independent and\noriginates from the polarization directions, pointing either up or down, of the\npiezoelectric materials. Such a piezoelectric metasurface is driven by a single\nelectrode and acts as a controllable active sound source, which combines the\nadvantages of acoustic metasurfaces and phased array transducers while keeping\nthe devices structurally simple and compact.

However, recent hybrid-/transformer-based approaches mainly focus on the\nbenefits of transformers in capturing long-range dependency while ignoring the\nissues of their daunting computational complexity, high training costs, and\nredundant dependency. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive pruning to\ntransformers for medical image segmentation and propose a lightweight and\neffective hybrid network APFormer. To our best knowledge, this is the first\nwork on transformer pruning for medical image analysis tasks. The key features\nof APFormer mainly are self-supervised self-attention (SSA) to improve the\nconvergence of dependency establishment, Gaussian-prior relative position\nembedding (GRPE) to foster the learning of position information, and adaptive\npruning to eliminate redundant computations and perception information.\nSpecifically, SSA and GRPE consider the well-converged dependency distribution\nand the Gaussian heatmap distribution separately as the prior knowledge of\nself-attention and position embedding to ease the training of transformers and\nlay a solid foundation for the following pruning operation. Then, adaptive\ntransformer pruning, both query-wise and dependency-wise, is performed by\nadjusting the gate control parameters for both complexity reduction and\nperformance improvement. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets\ndemonstrate the prominent segmentation performance of APFormer against the\nstate-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and lower GFLOPs. More\nimportantly, we prove, through ablation studies, that adaptive pruning can work\nas a plug-n-play module for performance improvement on other\nhybrid-/transformer-based methods.

Physically-based\nremote sensing models relying on sensible heat flux estimates, like the\ntwo-source energy balance model, could benefit from considering more explicitly\nthe key effect of stomatal regulation on dryland ET. The objective of this\nstudy is to assess the value of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a\nproxy for photosynthesis, to constrain the canopy conductance (Gc) of an\noptimal stomatal model within a two-source energy balance model in drylands. We\nassessed our ET estimation using in situ eddy covariance GPP as a benchmark,\nand compared with results from using the Contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll\nfluorescence (CSIF) remote sensing product instead of GPP, with and without the\neffect of root-zone soil moisture on the Gc. The estimated ET was robust across\nfour steppes and two tree-grass dryland ecosystem. Comparison of ET simulated\nagainst in situ GPP yielded an average R2 of 0.73 (0.86) and RMSE of 0.031\n(0.36) mm at half-hourly (daily) timescale. Including explicitly the soil\nmoisture effect on Gc, increased the R2 to 0.76 (0.89). For the CSIF model, the\naverage R2 for ET estimates also improved when including the effect of soil\nmoisture: from 0.65 (0.79) to 0.71 (0.84), with RMSE ranging between 0.023\n(0.22) and 0.043 (0.54) mm depending on the site. Our results demonstrate the\ncapacity of SIF to estimate subdaily and daily ET fluxes under very low ET\nconditions. SIF can provide effective vegetation signals to constrain stomatal\nconductance and partition ET into T and E in drylands. This approach could be\nextended for regional estimates using remote sensing SIF estimates such as\nCSIF, TROPOMI-SIF, or the upcoming FLEX mission, among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 06:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

We prove that for a wide parameter range (e.g., convex price impact\nfunctions), equilibria exist and form a complete lattice. This is contrasted\nwith a non-existence result for concave price impact functions. Moreover, we\nstudy the convergence of best-response dynamics towards equilibria when they\nexist. In general, best-response dynamics may cycle. However, in many settings\nthey are guaranteed to converge to the socially optimal equilibrium when\nstarting from a natural initial state. Moreover, we discuss a simplified\nvariant of the dynamics that is less informationally demanding and converges to\nthe same equilibria. We compare the dynamics in terms of convergence speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 12:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Although a universal profile\nwas evidenced, confirming the validity of the general scaling theory, the\nparallel study of the power spectrum scaling under the same conditions was not\nperformed. The puzzling observation is that in the majority of healthy neuronal\nsystems the power spectrum exhibits a behaviour close to $1/f$, rather than\nBrown, noise.

A basic\nmechanism assumes a phenotypically homogeneous population that secretes its own\nattractant, with the well known system introduced more than five decades ago by\nKeller and Segel proving resolutely popular in modelling studies. The typical\nassumption of population phenotypic homogeneity, however, often lies at odds\nwith the heterogeneity of natural systems, where populations may comprise\ndistinct phenotypes that vary according to their chemotactic ability,\nattractant secretion, {\\it etc}. To initiate an understanding into how this\ndiversity can impact on autoaggregation, we propose a simple extension to the\nclassical Keller and Segel model, in which the population is divided into two\ndistinct phenotypes: those performing chemotaxis and those producing\nattractant.

Specifically, we\nfocus on the downlink communication of an indoor MIMO VLC system and aim to\nminimize the mean square error (MSE) of demodulated signals at the receiver. To\nthis end, the MIMO channel gain of the IRS-aided VLC is first derived under the\npoint source assumption, based on which the MSE minimization problem is then\nformulated subject to the emission power constraints. Next, we propose an\nalternating optimization algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into\nthree subproblems, to iteratively optimize the IRS configuration, the precoding\nand detection matrices for minimizing the MSE. Moreover, theoretical analysis\non the performance of the proposed algorithm in high and low signal-to-noise\nrate (SNR) regimes is provided, revealing that the joint optimization process\ncan be simplified in such special cases, and the algorithm's convergence\nproperty and computational complexity are also discussed.

On the other hand, data can\nalso be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary\nusers but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users'\ncontributions. In this paper, we explore an integrated paradigm called \"hybrid\nsensing\" that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary\nmanner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not\ncovered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in\ncalibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that\ncan be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In\nthis paper, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user\nprivacy -- IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private\nuser data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a\nprivacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of\nour system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available\nparking spaces in outdoor parking lots.

This failure mode of EV models is generally\nrelated to the fact that the transport of momentum and scalar depends on\ndifferent Reynolds stress components. The present work addresses two common\nissues relevant to such failures in turbulent scalar transport around\nobstacles. The first issue is the general overprediction of scalar transfer\nnear the upwind surfaces, which is primarily attributed to the absence of\nwall-blocking mechanism in conventional EV models. We accordingly propose a\nShear-Preserving-Wall-Blocking (SPWB) method to analytically correct the\noverpredicted wall-normal stress under the realizability constraint. The second\nissue is the general underprediction of scalar transfer in the downstream large\nseparation regions, which is essentially attributed to the presence of vortex\nshedding invalidating the scaling ground in conventional EV models' dissipation\nclosures. We accordingly apply the recently proposed Double-Scale\nDouble-Linear-EV (DSDL) model to scalar transport predictions. Consequently, a\nhybrid model SPWB-DSDL is developed. The model is then applied to two test\ncases, of which the first features a bluff obstacle with an upstream\nimpingement flow and a downstream two-dimensional separation and the second a\nstreamlined obstacle with an upstream concave surface flow and a downstream\nthree-dimensional separation. In the two cases, the SPWB-DSDL model is capable\nof simultaneously yielding reasonable results of mean flow field, turbulence\nenergy and stress, and scalar transfer in both upstream and downstream regions,\nthus demonstrating significant improvement upon a classical EV model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Approach: We compare quantitatively 13 different\naugmentations with two different predictive tasks, datasets and models, using\nthree different types of experiments. Main results: We demonstrate that\nemploying the adequate data augmentations can bring up to 45% accuracy\nimprovements in low data regimes compared to the same model trained without any\naugmentation.

A\npopular scenario is morphing from an initial two-dimensional (2D) shape that is\nflat to a three-dimensional (3D) target shape. One of the exciting\nmanufacturing paradigms is transforming flat 2D sheets with prescribed cuts\n(i.e. kirigami) into 3D structures. By employing the formalism of the 'tapered\nelastica' equation, we develop an inverse design framework to predict the shape\nof the 2D cut pattern that would generate a desired axisymmetric 3D shape. Our\nprevious work has shown that tessellated 3D structures can be achieved by\ndesigning both the width and thickness of the cut 2D sheet to have particular\ntapered designs. However, the fabrication of a sample with variable thickness\nis quite challenging. Here we propose a new strategy -- perforating the cut\nsheet with tapered width but uniform thickness to introduce a distribution of\nporosity. We refer to this strategy as perforated kirigami and show how the\nporosity function can be calculated from our theoretical model. The porosity\ndistribution can easily be realized by laser cutting and modifies the bending\nstiffness of the sheet to yield a desired elastic deformation upon buckling. To\nverify our theoretical approach, we conduct finite element simulations and\nphysical experiments.

However, a full understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for the cooperation of bone toughness and\nbiological functions, with important implications in bone ageing, osteoporosis\nand tissue repair, has yet to be achieved. In particular, how micro-damage\nnucleation, needed for tissue remodeling, does not evolve into catastrophic\nfailure in such a stiff material, still remains a partial enigma, cement lines,\ninterfaces and sacrificial elements alone not providing a definitive answer to\nthe question. Here, we bring to light a novel stress-based bone toughening\nmechanism, calling into play the nearly-symmetrical, chiral and hierarchical\narchitecture of the osteons, demonstrating that their arrangement\nsimultaneously gives rise to stress states alternating in sign along the osteon\nradius and to localized stress amplifications, both in the tensile and\ncompressive regimes. This unveils a previously unforeseen synergistic mechanism\nallowing micro-damage accumulation without propagating cracks, kindled by the\ncontrast between crack-opening due to tensile hoop stresses and crack-stopping\ndue to compressive stresses at the crack tips in adjacent lamellae, which seal\nthe crack ends conferring toughness to bone well beyond that predicted by\ncurrent models. Furthermore, shear stresses occur at the lamellar interfaces,\ncontributing with fluid flow to mechanically stimulate the osteocytes and to\namplify the bone signalling.

In the warm\nphase of the Galactic plane (n = 1/cm3, T = 8000 K), an organised magnetic\nfield of strength 7 microG has profound consequences on the morphology of the\nwind bubble of massive stars at rest.

One of the most relevant challenges is\ncoordinating the decisions of team members who work from different time zones.\nIntuition suggests that task performance should improve if the team members'\ndecisions are coordinated. However, previous research suggests that the effect\nof coordination on task performance is ambiguous. Specifically, the effect of\ncoordination on task performance depends on aspects such as the team members'\nlearning and the changes in team composition over time. This paper aims to\nunderstand how individual learning and team composition moderate the\nrelationship between coordination and task performance. We implement an\nagent-based modeling approach based on the NK-framework to fulfill our research\nobjective. Our results suggest that both factors have moderating effects.\nSpecifically, we find that excessively increasing individual learning is\nharmful for the task performance of fully autonomous teams, but less\ndetrimental for teams that coordinate their decisions. In addition, we find\nthat teams that coordinate their decisions benefit from changing their\ncomposition in the short-term, but fully autonomous teams do not. In\nconclusion, teams that coordinate their decisions benefit more from individual\nlearning and dynamic composition than teams that do not coordinate.\nNevertheless, we should note that the existence of moderating effects does not\nimply that coordination improves task performance.

Highly magnetized rotating neutron stars (pulsars)\nare frequently observed by radio telescopes (and in other frequencies), where\nthe glitch is observed as irregular arrival times of pulses which are otherwise\nvery regular. A glitch in an isolated neutron star can excite the fundamental\n(f)-mode oscillations which can lead to gravitational wave generation.\nElectromagnetic observations of pulsars (and hence pulsar glitches) require the\npulsar to be oriented so that the jet is pointed toward the detector, but this\nis not a requirement for gravitational wave emission which is more isotropic\nand not jetlike. Hence, gravitational wave observations have the potential to\nuncover nearby neutron stars where the jet is not pointed towards the Earth. In\nthis work, we study the prospects of finding glitching neutron stars using a\ngeneric all-sky search for short-duration gravitational wave transients. The\nanalysis covers the high-frequency range from $1-4$ kHz of LIGO-Virgo detectors\nfor signals up to a few seconds. We set upper limits for the third observing\nrun of the LIGO-Virgo detectors and present the prospects for upcoming\nobserving runs of LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO India. We find the detectable\nglitch size will be around $10^{-5}$ Hz for the fifth observing run for pulsars\nwith spin frequencies and distances comparable to the Vela pulsar. We also\npresent the prospects of localizing the direction in the sky of these sources\nwith gravitational waves alone, which can facilitate electromagnetic follow-up.\nWe find that for the five detector configuration, the localization capability\nfor a glitch size of $10^{-5}$ Hz is around $132\\,\\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ at\n$1\\sigma$ confidence for $50\\%$ of events with distance and spin frequency as\nthat of Vela.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 10:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 05:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 14:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

It is natural to consider the hull-variation\nproblem when a linear code ${\\bf C}$ is transformed to an equivalent code ${\\bf\nv} \\cdot {\\bf C}$. In this paper we introduce the maximal hull dimension as an\ninvariant of a linear code with respect to the equivalent transformations. Then\nsome basic properties of the maximal hull dimension are studied. We prove that\nfor a nonnegative integer $h$ satisfying $0 \\leq h \\leq n-1$, a linear $[2n,\nn]_q$ self-dual code is equivalent to a linear $h$-dimension hull code. On the\nopposite direction we prove that a linear LCD code over ${\\bf F}_{2^s}$\nsatisfying $d\\geq 2$ and $d^{\\perp} \\geq 2$ is equivalent to a linear\none-dimension hull code under a weak condition. Several new families of LCD\nnegacyclic codes and LCD BCH codes over ${\\bf F}_3$ are also constructed. Our\nmethod can be applied to the generalized Reed-Solomon codes and the generalized\ntwisted Reed-Solomon codes to construct arbitrary dimension hull MDS codes.\nSome new entanglement-assisted quantum error-correction (EAQEC) codes including\nMDS and almost MDS EAQEC codes are constructed. Many EAQEC codes over small\nfields are constructed from optimal Hermitian self-dual codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 10:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 15:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

Among the numerous\ncategories of biometric traits, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based biometrics is\nrecognized as a promising method owing to its unique characteristics. This\npaper provides an experimental evaluation of the effect of auditory stimuli\n(AS) on EEG-based biometrics by studying the following features: i) general\nchange in AS-aided EEG-based biometric authentication in comparison with\nnon-AS-aided EEG-based biometric authentication, ii) role of the language of\nthe AS and ii) influence of the conduction method of the AS. Our results show\nthat the presence of an AS can improve authentication performance by 9.27%.\nAdditionally, the performance achieved with an in-ear AS is better than that\nobtained using a bone-conducting AS. Finally, we verify that performance is\nindependent of the language of the AS. The results of this work provide a step\nforward towards designing a robust EEG-based authentication system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 10:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

However, previous\nmethods based on data-independent hashing rely on random projections or manual\nconstruction, inapplicable to address specific data issues (e.g.,\nhigh-dimensionality and heterogeneity) due to their insensitivity to data\ncharacteristics. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel deep\nhashing network to learn similarity-preserving compact hash codes for efficient\ncase retrieval and proposes a deep-hashing-enabled CBR model HeCBR.\nSpecifically, we introduce position embedding to represent heterogeneous\nfeatures and utilize a multilinear interaction layer to obtain case embeddings,\nwhich effectively filtrates zero-valued features to tackle high-dimensionality\nand sparsity and captures inter-feature couplings. Then, we feed the case\nembeddings into fully-connected layers, and subsequently a hash layer generates\nhash codes with a quantization regularizer to control the quantization loss\nduring relaxation. To cater to incremental learning of CBR, we further propose\nan adaptive learning strategy to update the hash function. Extensive\nexperiments on public datasets show that HeCBR greatly reduces storage and\nsignificantly accelerates case retrieval. HeCBR achieves desirable performance\ncompared with the state-of-the-art CBR methods and performs significantly\nbetter than hashing-based CBR methods in classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 10:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

In order to provide this\nholistic approach of ubiquity in communication and computation, an integration\nof satellite, aerial and terrestrial networks is foreseen. In particular, the\nrising amount of applications such as In-Flight Entertainment and Connectivity\nServices (IFECS) and SDN-enabled satellites renders network management more\nchallenging. Moreover, due to the stringent Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirements edge computing gains in importance for these applications. Here,\nnetwork performance can be boosted by considering components of the aerial\nnetwork, like aircrafts, as potential Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) nodes.\nThus, we propose an Aerial-Aided Multi-Access Edge Computing (AA-MEC)\narchitecture that provides a framework for optimal management of computing\nresources and internet-based services in the sky. Furthermore, we formulate\noptimization problems to minimize the network latency for the two use cases of\nproviding IFECS to other aircrafts in the sky and providing services for\noffloading AI/ML-tasks from satellites. Due to the dynamic nature of the\nsatellite and aerial networks, we propose a re-configurable optimization. For\nthe transforming network we continuously identify the optimal MEC node for each\napplication and the optimal path to the destination MEC node. In summary, our\nresults demonstrate that using AA-MEC improves network latency performance by\n10.43% compared to the traditional approach of using only terrestrial MEC nodes\nfor latency-critical applications such as online gaming.

We specifically study a class of transformations called the Linear\nBasis Warps (LBWs), which contains the affine transformation and most of the\nusual deformation models, such as the Thin-Plate Spline (TPS). GPA with\ndeformations is a nonconvex underconstrained problem. We resolve the\nfundamental ambiguities of deformable GPA using two shape constraints requiring\nthe eigenvalues of the shape covariance. These eigenvalues can be computed\nindependently as a prior or posterior. We give a closed-form and optimal\nsolution to deformable GPA based on an eigenvalue decomposition. This solution\nhandles regularization, favoring smooth deformation fields. It requires the\ntransformation model to satisfy a fundamental property of free-translations,\nwhich asserts that the model can implement any translation. We show that this\nproperty fortunately holds true for most common transformation models,\nincluding the affine and TPS models. For the other models, we give another\nclosed-form solution to GPA, which agrees exactly with the first solution for\nmodels with free-translation.

This paper addresses the issue by proposing a novel robot\nmotion generation model, inspired by a human cognitive structure. The model\nincorporates a state-driven active top-down visual attention module, which\nacquires attentions that can actively change targets based on task states. We\nterm such attentions as role-based attentions, since the acquired attention\ndirected to targets that shared a coherent role throughout the motion.

By contrast, humans can quickly learn to accurately recognise\nanatomy of interest from medical (e.g. MRI and CT) images with some limited\nguidance. Such recognition ability can easily generalise to new images from\ndifferent clinical centres. This rapid and generalisable learning ability is\nmostly due to the compositional structure of image patterns in the human brain,\nwhich is less incorporated in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we\nmodel the compositional components (i.e. patterns) of human anatomy as\nlearnable von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels, which are robust to images collected\nfrom different domains (e.g. clinical centres). The image features can be\ndecomposed to (or composed by) the components with the composing operations,\ni.e. the vMF likelihoods. The vMF likelihoods tell how likely each anatomical\npart is at each position of the image. Hence, the segmentation mask can be\npredicted based on the vMF likelihoods. Moreover, with a reconstruction module,\nunlabeled data can also be used to learn the vMF kernels and likelihoods by\nrecombining them to reconstruct the input image. Extensive experiments show\nthat the proposed vMFNet achieves improved generalisation performance on two\nbenchmarks, especially when annotations are limited.

It provides a way to probe galactic halo rotation, and to\nconstrain the baryon fraction in the galactic halos. The frequency independence\nof the observed data provides a strong indication of the Doppler shift nature\nof the effect, due to the galactic halo rotation. It was proposed that this\neffect may arise from the emission of cold gas clouds populating the galactic\nhalos. However, in order to confirm this view, other effects that might give\nrise to a temperature asymmetry in the CMB data, have to be considered and\nstudied in detail. The main aim of the present paper is to estimate the\ncontribution in the CMB temperature asymmetry data due to the free-free\nemission by hot gas (particularly electrons) through the rotational kinetic\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (rkSZ) effect. We concentrate, in particular, on the M31\ngalactic halo and compare the estimated values of the rkSZ induced temperature\nasymmetry with those obtained by using the SMICA pipeline of the Planck data\nrelease, already employed to project out the SZ sources and for lensing\nstudies. As an additional consistency check, we also verified that the hot gas\ndiffuse emission in the X-ray band does not exceed that detected in the soft\nX-ray band by ROSAT observations.

For this reason, previous studies have\nformulated vehicle routing problems with workload-balance objectives or\nconstraints, leading to trade-off solutions between routing costs and workload\nequity. These methods consider a single planning period; however, equity is\noften sought over several days in practice. In this work, we show that workload\nequity over multiple periods can be achieved without impact on transportation\ncosts when the planning horizon is sufficiently large. To achieve this, we\ndesign a two-phase method to solve multi-period vehicle routing problems with\nworkload balance. Firstly, our approach produces solutions with minimal\ndistance for each period. Next, the resulting routes are allocated to drivers\nto obtain equitable workloads over the planning horizon. We conduct extensive\nnumerical experiments to measure the performance of the proposed approach and\nthe level of workload equity achieved for different planning-horizon lengths.\nFor horizons of five days or more, we observe that near-optimal workload equity\nand optimal routing costs are jointly achievable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 13:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

Consistency refers to\nthe correctness of databases and is a crucial property for many applications,\nsuch as financial and banking services. However, there exist typical challenges\nfor consistency. Theoretically, the current two definitions of consistency\nexpress quite different meanings, which are causal and sometimes controversial.\nPractically, it is notorious to check the consistency of databases, especially\nin terms of the verification cost. This paper proposes Coo, a framework to\ncheck the consistency of databases. Specifically, Coo has the following\nadvancements. First, Coo proposes partial order pair (POP) graph, which has a\nbetter expressiveness on transaction conflicts in a schedule by considering\nstateful information like Commit and Abort. By POP graph with no cycle, Coo\ndefines consistency completely. Secondly, Coo can construct inconsistent test\ncases based on POP cycles.

Magnetostrophic oscillations with a\nfrequency much smaller than the stellar rotation frequency have recently been\nproposed to account for the spin-orbit commensurability observed in several\nplanet-hosting stars. In principle, they can be resonantly excited in an\nisolated slender magnetic flux tube by a Fourier component of the time-varying\ntidal potential with a very low frequency in the reference frame rotating with\nthe host. However, due to the weakness of such high-order tidal components, a\nmechanism is required to lock the oscillations in phase with the forcing for\nlong time intervals ($10^{3}-10^{7}$ years) in order to allow the oscillation\namplitude to grow. We propose that the locking mechanism is an autoresonance\nproduced by the non-linear dependence of the oscillation frequency on its\namplitude. We suggest that the angular momentum loss rate is remarkably reduced\nin hosts entering autoresonance that contributes to maintain those systems in\nthat regime for a long time. We apply our model to a sample of ten systems\nshowing spin-orbit commensurability and estimate the maximum drifts of the\nrelevant tidal potential frequencies that allow them to enter the autoresonant\nregime. Such drifts are compared with the expected drifts owing to the tidal\nevolution of the planetary orbits and the stellar angular momentum loss in the\nmagnetized winds finding that autoresonance is a viable mechanism in eight\nsystems, at least in our idealized model. The duration of the autoresonant\nregime and the associated spin-orbit commensurability may be comparable with\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of the host stars, indicating that gyrochronology\nmay not be applicable to those hosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 13:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Using Kinetically Limited Minimization (KLM), an unconstrained\ncrystal structure prediction algorithm, and prototype sampling based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we have discovered 17 new Ferrovalley materials\n(rare-earth iodides RI$_2$, where R is a rare-earth element belonging to Sc, Y,\nor La-Lu, and I is Iodine). The rare-earth iodides are layered and demonstrate\n2H, 1T, or 1T$_d$ phase as the ground-state in bulk, analogous to transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The calculated exfoliation energy of monolayers\nis comparable to that of graphene and TMDCs, suggesting possible experimental\nsynthesis. The monolayers in the 2H phase exhibit two-dimensional\nferromagnetism due to unpaired electrons in $d$ and $f$ orbitals. Throughout\nthe rare-earth series, $d$ bands show valley polarization at $K$ and $\\bar{K}$\npoints in the Brillouin zone near the Fermi level. Due to strong magnetic\nexchange interaction and spin-orbit coupling, large intrinsic valley\npolarization in the range of 15-143 meV without external stimuli is observed,\nwhich can be tuned and enhanced by applying a biaxial strain. These valleys can\nselectively be probed and manipulated for information storage and processing,\npotentially offering superior performance beyond conventional electronics and\nspintronics. We further show that the 2H ferromagnetic phase of RI$_2$\nmonolayers possesses non-zero Berry curvature and exhibits the valley Hall\neffect with considerable anomalous Hall conductivity.

The burst is characterized by a maximum\nintensity scaling with the square of the number of atoms $N$ and a temporal\nwidth reduced by $N$ compared to the single atom spontaneous decay time. Both\neffects are usually attributed to a synchronization of the electric dipole\nmoments of the atoms occurring during the process of light emission. Contrary\nto this explanation, it was recently shown by use of a quantum path description\nthat the peak intensity results from the quantum correlations among the atoms\nwhen occupying symmetric Dicke states. Here we investigate from this\nperspective the temporal evolution of the ensemble, starting in the small\nsample limit, i.e., when the atoms have mutual separations much smaller than\nthe transition wavelength $\\lambda$ and pass down the ladder of symmetric Dicke\nstates. In addition, we explore the temporal evolution for the case of\nnon-interacting atoms with mutual separations much larger than $\\lambda$.

Reliable biometry estimation depends on the precise detection\nof landmarks in standard ultrasound planes. Manual annotation can be\ntime-consuming and operator dependent task, and may results in high\nmeasurements variability. Existing methods for automatic fetal biometry rely on\ninitial automatic fetal structure segmentation followed by geometric landmark\ndetection. However, segmentation annotations are time-consuming and may be\ninaccurate, and landmark detection requires developing measurement-specific\ngeometric methods. This paper describes BiometryNet, an end-to-end landmark\nregression framework for fetal biometry estimation that overcomes these\nlimitations. It includes a novel Dynamic Orientation Determination (DOD) method\nfor enforcing measurement-specific orientation consistency during network\ntraining. DOD reduces variabilities in network training, increases landmark\nlocalization accuracy, thus yields accurate and robust biometric measurements.\nTo validate our method, we assembled a dataset of 3,398 ultrasound images from\n1,829 subjects acquired in three clinical sites with seven different ultrasound\ndevices. Comparison and cross-validation of three different biometric\nmeasurements on two independent datasets shows that BiometryNet is robust and\nyields accurate measurements whose errors are lower than the clinically\npermissible errors, outperforming other existing automated biometry estimation\nmethods.

We consider the large-time asymptotics of the\nexpected position: For waiting time densities with finite mean the walker\nremains in the average localized close to the departure site whereas escapes\nfor fat-tailed waiting-time densities (i.e. densities with infinite mean) by a\nsublinear power-law. We explore anomalous diffusion features by accounting for\nthe `aging effect' as a hallmark of non-Markovianity where the discrete-time\nversion of the `aging renewal process' comes into play. By deriving pertinent\ndistributions of this process we obtain explicit formulae for the variance when\nthe waiting-times are Sibuya-distributed. In this case and generally for\nfat-tailed waiting time PDFs a $t^2$-ballistic superdiffusive scaling emerges\nin the large time limit. In contrast if the waiting time PDF between the step\nreversals is light-tailed (`narrow' with finite mean and variance) the walk\nexhibits normal diffusion and for `broad' waiting time PDFs (with finite mean\nand infinite variance) superdiffusive large time scaling. We also consider\ntime-changed versions where the walk is subordinated to a continuous-time point\nprocess such as the time-fractional Poisson process. This defines a new class\nof biased continuous-time random walks exhibiting several regimes of anomalous\ndiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 14:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 15:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 09:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The application of\ndata reduction rules during the preprocessing of problem instances allows in\nmany cases to considerably shrink their size, or even solve them directly.\nCommonly, these data reduction rules are applied exhaustively and in some fixed\norder to obtain irreducible instances. It was often observed that by changing\nthe order of the rules, different irreducible instances can be obtained. We\npropose to \"undo\" data reduction rules on irreducible instances, by which they\nbecome larger, and then subsequently apply data reduction rules again to shrink\nthem. We show that this somewhat counter-intuitive approach can lead to\nsignificantly smaller irreducible instances. The process of undoing data\nreduction rules is not limited to \"rolling back\" data reduction rules applied\nto the instance during preprocessing.

Distortion type identification and degradation level determination is\nemployed as an auxiliary task to train a deep learning model containing a deep\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts spatial features, as well as a\nrecurrent unit that captures temporal information. The model is trained using a\ncontrastive loss and we therefore refer to this training framework and\nresulting model as CONtrastive VIdeo Quality EstimaTor (CONVIQT). During\ntesting, the weights of the trained model are frozen, and a linear regressor\nmaps the learned features to quality scores in a no-reference (NR) setting. We\nconduct comprehensive evaluations of the proposed model on multiple VQA\ndatabases by analyzing the correlations between model predictions and\nground-truth quality ratings, and achieve competitive performance when compared\nto state-of-the-art NR-VQA models, even though it is not trained on those\ndatabases.

The steady state correlations and the mean square displacement are\nstudied when the particle is confined as well as when it is set free from the\ntrap. With the help of both numerical simulation and analytical calculations,\nwe observe that inertia plays a crucial role in the dynamics in the presence of\na magnetic field. In a highly viscous medium where the inertial effects are\nnegligible, the magnetic field has no influence on the correlated behaviour of\nposition as well as velocity. In the time asymptotic limit, the overall\ndisplacement of the confined harmonic particle gets enhanced by the presence of\nmagnetic field and saturates for a stronger magnetic field. On the other hand,\nwhen the particle is set free, the overall displacement gets suppressed and\napproaches zero when strength of the field is very high. Interestingly, it is\nseen that in the time asymptotic limit, the confined harmonic particle behaves\nlike a passive particle and becomes independent of the activity, especially in\nthe presence of a very strong magnetic field. Similarly, for a free particle\nthe mean square displacement in the long time limit becomes independent of\nactivity even for a longer persistence of noise correlation in the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 15:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Shazam\nidentifies the recording of it, not the music. This is because Shazam matches\nthe variation in volume, not the frequencies of the sound. This research\nattempts to match music the way humans understand it: by the frequency spectrum\nof music, not the volume variation. Essentially, the idea is to precompute the\nfrequency spectrums of all the music in the database, then take the unknown\npiece and try to match its frequency spectrum against every segment of every\nmusic in the database. I did it by matching the frequency spectrum of the\nunknown piece to our database by sliding the window by 0.1 seconds and\ncalculating the error by taking Absolute value, normalizing the audio,\nsubtracting the normalized arrays, and taking the sum of absolute differences.\nThe segment that shows the least error is considered the candidate for the\nmatch. The matching performance proved to be dependent on the complexity of the\nmusic. Matching simple music, such as single note pieces, was successful.\nHowever, more complex pieces, such as Chopins Ballade 4, were not successful,\nthat is, the algorithm could not produce low error values in any of the music\nin the database.

Producing many\nquasi-random polarization states and moving/bending a fiber without changing\npower allows finding a polarimeter calibration where the degree-of-polarization\nreaches unity and parasitic polarization-dependent loss is small. Using a\npolarization scrambler/transformer and a polarimeter a device-under-test can be\ncharacterized. Its Mueller matrix can be decomposed into a product of a\nnondepolarizing Mueller-Jones matrix times a purely depolarizing Mueller\nmatrix. Test polarizations may drift over time. With help of an optical switch\nthe reference device can be measured against an internal reference path. Later,\nwith possibly different test polarizations, the actual device-under-test is\nmeasured against the internal reference. Polarization drift and need for\nrepeated reference device measurement are thus overcome. When a patchcord is\ninserted, connector PDL can be measured, provided that errors are calibrated\naway, again by fiber moving/bending. Experimentally we have measured PDL with\nerrors <0.004 dB. This easily suffices to measure connector PDL, which is\ndemonstrated. PDL >60 dB was measured when the device under test was a good\npolarizer. A 20 Mrad/s polarization scrambler with LiNbO3 device generates the\ntest polarizations. The polarimeter can sample at 100 MHz and can store 64M\nStokes vectors.

Based on this observation,\nwe define the k-bit lepto-variance ${\\lambda}k^2$ of a target variable (or\nequivalently the lepto-variance at a specific depth k) as the variance that\ncannot be removed by any regression tree of a depth equal to k.

It's among the most important problems in graph\ntheory, as well as an NP-Complete problem that can't be solved in polynomial\ntime. As a result, we describe a new hybrid cuckoo search technique to tackle\nthe MDS problem in this work. Cuckoo search is a well-known metaheuristic famed\nfor its capacity for exploring a large area of the search space, making it\nuseful for diversification. However, to enhance performance, we incorporated\nintensification techniques in addition to the genetic crossover operator in the\nsuggested approach. The comparison of our method with the corresponding\nstate-of-the-art techniques from the literature is presented in an exhaustive\nexperimental test.

The collective dynamics of the\nfleet of ride-pooling vehicles fundamentally underlies the efficiency of these\nservices. In simplified models, the common features of these dynamics give rise\nto scaling laws of the efficiency that are valid across a wide range of street\nnetworks and demand settings. However, it is unclear how constraints of the\nvehicle fleet impact such scaling laws. Here, we map the collective dynamics of\ncapacity-constrained ride-pooling fleets to services with unlimited passenger\ncapacity and identify an effective fleet size of available vehicles as the\nrelevant scaling parameter characterizing the dynamics. Exploiting this\nmapping, we generalize the scaling laws of ride-pooling efficiency to\ncapacity-constrained fleets. We approximate the scaling function with a\nqueueing theoretical analysis of the dynamics in a minimal model system,\nthereby enabling mean-field predictions of required fleet sizes in more complex\nsettings. These results may help to transfer insights from existing\nride-pooling services to new settings or service locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 15:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

In particular, in highly\ndense traffic settings, AVs are expected to serve as congestion-dampeners,\nmitigating the presence of instabilities that arise from various sources.\nHowever, in many applications, such maneuvers rely heavily on non-local sensing\nor coordination by interacting AVs, thereby rendering their adaptation to\nreal-world settings a particularly difficult challenge. To address this\nchallenge, this paper examines the role of imitation learning in bridging the\ngap between such control strategies and realistic limitations in communication\nand sensing. Treating one such controller as an \"expert\", we demonstrate that\nimitation learning can succeed in deriving policies that, if adopted by 5% of\nvehicles, may boost the energy-efficiency of networks with varying traffic\nconditions by 15% using only local observations.
