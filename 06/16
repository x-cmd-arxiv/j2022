Specifically, we consider the\nrecently popularized objective function for hierarchical clustering due to\nDasgupta. Previous algorithms for (approximately) minimizing this objective\nfunction require linear time/space complexity. In many applications the\nunderlying graph can be massive in size making it computationally challenging\nto process the graph even using a linear time/space algorithm. As a result,\nthere is a strong interest in designing algorithms that can perform global\ncomputation using only sublinear resources. The focus of this work is to study\nhierarchical clustering for massive graphs under three well-studied models of\nsublinear computation which focus on space, time, and communication,\nrespectively, as the primary resources to optimize: (1) (dynamic) streaming\nmodel where edges are presented as a stream, (2) query model where the graph is\nqueried using neighbor and degree queries, (3) MPC model where the graph edges\nare partitioned over several machines connected via a communication channel.\n  We design sublinear algorithms for hierarchical clustering in all three\nmodels above. At the heart of our algorithmic results is a view of the\nobjective in terms of cuts in the graph, which allows us to use a relaxed\nnotion of cut sparsifiers to do hierarchical clustering while introducing only\na small distortion in the objective function. Our main algorithmic\ncontributions are then to show how cut sparsifiers of the desired form can be\nefficiently constructed in the query model and the MPC model.

Adding more\nfunctionalities onto the portable devices increases its energy consumption\nsignificantly. However, the energy capacity of the battery does not increase\nproportionally. Hence, to overcome the constraints on energy consumption, two\nmain approaches are being undertaken by the designers to integrate more\nfunctionalities onto the energy-constrained systems. One approach involves\nreducing the inherent energy consumption of circuits, and the other involves\nharvesting energy from the ambient sources and utilizing it to power the\ncircuits. In this thesis, both the approaches mentioned above are followed in\ndeveloping energy-saving techniques for energy-constrained CMOS circuits and\nsystems. Switched-capacitor-assisted power gating technique is proposed to\nreduce the leakage current of large digital circuits. Benefits in overall\nenergy saving using nano-electromechanical switches (NEMS) for power gating is\nquantified on a system-on chip for a mobile platform made using a 14 nm gate\nlength FinFET. For reducing the quiescent current in the analog front-end\ncircuits, this thesis proposes a novel technique of realizing discrete-time\n(D-T) signal amplification using nano-electromechanical switches (NEMS). Apart\nfrom the three energy reduction techniques mentioned above, harvesting energy\nfrom mechanical vibrations using an efficient technique of power extraction\nfrom the piezoelectric transducer is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 16:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Instead of having dedicated transformer layers for fusion after\nthe uni-modal backbones, FIBER pushes multimodal fusion deep into the model by\ninserting cross-attention into the image and text backbones, bringing gains in\nterms of memory and performance. In addition, unlike previous work that is\neither only pre-trained on image-text data or on fine-grained data with\nbox-level annotations, we present a two-stage pre-training strategy that uses\nboth these kinds of data efficiently: (i) coarse-grained pre-training based on\nimage-text data; followed by (ii) fine-grained pre-training based on\nimage-text-box data.

Spatial Priors (SPs) are\nour proposed family of inductive biases that highlight certain groups of\nspatial relations. Unlike convolutional inductive biases, which are forced to\nfocus exclusively on hard-coded local regions, our proposed SPs are learned by\nthe model itself and take a variety of spatial relations into account.\nSpecifically, the attention score is calculated with emphasis on certain kinds\nof spatial relations at each head, and such learned spatial foci can be\ncomplementary to each other. Based on SP-SA we propose the SP-ViT family, which\nconsistently outperforms other ViT models with similar GFlops or parameters.\nOur largest model SP-ViT-L achieves a record-breaking 86.3% Top-1 accuracy with\na reduction in the number of parameters by almost 50% compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art model (150M for SP-ViT-L vs 271M for CaiT-M-36) among all\nImageNet-1K models trained on 224x224 and fine-tuned on 384x384 resolution w/o\nextra data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 16:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

In\nthis context, the characterisation of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthermal dust in polarization has become a critical subject of study. We present\na power-spectra analysis of Planck data, which improves on previous studies by\nusing the newly released SRoll2 maps that correct residual data systematics,\nand by extending the analysis to regions near the Galactic plane.

A popular model for this problem assumes\nthat we are given the set of leaves (current species) of an unknown binary tree\nand the results of `experiments' on triples of leaves (a,b,c), which return the\npair with the deepest least common ancestor. If the tree is assumed to be an\nultrametric (i.e., all root-leaf paths have the same length), the experiment\ncan be equivalently seen to return the closest pair of leaves. In this model,\nefficient algorithms are known for tree reconstruction.\n  In reality, since the data on which these `experiments' are run is itself\ngenerated by the stochastic process of evolution, these experiments are noisy.\nIn all reasonable models of evolution, if the branches leading to the leaves in\na triple separate from each other at common ancestors that are very close to\neach other in the tree, the result of the experiment should be close to\nuniformly random. Motivated by this, we consider a model where the noise on any\ntriple is just dependent on the three pairwise distances (referred to as\ndistance based noise).\n  Our results are the following: 1. Suppose the length of every edge in the\nunknown tree is at least $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt n})$ fraction of the length\nof a root-leaf path. Then, we give an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the\ntopology of the tree for a broad family of distance-based noise models.\nFurther, we show that if the edges are asymptotically shorter, then topology\nreconstruction is information-theoretically impossible.\n  2.

In standard metacalibration,\nwhen estimating the object's shear response, extra noise is added to correct\nthe effect of shearing the noise in the image, increasing the uncertainty on\nshear estimates by ~ 20%. Our new deep-field metacalibration technique\nleverages a separate, deeper imaging survey to calculate calibrations with less\ndegradation in image noise. We demonstrate that weak lensing shear measurement\nwith deep-field metacalibration is unbiased up to second-order shear effects.\nWe provide algorithms to apply this technique to imaging surveys and describe\nhow to generalize it to shear estimators that rely explicitly on object\ndetection (e.g., metacalibration). For the Vera C.

Finally, we show that the technique\nis robust to sample variance in the LSST DDFs due to their large area, with the\nequivalent calibration error being ~ 0.1%.

Also, the existing dynamic NeRF\nmethods generally require a lengthy per-scene training procedure, where\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLP) are fitted to model both motions and radiance. In\nthis paper, built on top of the recent advances in voxel-grid optimization, we\npropose a fast deformable radiance field method to handle dynamic scenes. Our\nmethod consists of two modules. The first module adopts a deformation grid to\nstore 3D dynamic features, and a light-weight MLP for decoding the deformation\nthat maps a 3D point in the observation space to the canonical space using the\ninterpolated features. The second module contains a density and a color grid to\nmodel the geometry and density of the scene. The occlusion is explicitly\nmodeled to further improve the rendering quality.

Specifically, MFM\nfirst masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then\npredicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is\nthat predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to\nreveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the\nspatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy.

We compare the known population of lensed quasars to\nan updated mock catalogue at image separations between 1 and 4 arcseconds,\nshowing a very good match at z<1.5. At z>1.5, only 47% of the predicted number\nare known, with 56% of these missing lenses at image separations below 1.5\narcseconds. The missing higher-redshift, small-separation systems will have\nfainter lensing galaxies, and are partially explained by the unclassified\nquasar pairs and likely lenses presented in this work, which require deeper\nimaging. Of the 11 new reported projected quasar pairs, 5 have impact\nparameters below 10 kpc, almost tripling the number of such systems, which can\nprobe the innermost regions of quasar host galaxies through absorption studies.\nWe also report four new lensed galaxies discovered through our searches, with\nsource redshifts ranging from 0.62 to 2.79.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

We show that time reversal symmetry is\nbroken above Tc, indicating the presence of a magnetic phase independent of the\nsuperconductor. Strikingly, this phase does not generate detectable magnetic\nsignals. We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmicroscopy to show that it is incompatible with ferromagnetic ordering. The\ndiscovery of this new form of hidden magnetism illustrates how combining\nsuperconductivity with a strongly correlated system can lead to new, unexpected\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 18:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs\ngradient matching for only one single step without training the network\nweights. Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic\ngraphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs. Extensive\nexperiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we are able to reduce the\ndataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance\nand our method is significantly faster than multi-step gradient matching (e.g.\n15x in CIFAR10 for synthesizing 500 graphs).

Immersion is an\nobjective property of the virtual reality system that depends on both its\nhardware and software characteristics. Virtual reality systems are currently\nattempting to improve immersion as much as possible. However, there is no\nmetric to measure the level of immersion of a virtual reality system based on\nits characteristics. To date, the influence of these hardware and software\nvariables on immersion has only been considered individually or in small\ngroups.

In this paper, we propose immersion metrics for virtual\nreality systems based on their hardware and software variables, as well as the\ndevelopment process that led to their formulation. From the conducted\nexperiment and the obtained data, we followed a methodology to find immersion\nmodels based on the variables of the system. The immersion metrics presented in\nthis work offer a useful tool in the area of virtual reality and immersive\ntechnologies, not only to measure the immersion of any virtual reality system\nbut also to analyze the relationship and importance of the variables of these\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 18:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

We find that the HI gas mass excess in galaxies increases as a function\nof redshift, with an average of $M_{\\rm HI} / M_\\star \\approx 10$,\ncorresponding to HI gas mass fractions of $f_{\\rm HI} = M_{\\rm HI} / (M_\\star +\nM_{\\rm HI}) = 90\\%$, at $z\\approx 7$. Based on the [CII]-$158\\mu$m luminosity\nfunction (LF) derived from the same sample of galaxies, we further place\nconstraints on the cosmic HI gas mass density in galaxies ($\\rho_{\\rm HI}$) at\nthis redshift, which we measure to be $\\rho_{\\rm HI} = 7.1^{+6.4}_{-3.0} \\times\n10^{6}\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm Mpc^{-3}}$. This estimate is substantially lower by a\nfactor of $\\approx 10$ than that inferred from an extrapolation of damped\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorber (DLA) measurements, and largely depend on the exact\n[CII] LF adopted. However, we find this decrease in $\\rho_{\\rm HI}$ to be\nconsistent with recent simulations and argue that this apparent discrepancy is\nlikely a consequence of the DLA sightlines predominantly probing the\nsubstantial fraction of HI gas in high-$z$ galactic halos, whereas [CII] traces\nthe HI in the ISM associated with star formation. We make predictions for this\nbuild-up of neutral gas in galaxies as a function of redshift, showing that at\n$z\\gtrsim 5$ only $\\approx 10\\%$ of the cosmic HI gas content is confined in\ngalaxies and associated with the star-forming ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 18:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 11:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Most\nefforts are devoted to advancing optimization objectives that regularize models\nto capture the underlying invariance; however, there often are compromises in\nthe optimization process of these OOD objectives: i) Many OOD objectives have\nto be relaxed as penalty terms of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for the\nease of optimization, while the relaxed forms can weaken the robustness of the\noriginal objective; ii) The penalty terms also require careful tuning of the\npenalty weights due to the intrinsic conflicts between ERM and OOD objectives.\nConsequently, these compromises could easily lead to suboptimal performance of\neither the ERM or OOD objective. To address these issues, we introduce a\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) perspective to understand the OOD\noptimization process, and propose a new optimization scheme called PAreto\nInvariant Risk Minimization (PAIR). PAIR improves the robustness of OOD\nobjectives by cooperatively optimizing with other OOD objectives, thereby\nbridging the gaps caused by the relaxations.

The LSTM model\nsuccessfully replicates the pore pressure response for three cyclic simple test\nresults considering the shielding and density effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 19:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In essence, any\nspectrum deviation in the CM frame from a reference distribution (e.g.\nBoltzmann distribution on transverse mass $m_t$) is interpreted to reveal a\nflowing particle source. The ALICE collaboration has applied the BW model to\nidentified hadron (PID) spectra for four hadron species from 5 TeV $p$-Pb\ncollisions. From model fits BW parameters $T_{kin}$ (freeze-out temperature)\nand $\\langle \\beta_t \\rangle$ (transverse speed) are inferred that suggest\nstrong radial expansion in more-central $p$-Pb collisions. Such results from\nthe small $p$-Pb collision system are counterintuitive given that strong radial\nexpansion should be driven by large density gradients. The present study is\nintended to address that problem. Several methods are employed to evaluate the\nquality of the BW model data description, including logarithmic derivatives and\nthe Z-score statistic. The stability of the BW model definition across several\napplications to data is investigated. The BW model data description is compare\nto that of the two-component (soft+hard) model (TCM) that has been previously\napplied to the same $p$-Pb PID spectra. The general conclusion is that the BW\nmodel is falsified by $p$-Pb PID spectrum data according to standard\nstatistical measures and that the fitted parameter values do not convey the\nintended meaning. Statistically acceptable data descriptions provided by the\nTCM indicate that other collision mechanisms (projectile-nucleon dissociation,\ndijet production), that are consistent with conventional QCD, are more likely\nresponsible for observed spectrum characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 20:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate the impact of each of these semantic shifts on\ngeneralization independently.

Inspired by human vision, we hypothesize that scene context can\nserve as a bridge to help models generalize across material and viewpoint\ndomain shifts and propose a context-aware vision transformer along with a\ncontrastive loss over material and viewpoint changes to address these domain\nshifts. Our approach (dubbed as CDCNet) outperforms existing domain\ngeneralization methods by over an 18% margin.

Such models, referred to as NN dynamic\nmodels (NNDMs), use iterative noisy predictions of NN to estimate a\ndistribution of system trajectories over time. Despite their accuracy, safety\nanalysis of NNDMs is known to be a challenging problem and remains largely\nunexplored. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a method of\nproviding safety guarantees for NNDMs. Our approach is based on stochastic\nbarrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov\nfunctions with stability. We first show a method of synthesizing stochastic\nbarrier functions for NNDMs via a convex optimization problem, which in turn\nprovides a lower bound on the system's safety probability. A key step in our\nmethod is the employment of the recent convex approximation results for NNs to\nfind piece-wise linear bounds, which allow the formulation of the barrier\nfunction synthesis problem as a sum-of-squares optimization program. If the\nobtained safety probability is above the desired threshold, the system is\ncertified. Otherwise, we introduce a method of generating controls for the\nsystem that robustly maximizes the safety probability in a minimally-invasive\nmanner. We exploit the convexity property of the barrier function to formulate\nthe optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program. Experimental results\nillustrate the efficacy of the method. Namely, they show that the method can\nscale to multi-dimensional NNDMs with multiple layers and hundreds of neurons\nper layer, and that the controller can significantly improve the safety\nprobability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 20:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 09:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 20:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 19:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 21:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 20:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

However, these algorithms have faced great\nchallenges when deployed in safety-critical environments since they often\nexhibit erroneous behaviors that can lead to potentially critical errors. One\nway to assess the safety of DRL agents is to test them to detect possible\nfaults leading to critical failures during their execution. This raises the\nquestion of how we can efficiently test DRL policies to ensure their\ncorrectness and adherence to safety requirements. Most existing works on\ntesting DRL agents use adversarial attacks that perturb states or actions of\nthe agent. However, such attacks often lead to unrealistic states of the\nenvironment. Their main goal is to test the robustness of DRL agents rather\nthan testing the compliance of agents' policies with respect to requirements.\nDue to the huge state space of DRL environments, the high cost of test\nexecution, and the black-box nature of DRL algorithms, the exhaustive testing\nof DRL agents is impossible. In this paper, we propose a Search-based Testing\nApproach of Reinforcement Learning Agents (STARLA) to test the policy of a DRL\nagent by effectively searching for failing executions of the agent within a\nlimited testing budget. We use machine learning models and a dedicated genetic\nalgorithm to narrow the search towards faulty episodes. We apply STARLA on\nDeep-Q-Learning agents which are widely used as benchmarks and show that it\nsignificantly outperforms Random Testing by detecting more faults related to\nthe agent's policy. We also investigate how to extract rules that characterize\nfaulty episodes of the DRL agent using our search results. Such rules can be\nused to understand the conditions under which the agent fails and thus assess\nits deployment risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 20:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 18:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 02:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

One can model these\nintensity changes in a forward direction from the surface normals from\nbathymetric map and physical properties to the measured intensity or\nalternatively one can use an inverse model which starts from the intensities\nand models the surface normals. Here we use an inverse model which leverages\ndeep learning's ability to learn from data; a convolutional neural network is\nused to estimate the surface normal from the sidescan. Thus the internal\nproperties of the seabed are only implicitly learned. Once this information is\nestimated, a bathymetric map can be reconstructed through an optimization\nframework that also includes altimeter readings to provide a sparse depth\nprofile as a constraint. Implicit neural representation learning was recently\nproposed to represent the bathymetric map in such an optimization framework. In\nthis article, we use a neural network to represent the map and optimize it\nunder constraints of altimeter points and estimated surface normal from\nsidescan. By fusing multiple observations from different angles from several\nsidescan lines, the estimated results are improved through optimization.

This is usually a daunting\ntask, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial\nnature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far\nfocused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes.\nHowever, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental\ndata sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of\nthousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large\ncausal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic\ngraphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank\ncausal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with\nrecent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous\noptimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables.\nAdditionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation\nprocedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based\non random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG\nrank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is\nmuch smaller than the whole DAG space and thus may be more suitable as a search\nspace in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to\nassess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a\nscalable implementation of -DAG constrained causal discovery for\nhigh-dimensional interventional data.

Using the predictive densities, we can compute the\nexpected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) due to a solution.

The main hurdle lies in the massive amount of\nnon-linearity in large DNNs. To trade off the DNN expressiveness (which calls\nfor more non-linearity) and robustness certification scalability (which prefers\nmore linearity), we propose a novel solution to strategically manipulate\nneurons, by \"grafting\" appropriate levels of linearity. The core of our\nproposal is to first linearize insignificant ReLU neurons, to eliminate the\nnon-linear components that are both redundant for DNN performance and harmful\nto its certification. We then optimize the associated slopes and intercepts of\nthe replaced linear activations for restoring model performance while\nmaintaining certifiability. Hence, typical neuron pruning could be viewed as a\nspecial case of grafting a linear function of the fixed zero slopes and\nintercept, that might overly restrict the network flexibility and sacrifice its\nperformance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network backbones\nshow that our linearity grafting can (1) effectively tighten certified bounds;\n(2) achieve competitive certifiable robustness without certified robust\ntraining (i.e., over 30% improvements on CIFAR-10 models); and (3) scale up\ncomplete verification to large adversarially trained models with 17M\nparameters.

However, current neural surface reconstruction\nmethods have difficulty learning high-frequency geometry details, so the\nreconstructed shapes are often over-smoothed. We develop HF-NeuS, a novel\nmethod to improve the quality of surface reconstruction in neural rendering. We\nfollow recent work to model surfaces as signed distance functions (SDFs).\nFirst, we offer a derivation to analyze the relationship between the SDF, the\nvolume density, the transparency function, and the weighting function used in\nthe volume rendering equation and propose to model transparency as transformed\nSDF. Second, we observe that attempting to jointly encode high-frequency and\nlow-frequency components in a single SDF leads to unstable optimization. We\npropose to decompose the SDF into a base function and a displacement function\nwith a coarse-to-fine strategy to gradually increase the high-frequency\ndetails. Finally, we design an adaptive optimization strategy that makes the\ntraining process focus on improving those regions near the surface where the\nSDFs have artifacts. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that our\nmethod can reconstruct fine-grained surface details and obtain better surface\nreconstruction quality than the current state of the art.

Taking\nan invariance look at GCL, we argue that a high-performing augmentation should\npreserve the salient semantics of anchor graphs regarding\ninstance-discrimination. To this end, we relate GCL with invariant rationale\ndiscovery, and propose a new framework, Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive\nLearning (RGCL). Specifically, without supervision signals, RGCL uses a\nrationale generator to reveal salient features about graph\ninstance-discrimination as the rationale, and then creates rationale-aware\nviews for contrastive learning. This rationale-aware pre-training scheme endows\nthe backbone model with the powerful representation ability, further\nfacilitating the fine-tuning on downstream tasks. On MNIST-Superpixel and MUTAG\ndatasets, visual inspections on the discovered rationales showcase that the\nrationale generator successfully captures the salient features (i.e.\ndistinguishing semantic nodes in graphs). On biochemical molecule and social\nnetwork benchmark datasets, the state-of-the-art performance of RGCL\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of rationale-aware views for contrastive\nlearning.

To address this\nchallenge, we formalize learning from language in a contextual bandit setting\nand ask how a human might communicate preferences over behaviors. We study two\ndistinct types of language: $\\textit{instructions}$, which provide information\nabout the desired policy, and $\\textit{descriptions}$, which provide\ninformation about the reward function. We show that the agent's degree of\nautonomy determines which form of language is optimal: instructions are better\nin low-autonomy settings, but descriptions are better when the agent will need\nto act independently. We then define a pragmatic listener agent that robustly\ninfers the speaker's reward function by reasoning about $\\textit{how}$ the\nspeaker expresses themselves. We validate our models with a behavioral\nexperiment, demonstrating that (1) our speaker model predicts human behavior,\nand (2) our pragmatic listener successfully recovers humans' reward functions.\nFinally, we show that this form of social learning can integrate with and\nreduce regret in traditional reinforcement learning.

The present study aims to replicate, in\nBrazil, the studies conducted in the other four countries to establish\ncomparisons and support the development of strategies to improve the visibility\nand importance of software testing among undergraduate students across the\nglobe.

In summary, students seem to be interested in learning more about\nsoftware testing.

Many existing tools\nrely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees\nthat the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class\nof candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple\nlinear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be\nvacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings\nwhere UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear.

Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under\nslightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical\nmargin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides\ninsight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in\nthis challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,\nnear-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable\ncomponents and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence\nof the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal\nmargin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 02:46:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 08:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Recent studies\nbased on graph contrastive learning method have achieved remarkable results\nwhen exploit graph-structured data. However, most existing methods 1) do not\ndirectly address the clustering task, since the representation learning and\nclustering process are separated; 2) depend too much on data augmentation,\nwhich greatly limits the capability of contrastive learning; 3) ignore the\ncontrastive message for clustering tasks, which adversely degenerate the\nclustering results.

However, the capabilities of the current generation of quantum\ndevices are limited due to noise or errors, and therefore implementation of\nerror mitigation and/or correction techniques is pivotal to reliably process\nquantum algorithms. In this work, we have performed a comparative analysis of\nthe error mitigation capability of the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code\n(QEC method), duplicate circuit technique, and the Bayesian read-out error\nmitigation (BREM) approach in the context of proof-of-concept implementations\nof variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for determining the ground\nstate energy of H$_2$ molecule.

We find the mean compressive forces are non-monotonic as the\nextension of the filament varies, consistent with the observation that strongly\nbuckled filaments are less able to bear an external load. We also find that for\nthe fixed extension (isometric) ensemble that the buckling transition does not\ncoincide with the local minimum of the mean force (in contrast to Euler\nbuckling). We also show the theory is highly sensitive to fluctuations in\nlength, and that the buckling transition can still be accurately recovered by\naccounting for those fluctuations. These predictions may be useful in\nunderstanding the behavior of filamentous biomolecules compressed by\nfluctuating forces, relevant in a variety of biological contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 04:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Most methods focus on\npoint predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts\ndistributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also\nimpose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution\nwhich does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works\nalso silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given\nhierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show\ndeviation from this assumption. We close both these gaps and propose PROFHIT,\nwhich is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly\nmodels forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHIT uses a flexible\nprobabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency\nregularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast\ndistribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to\ndatasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHIT over wide\nrange of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and\ncalibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full distribution, we observed\nthat PROFHIT can robustly provide reliable forecasts even if up to 10% of input\ntime-series data is missing where other methods' performance severely degrade\nby over 70%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 06:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 19:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Recent research has\ndeveloped a variety of camera-only methods, where features are differentiably\n\"lifted\" from the multi-camera images onto the 2D ground plane, yielding a\n\"bird's eye view\" (BEV) feature representation of the 3D space around the\nvehicle. This line of work has produced a variety of novel \"lifting\" methods,\nbut we observe that other details in the training setups have shifted at the\nsame time, making it unclear what really matters in top-performing methods. We\nalso observe that using cameras alone is not a real-world constraint,\nconsidering that additional sensors like radar have been integrated into real\nvehicles for years already. In this paper, we first of all attempt to elucidate\nthe high-impact factors in the design and training protocol of BEV perception\nmodels. We find that batch size and input resolution greatly affect\nperformance, while lifting strategies have a more modest effect -- even a\nsimple parameter-free lifter works well. Second, we demonstrate that radar data\ncan provide a substantial boost to performance, helping to close the gap\nbetween camera-only and LiDAR-enabled systems.

For simplicity, and to maintain focus on the\nessential elements of the derivation, the discussion is confined to excitatory\nneural fields. The fundamental assumption of the procedure is that mesoscale\nprocesses are macroscopic with respect to cell-scale activity, and emerge as\nthe average behavior of a large population of cells. Because of their duration,\naction-potential details are assumed not observable at mesoscale; the essential\nmesoscopic function of action potentials is to redistribute energy in the\nneural field. The Hodgkin-Huxley dynamical model is first reduced to a set of\nequations that describe subthreshold dynamics. An ensemble average over a cell\npopulation then produces a closed system of equations involving two mesoscopic\nstate variables: the density of kinetic energy J, carried by sodium ionic\ncurrents, and the excitability H of the neural field, which could be described\nas the average state of gating variable h. The resulting model is represented\nas essentially a subthreshold process; and the dynamical role of the firing\nrate is naturally reassessed as describing energy transfers. The linear\nproperties of the equations are consistent with expectations for the dynamics\nof excitatory neural fields: the system supports oscillations of progressive\nwaves, with shorter waves typically having higher frequencies, propagating\nslower, and decaying faster.

We call the resulting polytopes, deformed realisations of the\nassociahedron. The deformed realisations shed new light on the CHY formula. One\nof the striking discoveries in [2] was the fact that the CHY scattering\nequations generate diffeomorphism between the (compactified) CHY moduli space\nand the ABHY associahedron. As we argue, the deformed realisation of the\nassociahedron can also be interpreted as an diffeomorphic image of the CHY\nmoduli space under scattering equations that we call deformed scattering\nequations. The canonical form in the kinematic space is thus once again the\npush-forward of the Parke-Taylor form . A natural off-shoot of our analysis is\nthe universality of the Parke-Taylor form as a CHY Integrand for a class of\n(tree-level and planar) multi-scalar field amplitudes.

However,\nthese methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction\nbut forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels\nof semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by\ntransformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data.

Previous\nsegmentation arts of learning with noisy labels merely perform a pixel-wise\nmanner to preserve semantics, such as pixel-wise label correction, but neglect\nthe pair-wise manner. In fact, we observe that the pair-wise manner capturing\naffinity relations between pixels can greatly reduce the label noise rate.\nMotivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective for noisy\nmitigation by incorporating both pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, where\nsupervisions are derived from noisy class and affinity labels, respectively.\nUnifying the pixel-wise and pair-wise manners, we propose a robust Joint\nClass-Affinity Segmentation (JCAS) framework to combat label noise issues in\nmedical image segmentation. Considering the affinity in pair-wise manner\nincorporates contextual dependencies, a differentiated affinity reasoning (DAR)\nmodule is devised to rectify the pixel-wise segmentation prediction by\nreasoning about intra-class and inter-class affinity relations. To further\nenhance the noise resistance, a class-affinity loss correction (CALC) strategy\nis designed to correct supervision signals via the modeled noise label\ndistributions in class and affinity labels. Meanwhile, CALC strategy interacts\nthe pixel-wise and pair-wise manners through the theoretically derived\nconsistency regularization. Extensive experiments under both synthetic and\nreal-world noisy labels corroborate the efficacy of the proposed JCAS framework\nwith a minimum gap towards the upper bound performance.

In scheme I, the RIS is regarded as a transmitter at the source to\nincorporate the $M$-ary phase-shift-keying ($M$-PSK) symbols into the FM\nchaotic signal and to reflect the resultant $M$-ary FM chaotic signal toward\nthe destination. The information bits of the source are carried by both the\npositive/negative state of the FM chaotic signal and the $M$-PSK symbols. In\nscheme II, the RIS is treated as a relay so that both the source and relay can\nsimultaneously transmit their information bits to the destination. The\ninformation bits of the source and relay are carried by the positive/negative\nstate of the FM chaotic signal and $M$-PSK symbols generated by the RIS,\nrespectively.

A prevailing challenge is\ninferring, from data, the diffusion and kinetic parameters that describe these\nstochastic processes.

To address these challenges, a\nmulti-view imputation and cross-attention network (MCNet) was proposed to\nintegrate data imputation and MCI conversion prediction in a unified framework.\nFirst, a multi-view imputation method combined with adversarial learning was\npresented to handle various missing data scenarios and reduce imputation\nerrors.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deformable\nfiducial marker system that consists of three main parts: First, a fiducial\nmarker generator creates a set of free-form color patterns to encode\nsignificantly large-scale information in unique visual codes. Second, a\ndifferentiable image simulator creates a training dataset of photorealistic\nscene images with the deformed markers, being rendered during optimization in a\ndifferentiable manner.

The deformable\nmarker creator and detector networks are jointly optimized via the\ndifferentiable photorealistic renderer in an end-to-end manner, allowing us to\nrobustly recognize a wide range of deformable markers with high accuracy.

A brief description of the theory and\nexperimental approaches involved in fluorescence spectroscopy, together with\nstate-of-the-art LIFS experiments employing ion traps, is presented. Quadrupole\nion traps are commonly used for spatial confinement of ions. One of the main\nchallenges involved in such experiments is poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\narising due to weak gas-phase fluorescence emission, high background noise, and\nsmall solid angle for the fluorescence collection optics. The experimental\napproaches based on the integrated high-finesse optical cavities provide a\nbetter (typically an order of magnitude more) SNR in the detected fluorescence\nthan the single-pass detection schemes.

A toy model proposed by\nKitaev shows that such states can arise on the ends of a spinless $p$-wave\nsuperconducting chain. Practical proposals for its realization require coupling\nneighboring quantum dots in a chain via both electron tunneling and crossed\nAndreev reflection. While both processes have been observed in semiconducting\nnanowires and carbon nanotubes, crossed-Andreev interaction was neither easily\ntunable nor strong enough to induce coherent hybridization of dot states. Here\nwe demonstrate the simultaneous presence of all necessary ingredients for an\nartificial Kitaev chain: two spin-polarized quantum dots in an InSb nanowire\nstrongly coupled by both elastic co-tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection.\nWe fine-tune this system to a sweet spot where a pair of Majorana bound states\nis predicted to appear. At this sweet spot, the transport characteristics\nsatisfy the theoretical predictions for such a system, including pairwise\ncorrelation, zero charge, and stability against local perturbations of the\nMajorana state.

We show that the\nobserved elasticity is a consequence of a trade-off between the excess\ncapillary energy introduced by the deformation from the equilibrium shape and\nviscous flow over the surface of the microcrystals. This surprising, unusual\nmechanical properties reported here reveals the role of the water molecules\npresent in the crystalline structure. Although many compounds can incorporate\nwater molecules in their crystalline frameworks, the relationship between the\ndifferent hydrates and anhydrate crystal forms are still poorly investigated.\nOur results on the floppy behaviour of such crystalline structure reveals some\nunexplored properties of water molecules entrapped in the crystalline structure\nand can open novel routes for their application in various fields such as\npharmaceutical sciences, thermal energy storage and even the traceability of\nwater on Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 10:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

We consider the unsteady heat propagation and\nobtain formulae, which provide continualization (everywhere excepting a\nneighbourhood of a defect) and asymptotic uncoupling of the thermal motion into\nthe sum of the slow and fast components. The slow motion is related with\nballistic heat transport, whereas the fast motion is energy oscillation related\nwith transformation of the kinetic energy into the potential one and in the\nopposite direction. To obtain the propagating component of the fast and slow\nmotions we estimate the exact solution in the integral form at a moving point\nof observation. We demonstrate that the propagating parts of the slow and the\nfast motions are \"anti-localized\" near the defect. The physical meaning of the\nanti-localization is a tendency for the unsteady propagating wave-field to\navoid a neighbourhood of a defect. The effect of anti-localization increases\nwith the absolute value of the difference between the alternated mass and the\nmass of a regular particle, and, therefore, more energy concentrates just\nbehind the leading wave-front of the propagating component. The obtained\nsolution is valid in a wide range of a spatial co-ordinate (i.e., a particle\nnumber), everywhere excepting a neighbourhood of the leading wavefront.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 10:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 16:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 16:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In most methods, the density maps are generated by convolving with a\nGaussian kernel from the ground-truth dot maps which are marked around the\ncenter of human heads. Due to the fixed geometric structures in CNNs and\nindistinct head-scale information, the head features are obtained incompletely.\nDeformable convolution is proposed to exploit the scale-adaptive capabilities\nfor CNN features in the heads. By learning the coordinate offsets of the\nsampling points, it is tractable to improve the ability to adjust the receptive\nfield. However, the heads are not uniformly covered by the sampling points in\nthe deformable convolution, resulting in loss of head information. To handle\nthe non-uniformed sampling, an improved Normed-Deformable Convolution\n(\\textit{i.e.,}NDConv) implemented by Normed-Deformable loss\n(\\textit{i.e.,}NDloss) is proposed in this paper.

Existing works\non SCSR are mainly based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) but they ignore the fact that although multiple users share a\nsingle account, it is mainly occupied by one user at a time. This observation\nmotivates us to learn a more accurate user-specific account representation by\nattentively focusing on its recent behaviors. Furthermore, though existing\nworks endow lower weights to irrelevant interactions, they may still dilute the\ndomain information and impede the cross-domain recommendation. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, namely\nRL-ISN, which consists of a basic cross-domain recommender and a reinforcement\nlearning-based domain filter.

We also show that\nattempts to model rising rotation curves by fitting the coefficient of the\nquadratic term in the SdS metric individually for each galaxy are precluded,\nsince this coefficient is most naturally interpreted as proportional to a\nglobal cosmological constant. We further extend our analysis beyond static,\nspherically-symmetric systems to show that the invariance of particle dynamics\nto the choice of conformal frame holds for arbitrary metrics, again as\nexpected. Moreover, we show that this conclusion remains valid for conformally\ninvariant gravity theories defined on more general Weyl--Cartan spacetimes,\nwhich include Weyl, Riemann--Cartan and Riemannian spacetimes as special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 11:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Adopting a dissipative quantum electrodynamics\ntreatment, we formulate a framework for the coupling of free electrons to\nwaveguide spatial-temporal modes. To avoid multimode-coupling induced state\ndecoherence, we show that with proper waveguide design, the interaction can be\nreduced to a single-mode coupling to a quasi-TM00 mode. In the single-mode\ncoupling limit, we go beyond the conventional state ladder treatment, and show\nthat the electron-photon energy correlations within the ladder subspace can\nstill lead to a fundamental purity and fidelity limit on complex optical and\nelectron state preparations through heralding schemes.

A BBH reaching several gravitational radii of a SMBH will\ninduce rich observable signatures in the waveform, but the current numerical\ntools are insufficient to simulate such a triple system while capturing the\nessential relativistic effects. Here we solve the problem by studying the\ndynamics in a frame freely falling alongside the BBH. Since the BBH is normally\nnon-relativistic and much smaller than the curvature radius of the Kerr\nbackground, the evolution in the free-fall frame reduces to essentially\nNewtonian dynamics, except for a perturbative gravito-electromagnetic (GEM)\nforce induced by the curved background. We use this method to study the BBHs on\nnear-circular orbits around a SMBH and track their evolution down to a distance\nof $2-3$ gravitational radii from the SMBH. Our simulations reveal a series of\ndynamical effects which are not shown in the previous studies using\nconventional methods.

The colour correction in the calibration\nsample is consistent with being entirely due to an extinction correction due to\ndust with properties similar to that of the Milky Way (R_B~4.6+/-0.4) and there\nis no evidence for intrinsic scatter in the SN peak magnitudes. An immediate\nconsequence of this finding is that the local measurement of the Hubble\nconstant becomes dependent on the choice of SN reference colour, i.e., the\ncolour of an unreddened SN.

Their observed extended main sequence turnoffs\n(eMSTOs) could result from variations in stellar age, stellar rotation, or\nboth. The physical interpretation of eMSTOs is largely based on the complex\nmapping between stellar models -- themselves functions of mass, rotation,\norientation, and binarity -- and the CMD. In this paper, we compute continuous\nprobability densities in three-dimensional color, magnitude, and vsini space\nfor individual stars in a cluster's eMSTO, based on a rotating stellar\nevolution model. These densities enable the rigorous inference of cluster\nproperties from a stellar model, or, alternatively, constraints on the stellar\nmodel from the cluster's CMD. We use the MIST stellar evolution models to\njointly infer the age dispersion, the rotational distribution, and the binary\nfraction of the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1846. We derive an age\ndispersion of ~ 70-80 Myr, approximately half the earlier estimates due to\nnonrotating models. This finding agrees with the conjecture that rotational\nvariation is largely responsible for eMSTOs. However, the MIST models do not\nprovide a satisfactory fit to all stars in the cluster and achieve their best\nagreement at an unrealistically high binary fraction. The lack of agreement\nnear the main-sequence turnoff suggests specific physical changes to the\nstellar evolution models, including a lower mass for the Kraft break and\npotentially enhanced main sequence lifespans for rapidly rotating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 13:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

This paper focuses on improving\nthe performance of GNNs via normalization.\n  In detail, by studying the long-tailed distribution of node degrees in the\ngraph, we propose a novel normalization method for GNNs, which is termed\nResNorm (\\textbf{Res}haping the long-tailed distribution into a normal-like\ndistribution via \\textbf{norm}alization).

In this paper, we\npropose a novel filter pruning method called Asymptotic Soft Cluster Pruning\n(ASCP), to identify the redundancy of network based on the similarity of\nfilters. Each filter from over-parameterized network is first distinguished by\nclustering, and then reconstructed to manually introduce redundancy into it.\nSeveral guidelines of clustering are proposed to better preserve feature\nextraction ability. After reconstruction, filters are allowed to be updated to\neliminate the effect caused by mistakenly selected. Besides, various decaying\nstrategies of the pruning rate are adopted to stabilize the pruning process and\nimprove the final performance as well.

According to this model, a flavin-superoxide radical pair, born in\nthe singlet spin configuration, undergoes magnetic field-dependent spin\ndynamics such that the pair's recombination is enhanced as the applied magnetic\nfield is reduced.

However, the\nscales of objects are diverse and current convolution can only process\nsingle-scale input. The capability of traditional convolution with a fixed\nreceptive field in dealing with such a scale variance problem, is thus limited.\nMulti-scale feature representation has been proven to be an effective way to\nmitigate the scale variance problem. Recent researches mainly adopt partial\nconnection with certain scales, or aggregate features from all scales and focus\non the global information across the scales. However, the information across\nspatial and depth dimensions is ignored. Inspired by this, we propose the\nmulti-scale convolution (MSConv) to handle this problem. Taking into\nconsideration scale, spatial and depth information at the same time, MSConv is\nable to process multi-scale input more comprehensively. MSConv is effective and\ncomputationally efficient, with only a small increase of computational cost.\nFor most of the single-stage object detectors, replacing the traditional\nconvolutions with MSConvs in the detection head can bring more than 2.5\\%\nimprovement in AP (on COCO 2017 dataset), with only 3\\% increase of FLOPs.\nMSConv is also flexible and effective for two-stage object detectors.

Among them, self-attention is\noften used in audio-only tasks to help the model recognize different acoustic\nevents. Self-attention relies on the similarity between time frames, and uses\nglobal information from the whole segment to highlight specific features within\na frame. In real life, information related to acoustic events will attenuate\nover time, which means the information within some frames around the event\ndeserves more attention than distant time global information that may be\nunrelated to the event. This paper shows that self-attention may over-enhance\ncertain segments of audio representations, and smooth out the boundaries\nbetween events representations and background noises. Hence, this paper\nproposes an event-related data conditioning (EDC) for AEC. EDC directly works\non spectrograms.

One of the unique points of GNNs is their flexibility to\nadapt to multiple problems, which not only leads to wide applicability, but\nalso poses important challenges when finding the best model or acceleration\ntechnique for a particular problem. An example of such challenges resides in\nthe fact that the accuracy or effectiveness of a GNN model or acceleration\ntechnique generally depends on the structure of the underlying graph. In this\npaper, in an attempt to address the problem of graph-dependent acceleration, we\npropose ProGNNosis, a data-driven model that can predict the GNN training time\nof a given GNN model running over a graph of arbitrary characteristics by\ninspecting the input graph metrics.

In practice, our method allows making informed decisions on which\ndesign to use for a specific problem. In the paper, the methodology to build\nProGNNosis is defined and applied for a specific use case, where it helps to\ndecide which graph representation is better.

We use a modular\nconfiguration of small, repeatable unit cells, called tiles, that each\nindividually perform power collection, conversion, and transmission. Sunlight\nis collected via lightweight parabolic concentrators and converted to DC\nelectric power with high efficiency III-V photovoltaics. Several CMOS\nintegrated circuits within each tile generates and controls the phase of\nmultiple independently-controlled microwave sources using the DC power. These\nsources are coupled to multiple radiating antennas which act as elements of a\nlarge phased array to beam the RF power to Earth. The power is sent to Earth at\na frequency chosen in the range of 1-10 GHz and collected with ground-based\nrectennas at a local intensity no larger than ambient sunlight. We achieve\nsignificantly reduced mass compared to previous designs by taking advantage of\nsolar concentration, current CMOS integrated circuit technology, and ultralight\nstructural elements. Of note, the resulting satellite has no movable parts once\nit is fully deployed and all beam steering is done electronically.

Currently, popular testing\nmethods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can\nhave high false negative rates. Consequently, COVID-19 patients are not\naccurately identified nor treated quickly enough to prevent transmission of the\nvirus. However, the recent rise of medical CT data has presented promising\navenues, since CT manifestations contain key characteristics indicative of\nCOVID-19. This study aimed to take a novel approach in the machine\nlearning-based detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scans. First, the dataset\nutilized in this study was derived from three major sources, comprising a total\nof 17,698 chest CT slices across 923 patient cases. Image preprocessing\nalgorithms were then developed to reduce noise by excluding irrelevant\nfeatures. Transfer learning was also implemented with the EfficientNetB7\npre-trained model to provide a backbone architecture and save computational\nresources. Lastly, several explainability techniques were leveraged to\nqualitatively validate model performance by localizing infected regions and\nhighlighting fine-grained pixel details. The proposed model attained an overall\naccuracy of 0.927 and a sensitivity of 0.958. Explainability measures showed\nthat the model correctly distinguished between relevant, critical features\npertaining to COVID-19 chest CT images and normal controls. Deep learning\nframeworks provide efficient, human-interpretable COVID-19 diagnostics that\ncould complement radiologist decisions or serve as an alternative screening\ntool. Future endeavors may provide insight into infection severity, patient\nrisk stratification, and prognosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 18:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

In this\nwork, we first introduce a real-world dataset that will enable us to study and\nunderstand harmful online conversational content. Then, we conduct several\nexploratory data analysis experiments to gain deeper insights from the dataset.\nWe later describe our approach for detecting harmful online Anti-LGBTQIA+\nconversational content, and finally, we implement two baseline machine learning\nmodels (i.e., Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression), and fine-tune 3\npre-trained large language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and HateBERT).
