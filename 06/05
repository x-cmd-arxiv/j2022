Naturally, this\ncauses the NeuRD update to have higher variance than its SPG counterpart.\nBuilding on implicit exploration algorithms in the adversarial bandit setting,\nwe introduce capped implicit exploration (CIX) estimates that allow us to\nconstruct NeuRD-CIX, which interpolates between this aspect of NeuRD and SPG.\nWe show how CIX estimates can be used in a black-box reduction to construct\nbandit algorithms with regret bounds that hold with high probability and the\nbenefits this entails for NeuRD-CIX in sequential decision-making settings. Our\nanalysis reveals a bias--variance tradeoff between SPG and NeuRD, and shows how\ntheory predicts that NeuRD-CIX will perform well more consistently than NeuRD\nwhile retaining NeuRD's advantages over SPG in non-stationary environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 18:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

However, since there are disproportionately fewer\ncharging stations than EVs, range anxiety plays a major role in the rise in the\nnumber of queries made along the journeys to find an available charging\nstation. On the other hand, the use of personal data in various types of\nanalytics is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Hence, the risks of privacy\nviolation are also surging. Geo-indistinguishability is one of the standards\nfor formalising location privacy as a generalisation of the local differential\nprivacy. However, the noise has to be carefully calibrated considering the\nimplications of potential utility-loss. In this paper, we introduce approximate\ngeo-indistinguishability (AGeoI) which allows the EVs to obfuscate the\nindividual query-locations while ensuring that they remain within their\npreferred area of interest. It is vital because journeys are often sensitive to\na sharp drop in QoS, which has a high cost for the extra distance to be\ncovered. We apply AGeoI and dummy data generation to protect the privacy of EVs\nduring their journeys and preserve the QoS. Analytical insights and experiments\nare used to demonstrate that a very high percentage of EVs get privacy for free\nand that the utility-loss caused by the privacy-gain is minuscule.

Although a SPAD\nreceiver can provide higher sensitivity compared to the traditional linear\nphotodetectors, it suffers from the dead-time-induced nonlinearity. To improve\nthe data rates of SPAD-based OWC systems, optical orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) can be employed. This paper provides a comprehensive\ntheoretical analysis of the SPAD-based OWC systems using OFDM signalling\nconsidering the effects of signal clipping, SPAD nonlinearity, and\nsignal-dependent shot noise. An equivalent additive Gaussian noise channel\nmodel is proposed to describe the performance of the SPAD-based OFDM system.\nThe statistics of the proposed channel model and the analytical expressions of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) are derived in closed\nforms.

Existing methods often approximate the\ndistance between the models via their sample distributions. In this paper, we\napproach the problem of fingerprinting generative models by learning\nrepresentations that encode the residual artifacts left by the generative\nmodels as unique signals that identify the source models. We consider these\nunique traces (a.k.a. \"artificial fingerprints\") as representations of\ngenerative models, and demonstrate their usefulness in both the discriminative\ntask of source attribution and the unsupervised task of defining a similarity\nbetween the underlying models. We first extend the existing studies on\nfingerprints of GANs to four representative classes of generative models (VAEs,\nFlows, GANs and score-based models), and demonstrate their existence and\nattributability. We then improve the stability and attributability of the\nfingerprints by proposing a new learning method based on set-encoding and\ncontrastive training. Our set-encoder, unlike existing methods that operate on\nindividual images, learns fingerprints from a \\textit{set} of images. We\ndemonstrate improvements in the stability and attributability through\ncomparisons to state-of-the-art fingerprint methods and ablation studies.\nFurther, our method employs contrastive training to learn an implicit\nsimilarity between models.

In this\nwork, we predict a PQSHI Janus monolayer VCClBr constructed from\n$\\mathrm{VCCl_2}$, which is dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. In\nthe absence of spin orbital coupling (SOC), VCClBr is a narrow gap\nsemiconductor with gap value of 57 meV, which is different from Dirac semimetal\n$\\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. The gap of VCClBr is due to built-in electric field caused\nby asymmetrical upper and lower atomic layers, which is further confirmed by\nexternal-electric-field induced gap in $\\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. When including SOC,\nthe gap of VCClBr is improved to 76 meV, which is larger than the thermal\nenergy of room temperature (25 meV). The VCClBr is a 2D topological insulator\n(TI), which is confirmed by $Z_2$ topological invariant and nontrivial\none-dimensional edge states. It is proved that the nontrivial topological\nproperties of VCClBr are robust against strain (biaxial and uniaxial cases) and\nexternal electric field.

The predicted piezoelectric strain coefficients\n$d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are -0.425 pm/V and -0.219 pm/V, which are higher than or\ncompared with ones of many 2D materials. Finally, another two Janus monolayer\nVCFBr and VCFCl (dynamically unstable) are constructed, and they are still\nPQSHIs. Moreover, their $d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are higher than ones of VCClBr,\nand the $d_{31}$ (absolute value) of VCFBr is larger than one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 01:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

The present study aims to\ncharacterize the turbulent airflow over wave surfaces and wave dynamics under\nwind driving force. A high-fidelity two-phase model is developed to simulate\nhighly turbulent wind-wave fields. Instead of using uniform wind, inherent wind\nturbulences are prescribed at the inlet boundary using the turbulent spot\nmethod. The developed model is validated by comparing the simulated wind-wave\nflow characteristics with experimental data. With the validated model, a\nnumerical case study is conducted on a 10^2 m scale under extreme wind and wave\nconditions. The result shows that when inherent wind turbulences are\nconsidered, the resultant turbulence is strengthened and is the summation of\nthe inherent turbulence and the wave-induced turbulence. In addition, the wave\ncoherent velocities and shelter effect are enhanced because of the presence of\nwind inherent turbulence. The regions of intense turbulence depend on the\nrelative speed between wind velocity and wave phase speed. Higher wind\nvelocities induce greater turbulence intensities, which can be increased by up\nto 17%. The different relative speed between wind and wave can induce opposite\npositive-negative patterns of wave coherent velocities.

Instead of\ntesting for parameters that are only interpretable for specific models, there\nhas been increasing interest in model-agnostic methods, often in the form of\nfeature occlusion or leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) inference. Existing\napproaches often make distributional assumptions, which can be difficult to\nverify in practice, or require model refitting and data splitting, which are\ncomputationally intensive and lead to losses in power. In this work, we develop\na novel, mostly model-agnostic and distribution-free inference framework for\nfeature importance that is computationally efficient and statistically\npowerful. Our approach is fast as we avoid model refitting by leveraging a form\nof random observation and feature subsampling called minipatch ensembles; this\napproach also improves statistical power by avoiding data splitting.

This involves indirect elastic-plastic bending of pre-weakened\ncreases by continuously injecting material into an accordion-shaped pack. This\nstep can fail through a localization instability that creates a kink in a pleat\nfacet instead of in the desired crease location. In the present work, we\nconsider the effects of geometric and material parameters on the rotary\npleating process. We formulate the process as a multi-point variable-arc-length\nboundary value problem for planar inextensible rods, with hinge connections.\nBoth the facets (rods) and creases (hinges) obey nonlinear moment-curvature or\nmoment-angle constitutive laws. Some unexpected aspects of the sleeve boundary\ncondition at the point of material injection, common to many continuous sheet\nprocesses, are noted. The process, modeled as quasistatic, features multiple\nequilibria which we explore by numerical continuation. The presence of,\npresumably stable, kinked equilibria is taken as a conservative sign of\npotential pleating failure. Failure may also occur due to localization at the\ninjection point. We may thus obtain \"pleatability surfaces\" that separate the\nparameter space into regions where mechanical pleating will succeed or fail.\nSuccessful pleating depends primarily on the distance between the injection\npoint and the pleated pack. Other factors, such as the crease stiffness and\nstrength relative to that of the facets, also have an influence. Our approach\ncan be adapted to study other pleating and forming processes, the deployment\nand collapse of folded structures, or multi-stability in compliant structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 03:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 07:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, as CMEs\nmay have expansion speeds comparable to their propagation speeds in the corona,\nit is not clear whether and how reconnection contributes to the true\nacceleration and expansion separately. To address this question, we analyze the\ndynamics of a moderately fast CME on 2013 February 27, associated with a\ncontinuous acceleration of its front into the high corona, even though its\nspeed had reached $\\sim$700~km~s$^{-1}$ and larger than the solar wind speed.\nThe apparent CME acceleration is found to be due to the CME expansion in the\nradial direction. The CME true acceleration, i.e., the acceleration of its\ncenter, is then estimated by taking into account the expected deceleration\ncaused by the solar wind drag force acting on a fast CME. It is found that the\ntrue acceleration and the radial expansion have similar magnitudes. We find\nthat magnetic reconnection occurs after the CME eruption and continues during\nthe CME propagation in the high corona, which contributes to the CME dynamic\nevolution. Comparison between the apparent acceleration related to the\nexpansion and the true acceleration that compensates the drag shows that, for\nthis case, magnetic reconnection contributes almost equally to the CME\nexpansion and to the CME acceleration.

To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the\nPoint-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden\nknowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first\nleverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the\nsparse supervision signals.

Looking forward towards 6G, by exploiting the extremely large spatial\ndimension brought by large antenna arrays and multi-path sparsity of millimeter\nwave (mmWave)/Terahertz channels, we propose a novel ISI mitigation technique,\ntermed delay alignment modulation (DAM). The key ideas of DAM are path delay\npre-compensation and path-based beamforming, i.e., by deliberately introducing\nsymbol delays to compensate respective multi-path delays of the channel, so\nthat with appropriate per-path-based beamforming, the multi-path signal\ncomponents will arrive at the receiver simultaneously and constructively. To\ngain some insights, we first show that perfect delay alignment can be achieved\nto transform the time-dispersive channel to time non-dispersive channel,\nwithout sophisticated channel equalization or multi-carrier processing. This\nthus enables efficient equalization-free single-carrier transmission or CP-free\nOFDM transmission. When perfect DAM is infeasible or undesirable, we propose\nthe generic DAM technique to significantly reduce the channel delay spread.\nThis thus provides a new DoF to combat channel time dispersion for more\nefficient single- or multi-carrier signal transmissions.

However, existing work merely focuses on\nnumerical quantization whilst ignoring the concomitant information loss issue,\nwhich, consequently, leads to conspicuous performance degradation. In this\npaper, we propose a novel quantization framework to learn Binarized Graph\nRepresentations for Top-K Recommendation (BiGeaR). BiGeaR introduces\nmulti-faceted quantization reinforcement at the pre-, mid-, and post-stage of\nbinarized representation learning, which substantially retains the\nrepresentation informativeness against embedding binarization.

The empirical results over five large real-world\nbenchmarks show that BiGeaR achieves about 22%~40% performance improvement over\nthe state-of-the-art quantization-based recommender system, and recovers about\n95%~102% of the performance capability of the best full-precision counterpart\nwith over 8x time and space reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 07:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

The simplicity is somewhat surprising given that non-linearities of\ngeneral relativity are thought to play an important role at the merger. The\nuniversal features include an increasing amplitude as we approach the merger,\nwhere transition from an oscillatory to a damped regime occurs in a pattern\napparently oblivious to the initial conditions. We propose an Airy-function\npattern to model the binary black hole (BBH) merger waveform, focusing on\naccounting for its simplicity and universality. We postulate that the relevant\nuniversal features are controlled by a physical mechanism involving: i) a\ncaustic phenomenon in a basic `geometric optics' approximation and, ii) a\ndiffraction over the caustic regularizing its divergence. Universality of\ncaustics and their diffraction patterns account for the observed universal\nfeatures, as in optical phenomena such as rainbows. This postulate, if true,\nallows us to borrow mathematical techniques from Singularity (Catastrophe)\nTheory, in particular Arnol'd-Thom's theorem, and to understand binary mergers\nin terms of fold caustics. The diffraction pattern corresponding to the\nfold-caustic is given in terms of the Airy function, which leads (under a\n`uniform approximation') to the waveform model written in terms of a\nparameterized Airy function. The post-merger phase does not share the same\nfeatures of simplicity and universality, and must be added separately.\nNevertheless, our proposal allows a smooth matching of the inspiral and\npost-merger signals by using the known asymptotics of the Airy function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 07:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

The main results are on characterizations of local existence of\nnon-tangential boundary limits of a generalized harmonic function $u$ in the\nupper half-space $\\RR^{d+1}_+$ associated with the Dunkl operators, and for a\nsubset $E$ of $\\RR^d$ invariant under the reflection group generated by the\nroot system, the equivalence of the following three assertions are proved: (i)\n$u$ has a finite non-tangential limit at $(x,0)$ for a.e. $x\\in E$; (ii) $u$ is\nnon-tangentially bounded for a.e. $x\\in E$; (iii) $(Su)(x)$ is finite for a.e.\n$x\\in E$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 09:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Existing video restoration methods generally fall\ninto two extreme cases, i.e., they either restore all frames in parallel or\nrestore the video frame by frame in a recurrent way, which would result in\ndifferent merits and drawbacks. Typically, the former has the advantage of\ntemporal information fusion. However, it suffers from large model size and\nintensive memory consumption; the latter has a relatively small model size as\nit shares parameters across frames; however, it lacks long-range dependency\nmodeling ability and parallelizability. In this paper, we attempt to integrate\nthe advantages of the two cases by proposing a recurrent video restoration\ntransformer, namely RVRT. RVRT processes local neighboring frames in parallel\nwithin a globally recurrent framework which can achieve a good trade-off\nbetween model size, effectiveness, and efficiency. Specifically, RVRT divides\nthe video into multiple clips and uses the previously inferred clip feature to\nestimate the subsequent clip feature. Within each clip, different frame\nfeatures are jointly updated with implicit feature aggregation. Across\ndifferent clips, the guided deformable attention is designed for clip-to-clip\nalignment, which predicts multiple relevant locations from the whole inferred\nclip and aggregates their features by the attention mechanism.

To achieve a better\nrobustness-accuracy trade-off, we propose the Vanilla Feature Distillation\nAdversarial Training (VFD-Adv), which conducts knowledge distillation from a\npre-trained model (optimized towards high accuracy) to guide adversarial\ntraining towards higher accuracy, i.e., preserving those non-robust but\npredictive features. More specifically, both adversarial examples and their\nclean counterparts are forced to be aligned in the feature space by distilling\npredictive representations from the pre-trained/clean model, while previous\nworks barely utilize predictive features from clean models. Therefore, the\nadversarial training model is updated towards maximally preserving the accuracy\nas gaining robustness. A key advantage of our method is that it can be\nuniversally adapted to and boost existing works.

Especially in\nrecent years, the rapid increase of ride-hailing trips and commercial\ndeliveries has induced massive pick-ups/drop-offs (PUDOs), which occupy the\nlimited curb space that was designed and built decades ago. These PUDOs could\njam curb utilization and disturb the mainline traffic flow, evidently leading\nto significant societal externalities. However, there is a lack of an\nanalytical framework that rigorously quantifies and mitigates the congestion\neffect of PUDOs in the system view, particularly with little data support and\ninvolvement of confounding effects. In view of this, this paper develops a\nrigorous causal inference approach to estimate the congestion effect of PUDOs\non general networks. A causal graph is set to represent the spatio-temporal\nrelationship between PUDOs and traffic speed, and a double and separated\nmachine learning (DSML) method is proposed to quantify how PUDOs affect traffic\ncongestion. Additionally, a re-routing formulation is developed and solved to\nencourage passenger walking and traffic flow re-routing to achieve system\noptimal. Numerical experiments are conducted using real-world data in the\nManhattan area. On average, 100 additional units of PUDOs in a region could\nreduce the traffic speed by 3.70 and 4.54 mph on weekdays and weekends,\nrespectively. Re-routing trips with PUDOs on curbs could respectively reduce\nthe system-wide total travel time by 2.44\\% and 2.12\\% in Midtown and Central\nPark on weekdays.

Here, we\ndemonstrate the fabrication of DBR structures consisting only of undoped boron\nnitride (BN) layers with high refractive index contrast by using Metal-Organic\nChemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). This has been achieved in a single process,\nwithout the need for any post-process etching. The difference in the refractive\nindex of the component BN layers stems from different degrees of porosity of\nthe individual BN layers, which is a direct result of a different growth\ntemperature.

The wavelength of maximum\nreflectance can be tuned from 500 nm up to the Infrared Region (IR), by simply\nadjusting the growth periods of subsequent BN layers. We also demonstrate that\nthe fabricated structures can be used to create an optical microcavity.

We\nintroduce a new feature extractor to extract latent features from the audio and\nvisual modality. The proposed feature extractor is trained with a novel\nadaptive margin-based triplet loss function to learn emotion-relevant features\nfrom the audio and visual data. In the domain of ERC, the existing methods\nperform well on one benchmark dataset but not on others. Our results show that\nthe proposed M2FNet architecture outperforms all other methods in terms of\nweighted average F1 score on well-known MELD and IEMOCAP datasets and sets a\nnew state-of-the-art performance in ERC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 14:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

It iteratively moves each data point to the weighted mean of its\nneighborhood data points. The computational cost required to find the neighbors\nof each data point is quadratic to the number of data points. Consequently, the\nvanilla MS appears to be very slow for large-scale datasets. To address this\nissue, we propose a mode-seeking algorithm called GridShift, with significant\nspeedup and principally based on MS. To accelerate, GridShift employs a\ngrid-based approach for neighbor search, which is linear in the number of data\npoints. In addition, GridShift moves the active grid cells (grid cells\nassociated with at least one data point) in place of data points towards the\nhigher density, a step that provides more speedup. The runtime of GridShift is\nlinear in the number of active grid cells and exponential in the number of\nfeatures. Therefore, it is ideal for large-scale low-dimensional applications\nsuch as object tracking and image segmentation. Through extensive experiments,\nwe showcase the superior performance of GridShift compared to other MS-based as\nwell as state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime on\nbenchmark datasets for image segmentation.

Here we report the adsorption of SO$_2$, an industrially and\nenvironmentally important gas, in ZSM-22, a zeolite characterized by straight\nchannel like pores. The simple pore geometry of ZSM-22 helps us make\npolycrystalline models of the adsorbent with different degrees of orientational\ndisorder.

Introducing inter-crystalline\nspace is found to enhance the adsorption capacity, with a larger\ninter-crystalline space leading to higher adsorption. Increasing the\norientational disorder of the adsorbent is found to enhance the adsorption\ncapacity too. However, the effects of orientational disorder become weaker when\nthe inter-crystalline space is widened. This weakening of the effect of\norientational disorder is a result of an interplay between the width of the\ninter-crystalline space and the strength of guest-guest interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 15:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Composite maps of different components such as pressure levels, vector\nwind, U and V winds, vertical velocity, Specific humidity, OLR, streamlines,\nvorticity, and the temperature was drawn and analyzed. The results showed that\nthe summer circulation of the atmosphere over South West Asia after a sudden\nchange from late May to early June was established in its normal position.\nDifferent new pressure systems such as Zagros Trough were identified over the\nsurface and the Turkmenistan Anticyclone, the quasi-stationary trough of east\nTurkey at 700 hPa level. During the establishment of Subtropical High Pressure\nin the middle and upper troposphere over Iran, the summer circulation of\nsouthwest Asia reached its highest intensity and expansion and continued to\nmid-August. On the other hand, the establishment of the Turkmenistan\nAnticyclone and Pakistan Low caused the 120 days winds of Sistan, and the\ndevelopment of High pressure over the Arabian Peninsula and Zagros Trough\nresulted in the Shomal wind. The main region of summer precipitation was\nidentified as a triangular area to the east of 58.30 E and south of 28.30 N.\nSynoptic patterns responsible for the summer precipitation of the area are\ngrouped into four categories as Iran low pressure, Monsoon Depression, Pakistan\nlow pressure, and local convective cells. Iran low pressure was responsible for\nmore than 65 percent of summer rainfall, while the Monsoon and Pakistan lows\nproduced only 15 percent of the rain. Most of the moisture of rain generating\nsystems came from the west of Oman sea and the northwest Arabian sea via the\nsouthwesterly flow below 850hPa level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 08:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}
