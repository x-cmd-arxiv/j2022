Information propagation\nin a CNN is modeled via an analogy to an optical system, where information is\nconcentrated near a bottleneck where the 2D spatial resolution collapses about\na focal point $1\\times 1=1$. A 3D space $(x,y,t)$ is defined by $(x,y)$\ncoordinates in the image plane and CNN layer $t$, where a principal ray\n$(0,0,t)$ runs in the direction of information propagation through both the\noptical axis and the image center pixel located at $(x,y)=(0,0)$, about which\nthe sharpest possible spatial focus is limited to a circle of confusion in the\nimage plane. Our novel insight is to model the principal optical ray $(0,0,t)$\nas geometrically equivalent to the medial vector in the positive orthant\n$I(x,y) \\in R^{N+}$ of a $N$-channel activation space, e.g. along the greyscale\n(or luminance) vector $(t,t,t)$ in $RGB$ colour space.

One promising method for\nalignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences\nbetween pairs of trajectory segments. These human preferences are typically\nassumed to be informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each\nsegment. We find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling preferences\ninstead as arising from a different statistic: each segment's regret, a measure\nof a segment's deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many\npreferences generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a\nreward function equivalent to the reward function that generated those\npreferences. We also prove that the previous partial return model lacks this\nidentifiability property without preference noise that reveals rewards'\nrelative proportions, and we empirically show that our proposed regret\npreference model outperforms it with finite training data in otherwise the same\nsetting. Additionally, our proposed regret preference model better predicts\nreal human preferences and also learns reward functions from these preferences\nthat lead to policies that are better human-aligned. Overall, this work\nestablishes that the choice of preference model is impactful, and our proposed\nregret preference model provides an improvement upon a core assumption of\nrecent research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 17:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Furthermore, it\nexposes low-layer networking metrics to the application layer to enable robots\nto autonomously monitor, map, and extend the network via droppable radios, as\nwell as restore connectivity to improve collaborative exploration. We evaluate\nour solution with respect to the comms performance in several challenging\nunderground environments including the DARPA SubT Finals competition\nenvironment. Our findings support the use of data stratification and flow\ncontrol to improve bandwidth-usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 19:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced much\nlater, solves most of these problems with an innovative concept called\noff-chain payments. With this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive\nvenue to perform micro-payments which can also be adopted in many IoT\napplications (e.g., toll payments). Nevertheless, it is not feasible to host LN\nand Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory, and processing\nrestrictions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure and efficient\nprotocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through an untrusted\ngateway node. Through this gateway which hosts the LN and Bitcoin nodes, the\nIoT device can open & close LN channels and send & receive LN payments. This\ndelegation approach is powered by a threshold cryptography based scheme that\nrequires the IoT device and the LN gateway to jointly perform all LN\noperations. Specifically, we propose thresholdizing LN's Bitcoin public and\nprivate keys as well as its public and private keys for the new channel states\n(i.e., commitment points). We prove with a game theoretical security analysis\nthat the IoT device is secure against collusion attacks. We implemented the\nproposed protocol by changing LN's source code and thoroughly evaluated its\nperformance using several Raspberry Pis. Our evaluation results show that the\nprotocol; is fast, does not bring extra cost overhead, can be run on low data\nrate wireless networks, is scalable and has negligible energy consumption\noverhead.

In software engineering,\nconceptual modeling has gained importance as a discipline that offers\nlanguages, methods, and methodologies to address the complexity of software\ndevelopment. The key to understanding such complexity is using tools such as\ndiagrams at various levels of representation. A conceptual model must include\nall relevant static and behavioral aspects of its domain. In UML, the static\naspects include structural diagrams that represent the internal architecture of\na system with a special focus on the classes, the connections and interactions\nthat they have, and integrity constraints over the state of the domain.

Constraints assist in analyzing permissible design requirements\nand the limitations of the intended functions. To overcome the limitations of\nthe graphical notation, other types of languages are used to complement the\ndiagrammatic language (e.g., the textual Object Constraint Language [OCL]). In\nthis paper, we study how to express constraints diagrammatically using the\nthinging machine (TM) through examples taken from the UML/OCL literature.

These\nlaws underpin the origin of life, evolution, human culture and technology, as\nset by the boundary conditions of the universe, however these laws cannot\npredict the emergence of these things. By contrast evolutionary theory works in\nthe opposite direction, indicating how selection can explain why some things\nexist and not others. To understand how open-ended forms can emerge in a\nforward-process from physics that does not include their design, a new approach\nto understand the non-biological to biological transition is necessary. Herein,\nwe present a new theory, Assembly Theory (AT), which explains and quantifies\nthe emergence of selection and evolution. In AT, the complexity of an\nindividual observable object is measured by its Assembly Index (a), defined as\nthe minimal number of steps needed to construct the object from basic building\nblocks. Combining a with the copy number defines a new quantity called Assembly\nwhich quantifies the amount of selection required to produce a given ensemble\nof objects. We investigate the internal structure and properties of assembly\nspace and quantify the dynamics of undirected exploratory processes as compared\nto the directed processes that emerge from selection. The implementation of\nassembly theory allows the emergence of selection in physical systems to be\nquantified at any scale as the transition from undirected-discovery dynamics to\na selected process within the assembly space. This yields a mechanism for the\nonset of selection and evolution and a formal approach to defining life.\nBecause the assembly of an object is easily calculable and measurable it is\npossible to quantify a lower limit on the amount of selection and memory\nrequired to produce complexity uniquely linked to biology in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 22:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 16:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 13:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Different\nkinds of imperfections are uncertainty, imprecision, vagueness, incompleteness,\ninconsistency, and context-dependency which can be handled pretty well by our\nbrain. Basic approaches like probability theory and standard logic are\nintrinsically inefficient in modeling fallacious minds. The generalized\nprobability and nonstandard logic theories have epistemological motivations to\nprovide better models for information integration in cognitive agents. Among\nmany models of them, possibility theory and probabilistic logic theory are the\nbest approaches. I argue, based on a review of different approaches to\nImperfect Information Management, that a good framework for it is the Situation\ntheory of Barwise and the Channel theory of Barwise-Seligman. These theories\nhave relied on a powerful and unique epistemological-based notion of\ninformation to refer to partiality. These frameworks have a proper approach for\ncontext modeling to handle common knowledge and incomplete information. Also,\nthey distinguish belief from knowledge clearly to model the non-monotonic and\ndynamic nature of knowledge. They discern the logic of the world from\ninformation flow in the mind. The objectification process in these theories\nreveals to us the nature of default or probabilistic rules in perceptions. The\nconcept of the channel can be used to represent those types of reasoning\nmechanisms that move from one model or logic to another one. The imprecision in\nour perceptions causes fuzziness in reasoning and vagueness in communication\nthat can be represented by some suitable classifications connected by some\nchannels. This new framework like a network framework can provide a scalable\nand open framework to cover different models based on a relativistic notion of\ntruth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 23:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Nonetheless,\ndelineating a few target samples is usually manageable and particularly\nworthwhile, due to the substantial performance gain. Inspired by this, we aim\nto develop semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for medical image\nsegmentation, which is largely underexplored. We, thus, propose to exploit both\nlabeled source and target domain data, in addition to unlabeled target data in\na unified manner. Specifically, we present a novel asymmetric co-training (ACT)\nframework to integrate these subsets and avoid the domination of the source\ndomain data. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, we explicitly decouple\nthe label supervisions in SSDA into two asymmetric sub-tasks, including\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) and UDA, and leverage different knowledge from\ntwo segmentors to take into account the distinction between the source and\ntarget label supervisions. The knowledge learned in the two modules is then\nadaptively integrated with ACT, by iteratively teaching each other, based on\nthe confidence-aware pseudo-label. In addition, pseudo label noise is\nwell-controlled with an exponential MixUp decay scheme for smooth propagation.\nExperiments on cross-modality brain tumor MRI segmentation tasks using the\nBraTS18 database showed, even with limited labeled target samples, ACT yielded\nmarked improvements over UDA and state-of-the-art SSDA methods and approached\nan \"upper bound\" of supervised joint training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 23:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 16:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 17:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

One of\nthe central tasks in the field of state tomography is to reconstruct with high\nfidelity, the quantum states of a quantum system.

With such a data as input, in this report we employ the maximal\nentropy formalism to construct the least biased mixed quantum state that is\nconsistent with the given set of expectation values. Even though in principle,\nthe reported formalism is quite general and should work for an arbitrary set of\nobservables, in practice we shall demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on\nan informationally complete (IC) set of Hermitian operators. Such a set\npossesses the advantage of uniquely specifying a single quantum state from\nwhich the experimental measurements have been sampled and hence renders the\nrare opportunity to not only construct a least-biased quantum state but even\nreplicate the exact state prepared experimentally within a preset tolerance.\nThe primary workhorse of the algorithm is re-constructing an energy function\nwhich we designate as the effective Hamiltonian of the system, and\nparameterizing it with Lagrange multipliers, according to the formalism of\nmaximal entropy. These parameters are thereafter optimized variationally so\nthat the reconstructed quantum state of the system converges to the true\nquantum state within an error threshold.

We demonstrate that motion planning problems such as minimum\nconstraint removal, belief-space planning, and visibility-aware motion planning\n(VAMP) benefit from a path-dependent formulation, in which the state at a\nsearch node is represented implicitly by the path to that node. A naive\napproach to computing the feasibility of a successor node in such a\npath-dependent formulation takes time linear in the path length to the node, in\ncontrast to a (possibly very large) constant time for a more typical search\nformulation. For long-horizon plans, performing this linear-time computation,\nwhich we call the lookback, for each node becomes prohibitive. To improve upon\nthis, we introduce the use of a fully persistent spatial data structure\n(FPSDS), which bounds the size of the lookback. We then focus on the\napplication of the FPSDS in VAMP, which involves incremental geometric\ncomputations that can be accelerated by filtering configurations with bounding\nvolumes using nearest-neighbor data structures.

Moreover, it remains unclear whether\nall negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an\nAnatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative\ncontrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than\nbinary supervision between positive and negative pairs.

Second, we raise a\nmore important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield\nbetter performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global\nsemantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features\namong the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During\nthe training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse\nset of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation\nboundaries and more accurate predictions.

Three propagation modes are identified:\nperturbed propagation, leeward re-detonation, and detonation extinction.\nLeeward re-detonation is analyzed from unsteady evolutions of gas and liquid\ndroplet quantities. The detonation is re-initiated by a local hot spot from\nshock focusing of upper and lower diffracted detonations. Disintegration of\nwater droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the cloud.

The UAV flies along a fixed trajectory to\ncollect tasks generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and forwards these\ntasks to a BS or the cloud server for further processing.

One of the major issues with the CEPA and its variants is that\nsingularities arise in the amplitude equations when the system starts to be\nstrongly correlated.

Through our quantitative experiments, we find that\n1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The\nsentence-level repetitions have a \\textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more\ntimes a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of\ncontinuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial\nprobabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by\nour findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \\textbf{DITTO}\n(Pseu\\underline{D}o-Repet\\underline{IT}ion\nPenaliza\\underline{T}i\\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize\nprobabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data.\nAlthough our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show\nthat DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing\nperplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments\non open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization\n(CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 05:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2022 07:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

Different thermoelectric quantities are computed for the\nstrain-induced pentacene using Green's function formalism following the\nLandauer-Buttiker prescription.

Specifically, we focus on identifying the same player in images\ncaptured from different camera viewpoints during any given moment of a match.\nThis task differs from traditional applications of person re-id in a few\nimportant ways. Firstly, players from the same team wear highly similar\nclothes, thereby making it harder to tell them apart. Secondly, there are only\na few number of samples for each identity, which makes it harder to train a\nre-id system. Thirdly, the resolutions of the images are often quite low and\nvary a lot. This combined with heavy occlusions and fast movements of players\ngreatly increase the challenges for re-id. In this paper, we propose a simple\nbut effective hierarchical data sampling procedure and a centroid loss function\nthat, when used together, increase the mean average precision (mAP) by 7 - 11.5\nand the rank-1 (R1) by 8.8 - 14.9 without any change in the network or\nhyper-parameters used. Our data sampling procedure improves the similarity of\nthe training and test distributions, and thereby aids in creating better\nestimates of the centroids of the embeddings (or feature vectors).\nSurprisingly, our study shows that in the presence of severely limited data, as\nis the case for our application, a simple centroid loss function based on\neuclidean distances significantly outperforms the popular triplet-centroid loss\nfunction. We show comparable improvements for both convolutional networks and\nvision transformers.

The\nexperimental results show that our graph restructuring method can significantly\nboost the performance of six classical GNNs by an average of 25% on\nless-homophilic graphs. The boosted performance is comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 06:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 07:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Recent years brought machine learning and optimization\ntechniques to the field of analog circuits design, with evolutionary algorithms\nand Bayesian models showing good results for circuit sizing.

Furthermore, using a\ndiffusion-scaled analysis, we prove that the load balancer achieves\nasymptotically optimal performance whenever the approximation error scales at a\nlower rate than the square-root of the total processing capacity, which\nincludes as a special case constant-error approximations.

Initially, profit and risk were measured by the first two\nmoments of the portfolio's return, a.k.a. the mean and variance, which are\nsufficient to characterize a Gaussian distribution. However, it is broadly\nbelieved that the first two moments are not enough to capture the\ncharacteristics of the returns' behavior, which have been recognized to be\nasymmetric and heavy-tailed. Although there is ample evidence that portfolio\ndesigns involving the third and fourth moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis,\nwill outperform the conventional mean-variance framework, they are non-trivial.\nSpecifically, in the classical framework, the memory and computational cost of\ncomputing the skewness and kurtosis grow sharply with the number of assets. To\nalleviate the difficulty in high-dimensional problems, we consider an\nalternative expression for high-order moments based on parametric\nrepresentations via a generalized hyperbolic skew-t distribution. Then, we\nreformulate the high-order portfolio optimization problem as a fixed-point\nproblem and propose a robust fixed-point acceleration algorithm that solves the\nproblem in an efficient and scalable manner.

Yet, VAEs often succeed at this task. We\nseek to elucidate this apparent paradox by studying nonlinear VAEs in the limit\nof near-deterministic decoders.

However, in clinical\npractice, it is not always possible to acquire a complete set of MRIs, and the\nproblem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in existing\nmultimodal segmentation methods. In this work, we present the first attempt to\nexploit the Transformer for multimodal brain tumor segmentation that is robust\nto any combinatorial subset of available modalities. Concretely, we propose a\nnovel multimodal Medical Transformer (mmFormer) for incomplete multimodal\nlearning with three main components: the hybrid modality-specific encoders that\nbridge a convolutional encoder and an intra-modal Transformer for both local\nand global context modeling within each modality; an inter-modal Transformer to\nbuild and align the long-range correlations across modalities for\nmodality-invariant features with global semantics corresponding to tumor\nregion; a decoder that performs a progressive up-sampling and fusion with the\nmodality-invariant features to generate robust segmentation. Besides, auxiliary\nregularizers are introduced in both encoder and decoder to further enhance the\nmodel's robustness to incomplete modalities. We conduct extensive experiments\non the public BraTS $2018$ dataset for brain tumor segmentation. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed mmFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nfor incomplete multimodal brain tumor segmentation on almost all subsets of\nincomplete modalities, especially by an average 19.07% improvement of Dice on\ntumor segmentation with only one available modality.

Recent developments in\nnatural language processing suggest that large-scale pre-trained language\nbackbones could be leveraged for such machine comprehension and information\nextraction tasks. Yet, due to the gap between pre-training and downstream\nclinical domains, it remains challenging to exploit the generic backbones for\ndomain-specific applications.

End-to-end neural diarization\n(EEND) has achieved overlap-aware speaker diarization by formulating it as a\nmulti-label classification problem. It has also been extended for a flexible\nnumber of speakers by introducing speaker-wise attractors. However, the output\nnumber of speakers of attractor-based EEND is empirically capped; it cannot\ndeal with cases where the number of speakers appearing during inference is\nhigher than that during training because its speaker counting is trained in a\nfully supervised manner. Our method, EEND-GLA, solves this problem by\nintroducing unsupervised clustering into attractor-based EEND. In the method,\nthe input audio is first divided into short blocks, then attractor-based\ndiarization is performed for each block, and finally, the results of each block\nare clustered on the basis of the similarity between locally-calculated\nattractors. While the number of output speakers is limited within each block,\nthe total number of speakers estimated for the entire input can be higher than\nthe limitation. To use EEND-GLA in an online manner, our method also extends\nthe speaker-tracing buffer, which was originally proposed to enable online\ninference of conventional EEND. We introduce a block-wise buffer update to make\nthe speaker-tracing buffer compatible with EEND-GLA. Finally, to improve online\ndiarization, our method improves the buffer update method and revisits the\nvariable chunk-size training of EEND. The experimental results demonstrate that\nEEND-GLA can perform speaker diarization of an unseen number of speakers in\nboth offline and online inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 08:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 11:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Classical stopping theory assumes that\nsellers have full knowledge of the value distributions, and leverage this\nknowledge to determine stopping rules that maximize expected welfare. In\npractice, however, stopping rules must often be determined under partial\ninformation, based on scarce data or expert predictions. Consider a seller that\nhas one item for sale and receives successive offers drawn from some value\ndistributions. The decision on whether or not to accept an offer is\nirrevocable, and the value distributions are only partially known. We therefore\nlet the seller adopt a robust maximin strategy, assuming that value\ndistributions are chosen adversarially by nature to minimize the value of the\naccepted offer. We provide a general maximin solution to this stopping problem\nthat identifies the optimal (threshold-based) stopping rule for the seller for\nall possible statistical information structures. We then perform a detailed\nanalysis for various ambiguity sets relying on knowledge about the common mean,\ndispersion (variance or mean absolute deviation) and support of the\ndistributions. We show for these information structures that the seller's\nstopping rule consists of decreasing thresholds converging to the common mean,\nand that nature's adversarial response, in the long run, is to always create an\nall-or-nothing scenario. The maximin solutions also reveal what happens as\ndispersion or the number of offers grows large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 10:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 08:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-30"}

After the short-term clearing of the\ndust shell in 2019, another dust structure was ejected that resulted in the\nstar fading in all the observed bands. Based on the IR brightness and color\ncurves, we estimated the dust depth growth in 2019-2020.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 10:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

For models that show a strongly non-linear dependence on their\ninput parameters, standard surrogate techniques, such as polynomial chaos\nexpansion, are not sufficient to obtain an accurate representation of the\noriginal model response. Through applying a rational approximation instead, the\napproximation error can be efficiently reduced for models whose non-linearity\nis accurately described through a rational function. Specifically, our aim is\nto approximate complex-valued models. A common approach to obtain the\ncoefficients in the surrogate is to minimize the sample-based error between\nmodel and surrogate in the least-square sense. In order to obtain an accurate\nrepresentation of the original model and to avoid overfitting, the sample set\nhas be two to three times the number of polynomial terms in the expansion.

To ensure safe driving of\nautomated vehicles, the vehicle must plan its trajectory to avoid navigating on\nunsafe roads (e.g., icy conditions, construction zones, narrow streets, etc.).\nSuch information can be derived from the roads' physical properties, vehicle's\ncapabilities, and weather conditions. From a GNSS-based navigation perspective,\nthe reliability of GNSS signals in different locales, which is heavily\ndependent on the road layout within the surrounding environment, is crucial to\nensure safe automated driving. An urban road environment surrounded by tall\nobjects can significantly degrade the accuracy and availability of GNSS\nsignals. This article proposes an approach to predict the reliability of\nGNSS-based navigation to ensure safe urban navigation. Satellite navigation\nreliability at a given location and time on a road is determined based on the\nprobabilistic position error bound of the vehicle-mounted GNSS receiver. A\nmetric for GNSS reliability for ground vehicles is suggested, and a method to\npredict the conservative probabilistic error bound of the GNSS navigation\nsolution is proposed. A satellite navigation reliability map is generated for\nvarious navigation applications. As a case study, the reliability map is used\nin the proposed optimization problem formulation for automated ground vehicle\nsafety-constrained path planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 12:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 22:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 12:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Yet, it is only recently that well-controlled channels with\ncross-sections as small as a few molecular diameters became an experimental\nreality. When aqueous electrolytes are confined within such channels, the\nCoulomb interactions between the dissolved ions are reinforced due to\ndielectric contrast at the channel walls: we dub this effect `interaction\nconfinement'. Yet, no systematic way of computing these confined interactions\nhas been proposed beyond the limiting cases of perfectly metallic or perfectly\ninsulating channel walls.

We illustrate this approach by\nimplementing these interactions in brownian dynamics simulations of a strongly\nconfined electrolyte, and show that the resulting ionic conduction can be\nadjusted between Ohm's law and a Wien effect behavior.

However, the\ndata distribution among clients often exhibits non-IID, i.e., distribution\nshift, which makes efficient optimization difficult. To tackle this problem,\nmany FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across\nclients by increasing the performance of the global model. However, almost all\nalgorithms leverage Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) to be the local\noptimizer, which is easy to make the global model fall into a sharp valley and\nincrease a large deviation of parts of local clients. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe revisit the solutions to the distribution shift problem in FL with a focus\non local learning generality.

VPIT is the first method\nthat uses voxel pseudo images for 3D SOT. The input point cloud is structured\nby pillar-based voxelization, and the resulting pseudo image is used as an\ninput to a 2D-like Siamese SOT method. The pseudo image is created in the\nBird's-eye View (BEV) coordinates, and therefore the objects in it have\nconstant size. Thus, only the object rotation can change in the new coordinate\nsystem and not the object scale. For this reason, we replace multi-scale search\nwith a multi-rotation search, where differently rotated search regions are\ncompared against a single target representation to predict both position and\nrotation of the object. Experiments on KITTI Tracking dataset show that VPIT is\nthe fastest 3D SOT method and maintains competitive Success and Precision\nvalues. Application of a SOT method in a real-world scenario meets with\nlimitations such as lower computational capabilities of embedded devices and a\nlatency-unforgiving environment, where the method is forced to skip certain\ndata frames if the inference speed is not high enough. We implement a real-time\nevaluation protocol and show that other methods lose most of their performance\non embedded devices, while VPIT maintains its ability to track the object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 14:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Therefore, transfer\nlearning has become a promising approach to reuse well-trained two-dimensional\nmodels and greatly reduce the need for samples for three-dimensional problems.\nThis paper proposes to reuse the baseline models trained on supercritical\nairfoils to predict finite-span swept supercritical wings, where the simple\nswept theory is embedded to improve the prediction accuracy. Two baseline\nmodels for transfer learning are investigated: one is commonly referred to as\nthe forward problem of predicting the pressure coefficient distribution based\non the geometry, and the other is the inverse problem that predicts the\ngeometry based on the pressure coefficient distribution. Two transfer learning\nstrategies are compared for both baseline models. The transferred models are\nthen tested on the prediction of complete wings. The results show that transfer\nlearning requires only approximately 500 wing samples to achieve good\nprediction accuracy on different wing planforms and different free stream\nconditions.

This\nframework unifies many existing and new policy optimization algorithms. We show\nthat the state-wise average policy of this algorithm converges to an\napproximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game, as long as the matrix game\nalgorithms achieve low weighted regret at each state, with respect to weights\ndetermined by the speed of the value updates.

Species numbers\nare modelled using a continuous-time stochastic process, and, depending on the\napplication area of interest, this will typically take the form of a Markov\njump process or an It\\^o diffusion process. Widespread use of these models is\ntypically precluded by their computational complexity. In particular,\nperforming exact fully Bayesian inference in either modelling framework is\nchallenging due to the intractability of the observed data likelihood,\nnecessitating the use of computationally intensive techniques such as particle\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (particle MCMC). It is proposed to increase the\ncomputational and statistical efficiency of this approach by leveraging the\ntractability of an inexpensive surrogate derived directly from either the jump\nor diffusion process. The surrogate is used in three ways: in the design of a\ngradient-based parameter proposal, to construct an appropriate bridge and in\nthe first stage of a delayed-acceptance step. The resulting approach, which\nexactly targets the posterior of interest, offers substantial gains in\nefficiency over a standard particle MCMC implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 14:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 15:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 15:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Promising early results achieved by\ncapsule networks have motivated the deep learning community to continue trying\nto improve their performance and scalability across several application areas.\nHowever, a major hurdle for capsule network research has been the lack of a\nreliable point of reference for understanding their foundational ideas and\nmotivations. The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of\nthe capsule network research landscape, which will serve as a valuable resource\nfor the community going forward. To that end, we start with an introduction to\nthe fundamental concepts and motivations behind capsule networks, such as\nequivariant inference in computer vision. We then cover the technical advances\nin the capsule routing mechanisms and the various formulations of capsule\nnetworks, e.g. generative and geometric. Additionally, we provide a detailed\nexplanation of how capsule networks relate to the popular attention mechanism\nin Transformers, and highlight non-trivial conceptual similarities between them\nin the context of representation learning.

In particular, primordial black holes\nof asteroid mass $M \\sim 10^{17}-10^{23}\\,$g may represent 100\\% of dark\nmatter. While the microlensing and stellar disruption constraints on their\nabundance have been relieved, Hawking radiation of these black holes seems to\nbe the only detection (and constraining) mean.

Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an\nintimate connection between these fields has been unveiled in the context of\ncontinuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing several important implications\nfor nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous connection\nfor discrete cases by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal\ntransport.

Specifically, we rigorously\nprove that the Wasserstein distance equals the minimum product of irreversible\nentropy production and dynamical state mobility over all admissible Markovian\ndynamics.

However,\nthe interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential\nrecommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In\nmany real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often\nmulti-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type\nbehavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users\nand items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance\nto accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference.

To realize\nfault-tolerant quantum computing, the fault-tolerant quantum protocols should\nbe transformed into executable quantum circuits based on the nearest-neighbor\ninteraction. Unlike topological codes that are defined based on local\noperations fundamentally, for the concatenated codes, it is possible to obtain\nthe circuits composed of the local operations by applying the quantum circuit\nsynthesis. However, by the existing quantum circuit synthesis developed for\nordinary quantum computational algorithms, the fault-tolerant of the protocol\nmay not be preserved in the resulting circuit. Besides, we have to consider\nsomething more to implement the quantum circuit of universal fault-tolerant\nquantum computing. First, we have not to propagate quantum errors on data\nqubits when selecting a qubit move path (a sequence of \\emph{SWAP} gates) to\nsatisfy the geometric locality constraint. Second, the circuit should be\nself-contained so that it is possible to act independently regardless of the\nsituation.

More generally, a set $X$ of edges between points of $P$ is a flip\ncut set if eliminating all triangulations that contain edges of $X$ results in\na disconnected flip graph. The flip cut number of $P$ is the minimum size of a\nflip cut set.\n  We give a characterization of flip cut edges that leads to an $O(n \\log n)$\ntime algorithm to test if an edge is a flip cut edge and, with that as\npreprocessing, an $O(n)$ time algorithm to test if two triangulations are in\nthe same connected component of the flip graph. For a set of $n$ points in\nconvex position (whose flip graph is the 1-skeleton of the associahedron) we\nprove that the flip cut number is $n-3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 15:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

We present such a\nmachine learning approach for analyzing Raman spectra of human and avian\nviruses. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier specifically designed\nfor spectral data achieves very high accuracy for a variety of virus type or\nsubtype identification tasks.

To address this\nproblem, we have noticed that, there are psychological and physiological\nevidences showing that we humans are more likely to annotate instances of\nsimilar appearances to the same classes, and thus poor-quality or ambiguous\ninstances of similar appearances are easier to be mislabeled to the correlated\nor same noisy classes.

Running\nthese FEAs are computationally very costly for any optimization process and it\nbecomes difficult to run even hundreds of evaluation.
