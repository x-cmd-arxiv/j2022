In addition to many important machine\nlearning tasks, as artificial networks emulating the way brain cells function,\nDNNs also show the capability of storing non-linear relationships between input\nand output data, which exhibits the potential of storing data via DNNs. We\nenvision a new paradigm of data storage, \"DNN-as-a-Database\", where data are\nencoded in well-trained machine learning models. Compared with conventional\ndata storage that directly records data in raw formats, learning-based\nstructures (e.g., DNN) can implicitly encode data pairs of inputs and outputs\nand compute/materialize actual output data of different resolutions only if\ninput data are provided. This new paradigm can greatly enhance the data\nsecurity by allowing flexible data privacy settings on different levels,\nachieve low space consumption and fast computation with the acceleration of new\nhardware (e.g., Diffractive Neural Network and AI chips), and can be\ngeneralized to distributed DNN-based storage/computing. In this paper, we\npropose this novel concept of learning-based data storage, which utilizes a\nlearning structure called learning-based memory unit (LMU), to store, organize,\nand retrieve data.

To further enhance WSI visual representations, existing\nmethods have explored image pyramids, instead of single-resolution images, in\nWSIs. In spite of this, they still face two major problems: high computational\ncost and the unnoticed semantical gap in multi-resolution feature fusion. To\ntackle these problems, this paper proposes to efficiently exploit WSI pyramids\nfrom a new perspective, the dual-stream network with cross-attention (DSCA).\nOur key idea is to utilize two sub-streams to process the WSI patches with two\nresolutions, where a square pooling is devised in a high-resolution stream to\nsignificantly reduce computational costs, and a cross-attention-based method is\nproposed to properly handle the fusion of dual-stream features. We validate our\nDSCA on three publicly-available datasets with a total number of 3,101 WSIs\nfrom 1,911 patients. Our experiments and ablation studies verify that (i) the\nproposed DSCA could outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in cancer\nprognosis, by an average C-Index improvement of around 4.6%; (ii) our DSCA\nnetwork is more efficient in computation -- it has more learnable parameters\n(6.31M vs. 860.18K) but less computational costs (2.51G vs. 4.94G), compared to\na typical existing multi-resolution network. (iii) the key components of DSCA,\ndual-stream and cross-attention, indeed contribute to our model's performance,\ngaining an average C-Index rise of around 2.0% while maintaining a\nrelatively-small computational load. Our DSCA could serve as an alternative and\neffective tool for WSI-based cancer prognosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 16:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 02:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 15:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

To boost cost-efficiency, MLLess implements two innovative\noptimizations tailored to the traits of serverless computing: on one hand, a\nsignificance filter, to make indirect communication more effective, and on the\nother hand, a scale-in auto-tuner, to reduce cost by benefiting from the FaaS\nsub-second billing model (often per 100ms). Our results certify that MLLess can\nbe 15X faster than serverful ML systems at a lower cost for sparse ML models\nthat exhibit fast convergence such as sparse logistic regression and matrix\nfactorization.

Its core idea\nis to automatically tune the internal parameter of FSS by solving an\noptimization problem using BO.

In the late 1980s, the conjectures were disproved by Thomason\nand Sidorenko, respectively. A classification of graphs whose number of\nmonochromatic copies is minimized by the random 2-edge-coloring, which are\nreferred to as common graphs, remains a challenging open problem. If\nSidorenko's Conjecture, one of the most significant open problems in extremal\ngraph theory, is true, then every 2-chromatic graph is common, and in fact, no\n2-chromatic common graph unsettled for Sidorenko's Conjecture is known.

This approach involves\ntwo timescales associated with the first appearance (at time $t_{{\\rm p}_1}>0$)\nand stabilization (at time $t_{\\rm p}>t_{{\\rm p}_1}$) of a giant percolation\ncluster, as previously reported. However, the microscopic mechanisms that\ncontrol such timescales are not yet fully understood. In this paper, in order\nto study their role on each time regime after the quench ($T_F=0$), we\ndistinguish between spin flips that decrease the total energy of the system\nfrom those that keep it constant, the latter being parametrized by the\nprobability $p$. We show that the cluster size heterogeneity $H(t,p)$ and the\ntypical domain size $\\ell (t,p)$ have no dependence on $p$ in the first time\nregime up to $t_{{\\rm p}_1}$. On the other hand, the time for stabilizing a\npercolating cluster is controlled by the acceptance probability of\nconstant-energy flips: $t_{\\rm p}(p) \\sim p^{-1}$ for $p\\ll 1$ (at $p=0$, the\ndynamics gets stuck in a metastable state). These flips are also the relevant\nones in the later coarsening regime where dynamical scaling takes place.\nBecause the phenomenology on the approach to the percolation point seems to be\nshared by many 2d systems with a non-conserved order parameter dynamics (and\ncertain cases of conserved ones as well), our results may suggest a simple and\neffective way to set, through the dynamics itself, $t_{{\\rm p}_1}$ and $t_{\\rm\np}$ in such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 18:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Automatic,\nfast and cheap strategies to estimate essential material properties for quality\ncontrol, risk mitigation and the prediction of faults are highly desirable. In\nthis work we analyse a high throughput production line of steel-based products.\nCurrently, the material quality is checked using manual destructive testing,\nwhich is slow, wasteful and covers only a tiny fraction of the material. To\nachieve complete testing coverage our industrial collaborator developed a\ncontactless, non-invasive, electromagnetic sensor to measure all material\nduring production in real-time. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We show in a\ncontrolled experiment that the sensor can distinguish steel with deliberately\naltered properties. 2) 48 steel coils were fully measured non-invasively and\nadditional destructive tests were conducted on samples to serve as ground\ntruth. A linear model is fitted to predict from the non-invasive measurements\ntwo key material properties (yield strength and tensile strength) that normally\nare obtained by destructive tests. The performance is evaluated in\nleave-one-coil-out cross-validation. 3) The resulting model is used to analyse\nthe material properties and the relationship with logged product faults on real\nproduction data of ~108 km of processed material measured with the non-invasive\nsensor. The model achieves an excellent performance (F3-score of 0.95)\npredicting material running out of specifications for the tensile strength. The\ncombination of model predictions and logged product faults shows that if a\nsignificant percentage of estimated yield stress values is out of\nspecification, the risk of product faults is high.

These systems present unique difficulties in analyzing noise-induced\nescape over a barrier, including the presence of nonlocal interactions,\nnongradient terms in the energy functional, and dynamical textures as initial\nor saddle states. We begin with a discussion of magnetic reversal between\nsingle-domain configurations of the magnetization. Here the transition (saddle)\nstate can be either a single-domain or a spatially varying (instanton-like)\nconfiguration, and depending on the system parameters can exhibit either\nArrhenius or non-Arrhenius reversal rates. We then turn to a discussion of\ntransitions between magnetic textures, which can be either static and\ntopologically protected or dynamic and not topologically protected. An example\nof the latter case is the droplet soliton, a rotating\nnontopologically-protected configuration, which we find can occur either as a\nmetastable or transition state in a nanoscopic magnetic system. After\ndiscussing various issues in calculating transition rates, we present results\nfor the activation barriers for creation and annihilation of these magnetic\ntextures.

To address this\nimpedance mismatch, various data shuffling strategies have been proposed to\nbalance the convergence rate of SGD (which favors randomness) and its I/O\nperformance (which favors sequential access).\n  In this paper, we first conduct a systematic empirical study on existing data\nshuffling strategies, which reveals that all existing strategies have room for\nimprovement -- they all suffer in terms of I/O performance or convergence rate.\nWith this in mind, we propose a simple but novel hierarchical data shuffling\nstrategy, CorgiPile.

We provide a non-trivial theoretical analysis of\nCorgiPile on its convergence behavior. We further integrate CorgiPile into\nPyTorch by designing new parallel/distributed shuffle operators inside a new\nCorgiPileDataSet API.

However, the fisheye\nimage generally contains invalid black regions induced by its imaging model. In\nthis paper, we present a FisheyeEX method that extends the FoV of the fisheye\nlens by outpainting the invalid regions, improving the integrity of captured\nscenes. Compared with the rectangle and undistorted image, there are two\nchallenges for fisheye image outpainting: irregular painting regions and\ndistortion synthesis. Observing the radial symmetry of the fisheye image, we\nfirst propose a polar outpainting strategy to extrapolate the coherent\nsemantics from the center to the outside region. Such an outpainting manner\nconsiders the distribution pattern of radial distortion and the circle\nboundary, boosting a more reasonable completion direction. For the distortion\nsynthesis, we propose a spiral distortion-aware perception module, in which the\nlearning path keeps consistent with the distortion prior of the fisheye image.\nSubsequently, a scene revision module rearranges the generated pixels with the\nestimated distortion to match the fisheye image, thus extending the FoV. In the\nexperiment, we evaluate the proposed FisheyeEX on three popular outdoor\ndatasets: Cityscapes, BDD100k, and KITTI, and one real-world fisheye image\ndataset.

To add\nprecision and ground these discussions, we provide a guide for how to analyze\nAI x-risk, which consists of three parts: First, we review how systems can be\nmade safer today, drawing on time-tested concepts from hazard analysis and\nsystems safety that have been designed to steer large processes in safer\ndirections. Next, we discuss strategies for having long-term impacts on the\nsafety of future systems. Finally, we discuss a crucial concept in making AI\nsystems safer by improving the balance between safety and general capabilities.\nWe hope this document and the presented concepts and tools serve as a useful\nguide for understanding how to analyze AI x-risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 00:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 03:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 18:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 18:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 17:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 21:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 16:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

To\ndeal with the ambiguity, most existing studies resort to additional constraint\ninformation or implicit inference by analyzing two-view geometries or feature\npoints. In this paper, we propose to exploit high-level information in the\nscene, i.e., the spatial contextual information of local regions, to guide the\nreconstruction. Specifically, a novel structure is proposed, namely,\n{\\textit{track-community}}, in which each community consists of a group of\ntracks and represents a local segment in the scene. A community detection\nalgorithm is used to partition the scene into several segments. Then, the\npotential ambiguous segments are detected by analyzing the neighborhood of\ntracks and corrected by checking the pose consistency. Finally, we perform\npartial reconstruction on each segment and align them with a novel\nbidirectional consistency cost function which considers both 3D-3D\ncorrespondences and pairwise relative camera poses. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach can robustly alleviate reconstruction failure\nresulting from visually indistinguishable structures and accurately merge the\npartial reconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

We first focus\non three samples that span a large parameter space: young massive disk stars\n(~3M), FGKM spectral type stars (~3M), and UCDs (~20K). We provide these\nsources along with additional information (either a flag or complementary\nparameters) as tables that are made available in the Gaia archive. We\nfurthermore identify 15740 bone fide carbon stars, 5863 solar-analogues, and\nprovide the first homogeneous set of stellar parameters of the Spectro\nPhotometric Standard Stars. We use a subset of the OBA sample to illustrate its\nusefulness to analyse the Milky Way rotation curve. We then use the properties\nof the FGKM stars to analyse known exoplanet systems. We also analyse the ages\nof some unseen UCD-companions to the FGKM stars. We additionally predict the\ncolours of the Sun in various passbands (Gaia, 2MASS, WISE) using the\nsolar-analogue sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate a multiple FL service trading problem in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided networks, where FL service demanders (FLSDs) aim to\npurchase various data sets from feasible clients (smart devices, e.g.,\nsmartphones, smart vehicles), and model aggregation services from UAVs, to\nfulfill their requirements. An auction-based trading market is established to\nfacilitate the trading among three parties, i.e., FLSDs acting as buyers,\ndistributed located client groups acting as data-sellers, and UAVs acting as\nUAV-sellers. The proposed auction is formalized as a 0-1 integer programming\nproblem, aiming to maximize the overall buyers' revenue via investigating\nwinner determination and payment rule design.

The intuition behind this methodology consists in\ndriving the input, rather than computing it, towards the unknown value that\nachieves the desired dynamic behavior of the herd.

Training with large batches on individual clients is proposed to\naddress data heterogeneity in general, but their effectiveness under partial\nclient participation is not clear. Motivated by these challenges, we propose to\ndevelop a novel federated learning framework, referred to as FedAMD, for\npartial client participation.

In this paper, we study the expressive power of GNN for\nthe said classification task, which is in essence a function interpolation\nproblem. Explicitly, we derive the number of weights and layers needed for a\nGNN to interpolate a band-limited function in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Recent\nadvances towards weakly supervised vision-language models that learn holistic\nrepresentations from cheap weakly supervised noisy text annotations have shown\ntheir ability on semantic understanding by capturing object characteristics\nthat generalize under different domains. However, when multiple source domains\nare involved, the cost of curating textual annotations for every image in the\ndataset can blow up several times, depending on their number. This makes the\nprocess tedious and infeasible, hindering us from directly using these\nsupervised vision-language approaches to achieve the best generalization on an\nunseen domain. Motivated from this, we study how multimodal information from\nexisting pre-trained multimodal networks can be leveraged in an \"intrinsic\" way\nto make systems generalize under unseen domains. To this end, we propose\nIntriNsic multimodality for DomaIn GeneralizatiOn (INDIGO), a simple and\nelegant way of leveraging the intrinsic modality present in these pre-trained\nmultimodal networks along with the visual modality to enhance generalization to\nunseen domains at test-time.

Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods fail to support\nthe extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in vision tasks, due to the poor\ndescriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D\nLiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully\nconsiders the characteristics (such as sparsity, complexity of scenarios) of\nLiDAR point cloud, and represents current keypoint with its robust neighbor\nkeypoints, which provide strong constraint on the description of current\nkeypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on two public datasets (i.e.,\nKITTI, Steven VLP16), and the experimental results show that our method greatly\noutperforms the state-of-the-arts in matching performance.

We propose a bottom-up framework where the pooling\ndegree of identified rides is gradually increased, thereby ensuring\nattractiveness at subsequent aggregation levels. Our Hyper-pool method outputs\nthe set of attractive pooled rides per service variant for a given travel\ndemand. The algorithms are publicly available and reproducible. It is\napplicable for real-size demand datasets and opens new opportunities for\nexploiting the limits of ride-pooling potential. In our Amsterdam case-study we\nmanaged to pool over 220 travellers into 40 hyper-pooled rides of average\noccupancy 5.8 pax/veh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing\nthe sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some\nextent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation\nscenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle\nthis issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning\napproach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated\ndescription text of items to learn transferable representations across\ndifferent recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item\nrepresentations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on\nparametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning\nuniversal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training\ntasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal\nsequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to\nnew recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under\neither inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nEspecially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a\ncross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed\nuniversal SRL method.

However, while the application of private\nsynthetic data to the problem of query release has been well studied, such\nresearch is restricted to non-hierarchical data domains, raising the initial\nquestion -- what queries are important when considering data of this form?\nMoreover, it has not yet been established how one can generate synthetic data\nat both the group and individual-level while capturing such statistics. In\nlight of these challenges, we first formalize the problem of hierarchical query\nrelease, in which the goal is to release a collection of statistics for some\nhierarchical dataset.

In\nparticular, $^3$He nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes have been proposed\nas a new standard for absolute magnetometry [6, 9]. This requires a\nhigh-accuracy value for the $^3$He nuclear magnetic moment, which, however, has\nso far been determined only indirectly and with a relative precision of $12$\nparts per billon (p.p.b.)

First, by analyzing the wireless sensing process in\nhuman motion recognition, we find that there exists a thresholding value for\nthe sensing transmit power, exceeding which yields sensing data samples with\napproximately the same satisfactory quality. Then, the joint SC$^{2}$ resource\nallocation problem is cast to maximize the convergence speed of FEEL, under the\nconstraints on training time, energy supply, and sensing quality of each edge\ndevice. Solving this problem entails solving two subproblems in order: the\nfirst one reduces to determine the joint sensing and communication resource\nallocation that maximizes the total number of samples that can be sensed during\nthe entire training process; the second one concerns the partition of the\nattained total number of sensed samples over all the communication rounds to\ndetermine the batch size at each round for convergence speed maximization. The\nfirst subproblem on joint sensing and communication resource allocation is\nconverted to a single-variable optimization problem by exploiting the derived\nrelation between different control variables (resources), which thus allows an\nefficient solution via one-dimensional grid search. For the second subproblem,\nit is found that the number of samples to be sensed (or batch size) at each\nround is a decreasing function of the loss function value attained at the\nround. Based on this relationship, the approximate optimal batch size at each\ncommunication round is derived in closed-form as a function of the round index.\nFinally, extensive simulation results are provided to validate the superiority\nof the proposed joint SC$^{2}$ resource allocation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

A\nkey challenge in this problem is that the network and computation resources\ncould be allocated on different servers, since the server to which a task is\noffloaded (e.g., a server with an access point) may be different from the\nserver on which the task is eventually processed.

As\nopposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make\na good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time.\nTwo direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat\npixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended\nflight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction\nin which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel\ndefines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next\nstep. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest\namount of currently unexplored areas.\n  Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is\nable to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more\ncomplicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited. In addition, we\npropose a way to generate a navigation-oriented dataset, enabling efficient\ntraining of our method using RGB and depth images.

In contrast to other popular\nsurvival models that work on hazard functions, the effects of covariates are\ndirectly on failure times, whose interpretation is intuitive. The\nsemiparametric AFT model that does not specify the error distribution is\nflexible and robust to departures from the distributional assumption. Owing to\nthe desirable features, this class of models has been considered as a promising\nalternative to the popular Cox model in the analysis of censored failure time\ndata. However, in these AFT models, a linear predictor for the mean is\ntypically assumed. Little research has addressed the nonlinearity of predictors\nwhen modeling the mean. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received a focal\nattention over the past decades and have achieved remarkable success in a\nvariety of fields. DNNs have a number of notable advantages and have been shown\nto be particularly useful in addressing the nonlinearity. By taking advantage\nof this, we propose to apply DNNs in fitting AFT models using a Gehan-type\nloss, combined with a sub-sampling technique.

DeepR-AFT shows a superior performance over its\nparametric or semiparametric counterparts when the predictor is nonlinear. For\nlinear predictors, DeepR-AFT performs better when the dimensions of covariates\nare large. The proposed DeepR-AFT is illustrated using two real datasets, which\ndemonstrates its superiority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 08:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

It has become increasingly important\ngiven the ever-growing popularity of online videos. However, prediction of\nwatch time not only depends on the match between the user and the video but is\noften mislead by the duration of the video itself. With the goal of improving\nwatch time, recommendation is always biased towards videos with long duration.\nModels trained on this imbalanced data face the risk of bias amplification,\nwhich misguides platforms to over-recommend videos with long duration but\noverlook the underlying user interests.\n  This paper presents the first work to study duration bias in watch-time\nprediction for video recommendation. We employ a causal graph illuminating that\nduration is a confounding factor that concurrently affects video exposure and\nwatch-time prediction -- the first effect on video causes the bias issue and\nshould be eliminated, while the second effect on watch time originates from\nvideo intrinsic characteristics and should be preserved. To remove the\nundesired bias but leverage the natural effect, we propose a Duration\nDeconfounded Quantile-based (D2Q) watch-time prediction framework, which allows\nfor scalability to perform on industry production systems. Through extensive\noffline evaluation and live experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of this\nduration-deconfounding framework by significantly outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art baselines. We have fully launched our approach on Kuaishou\nApp, which has substantially improved real-time video consumption due to more\naccurate watch-time predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 09:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The particle content of the model comprises $5_H$, $24_H$,\n$35_H$, ${\\overline{5}_F}_i$, ${10_F}_i$, $15_F$, $\\overline{15}_F$, and\n$24_V$, where subscripts $H$, $F$, and $V$ denote whether a given\nrepresentation contains scalars, fermions, or gauge bosons, respectively, while\n$i=1,2,3$. The model employs all possible interaction terms, as allowed by the\nLorentz group, the $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry, and the aforementioned particle\ncontent, to generate the Standard Model fermion masses through three different\nmechanisms. It also connects the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the\nexperimentally observed mass disparity between the down-type quarks and charged\nleptons. The minimal structure of the model requires $24_H$ and $5_H$ not only\nto break $SU(5)$ and $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)$ gauge groups,\nrespectively, but to accomplish one additional task each. The model furthermore\npredicts that neutrinos are strictly Majorana fields, that one neutrino is\npurely a massless particle, and that neutrino masses are of normal ordering.\nThe experimental bound on the $p \\rightarrow \\pi^0 e^+$ lifetime limit, in\nconjunction with the prediction of the model for the gauge mediated proton\ndecays, implies that there are four new scalar multiplets at or below a\n$120$\\,TeV mass scale if these multiplets are mass degenerate. If these\nmultiplets are not mass degenerate, the quoted limit then applies, for all\npractical purposes, to the geometric mean of their masses. The scalars in\nquestion transform as $(1,3,0)$, $(8,1,0)$, $(\\overline{3},3,-2/3)$, and\n$(\\overline{6},2,1/6)$ under the Standard Model gauge group $SU(3) \\times SU(2)\n\\times U(1)$ with calculable couplings to the Standard Model fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 10:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The present work proposes a new data-driven\nstrategy which conserves the symmetries in a cost-effective way and delivers\nconsistent results over a wide range of grids. The method is based on\nartificial neural networks with deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture\nwhich read volume fraction fields on regular grids. The anti-symmetries are\npreserved with no additional cost by employing a neural network model with\ninput normalization, odd-symmetric activation functions and bias-free neurons.\nThe symmetries are further conserved by height-function inspired rotations and\naveraging over several different orientations. The new symmetry-preserving MLP\nmodel is implemented into a flow solver (OpenFOAM) and tested against\nconventional schemes in the literature.

Since there are\nno publicly-available GBF tools for concurrent code, we first propose OpenGBF\n-- a new open-source concurrency-aware gray-box fuzzer that explores different\nthread schedules by instrumenting the code under test with random delays.

On the other hand, we aggregate the\noutcomes of the BMC and GBF tools in the ensemble using a decision matrix, thus\nimproving the accuracy of EBF. We evaluate EBF against state-of-the-art pure\nBMC tools and show that it can generate up to 14.9% more correct verification\nwitnesses than the corresponding BMC tools alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthe efficacy of OpenGBF, by showing that it can find 24.2% of the\nvulnerabilities in our evaluation suite, while non-concurrency-aware GBF tools\ncan only find 0.55%.

For\nneural networks, however, the intrinsic mechanism that yields low-rank\nstructures remains vague and unclear. To fill this gap, we perform a rigorous\nstudy on the behavior of network rank, focusing particularly on the notion of\nrank deficiency. We theoretically establish a universal monotonic decreasing\nproperty of network rank from the basic rules of differential and algebraic\ncomposition, and uncover rank deficiency of network blocks and deep function\ncoupling. By virtue of our numerical tools, we provide the first empirical\nanalysis of the per-layer behavior of network rank in practical settings, i.e.,\nResNets, deep MLPs, and Transformers on ImageNet. These empirical results are\nin direct accord with our theory. Furthermore, we reveal a novel phenomenon of\nindependence deficit caused by the rank deficiency of deep networks, where\nclassification confidence of a given category can be linearly decided by the\nconfidence of a handful of other categories.

The photometric time series were used to perform a Fourier\nanalysis, while the global astrophysical parameters necessary for the empirical\ninstability strips were taken from the Gaia DR3 gspphot tables, and the vsini\ndata were taken from the Gaia DR3 esphs tables. We show that for nearby\nOBAF-type pulsators, the Gaia DR3 data are precise and accurate enough to\npinpoint them in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We find empirical instability\nstrips covering broader regions than theoretically predicted. In particular,\nour study reveals the presence of fast rotating gravity-mode pulsators outside\nthe strips, as well as the co-existence of rotationally modulated variables\ninside the strips as reported before in the literature.

The term \"leaky pipeline\" is often used to describe the lack of\nretention of women before they progress to senior roles. Numerous initiatives\nhave targeted the problem of the leaky pipeline in recent decades. This paper\nprovides a comprehensive review of initiatives related to techniques used to\nboost recruitment and retention of women in undergraduate computing and related\ncourses in higher education. The primary aim was to identify interventions or\ninitiatives (which we called \"actions\") that have shown some effectiveness. A\nsecondary objective was to structure our findings as a categorisation, in order\nto enable future action discussion, comparison and planning. A particular\nchallenge faced in a significant portion of the work was the lack of\nevaluation: i.e. the assessment of the direct relationship between the\ninitiatives and the outcomes on retention or recruitment. The actions were\ncategorised into four groups: Policy, Pedagogy, Influence and Support and\nPromotion and Engagement. Policy actions need support and potentially\nstructural change at institution level. Pedagogy actions are initiatives\nrelated to the teaching of computing courses. The Influence and Support\ncategory includes actions associated with ways to influence women to choose\ncomputing and once enrolled to support and encourage them to stay. Finally,\nPromotion and Engagement actions are initiatives to promote computing based\ncourses and involve engagement and outreach activities. We present our\ncategorisation, identifying the literature related to actions under each\ncategory and subcategory. We discuss the challenges with evaluating the direct\nimpact of actions and outline how this work leads towards the next phase of our\nwork - a toolkit of actions to promote retention and recruitment of women in\ncomputing undergraduate courses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 12:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

However\nin practice, when estimating average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) via\nmatching, no matter which method, the trade-off between estimation accuracy and\ninformation loss constantly exist. Attempting to completely replace the\nmatching process, this paper proposes the GAN-ATT estimator that integrates\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) into counterfactual inference framework.\nThrough GAN machine learning, the probability density functions (PDFs) of\nsamples in both treatment group and control group can be approximated. By\ndifferentiating conditional PDFs of the two groups with identical input\ncondition, the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) can be estimated,\nand the ensemble average of corresponding CATEs over all treatment group\nsamples is the estimate of ATT. Utilizing GAN-based infinite sample\naugmentations, problems in the case of insufficient samples or lack of common\nsupport domains can be easily solved. Theoretically, when GAN could perfectly\nlearn the PDFs, our estimators can provide exact estimate of ATT.\n  To check the performance of the GAN-ATT estimator, three sets of data are\nused for ATT estimations: Two toy data sets with 1/2 dimensional covariate\ninputs and constant/covariate-dependent treatment effect are tested. The\nestimates of GAN-ATT are proved close to the ground truth and are better than\ntraditional matching approaches; A real firm-level data set with\nhigh-dimensional input is tested and the applicability towards real data sets\nis evaluated by comparing matching approaches. Through the evidences obtained\nfrom the three tests, we believe that the GAN-ATT estimator has significant\nadvantages over traditional matching methods in estimating ATT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 12:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The top three $Z^0$ propagated channels in cross\nsections for double charmonia are $J/\\psi+h_c,\\eta_c+\\chi_{c2}$, and\n$\\eta_c+\\chi_{c0}$.

To this end, a plethora of so-called\ncentrality measures have been proposed in the literature. Such measures assess\nwhich vertices in a graph are the most important ones by analyzing the\nstructure of the underlying graph. A family of centrality measures that are\nsuited for graph databases has been recently proposed by relying on the\nfollowing simple principle: the importance of a vertex in a graph is relative\nto the number of ``relevant'' connected subgraphs surrounding it; we refer to\nthe members of this family as subgraph-based centrality measures. Although it\nhas been shown that such measures enjoy several favourable properties, their\nabsolute expressiveness remains largely unexplored. The goal of this work is to\nprecisely characterize the absolute expressiveness of the family of\nsubgraph-based centrality measures by considering both directed and undirected\ngraphs. To this end, we characterize when an arbitrary centrality measure is a\nsubgraph-based one, or a subgraph-based measure relative to the induced\nranking. These characterizations provide us with technical tools that allow us\nto determine whether well-established centrality measures are subgraph-based.\nSuch a classification, apart from being interesting in its own right, gives\nuseful insights on the structural similarities and differences among existing\ncentrality measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 13:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 19:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

These parameters are effective\ntemperature, surface gravity, metallicity, absolute $M_G$ magnitude, radius,\ndistance, and extinction for each star. GSP-Phot uses a Bayesian\nforward-modelling approach to simultaneously fit the BP/RP spectrum, parallax,\nand apparent $G$ magnitude. A major design feature of GSP-Phot is the use of\nthe apparent flux levels of BP/RP spectra to derive, in combination with\nisochrone models, tight observational constraints on radii and distances. We\ncarefully validate the uncertainty estimates by exploiting repeat Gaia\nobservations of the same source. The data release includes GSP-Phot results for\n471 million sources with $G<19$.

The control inputs are a\nforce, which is normal to the cross section and distributed piecewise\nconstantly along the rod's axis, as well as two external lumped loads at the\nends. It is assumed that the intervals of constancy in the normal force have\nequal length. Given initial and terminal states with a fixed time horizon, the\noptimal control problem is to minimize the mean mechanical energy stored in the\nrod. To solve the problem, two unknown functions are introduced: the dynamical\npotential and the longitudinal displacements. As a result, the initial-boundary\nvalue problem is reformulated in a weak form, in which constitutive relations\nare given as an integral quadratic equation. The unknown functions are both\ncontinuous in the new statement. For the uniform rod, they are found as linear\ncombinations of traveling waves. In this case, all conditions on continuity as\nwell as boundary, initial, and terminal constraints form a linear algebraic\nsystem with respect to the traveling waves and control functions. The minimal\ncontrollability time is found from the solvability condition for this algebraic\nsystem. After resolving the system, remaining free variables are used to\noptimize the cost functional. Thus, the original control problem is reduced to\na one-dimensional variational problem. The Euler-Lagrange necessary condition\nyields a linear system of ordinary differential equations with constant\ncoefficients supplemented by essential and natural boundary conditions.\nTherefore, the exact optimal control law and the corresponding dynamic and\nkinematic fields are found explicitly.

While\ntheoretically sound, this approach is impractical for many reasons, e.g., the\ncontrol scheme is often not unique and half of the nodes may be driver genes\nfor the cell. We developed a novel approach that transcends structural\ncontrollability. Instead of considering driver genes for one control scheme, we\nconsidered control hub genes that reside in the middle of a control path of\nevery control scheme. Control hubs are the most vulnerable spots for\ncontrolling the cell and exogenous stimuli on them may render the cell\nuncontrollable. We adopted control hubs as cancer-keep genes (CKGs) and applied\nthem to a gene regulatory network of bladder cancer (BLCA). All the genes on\nthe cell cycle and p53 singling pathways in BLCA are CKGs, confirming the\nimportance of these genes and the two pathways in cancer. A smaller set of 35\nsensitive CKGs (sCKGs) for BLCA was identified by removing network links. Six\nsCKGs (RPS6KA3, FGFR3, N-cadherin (CDH2), EP300, caspase-1, and FN1) were\nsubjected to small-interferencing-RNA knockdown in four cell lines to validate\ntheir effects on the proliferation or migration of cancer cells. Knocking down\nRPS6KA3 in a mouse model of BLCA significantly inhibited the growth of tumor\nxenografts in the mouse model. Combined, our results demonstrated the value of\nCKGs as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy and the potential of CKGs as an\neffective means for studying and characterizing cancer etiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 13:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

We then\nconsider the influence of inputs through the notions of ISS, integral ISS, and\ninput-to-output stability and provide both Lyapunov-like and solutions-based\ncharacterizations of these properties. We also show how these notions can be\nhelpful for the stability analysis of interconnected systems, whether in\ncascade or in feedback form. We finally provide a list of questions which\nremain open until now.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 13:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

However, it is still of\ngreat challenge to learn from scratch on small-scale datasets efficiently and\neffectively. With limited training datasets, the concepts of categories will be\nambiguous since the over-parameterized CNNs tend to simply memorize the\ndataset, leading to poor generalization capacity. Therefore, it is crucial to\nstudy how to learn more discriminative representations while avoiding\nover-fitting. Since the concepts of categories tend to be ambiguous, it is\nimportant to catch more individual-wise information. Thus, we propose a new\nframework, termed Attract-and-Repulse, which consists of Contrastive\nRegularization (CR) to enrich the feature representations, Symmetric Cross\nEntropy (SCE) to balance the fitting for different classes and Mean Teacher to\ncalibrate label information. Specifically, SCE and CR learn discriminative\nrepresentations while alleviating over-fitting by the adaptive trade-off\nbetween the information of classes (attract) and instances (repulse). After\nthat, Mean Teacher is used to further improve the performance via calibrating\nmore accurate soft pseudo labels. Sufficient experiments validate the\neffectiveness of the Attract-and-Repulse framework. Together with other\nstrategies, such as aggressive data augmentation, TenCrop inference, and models\nensembling, we achieve the second place in ICCV 2021 VIPriors Image\nClassification Challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 13:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

AAA can cause death if\nrupture occurs. Elective surgeries are recommended to prevent rupture based on\ngeometrical measurements of AAA diameter and diameter growth rate. Reliability\nof these geometric parameters to predict the AAA rupture risk has been\nquestioned, and biomechanical assessment has been proposed to distinguish\nbetween patients with high and low risk of rupture. Stress in aneurysm wall is\nthe main variable of interest in such assessment. Most studies use finite\nelement method to compute AAA stress. This requires discretising\npatient-specific geometry (aneurysm wall and intraluminal thrombus ILT) into\nfinite elements/meshes. Tetrahedral elements are most commonly used as they can\nbe generated in seemingly automated and effortless way. In practice, however,\ndue to complex aneurysm geometry, the process tends to require time consuming\nmesh optimisation to ensure sufficiently high quality of tetrahedral elements.\nFurthermore, ensuring solution convergence requires large number of tetrahedral\nelements, which leads to long computation times. In this study, we focus on\ngeneration of hexahedral meshes as they are known to provide converged solution\nfor smaller number of elements than tetrahedral meshes.

Such big models are not only strong\nperformers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the\ntask-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified\nML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the\nrecommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard\nrecommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features.\nThat is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique\nIDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms.\nTo pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS\nmodels in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a\nmixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present\nTransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework.\nTransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an\nend-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under\nvarious scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically\nstudy the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world\nrecommendation settings. Besides, we look at its effects by scaling source and\ntarget data size. Our results suggest that learning neural recommendation\nmodels from MoM feedback provides a promising way to realize universal RS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 09:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

While this is a\nsafe assumption for many applications, recent advances in ultrafast imaging\nleverage the wealth of information that can be extracted from the exact time of\nflight of light. In this context, physically-based transient rendering allows\nto efficiently simulate and analyze light transport considering that the speed\nof light is indeed finite. In this paper, we introduce a novel differentiable\ntransient rendering framework, to help bring the potential of differentiable\napproaches into the transient regime. To differentiate the transient path\nintegral we need to take into account that scattering events at path vertices\nare no longer independent; instead, tracking the time of flight of light\nrequires treating such scattering events at path vertices jointly as a\nmultidimensional, evolving manifold. We thus turn to the generalized transport\ntheorem, and introduce a novel correlated importance term, which links the\ntime-integrated contribution of a path to its light throughput, and allows us\nto handle discontinuities in the light and sensor functions. Last, we present\nresults in several challenging scenarios where the time of flight of light\nplays an important role such as optimizing indices of refraction,\nnon-line-of-sight tracking with nonplanar relay walls, and non-line-of-sight\ntracking around two corners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

The large frequency difference between a transmon and a fluxonium makes\nthe realization of a two-qubit gate challenging. For a medium-frequency\nfluxonium qubit, the transmon-fluxonium system allows for a cross-resonance\neffect mediated by the higher levels of the fluxonium over a wide range of\ntransmon frequencies. This allows one to realize the cross-resonance gate by\ndriving the fluxonium at the transmon frequency, mitigating typical problems of\nthe cross-resonance gate in transmon-transmon chips related to frequency\ntargeting and residual ZZ coupling. However, when the fundamental frequency of\nthe fluxonium enters the low-frequency regime below 100 MHz, the\ncross-resonance effect decreases leading to long gate times. For this range of\nparameters, a fast microwave CPHASE gate can be implemented using the higher\nlevels of the fluxonium.

We examine the blockchain synchronization in a bidirectional\nmanner via investigating the impact of full nodes as responders and that of\npartial nodes as requesters.

However, existing DNN-based LF\nimage SR methods are developed on a single fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic\ndownsampling), and thus cannot be applied to super-resolve real LF images with\ndiverse degradations. In this paper, we propose the first method to handle LF\nimage SR with multiple degradations. In our method, a practical LF degradation\nmodel that considers blur and noise is developed to approximate the degradation\nprocess of real LF images. Then, a degradation-adaptive network (LF-DAnet) is\ndesigned to incorporate the degradation prior into the SR process. By training\non LF images with multiple synthetic degradations, our method can learn to\nadapt to different degradations while incorporating the spatial and angular\ninformation. Extensive experiments on both synthetically degraded and\nreal-world LFs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with\nexisting state-of-the-art single and LF image SR methods, our method achieves\nsuperior SR performance under a wide range of degradations, and generalizes\nbetter to real LF images.

The\nproduction is measured at midrapidity, $|y| < 0.5$, in a wide transverse\nmomentum range, $0 < p_{\\rm T} < 16$ GeV/$c$, by reconstructing the resonance\nin the ${\\rm f}_{0}(980) \\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ hadronic decay channel\nusing the ALICE detector. The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential yields are compared to\nthose of pions, protons and $\\phi$ mesons as well as to predictions from the\nHERWIG 7.2 QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generator and calculations from a\ncoalescence model that uses the AMPT model as an input. The ratio of the\n$p_{\\rm T}$-integrated yield of ${\\rm f}_{0}(980)$ relative to pions is\ncompared to measurements in ${\\rm e}^{+}{\\rm e}^{-}$ and pp collisions at lower\nenergies and predictions from statistical hadronisation models and HERWIG 7.2.\nA mild collision energy dependence of the ${\\rm f}_{0}(980)$ to pion production\nis observed in pp collisions from SPS to LHC energies.

The prediction from the $\\gamma_{\\rm s}$-CSM model assuming a zero total\nstrangeness content of ${\\rm f}_{0}(980)$ is consistent with the data within\n1.9$\\sigma$ and is the closest to the data. The results provide an essential\nreference for future measurements of the particle yield and nuclear\nmodification in p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions, which have been proposed to be\ninstrumental to probe the elusive nature and quark composition of the ${\\rm\nf}_{0}(980)$ scalar meson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

Almost all\ncomputational methods adopt approximations in some form in order to obtain a\nfavourable cost/accuracy trade-off and there are usually many approximations\nthat could be used. As a result, when a researcher wishes to measure a property\nof a system with a computational technique, they are faced with an array of\noptions. Current computational workflow frameworks focus on helping researchers\nautomate a sequence of steps on a particular platform. The aim is often to\nobtain a computational measurement of a property.

However, by\nbuilding on work of Zarach, we provide a general framework for separating\ndependent choice schemes of various lengths by producing models of ZFC$^-$ with\nproper classes that are not big.

Moreover, there are no explanations\nfor the success of using $m$-sharpness in SAM which has been shown as essential\nfor generalization. To better understand this aspect of SAM, we theoretically\nanalyze its implicit bias for diagonal linear networks. We prove that SAM\nalways chooses a solution that enjoys better generalization properties than\nstandard gradient descent for a certain class of problems, and this effect is\namplified by using $m$-sharpness.

As a result, providing explanations for\ntheir decisions to address the needs of users and organisations is increasingly\nexpected by laws, regulations, codes of conduct, and the public. However, as\nlaws and regulations do not prescribe how to meet such expectations,\norganisations are often left to devise their own approaches to explainability,\ninevitably increasing the cost of compliance and good governance. Hence, we\nenvision Explainability-by-Design, a holistic methodology characterised by\nproactive measures to include explanation capability in the design of\ndecision-making systems. The methodology consists of three phases: (A)\nExplanation Requirement Analysis, (B) Explanation Technical Design, and (C)\nExplanation Validation. This paper describes phase (B), a technical workflow to\nimplement explanation capability from requirements elicited by domain experts\nfor a specific application context. Outputs of this phase are a set of\nconfigurations, allowing a reusable explanation service to exploit logs\nprovided by the target application to create provenance traces of the\napplication's decisions. The provenance then can be queried to extract relevant\ndata points, which can be used in explanation plans to construct explanations\npersonalised to their consumers. Following the workflow, organisations can\ndesign their decision-making systems to produce explanations that meet the\nspecified requirements. To facilitate the process, we present a software\narchitecture with reusable components to incorporate the resulting explanation\ncapability into an application. Finally, we applied the workflow to two\napplication scenarios and measured the associated development costs. It was\nshown that the approach is tractable in terms of development time, which can be\nas low as two hours per sentence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 15:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 23:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Nevertheless, the coarse resolution may lead to\ndifficulties in medical diagnosis by either physicians or computer-aided\ndiagnosis algorithms. Deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution (SR)\nmethods are feasible ways to improve resolution, with convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) at their core. Despite recent progress, these methods are\nlimited by inherent properties of convolution operators, which ignore content\nrelevance and cannot effectively model long-range dependencies. In addition,\nmost of the existing methods use pseudo-paired volumes for training and\nevaluation, where pseudo low-resolution (LR) volumes are generated by a simple\ndegradation of their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the domain gap\nbetween pseudo- and real-LR volumes leads to the poor performance of these\nmethods in practice. In this paper, we build the first public real-paired\ndataset RPLHR-CT as a benchmark for volumetric SR, and provide baseline results\nby re-implementing four state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. Considering the\ninherent shortcoming of CNN, we also propose a transformer volumetric\nsuper-resolution network (TVSRN) based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with\nconvolutions entirely. This is the first research to use a pure transformer for\nCT volumetric SR. The experimental results show that TVSRN significantly\noutperforms all baselines on both PSNR and SSIM. Moreover, the TVSRN method\nachieves a better trade-off between the image quality, the number of\nparameters, and the running time.

Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans play\nan important role in the study of glioma prognosis OS time. Several deep\nlearning-based methods are proposed for the OS time prediction on multi-modal\nMRI problems. However, these methods usually fuse multi-modal information at\nthe beginning or at the end of the deep learning networks and lack the fusion\nof features from different scales. In addition, the fusion at the end of\nnetworks always adapts global with global (eg. fully connected after\nconcatenation of global average pooling output) or local with local (eg.\nbilinear pooling), which loses the information of local with global.

The agents connect through credit\ninstruments borrowed from each other or through direct lending, and these\ncreate the liability edges. These random edges are modified (locally) by the\nagents over time, as they learn from their experiences and (possibly imperfect)\nobservations. The settlement of the liabilities of various agents at the end of\nthe contract period (at any time instance) can be expressed as solutions of\nrandom fixed point equations. Our first step is to derive the solutions of\nthese equations (asymptotically and one for each time instance), using a recent\nresult on random fixed point equations. The agents, at any time instance, adapt\none of the two available strategies, risky or less risky investments, with an\naim to maximize their returns. We aim to study the emerging strategies of such\nreplicator dynamics that drives the financial network. We theoretically reduce\nthe analysis of the complex system to that of an appropriate ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE). Using the attractors of the resulting ODE we show\nthat the replicator dynamics converges to one of the two pure evolutionary\nstable strategies (all risky or all less risky agents); one can have mixed\nlimit only when the observations are imperfect. We verify our theoretical\nfindings using exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations. The dynamics avoid the\nemergence of the systemic-risk regime (where majority default). However, if all\nthe agents blindly adapt risky strategy it can lead to systemic risk regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 09:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-23"}

In this\nsituation, control of such a process by its mathematical model can be used to\nsuppress chaotic behavior and to transit the system from irregular to regular\ndynamics.\n  In this paper, we have constructed an overlapping generations model with a\ncontrol function. By applying evolutionary algorithms we showed that in the\nabsence of control, both regular and irregular behavior (periodic and chaotic)\ncould be observed in this model. We then used the synthesis of control by the\nPyragas control method with two control parameters to solve the problem of\ncontrolling the irregular behavior of the model. We solved a number of\noptimization problems applying evolutionary algorithms to select control\nparameters in order to ensure stability of periodic orbits. We compared\nqualitative and quantitative characteristics of the model's dynamics before and\nafter applying control and verified the results obtained using simulation.\n  We thus demonstrated that artificial intelligence technologies (in\nparticular, evolutionary algorithms) combined with the Pyragas control method\nare well suited for in-depth analysis and stabilization of irregular dynamics\nin the model considered in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 17:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}
