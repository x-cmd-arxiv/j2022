These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,\nironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations\namong data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the\nstructure of the graph) to allow target nodes to evade detection or degenerate\nthe classification performance of the detection. In this paper, we exploit this\nvulnerability by designing the structural poisoning attacks to a FeXtra-based\nGAD system termed OddBall as well as the black box attacks against GCN-based\nGAD systems by attacking the imbalanced lienarized GCN ( LGCN ). Specifically,\nwe formulate the attack against OddBall and LGCN as a one-level optimization\nproblem by incorporating different regression techniques, where the key\ntechnical challenge is to efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain.\nWe propose a novel attack method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient\ndescent. Comparing to prior arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient\ninformation, making it particularly suitable for solving discrete optimization\nproblems, thus opening the door to studying a new type of attack against\nsecurity analytic tools that rely on graph data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

In the\ncurrent online pedagogical setting, paraphrasing these problems is helpful for\nacademicians to generate multiple syntactically diverse questions for\nassessments. It also helps induce variation to ensure that the student has\nunderstood the problem instead of just memorizing it or using unfair means to\nsolve it. The current state-of-the-art paraphrase generation models often\ncannot effectively paraphrase word problems, losing a critical piece of\ninformation (such as numbers or units) which renders the question unsolvable.\nThere is a need for paraphrase scoring methods in the context of AWP to enable\nthe training of good paraphrasers. Thus, we propose ParaQD, a self-supervised\nparaphrase quality detection method using novel data augmentations that can\nlearn latent representations to separate a high-quality paraphrase of an\nalgebraic question from a poor one by a wide margin.

When applied to tasks involving\nclassical data, such algorithms generally begin with quantum circuits for data\nencoding and then train quantum neural networks (QNNs) to minimize target\nfunctions. Although QNNs have been widely studied to improve these algorithms'\nperformance on practical tasks, there is a gap in systematically understanding\nthe influence of data encoding on the eventual performance. In this paper, we\nmake progress in filling this gap by considering the common data encoding\nstrategies based on parameterized quantum circuits. We prove that, under\nreasonable assumptions, the distance between the average encoded state and the\nmaximally mixed state could be explicitly upper-bounded with respect to the\nwidth and depth of the encoding circuit. This result in particular implies that\nthe average encoded state will concentrate on the maximally mixed state at an\nexponential speed on depth. Such concentration seriously limits the\ncapabilities of quantum classifiers, and strictly restricts the\ndistinguishability of encoded states from a quantum information perspective. We\nfurther support our findings by numerically verifying these results on both\nsynthetic and public data sets.

These design decisions include basic\nproblem formulation, the data chosen for analysis, the use the AI technology is\nput to, and operational design elements in addition to the core algorithmic\ndesign. We draw on three historical models of disability common to different\ndecision-making settings to demonstrate how differences in the definition of\ndisability can lead to highly distinct decisions on each of these aspects of\ndesign, leading in turn to AI technologies with a variety of biases and\ndownstream effects. We further show that the potential harms arising from\ninappropriate definitions of disability in fundamental design stages are\nfurther amplified by a lack of transparency and disabled participation\nthroughout the AI design process. Our analysis provides a framework for\ncritically examining AI technologies in decision-making contexts and guiding\nthe development of a design praxis for disability-related AI analytics.

To validate this claim, we run numerical\nsimulations for particular classes of Clifford circuits with noise and observe\nexponential decays. When noise levels are low, the decay rates are\nwell-correlated with the noise of each cycle assuming a digital error model. We\nperform simulations of systems up to 1,225 qubits, where the classical\nprocessing task can be easily dealt with by a workstation. Furthermore, using\nthe theoretical guarantees in Chen et al. (arXiv:2203.12703), we prove that\nClifford XEB with our proposed Clifford circuits must yield exponential decays\nunder a general error model for sufficiently low errors. Our theoretical\nresults explain some of the phenomena observed in the simulations and shed\nlight on the behavior of general linear XEB experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Economists and mathematicians have\nindependently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on\nresource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend\nprecious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine\nthe turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias\ngame in a Euclidean setting.\n  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war\ngames with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget\nwhich she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each\nturn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the\nsum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary\nbeing the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a\nsingle distinguished leaf.

We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained\nat its initial value $\\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic\nfunction; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given\nturn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\\lambda$-derivative of\ngame value.

Although able to yield\ngood performance, they involve an autoregressive (AR) decoder to generate\ntokens one by one, which is computationally inefficient. To speed up inference,\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) methods, e.g. single-step NAR, were designed, to\nenable parallel generation. However, due to an independence assumption within\nthe output tokens, performance of single-step NAR is inferior to that of AR\nmodels, especially with a large-scale corpus. There are two challenges to\nimproving single-step NAR: Firstly to accurately predict the number of output\ntokens and extract hidden variables; secondly, to enhance modeling of\ninterdependence between output tokens. To tackle both challenges, we propose a\nfast and accurate parallel transformer, termed Paraformer. This utilizes a\ncontinuous integrate-and-fire based predictor to predict the number of tokens\nand generate hidden variables. A glancing language model (GLM) sampler then\ngenerates semantic embeddings to enhance the NAR decoder's ability to model\ncontext interdependence.

To this end, a variety of measurement environments and\nscenarios are considered, including an indoor open-office area, an outdoor\nopen-space, line of sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and mobile scenarios.

An\nabundance of collective modes in the spin and valley isospin channels of\nmagic-angle graphene moir\\'e bands has been alluded to by a series of recent\nexperiments.

In this work, we study the effects\nthat galaxy mergers and morphological transformations have on setting different\nmodes of star formation at galactic scales and across cosmic time. We monitor\nthe global properties of VINTERGATAN, a 20 pc resolution cosmological zoom-in\nsimulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy. Between redshifts 1 and 5, we find that\nmajor mergers trigger multiple starburst episodes, corresponding to a tenfold\ndrop of the gas depletion time down to 100 Myr. Bursty star formation is\nenabled by the emergence of a galactic disc, when the rotational velocity of\ngas starts to dominate over its velocity dispersion. Coherent motions of gas\nthen outweigh disordered ones, such that the galaxy responds to merger-induced\nforcings by redistributing large amounts of gas towards high densities. As a\nresult, the overall star formation rate is enhanced with an associated decrease\nin the depletion time. Before redshift 5, mergers are expected to be even more\nfrequent. However, a more turbulent interstellar medium, is incapable of\nreacting in such a collective manner so as to spark rapid star formation. Thus,\na constant long depletion time of 1 Gyr is kept, along with a low, but\ngradually increasing star formation rate. After the last major merger at\nredshift 1, VINTERGATAN spends the next 8 Gyr evolving secularly. It has a\nsettled and adiabatically growing disc, and a constant star formation rate with\ngas depletion times of 1-2 Gyr.

Feature selection techniques can be divided into two\ncategories: filter and wrapper methods. While wrapper methods commonly result\nin strong predictive performances, they suffer from a large computational\ncomplexity and therefore take a significant amount of time to complete,\nespecially when dealing with high-dimensional feature sets. Alternatively,\nfilter methods are considerably faster, but suffer from several other\ndisadvantages, such as (i) requiring a threshold value, (ii) not taking into\naccount intercorrelation between features, and (iii) ignoring feature\ninteractions with the model. To this end, we present powershap, a novel wrapper\nfeature selection method, which leverages statistical hypothesis testing and\npower calculations in combination with Shapley values for quick and intuitive\nfeature selection. Powershap is built on the core assumption that an\ninformative feature will have a larger impact on the prediction compared to a\nknown random feature. Benchmarks and simulations show that powershap\noutperforms other filter methods with predictive performances on par with\nwrapper methods while being significantly faster, often even reaching half or a\nthird of the execution time. As such, powershap provides a competitive and\nquick algorithm that can be used by various models in different domains.\nFurthermore, powershap is implemented as a plug-and-play and open-source\nsklearn component, enabling easy integration in conventional data science\npipelines. User experience is even further enhanced by also providing an\nautomatic mode that automatically tunes the hyper-parameters of the powershap\nalgorithm, allowing to use the algorithm without any configuration needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 18:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 09:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

Attempts to model such tasks are currently stymied by the\ninability to incorporate time. People show a flexible tradeoff between speed\nand accuracy and this tradeoff is a crucial human skill. Deep neural networks\nhave emerged as promising candidates for predicting peak human object\nrecognition performance and neural activity. However, modeling the temporal\ndimension i.e., the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT), is essential for them to\nserve as useful computational models for how humans recognize objects. To this\nend, we here present the first large-scale (148 observers, 4 neural networks, 8\ntasks) dataset of the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) in recognizing ImageNet\nimages. In each human trial, a beep, indicating the desired reaction time,\nsounds at a fixed delay after the image is presented, and observer's response\ncounts only if it occurs near the time of the beep. In a series of blocks, we\ntest many beep latencies, i.e., reaction times. We observe that human accuracy\nincreases with reaction time and proceed to compare its characteristics with\nthe behavior of several dynamic neural networks that are capable of\ninference-time adaptive computation. Using FLOPs as an analog for reaction\ntime, we compare networks with humans on curve-fit error, category-wise\ncorrelation, and curve steepness, and conclude that cascaded dynamic neural\nnetworks are a promising model of human reaction time in object recognition\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 20:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

To address these limitations, we propose an\nalternative workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH), a rapid\noptical imaging method, with deep learning-based automated interpretation of\nSRH images for intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis and real-time surgical\ndecision support. Here, we present OpenSRH, the first public dataset of\nclinical SRH images from 300+ brain tumors patients and 1300+ unique whole\nslide optical images. OpenSRH contains data from the most common brain tumors\ndiagnoses, full pathologic annotations, whole slide tumor segmentations, raw\nand processed optical imaging data for end-to-end model development and\nvalidation. We provide a framework for patch-based whole slide SRH\nclassification and inference using weak (i.e. patient-level) diagnostic labels.\nFinally, we benchmark two computer vision tasks: multiclass histologic brain\ntumor classification and patch-based contrastive representation learning. We\nhope OpenSRH will facilitate the clinical translation of rapid optical imaging\nand real-time ML-based surgical decision support in order to improve the\naccess, safety, and efficacy of cancer surgery in the era of precision\nmedicine.

A promising approach among the ensemble-based methods in the\ncontext of imbalance learning is Dynamic Selection (DS). DS techniques single\nout a subset of the classifiers in the ensemble to label each given unknown\nsample according to their estimated competence in the area surrounding the\nquery. Because only a small region is taken into account in the selection\nscheme, the global class disproportion may have less impact over the system's\nperformance. However, the presence of local class overlap may severely hinder\nthe DS techniques' performance over imbalanced distributions as it not only\nexacerbates the effects of the under-representation but also introduces\nambiguous and possibly unreliable samples to the competence estimation process.\nThus, in this work, we propose a DS technique which attempts to minimize the\neffects of the local class overlap during the classifier selection procedure.\nThe proposed method iteratively removes from the target region the instance\nperceived as the hardest to classify until a classifier is deemed competent to\nlabel the query sample. The known samples are characterized using instance\nhardness measures that quantify the local class overlap. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed technique can significantly outperform the baseline as\nwell as several other DS techniques, suggesting its suitability for dealing\nwith class under-representation and overlap.

To do so, we assembled a data set of 116 studies cited by the USPSTF\nthat report the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and\nfalse positives for the primary screening procedure for one of five cancers or\nsix sexually transmitted diseases. We use these data to estimate the\nprobability that an individual in one of 14 demographic subpopulations will\nreceive at least one false positive for one of these eleven diseases in a\nlifetime.

Juno observations have provided unprecedented views of the\nhigh latitudes, allowing for more constraints to be placed upon the troposphere\nand the overall atmospheric energy cycle. Moist convective events are believed\nto be the primary drivers of energetic storm behavior as observed on the\nplanet. Here, we introduce a novel single layer shallow water model to\ninvestigate the effects of polar moist convective events at high resolution,\nthe presence of dynamical instabilities over long timescales, and the emergence\nof FFRs at high latitudes. We use a flexible, highly parallelizable,\nfinite-difference hydrodynamic code to explore the parameter space set up by\nprevious models. We study the long term effects of deformation length (Ld),\ninjected pulse size, and injected geopotential. We find that models with Ld\nbeyond 1500 km (planetary Burger number, Bu$=4.4\\times10^{-4}$) tend to\nhomogenize their potential vorticity (PV) in the form of dominant stable polar\ncyclones, while lower Ld cases tend to show less stability with regards to\nArnol'd-type flows. We also find that large turbulent forcing scales\nconsistently lead to the formation of high latitude FFRs. Our findings support\nthe idea that moist convection, occurring at high latitudes, may be sufficient\nto produce the dynamical variety seen at the Jovian poles. Additionally,\nderived values of localized horizontal shear and Ld may constrain FFR formation\nand evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 22:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

An advanced extraction method\napplied directly to the multifrequency Planck time-ordered data, rather than\nthe mission sky maps, was developed to allow an assessment of the variability\nof polarized sources. Our analysis of the time-ordered data from the Planck\nmission, tod2flux, allowed us to catalog the time-varying emission and\npolarization properties for these sources at the full range of polarized\nfrequencies employed by Planck, 30 to 353 GHz. PCCS-PV provides the time- and\nfrequency-dependent, polarized flux densities for all 153 sources.

Class incremental learning methods aim to address this problem by\nkeeping a memory of a few exemplars from previously learned tasks, and\ndistilling knowledge from them. However, existing methods struggle to balance\nthe performance across classes since they typically overfit the model to the\nlatest task. In our work, we propose to address these challenges with the\nintroduction of a novel methodology of Tangent Kernel for Incremental Learning\n(TKIL) that achieves class-balanced performance. The approach preserves the\nrepresentations across classes and balances the accuracy for each class, and as\nsuch achieves better overall accuracy and variance. TKIL approach is based on\nNeural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which describes the convergence behavior of neural\nnetworks as a kernel function in the limit of infinite width. In TKIL, the\ngradients between feature layers are treated as the distance between the\nrepresentations of these layers and can be defined as Gradients Tangent Kernel\nloss (GTK loss) such that it is minimized along with averaging weights. This\nallows TKIL to automatically identify the task and to quickly adapt to it\nduring inference. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets with various\nincremental learning settings show that these strategies allow TKIL to\noutperform existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

In addition, we conjecture that high spatial and temporal\nsimilarities between tasks increase the prediction difficulty. We define this\nproblem as sparse condition. To solve this, a factorization approach is\nintroduced to allow the model to obtain distinct representations from latent\nspace. To this end, we propose two feature extractors: A class-common module is\ntrained through adversarial learning acting as a generator; Class-specific\nmodule utilizes loss function generated from classification so that features\nare extracted with traditional methods. To minimize the latent space shared by\nthe class-common and class-specific features, the model is trained under\northogonal constraint.

While domain adaptation methods can\nmitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target\ndomain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge,\nmethods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and\nbe capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training.\nRelative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and\nfrequency-based representations of the same example are located close together\nin the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency\nconsistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close\nto its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training.

By\ninjecting a backdoor in the training phase, the adversary could control model\npredictions via predefined triggers. As various attack and defense models have\nbeen proposed, it is of great significance to perform rigorous evaluations.\nHowever, we highlight two issues in previous backdoor learning evaluations: (1)\nThe differences between real-world scenarios (e.g. releasing poisoned datasets\nor models) are neglected, and we argue that each scenario has its own\nconstraints and concerns, thus requires specific evaluation protocols; (2) The\nevaluation metrics only consider whether the attacks could flip the models'\npredictions on poisoned samples and retain performances on benign samples, but\nignore that poisoned samples should also be stealthy and semantic-preserving.\nTo address these issues, we categorize existing works into three practical\nscenarios in which attackers release datasets, pre-trained models, and\nfine-tuned models respectively, then discuss their unique evaluation\nmethodologies. On metrics, to completely evaluate poisoned samples, we use\ngrammar error increase and perplexity difference for stealthiness, along with\ntext similarity for validity.

In\nthis paper, we revisit the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm, which is\nwidely cited as a score-based algorithm for learning the MEC of the underlying\ncausal structure. We observe that in order to make the GES algorithm consistent\nin a nonparametric setting, it is not necessary to design a scoring metric that\nevaluates graphs. Instead, it suffices to plug in a consistent estimator of a\nmeasure of conditional dependence to guide the search. We therefore present a\nreframing of the GES algorithm, which is more flexible than the standard\nscore-based version and readily lends itself to the nonparametric setting with\na general measure of conditional dependence. In addition, we propose a neural\nconditional dependence (NCD) measure, which utilizes the expressive power of\ndeep neural networks to characterize conditional independence in a\nnonparametric manner. We establish the optimality of the reframed GES algorithm\nunder standard assumptions and the consistency of using our NCD estimator to\ndecide conditional independence. Together these results justify the proposed\napproach.

Secondly, our framework is that it is tailored for\nthe features inherent to reserving data. These include, for instance, accident,\ndevelopment, calendar, and claim maturity effects. Crucially, the relative\nimportance and scarcity of data across accident periods renders the problem\ndistinct from the traditional ensembling techniques in statistical learning.\n  Our framework is illustrated with a complex synthetic dataset. In the\nresults, the optimised ensemble outperforms both (i) traditional model\nselection strategies, and (ii) an equally weighted ensemble. In particular, the\nimprovement occurs not only with central estimates but also relevant quantiles,\nsuch as the 75th percentile of reserves (typically of interest to both insurers\nand regulators).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 04:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

But this reliance can be abused -- strategic\nmachines might craft representations that manipulate their users. How can a\nuser make good choices based on strategic representations? We formalize this as\na learning problem, and pursue algorithms for decision-making that are robust\nto manipulation. In our main setting of interest, the system represents\nattributes of an item to the user, who then decides whether or not to consume.\nWe model this interaction through the lens of strategic classification (Hardt\net al. 2016), reversed: the user, who learns, plays first; and the system,\nwhich responds, plays second. The system must respond with representations that\nreveal `nothing but the truth' but need not reveal the entire truth. Thus, the\nuser faces the problem of learning set functions under strategic subset\nselection, which presents distinct algorithmic and statistical challenges. Our\nmain result is a learning algorithm that minimizes error despite strategic\nrepresentations, and our theoretical analysis sheds light on the trade-off\nbetween learning effort and susceptibility to manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 04:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Recent work\nthat can generate textures in 3D requires 3D component segmentation that is\nexpensive to acquire. In this work, we present a novel conditional generative\narchitecture that we call a graph generative adversarial network (GGAN) that\ncan generate textures in 3D by learning object component information in an\nunsupervised way. In this framework, we do not need an expensive forward pass\nwhenever the camera viewpoint or lighting changes, and we do not need expensive\n3D part information for training, yet the model can generalize to unseen 3D\nmeshes and generate appropriate novel 3D textures. We compare this approach\nagainst state-of-the-art texture generation methods and demonstrate that the\nGGAN obtains significantly better texture generation quality (according to\nFrechet inception distance).

In\nthis work, we propose a new evaluation metric, called `rarity score', to\nmeasure the individual rarity of each image synthesized by generative models.\nWe first show empirical observation that common samples are close to each other\nand rare samples are far from each other in nearest-neighbor distances of\nfeature space. We then use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which\ndifferent generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. We\nalso propose a method to compare rarities between datasets that share the same\nconcept such as CelebA-HQ and FFHQ.

However, shortcut learning in the widely\nused Vision Transformer framework is largely unknown. Meanwhile, introducing\ndomain-specific knowledge is a major approach to rectifying the shortcuts,\nwhich are predominated by background related factors. For example, in the\nmedical imaging field, eye-gaze data from radiologists is an effective human\nvisual prior knowledge that has the great potential to guide the deep learning\nmodels to focus on meaningful foreground regions of interest. However,\nobtaining eye-gaze data is time-consuming, labor-intensive and sometimes even\nnot practical. In this work, we propose a novel and effective saliency-guided\nvision transformer (SGT) model to rectify shortcut learning in ViT with the\nabsence of eye-gaze data. Specifically, a computational visual saliency model\nis adopted to predict saliency maps for input image samples. Then, the saliency\nmaps are used to distil the most informative image patches. In the proposed\nSGT, the self-attention among image patches focus only on the distilled\ninformative ones. Considering this distill operation may lead to global\ninformation lost, we further introduce, in the last encoder layer, a residual\nconnection that captures the self-attention across all the image patches. The\nexperiment results on four independent public datasets show that our SGT\nframework can effectively learn and leverage human prior knowledge without eye\ngaze data and achieves much better performance than baselines.

On the other hand, since the prediction-based ones learn to\npredict a future frame given several previous frames, they are less sensitive\nto the generalizing issue. However, it is still uncertain if the model can\nlearn the spatio-temporal context of a video. Our intuition is that the\nunderstanding of the spatio-temporal context of a video plays a vital role in\nVAD as it provides precise information on how the appearance of an event in a\nvideo clip changes. Hence, to fully exploit the context information for anomaly\ndetection in video circumstances, we designed the transformer model with three\ndifferent contextual prediction streams: masked, whole and partial. By learning\nto predict the missing frames of consecutive normal frames, our model can\neffectively learn various normality patterns in the video, which leads to a\nhigh reconstruction error at the abnormal cases that are unsuitable to the\nlearned context. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we assess our\nmodel on the public benchmark datasets: USCD Pedestrian 2, CUHK Avenue and\nShanghaiTech and evaluate the performance with the anomaly score metric of\nreconstruction error. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach\nachieves a competitive performance compared to the existing video anomaly\ndetection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 05:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Also, the previous models generate unrealistic images when\nthere is a non-trivial amount of regions in the source image occluded by its\noriginal hair.

We design an algorithm that\nutilises the structure of decision diagrams to prepare their associated quantum\nstates. Our algorithm has a circuit complexity that is linear in the number of\npaths in the decision diagram. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm\nreduces the circuit complexity by up to 31.85% compared to the state-of-the-art\nalgorithm, when preparing generic $n$-qubit states with different degrees of\nnon-zero amplitudes. Additionally, for states with sparse decision diagrams,\nincluding the initial state of the quantum Byzantine agreement protocol, our\nalgorithm reduces the number of CNOTs by 86.61% $\\sim$ 99.9%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 08:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-02"}

To investigate\nthis, we build and release the Aced corpus with three TEC datasets. We show\nthat human errors in TEC exhibit a more diverse range of errors and far fewer\ntranslation fluency errors than the MT errors in automatic post-editing\ndatasets, suggesting the need for dedicated TEC models that are specialized to\ncorrect human errors. We show that pre-training instead on synthetic errors\nbased on human errors improves TEC F-score by as much as 5.1 points.

Information recently published\nfrom EHT about the Sgr A*'s shadow lets us have a novel possibility of\nexploration of Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) within the Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) framework. Despite the agreement between the shadow image of\nSgr A* and the prediction of the general theory of relativity, there is still a\nslight difference which is expected to be fixed by taking some fundamental\ncorrections into account. We bring up the idea that the recent inferred shadow\nimage of Sgr A* is explicable by a minimal SME-inspired Schwarzschild metric\ncontaining the Lorentz violating (LV) terms obtained from the post-Newtonian\napproximation. The LV terms embedded in Schwarzschild metric are dimensionless\nspatial coefficients ${\\bar s}^{jk}$ associated with the field responsible for\nLSV in the gravitational sector of the minimal SME theory. In this way, one can\ncontrol Lorentz invariance violation in the allowed sensitivity level of the\nfirst shadow image of Sgr A*. Actually, using the bounds released within\n$1\\sigma$ uncertainty for the shadow size of Sgr A* and whose fractional\ndeviation from standard Schwarzschild, we set upper limits for the two\ndifferent combinations of spatial diagonal coefficients and the time-time\ncoefficient of the SME, as well. The best upper bound is at the $10^{-2}$\nlevel, which should be interpreted differently from those constraints\npreviously extracted from well-known frameworks since unlike standard SME\nstudies it is not obtained from a Sun-centered celestial frame but comes from\nprobing the black hole horizon scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 10:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2022 17:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

However, with\nthe development of user interface (UI) design, the layout of displayed items on\na result page tends to be multi-block (i.e., multi-list) style instead of a\nsingle list, which requires different assumptions to model user behaviors more\naccurately. There exist click models for multi-block pages in desktop contexts,\nbut they cannot be directly applied to mobile scenarios due to different\ninteraction manners, result types and especially multi-block presentation\nstyles. In particular, multi-block mobile pages can normally be decomposed into\ninterleavings of basic vertical blocks and horizontal blocks, thus resulting in\ntypically F-shape forms. To mitigate gaps between desktop and mobile contexts\nfor multi-block pages, we conduct a user eye-tracking study, and identify\nusers' sequential browsing, block skip and comparison patterns on F-shape\npages. These findings lead to the design of a novel F-shape Click Model (FSCM),\nwhich serves as a general solution to multi-block mobile pages. Firstly, we\nconstruct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for each page, where each item is\nregarded as a vertex and each edge indicates the user's possible examination\nflow.

A staggered Cartesian grid is adopted in 3D, where the vector\nfield is naturally defined at the corners of the control volume, while its curl\nis evaluated as a cell-centered quantity. Firstly, the curl operator is\nrewritten as the divergence of a tensor, hence allowing compatible finite\ndifference schemes to be devised and to be proven to mimic the algebraic\ndiv-curl property. Successively, a high order DG divergence operator is built\nupon integration by parts, so that the structure-preserving finite difference\ndiv-curl operator is exactly retrieved for first order discretizations. We\nfurther demonstrate that the novel SPDG schemes are capable of obtaining a zero\ndiv-curl identity with machine precision from second up to sixth order\naccuracy. In a second part, we show the applicability of these SPDG methods by\nsolving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in vortex-stream\nformulation.

To obtain the time evolution, we rigorously derive the\ncircuit Hamiltonian of the qubit, readout resonator and resistor by describing\nthe latter as an infinite collection of bosonic modes through the\nCaldeira-Leggett model. Starting from this Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with\ninductive coupling to the remote bath comprised of the resistor, we\nconsistently obtain the Lindblad master equation for the qubit and resonator in\nthe dispersive regime. We exploit the underlying symmetries of the master\nequation to transform the Liouvillian superoperator into a block diagonal\nmatrix. The block diagonalization method reveals that the rate of exponential\ndecoherence of the qubit is well-captured by the slowest decaying eigenmode of\na single block of the Liouvillian superoperator, which can be easily computed.\nThe model captures the often used dispersive strong limit approximation of the\nqubit decoherence rate being linearly proportional to the number of thermal\nphotons in the readout resonator but predicts remarkably better decoherence\nrates when the dissipation rate of the resonator is increased beyond the\ndispersive strong regime.

Most of the existing works of adversarial image generation try\nto achieve attacks for most models, while few of them make efforts on\nguaranteeing the perceptual quality of the adversarial examples. High quality\nadversarial examples matter for many applications, especially for the privacy\npreserving. In this work, we develop a framework based on the Minimum\nNoticeable Difference (MND) concept to generate adversarial privacy preserving\nimages that have minimum perceptual difference from the clean ones but are able\nto attack deep learning models. To achieve this, an adversarial loss is firstly\nproposed to make the deep learning models attacked by the adversarial images\nsuccessfully. Then, a perceptual quality-preserving loss is developed by taking\nthe magnitude of perturbation and perturbation-caused structural and gradient\nchanges into account, which aims to preserve high perceptual quality for\nadversarial image generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork on exploring quality-preserving adversarial image generation based on the\nMND concept for privacy preserving. To evaluate its performance in terms of\nperceptual quality, the deep models on image classification and face\nrecognition are tested with the proposed method and several anchor methods in\nthis work. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MND\nframework is capable of generating adversarial images with remarkably improved\nperformance metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, and MOS) than that generated with the\nanchor methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 09:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Guided by the\nintuition that all mistakes are not equal, we present Comprehensive Hierarchy\nAware Multi-label Predictions (CHAMP), a framework that penalizes a\nmisprediction depending on its severity as per the hierarchy tree. While there\nhave been works that apply such an idea to single-label classification, to the\nbest of our knowledge, there are limited such works for multilabel\nclassification focusing on the severity of mistakes. The key reason is that\nthere is no clear way of quantifying the severity of a misprediction a priori\nin the multilabel setting. In this work, we propose a simple but effective\nmetric to quantify the severity of a mistake in HMC, naturally leading to\nCHAMP. Extensive experiments on six public HMC datasets across modalities\n(image, audio, and text) demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical\ninformation leads to substantial gains as CHAMP improves both AUPRC (2.6%\nmedian percentage improvement) and hierarchical metrics (2.85% median\npercentage improvement), over stand-alone hierarchical or multilabel\nclassification methods. Compared to standard multilabel baselines, CHAMP\nprovides improved AUPRC in both robustness (8.87% mean percentage improvement )\nand less data regimes. Further, our method provides a framework to enhance\nexisting multilabel classification algorithms with better mistakes (18.1% mean\npercentage increment).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 09:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Undeniably, they cannot learn the direct interactions of\nthese features, which limits the model's expressive power. To this end, we\nfirst present MixFM, inspired by Mixup, to generate auxiliary training data to\nboost FMs. Unlike existing augmentation strategies that require labor costs and\nexpertise to collect additional information such as position and fields, these\nextra data generated by MixFM only by the convex combination of the raw ones\nwithout any professional knowledge support.

Guided by the\ncustomized saliency, SMFM can generate more informative neighbor data.

In\nthis paper, we scrutinise the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and clustering\nproperties of ELGs by utilising IllustrisTNG galaxy formation hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Leveraging stellar population synthesis technique coupled with the\nphoto-ionization model, we compute line intensities of simulated galaxies and\nconstruct mock H$\\alpha$ and [OII] ELG catalogues. The line luminosity\nfunctions and the relation between the star formation rate and line intensity\nare well consistent with observational estimates. Next, we measure the HOD and\ndemonstrate that there is a distinct population for the central HOD, which\ncorresponds to low-mass infalling halos. We then perform the statistical\ninference of HOD parameters from the projected correlation function. Our\nanalysis indicates that the inferred HODs significantly deviate from the HOD\nmeasured directly from simulations although the best-fit model yields a good\nfit to the projected correlation function. It implies that the information\ncontent of the projected correlation function is not adequate to constrain HOD\nmodels correctly and thus, it is important to employ mock ELG catalogues to\ncalibrate the functional form of HOD models and add prior information on HOD\nparameters to robustly determine the HOD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 10:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 08:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 13:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

We find that in the type-I phase, the nonlinear Hall\nresponse is not particularly sensitive to the presence of Fermi arcs or other\ntrivial surface states.

However, our work surprisingly discovers that\nnetwork pruning sometimes even aggravates overfitting. We report an unexpected\nsparse double descent phenomenon that, as we increase model sparsity via\nnetwork pruning, test performance first gets worse (due to overfitting), then\ngets better (due to relieved overfitting), and gets worse at last (due to\nforgetting useful information). While recent studies focused on the deep double\ndescent with respect to model overparameterization, they failed to recognize\nthat sparsity may also cause double descent.

Our results show that the PPO type of on-policy algorithms can\nmaster simple manipulation tasks that are equivalent up to 48-month human\nbabies (e.g., catching a flying object, opening a bottle), while multi-agent RL\ncan further help to master manipulations that require skilled bimanual\ncooperation (e.g., lifting a pot, stacking blocks). Despite the success on each\nsingle task, when it comes to acquiring multiple manipulation skills, existing\nRL algorithms fail to work in most of the multi-task and the few-shot learning\nsettings, which calls for more substantial development from the RL community.\nOur project is open sourced at https://github.com/PKU-MARL/DexterousHands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 11:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 09:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

However, finding such\nvalues in large networks with thousands of parameters can become\ncomputationally very expensive.

However, existing hybrid beamforming designs mainly rely on\nreal-time channel training or beam sweeping to find the desired beams, which\nincurs prohibitive overhead due to a large number of antennas at both the\ntransmitter and receiver with only limited radio frequency (RF) chains. To\nresolve this challenging issue, in this paper, we propose a new\nenvironment-aware hybrid beamforming technique that requires only light\nreal-time training, by leveraging the useful tool of channel knowledge map\n(CKM) with the user's location information. CKM is a site-specific database,\nwhich offers location-specific channel-relevant information to facilitate or\neven obviate the acquisition of real-time channel state information (CSI). Two\nspecific types of CKM are proposed in this paper for hybrid beamforming design\nin mmWave massive MIMO systems, namely channel angle map (CAM) and beam index\nmap (BIM). It is shown that compared with existing environment-unaware schemes,\nthe proposed environment-aware hybrid beamforming scheme based on CKM can\ndrastically improve the effective communication rate, even under moderate user\nlocation errors, thanks to its great saving of the prohibitive real-time\ntraining overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 11:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

In addition, we identify three challenging\n(sub)tasks in the assumed task-oriented dialog system: (1) User Question\nUnderstanding, (2) Agent Action Frame Prediction, and (3) Agent Response\nGeneration. For each of these tasks, we develop a neural baseline model, which\nwe evaluate on the CookDial dataset. We publicly release the CookDial dataset,\ncomprising rich annotations of both dialogs and recipe documents, to stimulate\nfurther research on domain-specific document-grounded dialog systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 12:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

A promising approach\nto detecting semantic clones is contrastive learning (CL), a machine learning\nparadigm popular in computer vision but not yet commonly adopted for code\nprocessing.\n  Our work aims to evaluate the most popular CL algorithms combined with three\nsource code representations on two tasks. The first task is code clone\ndetection, which we evaluate on the POJ-104 dataset containing implementations\nof 104 algorithms. The second task is plagiarism detection. To evaluate the\nmodels on this task, we introduce CodeTransformator, a tool for transforming\nsource code.

Traditional\nmethods for model selection such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC) and minimum description length are heavily prone to\noverfitting in the high-dimensional setting. In this regard, extended BIC\n(EBIC), which is an extended version of the original BIC and extended Fisher\ninformation criterion (EFIC), which is a combination of EBIC and Fisher\ninformation criterion, are consistent estimators of the true model as the\nnumber of measurements grows very large.

However, so far\nthese results have only been limited to certain classes of games with\nstructured strategy spaces -- such as normal-form and extensive-form games. The\nquestion as to whether $O(\\text{polylog} T)$ regret bounds can be obtained for\ngeneral convex and compact strategy sets -- which occur in many fundamental\nmodels in economics and multiagent systems -- while retaining efficient\nstrategy updates is an important question. In this paper, we answer this in the\npositive by establishing the first uncoupled learning algorithm with $O(\\log\nT)$ per-player regret in general \\emph{convex games}, that is, games with\nconcave utility functions supported on arbitrary convex and compact strategy\nsets. Our learning dynamics are based on an instantiation of optimistic\nfollow-the-regularized-leader over an appropriately \\emph{lifted} space using a\n\\emph{self-concordant regularizer} that is, peculiarly, not a barrier for the\nfeasible region.

To cope with this problem, we assume that despite data\nheterogeneity, there are groups of clients who have similar data distributions\nthat can be clustered. In previous approaches, in order to cluster clients the\nserver requires clients to send their parameters simultaneously. However, this\ncan be problematic in a context where there is a significant number of\nparticipants that may have limited availability. To prevent such a bottleneck,\nwe propose FLIC (Federated Learning with Incremental Clustering), in which the\nserver exploits the updates sent by clients during federated training instead\nof asking them to send their parameters simultaneously.

In the context of online prediction\nwhere the min-max solution is the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML), it has\nbeen suggested to use NML with ``luckiness'': A prior-like function is applied\nto the hypothesis class, which reduces its effective size.

The monopole and\nquadrupole of the real-space correlation function is strongly boosted on small\nscales below 1 Mpc/h, due to some galaxies being duplicated at the boundaries\nbetween snapshots in the lightcone.

The effect of this in redshift space is small, as long as\nthe snapshots are cut into shells in real space. Randomly removing duplicated\ngalaxies is able to reduce the excess clustering signal.

In this paper, we propose a novel CAM weighting scheme, named\nFD-CAM, to improve both the faithfulness and discriminability of the CAM-based\nCNN visual explanation. First, we improve the faithfulness and discriminability\nof the score-based weights by performing a grouped channel switching operation.\nSpecifically, for each channel, we compute its similarity group and switch the\ngroup of channels on or off simultaneously to compute changes in the class\nprediction score as the weights.

We perform extensive\ncomparisons with the state-of-the-art CAM algorithms. The quantitative and\nqualitative results show our FD-CAM can produce more faithful and more\ndiscriminative visual explanations of the CNNs.

We also include the Type-II migration of giant planets during the\ndisk phase with suitable eccentricity and inclination damping as well as the\ndisk gravitational potential acting on the planets and the nodal precession of\nthe disk induced by the binary companion. We consider various inclinations,\neccentricities, and separations of the binary companion. Disk migration allows\nthe formation of planet pairs in mean-motion resonances (MMR) despite the\npresence of the binary companion.

Provided the planet-planet interaction timescale is smaller than the\nbinary perturbations timescale, these systems can remain in resonance long\nafter the disk has dissipated. When the binary separation is smaller (250au),\nonly planets in the 2:1 resonance tend to remain in a resonant state and more\nchaotic evolutions are observed, as well as more ejections. After those\nejections, the remaining planet can become eccentric due to the perturbations\nfrom the binary companion and for strongly inclined binary companions captures\nin the von Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai resonance can occur, while in systems with two\nplanets this mechanism is quenched by planet-planet interactions.

Therefore, a joint neural network that combines multiple cues is\nproposed and named as the holistic transformer to predict trajectories and make\nbehavioral decisions simultaneously. To better explore the intrinsic\nrelationships between cues, the network uses existing knowledge and adopts\nthree kinds of attention mechanisms: the sparse multi-head type for reducing\nnoise impact, feature selection sparse type for optimally using partial prior\nknowledge, and multi-head with sigmoid activation type for optimally using\nposteriori knowledge. Compared with other trajectory prediction models, the\nproposed model has better comprehensive performance and good interpretability.\nPerceptual noise robustness experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has\ngood noise robustness. Thus, simultaneous trajectory prediction and behavioral\ndecision-making combining multiple cues can reduce computational costs and\nenhance semantic relationships between scenes and agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 14:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

They are commonly trained by scientific survey\ndata but, since surveys are expensive, there is a need for complementary\nsources of information to train them. To this end, several authors have\nproposed to use expert elicitation since local citizen and substance area\nexperts can hold valuable information on species distributions. Expert\nknowledge has been incorporated within SDMs, for example, through informative\npriors. However, existing approaches pose challenges related to assessment of\nthe reliability of the experts. Since expert knowledge is inherently subjective\nand prone to biases, we should optimally calibrate experts' assessments and\nmake inference on their reliability. Moreover, demonstrated examples of\nimproved species distribution predictions using expert elicitation compared to\nusing only survey data are few as well. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach to use expert knowledge on species distribution within SDMs and\ndemonstrate that it leads to significantly better predictions. First, we\npropose expert elicitation process where experts summarize their belief on a\nspecies occurrence proability with maps. Second, we collect survey data to\ncalibrate the expert assessments.

In this paper, 4-50 nm thick GaP epitaxial films were grown on\nAs-terminated Si(100) substrates with different types of doping, miscuts, and\nAs-surface termination by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. The GaP(As)/Si(100)\nheterostructures were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\ncombined with gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) sputtering and by hard X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). We found residuals of arsenic atoms in the\nGaP lattice (0.2-0.3 at.%) and a localization of As atoms at the\nGaP(As)/Si(100) interface (1 at.%). Deconvolution of core level peaks revealed\ninterface core level shifts. In As core levels, chemical shifts between 0.5-0.8\neV were measured and identified by angle-resolved XPS measurements. Similar\nvalence band offset (VBO) values of 0.6 eV were obtained, regardless of the\ndoping type of Si substrate, Si substrate miscut or type of As-terminated Si\nsubstrate surface. The band alignment diagram of the heterostructure was\ndeduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 14:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

Despite many attempts at language grounding, it is still unclear\nhow to effectively inject visual knowledge into the word embeddings of a\nlanguage in such a way that a proper balance of textual and visual knowledge is\nmaintained. Some common concerns are the following. Is visual grounding\nbeneficial for abstract words or is its contribution only limited to concrete\nwords? What is the optimal way of bridging the gap between text and vision? How\nmuch do we gain by visually grounding textual embeddings? The present study\naddresses these questions by proposing a simple yet very effective grounding\napproach for pre-trained word embeddings. Our model aligns textual embeddings\nwith vision while largely preserving the distributional statistics that\ncharacterize word use in text corpora. By applying a learned alignment, we are\nable to generate visually grounded embeddings for unseen words, including\nabstract words. A series of evaluations on word similarity benchmarks shows\nthat visual grounding is beneficial not only for concrete words, but also for\nabstract words. We also show that our method for visual grounding offers\nadvantages for contextualized embeddings, but only when these are trained on\ncorpora of relatively modest size.

In addition, FedNew hides the gradient information\nand results in a privacy-preserving approach compared to the existing\nstate-of-the-art.

Though only one ADMM\npass is used to approximate the inverse Hessian-gradient product at each\niteration, we develop a novel theoretical approach to show the converging\nbehavior of FedNew for convex problems.

FF control\nsuccessfully converges to the desired trajectory, and PINN executes good\ncontrols with higher stochasticity observed for higher-order terms based on the\nphase portraits.

Moreover, the\nlong-tail distribution poses great challenges in deep learning classification\nproblems including clinical disease prediction. There are approaches proposed\nrecently to calibrate deep prediction in computer vision, but there are no\nstudies found to demonstrate how the representative models work in different\nchallenging contexts. In this paper, we bridge the confidence calibration from\ncomputer vision to medical imaging with a comparative study of four high-impact\ncalibration models. Our studies are conducted in different contexts (natural\nimage classification and lung cancer risk estimation) including in balanced vs.\nimbalanced training sets and in computer vision vs. medical imaging. Our\nresults support key findings: (1) We achieve new conclusions which are not\nstudied under different learning contexts, e.g., combining two calibration\nmodels that both mitigate the overconfident prediction can lead to\nunder-confident prediction, and simpler calibration models from the computer\nvision domain tend to be more generalizable to medical imaging. (2) We\nhighlight the gap between general computer vision tasks and medical imaging\nprediction, e.g., calibration methods ideal for general computer vision tasks\nmay in fact damage the calibration of medical imaging prediction. (3) We also\nreinforce previous conclusions in natural image classification settings. We\nbelieve that this study has merits to guide readers to choose calibration\nmodels and understand gaps between general computer vision and medical imaging\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 15:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

Since plasmons correspond to collective electron\nexcitations, the electron-electron interaction plays an essential role in their\ntheoretical description. Within the Random Phase Approximation, this\ninteraction is incorporated through a system of equations of motion, which has\nto be solved self-consistently. For homogeneous media, an analytical solution\ncan be found using the Fourier transform, giving rise to Lindhard theory. When\nthe medium is spatially inhomogeneous, this is no longer possible and one often\nuses numerical approaches, which are however limited to smaller systems. In\nthis paper, we present a novel semi-analytical approach for bulk plasmons in\ninhomogeneous media based on the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation, which is\napplicable when the charge density varies smoothly. By solving the equations of\nmotion self-consistently, we obtain the expressions of Lindhard theory with a\nspatially varying Fermi wavevector. The derivation involves passing from the\noperators to their symbols, which can be thought of as classical observables on\nphase space. In this way we obtain effective (Hamiltonian) equations of motion\nfor plasmons. We then find the quantized energy levels and the plasmon spectrum\nusing Einstein-Brilllouin-Keller quantization.

Many researchers and developers\nconsider that these constructs lead to programs that are more concise,\nreusable, and easier to understand. However, few studies investigate the\nimplications of using them in mainstream programming languages. This paper\nquantifies the prevalence of four concepts typically associated with functional\nprogramming in JavaScript: recursion, immutability, lazy evaluation, and\nfunctions as values. We focus on JavaScript programs due to the availability of\nsome of these concepts in the language since its inception, its inspiration\nfrom functional programming languages, and its popularity. We mine 91 GitHub\nrepositories (22+ million LOC) written mostly in JavaScript (over 50% of the\ncode), measuring the usage of these concepts from both static and temporal\nperspectives. We also measure the likelihood of bug-fixing commits removing\nuses of these concepts (which would hint at bug-proneness) and their\nassociation with the presence of code comments (which would hint at code that\nis hard to understand). We find that these concepts are in widespread use (1\nfor every 46.65 LOC, 43.59% of LOC). In addition, the usage of higher-order\nfunctions, immutability, and lazy evaluation-related structures has been\ngrowing throughout the years for the analyzed projects, while the usage of\nrecursion and callbacks & promises has decreased. We also find statistical\nevidence that removing these structures, with the exception of the ones\nassociated to immutability, is less common in bug-fixing commits than in other\ncommits. In addition, their presence is not correlated with comment size. Our\nfindings suggest that functional programming concepts are important for\ndevelopers using a multi-paradigm language, and their usage does not make\nprograms harder to understand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 15:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

For this purpose, a system of fermions on a lattice\nis considered and one applies the scheme to replace the fermionic variables\nwith spin matrices, while the transformation relates only those fermionic/spin\noperators which are assigned to nearby lattice sites. In one dimension, this\nproposal yields the same result as the well-known Jordan-Wigner transformation,\nwhile not being restricted to $d=1$ dimension. To obtain the equivalent\ndescription in the spin picture, one needs to impose constraints on the spin\nspace. Since finding the reduced spin Hilbert space constitutes a substantial\nstage of the whole procedure, the constraints are paid particular attention.\nThe full set of necessary constraints is determined in both representations. To\napproach the task to solve the constraints, a suitable basis is constructed.\nThe introduction of the basis in the spin representation along with the\nconstruction of the constraints and the Hamiltonian in this basis show how the\ntransformation proposed in this work can be applied to obtain observables in\nthe spin picture. Explicit construction of the constraints in the basis allows\none to solve them and, once the basis vectors of the reduced spin Hilbert space\nare found, the spin Hamiltonian is expressed in this basis and diagonalized.\nThe constraints are constructed in the basis as discussed above and analyzed\nwith the Wolfram Mathematica programs for lattice sizes $3\\times3$, $4\\times3$\nand $4\\times4$.

On this\npicture, intelligent agency is an extremely powerful force, and creating agents\nmuch more intelligent than us is playing with fire -- especially given that if\ntheir objectives are problematic, such agents would plausibly have instrumental\nincentives to seek power over humans. Second, I formulate and evaluate a more\nspecific six-premise argument that creating agents of this kind will lead to\nexistential catastrophe by 2070. On this argument, by 2070: (1) it will become\npossible and financially feasible to build relevantly powerful and agentic AI\nsystems; (2) there will be strong incentives to do so; (3) it will be much\nharder to build aligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems than to\nbuild misaligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems that are still\nsuperficially attractive to deploy; (4) some such misaligned systems will seek\npower over humans in high-impact ways; (5) this problem will scale to the full\ndisempowerment of humanity; and (6) such disempowerment will constitute an\nexistential catastrophe. I assign rough subjective credences to the premises in\nthis argument, and I end up with an overall estimate of ~5% that an existential\ncatastrophe of this kind will occur by 2070. (May 2022 update: since making\nthis report public in April 2021, my estimate here has gone up, and is now at\n>10%.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 17:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

By harvesting advanced deep learning techniques, the present work\nintroduces a new framework, hydrodynamic interaction graph neural network\n(HIGNN), for inferring and predicting the particles' dynamics in Stokes\nsuspensions. It overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches in\ncomputational efficiency, accuracy, and/or transferability. In particular, by\nuniting the data structure represented by a graph and the neural networks with\nlearnable parameters, the HIGNN constructs surrogate modeling for the mobility\ntensor of particles which is the key to predicting the dynamics of particles\nsubject to HI and external forces. To account for the many-body nature of HI,\nwe generalize the state-of-the-art GNN by introducing higher-order connectivity\ninto the graph and the corresponding convolutional operation. For training the\nHIGNN, we only need the data for a small number of particles in the domain of\ninterest, and hence the training cost can be maintained low. Once constructed,\nthe HIGNN permits fast predictions of the particles' velocities and is\ntransferable to suspensions of different numbers/concentrations of particles in\nthe same domain and to any external forcing. It has the ability to accurately\ncapture both the long-range HI and short-range lubrication effects. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of the proposed HIGNN\nframework in a variety of systems.

A classical method to\nquantify Ohmic and non-Ohmic resistive losses in solar cells is based on the\ncomparison between the voltage in the dark and under illumination analysed at\nequal recombination current density. Applied to perovskite solar cells, we\nobserve a combination of an Ohmic series resistance with a voltage-dependent\nresistance that is most prominent at short circuit and low forward bias. The\nlatter is most likely caused by the poor transport properties of the electron\nand/or hole transport layers. By measuring the photoluminescence of perovskite\nsolar cells as a function of applied voltage, we provide direct evidence for a\nhigh quasi-Fermi level splitting at low and moderate forward bias that\nsubstantially exceeds the externally applied voltage.

This represents a significant limitation for the\ndeployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the\nenergy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role.

Predicting how these interactions affect the spatial patterns and\nmagnitudes of bed deformation in meandering rivers is essential for various\nriver engineering and geoscience problems. Computational fluid dynamics\nsimulations can predict river morphodynamics at fine temporal and spatial\nscales but have traditionally been challenged by the large scale of natural\nrivers. We conducted coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and bed morphodynamics\nsimulations to create a unique database of hydro-morphodynamic datasets for 42\nmeandering rivers with a variety of planform shapes and large-scale geometrical\nfeatures that mimic natural meanders. For each simulated river, the database\nincludes (i) bed morphology, (ii) three-dimensional mean velocity field, and\n(iii) bed shear stress distribution under bankfull flow conditions. The\ncalculated morphodynamics results at dynamic equilibrium revealed the formation\nof scour and deposition patterns near the outer and inner banks, respectively,\nwhile the location of point bars and scour regions around the apexes of the\nmeander bends is found to vary as a function of the radius of curvature of the\nbends to the width ratio. A new mechanism is proposed that explains this\nseemingly paradoxical finding. The high-fidelity simulation results generated\nin this work provide researchers and scientists with a rich numerical database\nfor morphodynamics and bed shear stress distributions in large-scale meandering\nrivers to enable systematic investigation of the underlying phenomena and\nsupport a range of river engineering applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 19:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The properties of these polynomials are discussed in detail, and\nthen examples are provided to illustrate the diversity of their applications in\nmagnetic resonance. These examples include the use of the Chebyshev polynomial\noperators as an orthonormal basis to expand rotation operators, projection\noperators, and the Stratonovich-Weyl operator. The duality of the Chebyshev\npolynomials of a discrete real variable as Clebsch-Gordan coupling coefficients\nis noted and exploited, and it is shown that the Chebyshev polynomial operators\ncan be recoupled as a rank-zero composite tensor defined by the product of a\nspin and spatial tensor. These application examples demonstrate that the\nChebyshev polynomials of a discrete real variable are a unique nexus for spin\nphysics, special functions, angular momentum (re)coupling, and irreducible\nrepresentations of the rotation group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 19:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-29"}

In this paper, we study the homology groups of\nhigh-dimensional point cloud data (PCD) constructed from synthetic fBm data. We\ncovert the simulated fBm series to a PCD, a subset of unit $D$-dimensional\ncube, employing the time delay embedding method for a given embedding dimension\nand a time-delay parameter. In the context of persistent homology (PH), we\ncompute topological measures for embedded PCD as a function of associated Hurst\nexponent, $H$, for different embedding dimensions, time-delays and amount of\nirregularity existed in the dataset in various scales. Our results show that\nfor a regular synthetic fBm, the higher value of the embedding dimension leads\nto increasing the $H$-dependency of topological measures based on zeroth and\nfirst homology groups. To achieve a reliable classification of fBm, we should\nconsider the small value of time-delay irrespective of the irregularity\npresented in the data. More interestingly, the value of scale for which the PCD\nto be path-connected and the post-loopless regime scale are more robust\nconcerning irregularity for distinguishing the fBm signal. Such robustness\nbecomes less for the higher value of embedding dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 16:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}
