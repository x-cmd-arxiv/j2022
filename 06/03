In this paper, we attempt\nto make a response to the inquiry. After a brief introduction of the\nfundamentals of Transformers, especially in comparison with convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), and highlighting key defining properties that\ncharacterize the Transformers, we offer a comprehensive review of the\nstate-of-the-art Transformer-based approaches for medical imaging and exhibit\ncurrent research progresses made in the areas of medical image segmentation,\nrecognition, detection, registration, reconstruction, enhancement, etc. In\nparticular, what distinguishes our review lies in its organization based on the\nTransformer's key defining properties, which are mostly derived from comparing\nthe Transformer and CNN, and its type of architecture, which specifies the\nmanner in which the Transformer and CNN are combined, all helping the readers\nto best understand the rationale behind the reviewed approaches.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\ndelivers a better performance-efficient trade-off than previous FGVC methods\nand advanced neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 17:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

Our goal is to investigate the multi-scale spatial\nstructure of gas clumps, to probe the existence of a hierarchical cascade and\nto evaluate its possible link with star production in terms of multiplicity.\nFrom the Herschel emission maps of NGC 2264, clumps are extracted using getsf\nsoftware at each of their associated spatial resolution, respectively [8.4,\n13.5, 18.2, 24.9, 36.3]\". Using the spatial distribution of these clumps and\nthe class 0/I Young Stellar Object (YSO) from Spitzer data, we develop a\ngraph-theoretic analysis to represent the multi-scale structure of the cloud as\na connected network. From this network, we derive three classes of multi-scale\nstructure in NGC 2264 depending on the number of nodes produced at the deepest\nlevel: hierarchical, linear and isolated. The structure class is strongly\ncorrelated with the column density $N_{\\rm H_2}$ since the hierarchical ones\ndominate the regions whose N$_{\\rm H_2} > 6 \\times 10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$. Although\nthe latter are in minority, they contain half of the class 0/I YSOs proving\nthat they are highly efficient in producing stars. We define a novel\nstatistical metric, the fractality coefficient F that measure the fractal index\ndescribing the scale-free process of the cascade. For NGC 2264, we estimate F =\n1.45$\\pm$0.12. However, a single fractal index fails to fully describe a\nscale-free process since the hierarchical cascade starts at a 13 kAU\ncharacteristic spatial scale. Our novel methodology allows us to correlate YSOs\nwith their multi-scale gaseous environment. This hierarchical cascade that\ndrives efficient star formation is suspected to be both hierarchical and rooted\nby the larger-scale gas environment up to 13 kAU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 17:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 08:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 09:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Therefore, the deployment of ViT for real-time applications is\nparticularly challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware such as\nmobile devices. Recent efforts try to reduce the computation complexity of ViT\nthrough network architecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet\nthe inference speed is still unsatisfactory.

To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and\noperators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs.

Our approach\nmakes use of a 'universal dressing space', which contains as a subset every\npossible dynamical frame. We describe examples of such frames, including matter\nframes, a popular construction based on boundary-anchored geodesics and one\nusing minimal surfaces -- but our formalism does not depend on the existence of\na boundary. The class of observables we construct generalises and unifies the\ndressed and relational approaches to constructing gravitational observables,\nincluding single-integral and canonical power-series constructions. All these\n(possibly gravitationally charged) relational observables describe physics in a\nprecise sense relative to the dynamical frame and respect a notion of\n'relational' locality based on the relationships between fields. By using\n'relational atlases', i.e. collections of dynamical frames glued together by\nfield-dependent maps (which are relational observables too), we can construct\nrelationally local observables throughout spacetime. This further establishes a\nframework for dynamical frame covariance that permits us to change between\narbitrary relational frame perspectives. Relational locality obeys many\ndesirable properties: we prove that it satisfies microcausality in the bulk (in\ntension with previous work done mainly in a perturbative setting which we\ncomment on), and show that it permits a relational version of local bulk\ndynamics. Relational locality is therefore arguably more physically meaningful\nthan the ordinary notion of locality. Thus, our formalism -- which we argue to\nbe an updated, gauge-invariant version of general covariance -- refutes the\ncommonly claimed non-existence of local gravitational bulk physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 17:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Two main-stream SSL frameworks have been\nproposed, i.e., Instance Discrimination (ID) and Masked Image Modeling (MIM).\nID pulls together representations from different views of the same image, while\navoiding feature collapse. It lacks spatial sensitivity, which requires\nmodeling the local structure within each image. On the other hand, MIM\nreconstructs the original content given a masked image. It instead does not\nhave good semantic alignment, which requires projecting semantically similar\nviews into nearby representations. To address this dilemma, we observe that (1)\nsemantic alignment can be achieved by matching different image views with\nstrong augmentations; (2) spatial sensitivity can benefit from predicting dense\nrepresentations with masked images. Driven by these analysis, we propose\nSiamese Image Modeling (SiameseIM), which predicts the dense representations of\nan augmented view, based on another masked view from the same image but with\ndifferent augmentations. SiameseIM uses a Siamese network with two branches.\nThe online branch encodes the first view, and predicts the second view's\nrepresentation according to the relative positions between these two views. The\ntarget branch produces the target by encoding the second view. SiameseIM can\nsurpass both ID and MIM on a wide range of downstream tasks, including ImageNet\nfinetuning and linear probing, COCO and LVIS detection, and ADE20k semantic\nsegmentation.

This framework then naturally provides a recipe for mapping a\nquantum theory defined in a non-relativistic background to a theory around a\ntimelike trajectory in curved spacetimes. This is done by reinterpreting the\nposition and momentum operators and by introducing a local redshift factor to\nthe Hamiltonian, which gives rise to new dynamics due to the curvature of\nspacetime and the acceleration of the trajectory. We then apply our formalism\nto particle detector models, that is, to the case where the non-relativistic\nquantum system is coupled to a quantum field in a curved background. This\nallows one to write a general definition for particle detector models which is\nable to recover the previous models in the literature.

As both sparse and dense queries are\nimperfect, then \\emph{what are expected queries in end-to-end object\ndetection}? This paper shows that the expected queries should be Dense Distinct\nQueries (DDQ). Concretely, we introduce dense priors back to the framework to\ngenerate dense queries. A duplicate query removal pre-process is applied to\nthese queries so that they are distinguishable from each other. The dense\ndistinct queries are then iteratively processed to obtain final sparse outputs.\nWe show that DDQ is stronger, more robust, and converges faster.

The model assumes that\n'A' is immiscible with 'C,' which leads to the selective dissolution of 'B'\nfrom the precursor. Spinodal driving forces and surface diffusion within the\nsolid-liquid interface cause 'A' to segregate, initiating the growth of\n'A'-rich solid ligaments and promoting the bicontinuous penetration of the\ndealloying agent 'C' into the precursor. We demonstrate that this dealloying\nprocess leads to coupled grain-boundary migration to maintain equilibrium\ncontact angles with this topologically-complex solid-liquid interface. This\nleads to dealloying being locally accelerated by dissolving 'B' from (and\nrejecting 'A' into) the grain boundary. The migrating grain boundary promotes\nformation of a locally deeper corrosion channel that asymmetrically disrupts\nthe ligament connectivity of the final dealloyed structure, in qualitative\nagreement with published experimental observations.

The key question is which\nsolution is more generalizable. Empirical studies showed a strong correlation\nbetween flatness of the loss landscape at a solution and its generalizability,\nand stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial in finding the flat solutions.\nTo understand how SGD drives the learning system to flat solutions, we\nconstruct a simple model whose loss landscape has a continuous set of\ndegenerate (or near degenerate) minima. By solving the Fokker-Planck equation\nof the underlying stochastic learning dynamics, we show that due to its strong\nanisotropy the SGD noise introduces an additional effective loss term that\ndecreases with flatness and has an overall strength that increases with the\nlearning rate and batch-to-batch variation. We find that the additional\nlandscape-dependent SGD-loss breaks the degeneracy and serves as an effective\nregularization for finding flat solutions. Furthermore, a stronger SGD noise\nshortens the convergence time to the flat solutions. However, we identify an\nupper bound for the SGD noise beyond which the system fails to converge. Our\nresults not only elucidate the role of SGD for generalization they may also\nhave important implications for hyperparameter selection for learning\nefficiently without divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 18:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

This fragmentation of goals causes not only an\ninconsistent conceptual understanding of explanations but also the practical\nchallenge of not knowing which method to use when.\n  In this work, we begin to address these challenges by unifying eight popular\npost hoc explanation methods (LIME, C-LIME, KernelSHAP, Occlusion, Vanilla\nGradients, Gradients x Input, SmoothGrad, and Integrated Gradients). We show\nthat these methods all perform local function approximation of the black-box\nmodel, differing only in the neighbourhood and loss function used to perform\nthe approximation. This unification enables us to (1) state a no free lunch\ntheorem for explanation methods, demonstrating that no method can perform\noptimally across all neighbourhoods, and (2) provide a guiding principle to\nchoose among methods based on faithfulness to the black-box model. We\nempirically validate these theoretical results using various real-world\ndatasets, model classes, and prediction tasks.\n  By bringing diverse explanation methods into a common framework, this work\n(1) advances the conceptual understanding of these methods, revealing their\nshared local function approximation objective, properties, and relation to one\nanother, and (2) guides the use of these methods in practice, providing a\nprincipled approach to choose among methods and paving the way for the creation\nof new ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 19:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 19:49:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 23:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

The origin of their magnetic field is\nstill a challenging question. In situ magnetic field amplification by dynamo\naction is a promising process to generate ultra-strong magnetic fields in\nfast-rotating progenitors. However, it is unclear whether the fraction of\nprogenitors harboring fast core rotation is sufficient to explain the entire\nmagnetar population. To address this point, we propose a new scenario for\nmagnetar formation, in which a slow-rotating proto-neutron star is spun up by\nthe supernova fallback. We argue that this can trigger the development of the\nTayler-Spruit dynamo while other dynamo processes are disfavored. Using\nprevious works done on this dynamo and simulations to characterize the\nfallback, we derive equations modelling the coupled evolution of the\nproto-neutron star rotation and magnetic field. Their time integration for\ndifferent fallback masses is successfully compared with analytical estimates of\nthe amplification timescales and saturation value of the magnetic field. We\nfind that the magnetic field is amplified within $20$ to $40$s after the core\nbounce, and that the radial magnetic field saturates at intensities\n$10^{14}-10^{15}$G, therefore spanning the full range of magnetar's dipolar\nmagnetic fields. We also compare predictions of two proposed saturation\nmechanisms showing that magnetar-like magnetic fields can be generated for\nneutron star spun up to rotation periods $\\lesssim8$ms and $\\lesssim28$ms,\ncorresponding to fallback masses $\\gtrsim4\\times10^{-2}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and\n$\\gtrsim10^{-2}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.

Extracting the allocation part from the qubit routing\nmodel of Nannicini et al. (arXiv:2106.06446), we formulate the allocation\nsubproblem as a binary program.

In this paper, we generalize the analysis\nof [8,18,35,52] to show that the blowup solutions of the 3D Euler and 2D\nBoussinesq equations with $C^{1,\\alpha}$ velocity are unstable under the notion\nof stability introduced in [35,52]. These two seemingly contradictory results\nreflect the difference of the two approaches in studying the stability of 3D\nEuler blowup solutions. The stability analysis of the blowup solution obtained\nin [8,18] is based on the stability of a dynamically rescaled blowup profile in\nspace and time, which is nonlinear in nature. The linear stability analysis in\n[35,52] is performed by directly linearizing the 3D Euler equations around a\nblowup solution in the original variables. It does not take into account the\nchanges in the blowup time, the dynamic changes of the rescaling rate of the\nperturbed blowup profile and the blowup exponent of the original 3D Euler\nequations using a perturbed initial condition when there is an approximate\nself-similar blowup profile. Such information has been used in an essential way\nin establishing the nonlinear stability of the blowup profile in [8,18,19].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 20:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

This dissertation builds\non top of the two statements above, resulting in an exploration of the role of\ntemporal asymmetry in music (generalizing \"music flows\") and its relation to\nthe idea of organicism (generalizing \"music is life-like\"). We focus on two\naspects of temporal asymmetry. The first aspect concerns the vastly different\nepistemic mechanisms with which we obtain knowledge of the past and the future.\nA particular musical consequence follows: recurrence. The epistemic difference\nbetween the past and the future shapes our experience and interpretation of\nrecurring events in music. The second aspect concerns the arrow of time: the\nunambiguous ordering imposed on temporal events gives rise to the a priori\npointedness of time, rendering time asymmetrical and irreversible. A discussion\non thermodynamics informs us musically: the arrow of time effectuates itself in\nmusical forms by delaying the placement of the climax.\n  Organicism serves as a mediating topic, engaging with the concept of life as\nin organisms. On the one hand, organicism is related to temporal asymmetry in\nscience via a thermodynamical interpretation of life as entropy-reducing\nentities. On the other hand, organicism is a topic native to music via the\nuniversally acknowledged artistic idea that music should be interpreted as a\nvital force possessing volitional power. With organicism as a mediator, we\nbetter understand the role of temporal asymmetry in music. In particular, we\nview musical form as a process of expansion and elaboration analogous to\norganic growth. Finally, we present an organicist interpretation of delaying\nthe climax: viewing musical form as the result of organic growth, the arrow of\ntime translates to a preference for prepending structure over appending\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 21:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

While numerous efforts were put into developing new\nDL semantic segmentation models, less attention was paid to a key issue of how\nto effectively explore their probability maps to attain the best possible\ninstance segmentation. We observe that probability maps by DL semantic\nsegmentation models can be used to generate many possible instance candidates,\nand accurate instance segmentation can be achieved by selecting from them a set\nof \"optimized\" candidates as output instances. Further, the generated instance\ncandidates form a well-behaved hierarchical structure (a forest), which allows\nselecting instances in an optimized manner.

H-EMD contains two main stages. (1) Instance candidate\ngeneration: capturing instance-structured information in probability maps by\ngenerating many instance candidates in a forest structure. (2) Instance\ncandidate selection: selecting instances from the candidate set for final\ninstance segmentation.

The XOR Arbiter PUF (XOR PUF or XPUF) is an\nintensively studied PUF invented to improve the security of the Arbiter PUF,\nprobably the most lightweight delay-based PUF. Recently, highly powerful\nmachine learning attack methods were discovered and were able to easily break\nlarge-sized XPUFs, which were highly secure against earlier machine learning\nattack methods. Component-differentially-challenged XPUFs (CDC-XPUFs) are XPUFs\nwith different component PUFs receiving different challenges. Studies showed\nthey were much more secure against machine learning attacks than the\nconventional XPUFs, whose component PUFs receive the same challenge. But these\nstudies were all based on earlier machine learning attack methods, and hence it\nis not clear if CDC-XPUFs can remain secure under the recently discovered\npowerful attack methods. In this paper, the two current most powerful two\nmachine learning methods for attacking XPUFs are adapted by fine-tuning the\nparameters of the two methods for CDC-XPUFs. Attack experiments using both\nsimulated PUF data and silicon data generated from PUFs implemented on\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA) were carried out, and the experimental\nresults showed that some previously secure CDC-XPUFs of certain circuit\nparameter values are no longer secure under the adapted new attack methods,\nwhile many more CDC-XPUFs of other circuit parameter values remain secure.\nThus, our experimental attack study has re-defined the boundary between the\nsecure region and the insecure region of the PUF circuit parameter space,\nproviding PUF manufacturers and IoT security application developers with\nvaluable information in choosing PUFs with secure parameter values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 21:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

The success of these models raises\nthe question whether they could serve as a basis for building a wide range code\ngeneration tools. Traditionally, such tools are built manually and separately\nfor each task. Instead, few-shot learning may allow to obtain different tools\nfrom a single pre-trained language model by simply providing a few examples or\na natural language description of the expected tool behavior. This paper\nstudies to what extent a state-of-the-art, pre-trained language model of code,\nCodex, may serve this purpose. We consider three code manipulation and code\ngeneration tasks targeted by a range of traditional tools: (i) code mutation;\n(ii) test oracle generation from natural language documentation; and (iii) test\ncase generation. For each task, we compare few-shot learning to a manually\nbuilt tool. Our results show that the model-based tools complement (code\nmutation), are on par (test oracle generation), or even outperform their\nrespective traditionally built tool (test case generation), while imposing far\nless effort to develop them. By comparing the effectiveness of different\nvariants of the model-based tools, we provide insights on how to design an\nappropriate input (\"prompt\") to the model and what influence the size of the\nmodel has. For example, we find that providing a small natural language\ndescription of the code generation task is an easy way to improve predictions.\nOverall, we conclude that few-shot language models are surprisingly effective,\nyet there is still more work to be done, such as exploring more diverse ways of\nprompting and tackling even more involved tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 23:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2022 09:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}

In this\npaper, we propose a multivariate sparse group lasso joint model to integrate\nimaging and genomic data for building prediction models. Specifically, we\njointly consider two models, one regresses imaging features on genomic\nfeatures, and the other regresses patients clinical outcomes on genomic\nfeatures. The regularization penalties through sparse group lasso allow\nincorporation of intrinsic group information, e.g. biological pathway and\nimaging category, to select both important intrinsic groups and important\nfeatures within a group. To integrate information from the two models, in each\nmodel, we introduce a weight in the penalty term of each individual genomic\nfeature, where the weight is inversely correlated with the model coefficient of\nthat feature in the other model. This weight allows a feature to have a higher\nchance of selection by one model if it is selected by the other model. Our\nmodel is applicable to both continuous and time to event outcomes. It also\nallows the use of two separate datasets to fit the two models, addressing a\npractical challenge that many genomic datasets do not have imaging data\navailable.

Conventional\napproaches have evolved to either improve a single global model while keeping\neach local heterogeneous training data decentralized (i.e. data heterogeneity;\nFederated Learning (FL)) or to train an overarching network that supports\ndiverse architectural settings to address heterogeneous systems equipped with\ndifferent computational capabilities (i.e. system heterogeneity; Neural\nArchitecture Search). However, few studies have considered both directions\nsimultaneously. This paper proposes the federation of supernet training\n(FedSup) framework to consider both scenarios simultaneously, i.e., where\nclients send and receive a supernet that contains all possible architectures\nsampled from itself. The approach is inspired by observing that averaging\nparameters during model aggregation for FL is similar to weight-sharing in\nsupernet training. Thus, the proposed FedSup framework combines a\nweight-sharing approach widely used for training single shot models with FL\naveraging (FedAvg).

Most regularizers that prevent overfitting look to\nincrease confidence on additional examples (e.g., data augmentation,\nadversarial training), or reduce it on training data (e.g., label smoothing).\nIn this work we propose a complementary regularization strategy that reduces\nconfidence on self-generated examples. The method, which we call RCAD (Reducing\nConfidence along Adversarial Directions), aims to reduce confidence on\nout-of-distribution examples lying along directions adversarially chosen to\nincrease training loss. In contrast to adversarial training, RCAD does not try\nto robustify the model to output the original label, but rather regularizes it\nto have reduced confidence on points generated using much larger perturbations\nthan in conventional adversarial training. RCAD can be easily integrated into\ntraining pipelines with a few lines of code. Despite its simplicity, we find on\nmany classification benchmarks that RCAD can be added to existing techniques\n(e.g., label smoothing, MixUp training) to increase test accuracy by 1-3% in\nabsolute value, with more significant gains in the low data regime. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis that helps to explain these benefits in\nsimplified settings, showing that RCAD can provably help the model unlearn\nspurious features in the training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 02:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Prior works have achieved this goal by jointly training one model\non multi-site datasets, which achieve competitive performance on average but\nsuch methods rely on the assumption about the availability of all training\ndata, thus limiting its effectiveness in practical deployment. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel multi-site segmentation framework called\nincremental-transfer learning (ITL), which learns a model from multi-site\ndatasets in an end-to-end sequential fashion. Specifically, \"incremental\"\nrefers to training sequentially constructed datasets, and \"transfer\" is\nachieved by leveraging useful information from the linear combination of\nembedding features on each dataset. In addition, we introduce our ITL\nframework, where we train the network including a site-agnostic encoder with\npre-trained weights and at most two segmentation decoder heads. We also design\na novel site-level incremental loss in order to generalize well on the target\ndomain. Second, we show for the first time that leveraging our ITL training\nscheme is able to alleviate challenging catastrophic forgetting problems in\nincremental learning.

We hypothesize that most existing slot-based models have a\nlimited ability to learn object correlations. We propose two improvements that\nstrengthen slot correlation learning.

Second, we address the fundamental lack of a canonical order for objects\nby proposing to learn a consistent order to use for the autoregressive\ngeneration of scene objects. Specifically, we train an autoregressive slot\nprior to sequentially generate scene objects following the learned order. Slot\ninference entails estimating a randomly ordered set of slots using existing\napproaches for extracting slots from images, then aligning those slots to\nordered slots generated autoregressively with the prior.

However, how to instantly\nrepresent continuous changes of large-scale dynamic graphs with GNNs is still\nan open problem. Existing dynamic GNNs focus on modeling the periodic evolution\nof graphs, often on a snapshot basis. Such methods suffer from two drawbacks:\nfirst, there is a substantial delay for the changes in the graph to be\nreflected in the graph representations, resulting in losses on the model's\naccuracy; second, repeatedly calculating the representation matrix on the\nentire graph in each snapshot is predominantly time-consuming and severely\nlimits the scalability.

The verifcation results show that the proposed\nencryption scheme is technically feasible and available for power data and\nimage encryption in smart grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 06:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We run a set of sensitivity experiments\nto understand the role of each of the governing factors. The results show that\nthe SST, SSS, and DIC are the principal drivers affecting the sea-surface pH,\nwhile TALK plays a buffering role. The SST and DIC are consistently found to be\nopposite to each other. The pre-monsoon season (MAM) has shown to have an\nalmost equal contribution from all the drivers.

Our approach builds on the underpinning idea that we can\nlearn a probability density of contacts over objects' surfaces from a single\ndemonstration. We enhance this formulation for encoding aerial transportation\ntasks while maintaining the one-shot learning paradigm without handcrafting\ntask-dependent features or employing ad-hoc heuristics; the only prior is\nextrapolated directly from a single demonstration. Our models only rely on the\ngeometrical properties of the payloads computed from a point cloud, and they\nare robust to partial views. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated in\nsimulation, in which one or three quadropters are requested to transport\npreviously unseen payloads along a desired trajectory. The contact points and\nthe quadroptors configurations are computed on-the-fly for each test by our\napporach and compared with a baseline method, a modified grasp learning\nalgorithm from the literature.

Following this, the healthcare\nindustry has seen a significant increase in fraudulent activities owing to\nincreased insurance, and fraud has become a significant contributor to rising\nmedical care expenses, although its impact can be mitigated using fraud\ndetection techniques. To detect fraud, machine learning techniques are used.\nThe Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) of the United States\nfederal government released \"Medicare Part D\" insurance claims is utilized in\nthis study to develop fraud detection system. Employing machine learning\nalgorithms on a class-imbalanced and high dimensional medicare dataset is a\nchallenging task. To compact such challenges, the present work aims to perform\nfeature extraction following data sampling, afterward applying various\nclassification algorithms, to get better performance. Feature extraction is a\ndimensionality reduction approach that converts attributes into linear or\nnon-linear combinations of the actual attributes, generating a smaller and more\ndiversified set of attributes and thus reducing the dimensions. Data sampling\nis commonlya used to address the class imbalance either by expanding the\nfrequency of minority class or reducing the frequency of majority class to\nobtain approximately equal numbers of occurrences for both classes. The\nproposed approach is evaluated through standard performance metrics. Thus, to\ndetect fraud efficiently, this study applies autoencoder as a feature\nextraction technique, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) as a\ndata sampling technique, and various gradient boosted decision tree-based\nclassifiers as a classification algorithm.

The earliest cameras were in fact lensless, relying on long exposure\ntimes to form images on the other end of a small aperture in a darkened\nroom/container (camera obscura). The introduction of a lens allowed for more\nlight throughput and therefore shorter exposure times, while retaining sharp\nfocus. The incorporation of digital sensors readily enabled the use of\ncomputational imaging techniques to post-process and enhance raw images (e.g.\nvia deblurring, inpainting, denoising, sharpening). Recently, imaging\nscientists have started leveraging computational imaging as an integral part of\nlensless imaging systems, allowing them to form viewable images from the highly\nmultiplexed raw measurements of lensless cameras (see [5] and references\ntherein for a comprehensive treatment of lensless imaging). This represents a\nreal paradigm shift in camera system design as there is more flexibility to\ncater the hardware to the application at hand (e.g. lightweight or flat\ndesigns). This increased flexibility comes however at the price of a more\ndemanding post-processing of the raw digital recordings and a tighter\nintegration of sensing and computation, often difficult to achieve in practice\ndue to inefficient interactions between the various communities of scientists\ninvolved. With LenslessPiCam, we provide an easily accessible hardware and\nsoftware framework to enable researchers, hobbyists, and students to implement\nand explore practical and computational aspects of lensless imaging.

Standard approaches use labeling functions to specify signals that are\nrelevant for the labeling. It has been conjectured that weakly supervised\nmodels over-rely on those signals and as a result suffer from overfitting. To\nverify this assumption, we introduce a novel method, XPASC\n(eXPlainability-Association SCore), for measuring the generalization of a model\ntrained with a weakly supervised dataset. Considering the occurrences of\nfeatures, classes and labeling functions in a dataset, XPASC takes into account\nthe relevance of each feature for the predictions of the model as well as the\nassociations of the feature with the class and the labeling function,\nrespectively. The association in XPASC can be measured in two variants:\nXPASC-CHI SQAURE measures associations relative to their statistical\nsignificance, while XPASC-PPMI measures association strength more generally. We\nuse XPASC to analyze KnowMAN, an adversarial architecture intended to control\nthe degree of generalization from the labeling functions and thus to mitigate\nthe problem of overfitting. On one hand, we show that KnowMAN is able to\ncontrol the degree of generalization through a hyperparameter. On the other\nhand, results and qualitative analysis show that generalization and performance\ndo not relate one-to-one, and that the highest degree of generalization does\nnot necessarily imply the best performance. Therefore methods that allow for\ncontrolling the amount of generalization can achieve the right degree of benign\noverfitting.

The difference of these coupling schemes is due to their\nrelative scales and the number of semi-transparent mirrors for coupling.\nSpecifically, in the continuous mode coupling scheme, the generation of\ntwo-photon states is influenced by the length of the feedback loop by the\nwaveguide and the coupling strength between the waveguide and the cavity-QED\nsystem.

Many researchers modified the commonly used univariate\nparametric models such as exponential, gamma, Weibull, and log-normal\ndistributions to appropriately fit such data having instantaneous failure\nobservations. Researchers also find bivariate correlated life testing data\nhaving many observations near a particular point while the remaining\nobservations follow some continuous distribution. This situation defines as\nresponses having early failures for such bivariate responses. If the point is\nthe origin, then we call the situation a nearly instantaneous failure for the\nresponses.

Our observations indicate a large spin-flip probability in\nagreement with a theoretically expected large spin-orbit coupling, as well as a\nweak interlayer exchange coupling. The spin-flip probability is found to\nincrease when the magnetization is pulled away from its quantization axis,\nopening doors to an external control over the spins in this material. Our\nresults provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics van der Waals materials\nupon fs laser-pulse excitation, paving the way towards two-dimensional\nmaterials-based ultrafast spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 08:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Uniaxial or biaxial heterostrain modifies the stacking\narrangement of bilayer graphene (BLG) which subsequently influences the\nelectronic structure of the bilayer. Here, we use Density Functional Theory\n(DFT) calculations to investigate the interplay between an external applied\nheterostrain and the resulting stacking in BLG. We determine how a strain\napplied to one layer is transferred to a second, 'free' layer and at what\ncritical strain the ground-state AB-stacking is disrupted. To overcome\nlimitations introduced by periodic boundary conditions, we consider an\napproximate system consisting of an infinite graphene sheet and an armchair\ngraphene nanoribbon (AGNR). We find that above a critical strain of ~1%, it is\nenergetically favourable for the free layer to be unstrained, indicating a\ntransition between uniform AB-stacking and non-uniform mixed stacking. This is\nin agreement with a simple model estimate based on the individual energy\ncontributions of strain and stacking effects.

We examine the effects of such a thermal friction on\naxion dark matter density and its perturbation when the thermal friction\ndominates over the Hubble friction until when the axion field begins to\noscillate around the potential minimum. We show that in the presence of sizable\nthermal friction there can be an exponential decay phase of the axion field\nbefore the oscillation phase, during which the axion energy density is\nefficiently dissipated into hidden thermal bath. Consequently, the previously\nexcluded parameter region due to overclosing relic axion density becomes\ncosmologically viable with thermal friction. In particular, a QCD axion much\nlighter than $\\mu$eV is viable without tuning the initial misalignment angle.\nWe also find that thermal friction can affect the density perturbation of axion\ndark matter in various ways. For instance, it can alleviate the large-scale\nisocurvature bound on axion dark matter in the pre-inflationary PQ breaking\nscenario, which would make the pre-inflationary axion dark matter compatible\nwith high scale inflation over a wide range of model parameters.

One promising solution to\naddress this problem is barrier functions. The composition of a barrier\nfunction with a stochastic system forms a supermartingale, thus enabling the\ncomputation of the probability that the system stays in a safe set over a\nfinite time horizon via martingale inequalities. However, existing approaches\nto find barrier functions for stochastic systems generally rely on convex\noptimization programs that restrict the search of a barrier to a small class of\nfunctions such as low degree SoS polynomials and can be computationally\nexpensive. In this paper, we parameterize a barrier function as a neural\nnetwork and show that techniques for robust training of neural networks can be\nsuccessfully employed to find neural barrier functions.

Over the years, they have also benefited from various\nenhancements and they are now considered as state of the art techniques for\nimage like data. However, when they are used for regression to estimate some\nfunction value from images, fewer recommendations are available. In this study,\na novel CNN regression model is proposed. It combines convolutional neural\nlayers to extract high level features representations from images with a soft\nlabelling technique. More specifically, as the deep regression task is\nchallenging, the idea is to account for some uncertainty in the targets that\nare seen as distributions around their mean. The estimations are carried out by\nthe model in the form of distributions. Building from earlier work, a specific\nhistogram loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is\napplied during training. The model takes advantage of the CNN feature\nrepresentation and is able to carry out estimation from multi-channel input\nimages. To assess and illustrate the technique, the model is applied to Global\nNavigation Satellite System (GNSS) multi-path estimation where multi-path\nsignal parameters have to be estimated from correlator output images from the I\nand Q channels. The multi-path signal delay, magnitude, Doppler shift frequency\nand phase parameters are estimated from synthetically generated datasets of\nsatellite signals. Experiments are conducted under various receiving conditions\nand various input images resolutions to test the estimation performances\nquality and robustness. The results show that the proposed soft labelling CNN\ntechnique using distributional loss outperforms classical CNN regression under\nall conditions. Furthermore, the extra learning performance achieved by the\nmodel allows the reduction of input image resolution from 80x80 down to 40x40\nor sometimes 20x20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 09:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

However, GCL is inefficient in both time and memory consumption. In\naddition, GCL normally requires a large number of training epochs to be\nwell-trained on large-scale datasets. Inspired by an observation of a technical\ndefect (i.e., inappropriate usage of Sigmoid function) commonly used in two\nrepresentative GCL works, DGI and MVGRL, we revisit GCL and introduce a new\nlearning paradigm for self-supervised graph representation learning, namely,\nGroup Discrimination (GD), and propose a novel GD-based method called Graph\nGroup Discrimination (GGD). Instead of similarity computation, GGD directly\ndiscriminates two groups of node samples with a very simple binary\ncross-entropy loss.

Although PINNs are\ngenerally viewed as mesh-free, current approaches still rely on collocation\npoints within a bounded region, even in settings with spatially sparse signals.\nFurthermore, if the boundaries are not known, the selection of such a region is\ndifficult and often results in a large proportion of collocation points being\nselected in areas of low relevance. To resolve this severe drawback of current\nmethods, we present a mesh-free and adaptive approach termed particle-density\nPINN (pdPINN), which is inspired by the microscopic viewpoint of fluid\ndynamics. The method is based on the Eulerian formulation and, different from\nclassical mesh-free method, does not require the introduction of Lagrangian\nupdates. We propose to sample directly from the distribution over the particle\npositions, eliminating the need to introduce boundaries while adaptively\nfocusing on the most relevant regions. This is achieved by interpreting a\nnon-negative physical quantity (such as the density or temperature) as an\nunnormalized probability distribution from which we sample with dynamic Monte\nCarlo methods. The proposed method leads to higher sample efficiency and\nimproved performance of PINNs.

Finally, the techniques\nemployed in the previous cases allow us to describe the $\\infty$-category of\nproper $G$-spectra for a Lie group $G$, as a limit of a diagram of $H$-spectra\nfor $H$ running over all compact subgroups of $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 13:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 08:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Maintenance is often imperfect in reality and does not make the\nasset as good as new. Although a variety of imperfect maintenance policies have\nbeen proposed in the literature, these rely on strong assumptions regarding the\neffect of maintenance on the machine's condition, assuming the effect is (1)\ndeterministic or governed by a known probability distribution, and (2)\nmachine-independent.

Most research on RF and\nVLC coexistence has focused on hybrid designs where data transmission to any\nuser could originate from either an RF or a VLC access point (AP). However,\nhybrid RF/VLC systems fail to exploit the distinct transmission characteristics\nof RF and VLC systems to fully reap the benefits they can offer. Aggregated\nRF/VLC systems, in which any user can be served simultaneously by both RF and\nVLC APs, have recently emerged as a more promising and robust design for the\ncoexistence of RF and VLC systems. To this end, this paper, for the first time,\ninvestigates AP assignment, subchannel allocation (SA), and transmit power\nallocation (PA) to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of aggregated RF/VLC\nsystems while considering the effects of interference and VLC line-of-sight\nlink blockages. A novel and challenging EE optimization problem is formulated\nfor which an efficient joint solution based on alternating optimization is\ndeveloped. More particularly, an energy-efficient AP assignment algorithm based\non matching theory is proposed. Then, a low-complexity SA scheme that allocates\nsubchannels to users based on their channel conditions is developed. Finally,\nan effective PA algorithm is presented by utilizing the quadratic transform\napproach and a multi-objective optimization framework. Extensive simulation\nresults reveal that: 1) the proposed joint AP assignment, SA, and PA solution\nobtains significant EE, sum-rate, and outage performance gains with low\ncomplexity, and 2) the aggregated RF/VLC system provides considerable\nperformance improvement compared to hybrid RF/VLC systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 13:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

Despite some phenomenological resemblance,\nincluding signatures of criticality, the autonomous dynamics that binds motile\nagents into flocks, herds, or swarms allows for much richer behavior.\nLow-dimensional models have hinted at the crucial role played in this respect\nby perceived information, decision-making, and feedback implying that the\ncorresponding interactions are inevitably retarded. Here we present experiments\non spherical Brownian microswimmers with delayed self-propulsion toward a\nspatially fixed target. We observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking to a\ntransiently chiral dynamical state and concomitant critical behavior that does\nnot rely on many-particle cooperativity. By comparison with the stochastic\ndelay differential equation of motion of a single swimmer, we pinpoint the\ndelay-induced effective synchronization of the swimmers with their own past as\nits key mechanism. Increasing numbers of swimmers self-organize into layers\nwith pro- and retrograde orbital motion, synchronized and stabilized by steric\nand hydrodynamic interactions.

In this work,\nwe use far-UV (FUV) imaging to map recent SF on times scales of about 100 Myrs.\nWe used the Ultraviolet telescope UVIT on board Astrosat to image the Dorado\nbackbone galaxies previously observed in Ha+[NII], with the far-UV filter\nFUV.CaF2 (1300-1800A). The sample includes NGC1536, NGC1546, NGC1549,\n[CMI2001]4136-01, NGC1553, IC2058, PGC75125,NGC1566, NGC1596 and NGC1602.\nFUV.CaF2 emission is revealed in all galaxies, tracing young stellar\npopulations in rings and showing tidal distortions. The Sersic index, derived\nby fitting the luminosity profiles, is always n<3 suggesting that the FUV.CaF2\nemission originates from a disk also in ETGs. The SFR ranges from 0.004+-0.001\nM_sol yr^{-1} of [CMI2001]4136-01 to 2.455+-0.027 M_sol yr^{-1} of NGC 1566.\nMost of the recent SF is found at the periphery of the Dorado group where most\nof LTGs are located. For these galaxies, the ratio SFR_Ha/SFR_FUV.CaF2 is close\nto 1, except for the edge-on IC 2058, similarly to previously reported\nrelations for Local Volume samples. For ETGs, however, SFR_Ha is about 15 times\nhigher than SFR_FUV. The Dorado's ETGs define a separate locus in SFR_FUV,\nSFR_Ha space with respect to the LTGs, which is well represented by the\nrelation log (SFR_FUV.CaF2) = 0.70xlog (SFR_{Ha})-1.26.The disk structure of\nthe FUV.CaF2 emitting populations discovered in all the ETGs implies\ndissipative processes and wet merging events.

Our study further shows that Tb is an efficient SOT generator\nwhen in contact with Co, such that its position in the stack can be adjusted to\ngenerate torques additive to those generated by Pt. With optimal stacking and\nlayer thickness, the dampinglike SOT efficiency reaches up to 0.3, which is\nmore than twice that expected from the Pt/Co bilayer.

The process of constraining\nfree numerical models with observations is known as data assimilation. The\nprimary objective is to minimize the misfit of model states with the\nobservations while respecting the rules of physics. The caveat of this approach\nis that measurements are used only once, at the time of the prediction. The\ninformation contained in the history of the measurements and its role in the\ndeterminism of the prediction is, therefore, not accounted for. Consequently,\nhistorical measurement cannot be used in real-time forecasting systems. The\nresearch presented in this paper provides a novel approach rooted in artificial\nintelligence to expand the usability of observations made before the time of\nthe prediction. Our approach is based on the re-purpose of an existing deep\nlearning model, called U-Net, designed specifically for image segmentation\nanalysis in the biomedical field. U-Net is used here to create a Transform\nModel that retains the temporal and spatial evolution of the differences\nbetween model and observations to produce a correction in the form of\nregression weights that evolves spatially and temporally with the model both\nforward and backward in time, beyond the observation period. Using virtual\nobservations, we show that the usability of the observation can be extended up\nto a one year prior or post observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 14:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

High-resolution tomographic\nparticle image velocimetry and formaldehyde planar laser induced fluorescence\nmeasurements are used to obtain 3D velocity fields and estimates of the\nprogress variable and density fields. The kinetic energy transfer across a\nfilter scale of $\\Delta = 1.5 \\delta^0_\\mathrm{L}$ was then quantified using\nphysical space analysis. Coherent flow structures were identified using the\nswirling strength and proper orthogonal decomposition was used to identify the\ndominant periodic flow structure. While non-reacting regions of the flow show\nmean down-scale energy transfer (forward-scatter), mean back-scatter is\nobserved internal to the flame. Importantly, the back-scatter magnitude in the\nflame increases in regions undergoing flame/vortex interaction. That is, the\nmean back-scatter magnitude at locations simultaneously inside the flame and a\nlarge-scale coherent vortex is higher than regions in the flame and not in a\nvortex, with the mean back-scatter magnitude increasing with the swirling\nstrength. This increased back-scatter may be due to locally higher heat release\nrates in locations of flame/vortex interaction. Overall, the results\ndemonstrate the importance of kinetic energy back-scatter at scales around the\nflame thickness and the complicated relationship between back-scatter and local\nflame/flow structure; these results should be considered when modeling\nturbulence in flames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 15:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

The level of such improvements will\nhowever strongly depend on the extent to which late time non-linearities erase\nthe PNG signal on small scales. In this work, we show how much primordial\ninformation remains in the bispectrum of the non-linear dark matter density\nfield by implementing a new, simulation-based, methodology for joint estimation\nof PNG amplitudes ($f_{\\rm NL}$) and standard $\\Lambda$CDM parameters. The\nestimator is based on optimally compressed statistics, which, for a given input\ndensity field, combine power spectrum and modal bispectrum measurements, and\nnumerically evaluate their covariance and their response to changes in\ncosmological parameters. We train and validate the estimator using a large\nsuite of N-body simulations (QUIJOTE-PNG), including different types of PNG\n(local, equilateral, orthogonal). We explicitly test the estimator's\nunbiasedness, optimality and stability with respect to changes in the total\nnumber of input realizations. While the dark matter power spectrum itself\ncontains negligible PNG information, as expected, including it as an ancillary\nstatistic increases the PNG information content extracted from the bispectrum\nby a factor of order $2$.

However, RL systems, when\napplied to large-scale settings, rarely operate tabula rasa. Such large-scale\nsystems undergo multiple design or algorithmic changes during their development\ncycle and use ad hoc approaches for incorporating these changes without\nre-training from scratch, which would have been prohibitively expensive.\nAdditionally, the inefficiency of deep RL typically excludes researchers\nwithout access to industrial-scale resources from tackling\ncomputationally-demanding problems. To address these issues, we present\nreincarnating RL as an alternative workflow or class of problem settings, where\nprior computational work (e.g., learned policies) is reused or transferred\nbetween design iterations of an RL agent, or from one RL agent to another. As a\nstep towards enabling reincarnating RL from any agent to any other agent, we\nfocus on the specific setting of efficiently transferring an existing\nsub-optimal policy to a standalone value-based RL agent. We find that existing\napproaches fail in this setting and propose a simple algorithm to address their\nlimitations.

One example is breaking waves, where bubbles strongly influence wave\nimpact loads, acoustic emissions, and atmospheric-ocean transfer, but detailed\nsimulations in all but the simplest settings are infeasible. An alternative\napproach is to resolve only large scales, and model small scale bubbles\nadopting sub-resolution closures. Here we introduce a large eddy simulation\n(LES) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for simulations of bubbly\nflows. The continuous liquid phase is resolved with a semi-implicit\nisothermally compressible SPH framework. This is coupled with a discrete\nLagrangian bubble model. Bubbles and liquid interact via exchanges of volume\nand momentum, through turbulent closures, bubble breakup and entrainment, and\nfree-surface interaction models. By representing bubbles as individual\nparticles, they can be tracked over their lifetimes, allowing closure models\nfor sub-resolution fluctuations, bubble deformation, breakup and free-surface\ninteraction in integral form, accounting for the finite timescales over which\nthese events occur. We investigate two flows: bubble plumes, and breaking\nwaves, and find close quantitative agreement with published experimental and\nnumerical data. In particular, for plunging breaking waves, our framework\naccurately predicts the Hinze scale, bubble size distribution, and growth rate\nof the entrained bubble population.

Specifically, we start\nfrom the assumption that the position and orientation of a RIS can be viewed as\nprior information for RIS-aided localization in wireless systems and derive\nBayesian bounds for the localization of a user equipment (UE). To do this, we\nfirst derive the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (FIM) for geometric channel\nparameters in order to derive the Bayesian localization bounds. Subsequently,\nwe show through the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) that all the\ninformation provided by the RIS-related geometric channel parameters is\ncompletely lost when the complex path gains are unknown. More specifically, in\nthe absence of channel knowledge, the EFIM of the RIS-related geometric channel\nparameters is a zero matrix. This observation is crucial to parametric channel\nestimation. It mandates that any parametric channel estimator must estimate the\ncomplex path gains before estimating the RIS-related geometric channel\nparameters. Furthermore, we note that because these RIS-related geometric\nparameters are needed for localization, prior information about the complex\npath gains must be available for feasible UE localization. We also show that\nthis FIM is decomposable into i) information provided by the transmitter, ii)\ninformation provided by the RIS, and iii) information provided by the receiver.\nWe then transform the Bayesian EFIM for geometric channel parameters to the\nBayesian FIM for the UE position and orientation parameters and examine its\nspecific structure under a particular class of RIS reflection coefficients.\nFinally, we show the effect of having a set of RISs with perturbed\nposition/orientation on localization performance through numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

To overcome this, our\nlarge international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive\nframework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics.\nFollowing the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics\nReloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was\ndeveloped in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of\na problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that\ncaptures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain\ninterest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm\noutput. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process\nof choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware\nof potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that\ncan be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level,\nnamely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and\ninstance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the\nframework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of\naccess to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the\nmost common validation metrics.

However, inappropriate noises added to training data may reduce a\nmodel's performance, which is termed the trade-off between accuracy and\nrobustness. This problem has been sufficiently studied for the classification\nof whole images but has rarely been explored for image analysis tasks in the\nmedical application domain, including image segmentation, landmark detection,\nand object detection tasks. In this study, we show that, for those medical\nimage analysis tasks, the SAT method has a severe issue that limits its\npractical use: it generates a fixed and unified level of noise for all training\nsamples for robust DNN training. A high noise level may lead to a large\nreduction in model performance and a low noise level may not be effective in\nimproving robustness. To resolve this issue, we design an adaptive-margin\nadversarial training (AMAT) method that generates sample-wise adaptive\nadversarial noises for robust DNN training. In contrast to the existing,\nclassification-oriented adversarial training methods, our AMAT method uses a\nloss-defined-margin strategy so that it can be applied to different tasks as\nlong as the loss functions are well-defined.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was\ncarried out in a population of 75 subjects from a clinical center of San Carlos\nde Bariloche. The proposed method analyzes the myocardial texture in cine CMR\nimages using a convolutional neural network to determine local myocardial\ntissue damage. Results: An accuracy of 89% for quantifying local tissue damage\nwas observed for the validation data set and 70% for the test set. In addition,\nthe qualitative analysis showed a high spatial correlation in lesion location.\nConclusions: The postulated method enables to spatially identify fibrosis using\nonly the information from cine nuclear magnetic resonance studies,\ndemonstrating the potential of this technique to quantify myocardial viability\nin the future or to study the lesions etiology\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 14:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In this context, the main problem is how\nto learn new information without forgetting old knowledge (i.e., Catastrophic\nForgetting). Most existing CL approaches focus on finding solutions to preserve\nacquired knowledge, so working on the past of the model. However, we argue that\nas the model has to continually learn new tasks, it is also important to put\nfocus on the present knowledge that could improve following tasks learning. In\nthis paper we propose a new, simple, CL algorithm that focuses on solving the\ncurrent task in a way that might facilitate the learning of the next ones. More\nspecifically, our approach combines the main data stream with a secondary,\ndiverse and uncorrelated stream, from which the network can draw auxiliary\nknowledge. This helps the model from different perspectives, since auxiliary\ndata may contain useful features for the current and the next tasks and\nincoming task classes can be mapped onto auxiliary classes. Furthermore, the\naddition of data to the current task is implicitly making the classifier more\nrobust as we are forcing the extraction of more discriminative features. Our\nmethod can outperform existing state-of-the-art models on the most common CL\nImage Classification benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 14:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

With the number\nof EVs on the roads expected to increase, it is imperative to understand the\neffect of EVs on transport and energy systems. While unmanaged charging of EVs\ncould potentially add stress to the electricity grid, managed charging of EVs\ncould be beneficial to the grid in terms of improved demand-supply management\nand improved integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, as well as\noffer other ancillary services. To assess the impact of EVs on the electricity\ngrid and their potential use as batteries-on-wheels through smart charging\ncapabilities, decision-makers need to understand how current EV owners drive\nand charge their vehicles. As such, an emerging area of research focuses on\nunderstanding these behaviours.

We focus on novel scenarios that the energy-constrained mobile\ndevices offload inference tasks to an edge server with GPU. The inference task\nis partitioned into sub-tasks for a finer granularity of offloading and\nscheduling, and the user energy consumption minimization problem under\ninference latency constraints is investigated. To deal with the coupled\noffloading and scheduling introduced by concurrent batch processing, we first\nconsider an offline problem with a constant edge inference latency and the same\nlatency constraint. It is proven that optimizing the offloading policy of each\nuser independently and aggregating all the same sub-tasks in one batch is\noptimal, and thus the independent partitioning and same sub-task aggregating\n(IP-SSA) algorithm is inspired. Further, the optimal grouping (OG) algorithm is\nproposed to optimally group tasks when the latency constraints are different.\nFinally, when future task arrivals cannot be precisely predicted, a deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent is trained to call OG.

Today, special CMOS designs address this\nbottleneck. The next generation of computing hardware will need to eliminate or\ndramatically mitigate this bottleneck. We discuss how compute-in-memory can\nplay an important part in this development.

The electrification of\ntransport, households and manufacturing leads to an increase in energy\nconsumption due to hysteresis losses2. Therefore, minimizing coercivity, which\nscales these losses, is crucial3. Yet, meeting this target alone is not enough:\nSMMs in electrical engines must withstand severe mechanical loads, i.e., the\nalloys need high strength and ductility4. This is a fundamental design\nchallenge, as most methods that enhance strength introduce stress fields that\ncan pin magnetic domains, thus increasing coercivity and hysteretic losses5.\nHere, we introduce an approach to overcome this dilemma. We have designed a\nFe-Co-Ni-Ta-Al multicomponent alloy with ferromagnetic matrix and paramagnetic\ncoherent nanoparticles (~91 nm size, ~55% volume fraction). They impede\ndislocation motion, enhancing strength and ductility. Their small size, low\ncoherency and small magnetostatic energy create an interaction volume below the\nmagnetic domain wall width, leading to minimal domain wall pinning, thus\nmaintaining the soft magnetic properties. The alloy has a tensile strength of\n1336 MPa at 54% tensile elongation, extremely low coercivity of 78 A/m (<1 Oe),\nmoderate saturation magnetization of 100 Am2/kg, and high electrical\nresistivity of 103 {\\mu}{\\Omega} u Ohm cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 16:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}
