With typically hundreds of vehicles in one shift, the paint\nshop sequencing problem is intractable in classical computing.

Among the\nnumerous IQA methods, Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index and its variants are\nbetter matched to the perceived quality of the human visual system. However,\nSSIM methods are insufficiently sensitive, when images contain low information,\nwhere the important information only occupies a low proportion of the image\nwhile most of the image is noise-like, which is common in scientific data.\nTherefore, we propose two new IQA methods, InTensity Weighted SSIM index and\nLow-Information Similarity Index, for such low information images. In addition,\nauxiliary indexes are proposed to assist with the assessment. The application\nof these new IQA methods to natural images and field-specific images, such as\nradio astronomical images, medical images, and remote sensing images, are also\ndemonstrated. The results show that our IQA methods perform better than\nstate-of-the-art SSIM methods for differences in high-intensity parts of the\ninput images and have similar performance to that of the original and\ngradient-based SSIM for differences in low-intensity parts. Different\nsimilarity indexes are suitable for different applications, which we\ndemonstrate in our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 16:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2022 22:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

Predictions are more accurate when explanations are\nplausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful.\nLastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of\nout-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's\nin-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics\nfor evaluating model reasoning.

Our first contribution is a general theory of certification for\nend-to-end perception models. In particular, we introduce the notion of\n$\\zeta$-correctness, which bounds the distance between an estimate and the\nground truth. We show that $\\zeta$-correctness can be assessed by implementing\ntwo certificates: (i) a certificate of observable correctness, that asserts if\nthe model output is consistent with the input data and prior information, (ii)\na certificate of non-degeneracy, that asserts whether the input data is\nsufficient to compute a unique estimate. Our second contribution is to apply\nthis theory and design a new learning-based certifiable pose estimator. We\npropose C-3PO, a semantic-keypoint-based pose estimation model, augmented with\nthe two certificates, to solve the certifiable pose estimation problem. C-3PO\nalso includes a keypoint corrector, implemented as a differentiable\noptimization layer, that can correct large detection errors (e.g. due to the\nsim-to-real gap). Our third contribution is a novel self-supervised training\napproach that uses our certificate of observable correctness to provide the\nsupervisory signal to C-3PO during training. In it, the model trains only on\nthe observably correct input-output pairs, in each training iteration. As\ntraining progresses, we see that the observably correct input-output pairs\ngrow, eventually reaching near 100% in many cases. Our experiments show that\n(i) standard semantic-keypoint-based methods outperform more recent\nalternatives, (ii) C-3PO further improves performance and significantly\noutperforms all the baselines, and (iii) C-3PO's certificates are able to\ndiscern correct pose estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 17:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 16:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 19:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 19:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Recently, methods that tag rather\nthan linearly generate sequences have proven stronger in both in- and\nout-of-domain rewriting settings.

However, these\nmethods may suffer from low coverage when phrases that must be added to a\nsource utterance cannot be covered by a single context span. This can occur in\nlanguages like English that introduce tokens such as prepositions into the\nrewrite for grammaticality. We propose a hierarchical context tagger (HCT) that\nmitigates this issue by predicting slotted rules (e.g., \"besides_\") whose slots\nare later filled with context spans. HCT (i) tags the source string with\ntoken-level edit actions and slotted rules and (ii) fills in the resulting rule\nslots with spans from the dialogue context. This rule tagging allows HCT to add\nout-of-context tokens and multiple spans at once; we further cluster the rules\nto truncate the long tail of the rule distribution.

Finding\nsuch a reduced representation for complex systems is, however, a difficult\ntask. We address this problem for dynamics on weighted directed networks, with\nspecial emphasis on modular and heterogeneous networks. We propose a two-step\ndimension-reduction method that takes into account the properties of the\nadjacency matrix. First, units are partitioned into groups of similar\nconnectivity profiles. Each group is associated to an observable that is a\nweighted average of the nodes' activities within the group.

The result is a reduced adjacency matrix and an\napproximate system of ODEs for the observables' evolution. We show that the\nreduced system can be used to predict some characteristic features of the\ncomplete dynamics for different types of connectivity structures, both\nsynthetic and derived from real data, including neuronal, ecological, and\nsocial networks.

It\nfinds an approximate macroscopic homogenized equation with constant\ncoefficients posed in space and time; however, the resulting homogenized\nequation is higher order in space and time. The homogenized equation can be\nused to solve initial-boundary-value problems posed on arbitrary non-periodic\nmacroscale geometries with macroscopic heterogeneity, such as bodies composed\nof several different metamaterials or with external boundaries.\n  First, considering a single band, the higher-order space derivatives lead to\nadditional continuity conditions at the boundary between a homogeneous material\nand a metamaterial. These provide predictions of wave scattering in 1-d and 2-d\nthat match well with the exact fine-scale solution; compared to alternative\napproaches, they provide a single equation that is valid over a broad range of\nfrequencies, are easy to apply, and are much faster to compute. Next, the\nsetting of two bands with a bandgap is considered. The homogenized equation has\nalso higher-order time derivatives. Notably, the homogenized model provides a\nsingle equation that is valid over both bands and the bandgap. The continuity\nconditions are applied to wave scattering at a boundary, and show good\nagreement with the exact fine-scale solution.\n  Using that the order of the highest time derivative is proportional to the\nnumber of bands considered, a nonlocal-in-time structure is conjectured for the\nhomogenized equation in the limit of infinite bands. This suggests that\nhomogenizing over finer length and time scales -- with the temporal\nhomogenization being carried out through the consideration of higher bands in\nthe dispersion relation -- is a mechanism for the emergence of macroscopic\nspatial and temporal nonlocality, with the extent of temporal nonlocality being\nrelated to the number of bands considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 17:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

Fundamental solitons are one\npossible solution for such pulses which offer a fundamental advantage: their\nshape is not affected by fiber disperison and nonlinearity. Furthermore, a\nsimple energy detector can be used at the receiver to detect the transmitted\ninformation. However, systems based on energy modulation of solitons are not\ncompetitive in terms of data rates. This is partly due to the fact that the\neffective time duration of a soliton depends on its chosen amplitude. In this\npaper, we propose to replace fundamental solitons by new time-limited waveforms\nthat can be detected using an energy detector, and that are immune to fiber\ndistortions. Our proposed solution relies on the prolate spheroidal wave\nfunctions and a numerical optimization routine. Time-limited waveforms that\nundergo minimum time broadening along an optical fiber are obtained and shown\nto outperform fundamental solitons. In the case of binary transmission and a\nsingle span of fiber, we report rate increases of 33.8% and 12% over lossy and\nlossless fibers, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the transmission rate\nof the proposed system increases as the number of used energy levels increases,\nwhich is not the case for fundamental solitons due to their effective\ntime-amplitude constraint.

The role of equivalence extensions, which leave the theory the same\nup to Morita equivalence, is investigated.\n  Motivated by the question what the big Zariski topos of a non-affine scheme\nclassifies, we show how to construct a syntactic presentation for a topos if\nsyntactic presentations for a covering family of open subtoposes are given.

These properties limit the applicability of current methods in Offline\nRL and Behavioral Cloning to learn from large, pre-collected datasets. In this\nwork, we present Behavior Transformer (BeT), a new technique to model unlabeled\ndemonstration data with multiple modes. BeT retrofits standard transformer\narchitectures with action discretization coupled with a multi-task action\ncorrection inspired by offset prediction in object detection. This allows us to\nleverage the multi-modal modeling ability of modern transformers to predict\nmulti-modal continuous actions.

Furthermore, the tension between Planck data for\n$\\ell < 800$ and $\\ell \\geq 800$ is significantly reduced for the WZDR model.\nThe independent data sets show slightly more permissive bounds on the Hubble\nparameter, allowing the tension to be further reduced to $2.1 \\sigma$\n(CMB-independent) or $1.9\\sigma$ (ACT+WMAP). However, no combination shows a\nlarge preference for the presence of WZDR. We also investigate whether\nadditional dark radiation -- dark matter interactions can help in easing the\n$S_8$ tension as well.

This generative adversarial training approach is very powerful\nbut depends on a delicate balance between the discriminator and the generator\ntraining.

A key insight of this work is that performing imitation\nlearning in a suitable latent task space makes the training process stable,\neven in challenging high-dimensional problems. We use an action encoder-decoder\nmodel to obtain a low-dimensional latent action space and train a LAtent Policy\nusing Adversarial imitation Learning (LAPAL).

For\nmany applications, the question is not necessarily how to avoid (inevitable)\nsystem-environment interactions, but rather how to design environments that\noptimally preserve a system's phase relations in spite of such interactions.\nThe formation of system-environment entanglement is a major driving mechanism\nfor decoherence, and a detailed understanding of this process could inform\nstrategies for conserving coherence optimally. This requires scalable,\nflexible, and systematically improvable quantum dynamical methods that retain\ndetailed information about the entanglement properties of the environment, yet\nvery few current methods offer this combination of features. Here, we address\nthis need by introducing a theoretical framework wherein we combine the\ntruncated Wigner approximation with standard time-dependent perturbation theory\nallowing for computing expectation values of operators in the combined\nsystem-environment Hilbert space.

A ROM can be obtained, using the well-known Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD), by projecting the full-order model to a\nsubspace spanned by modal basis modes which are learned from experimental,\nsimulated or observational data, i.e., training data. However, the optimal\nbasis can change with the parameter settings. When a ROM, constructed using the\nPOD basis obtained from training data, is applied to new parameter settings,\nthe model often lacks robustness against the change of parameters in design,\ncontrol, and other real-time operation problems. This paper proposes to use\nregression trees on Grassmann Manifold to learn the mapping between parameters\nand POD bases that span the low-dimensional subspaces onto which full-order\nmodels are projected. Motivated by the fact that a subspace spanned by a POD\nbasis can be viewed as a point in the Grassmann manifold, we propose to grow a\ntree by repeatedly splitting the tree node to maximize the Riemannian distance\nbetween the two subspaces spanned by the predicted POD bases on the left and\nright daughter nodes. Five numerical examples are presented to comprehensively\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and compare the proposed\ntree-based method to the existing interpolation method for POD basis and the\nuse of global POD basis. The results show that the proposed tree-based method\nis capable of establishing the mapping between parameters and POD bases, and\nthus adapt ROMs for new parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 18:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

However, the heterogeneous nature of these\nservices' requirements, along with the limited RAN resources, makes the RAN\nslicing very complex. Indeed, the challenge that mobile virtual network\noperators (MVNOs) face is to rapidly adapt their RAN slicing strategies to the\nfrequent changes of the environment constraints and service requirements.\nMachine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are\nincreasingly considered a key enabler for automating the management and\norchestration of RAN slicing operations.

However, the\ncorrelation suffered from small number statistics (68 FRBs) and was not free\nfrom contamination by latent repeating populations, which might not have such a\ncorrelation. How to separate/exclude the repeating bursts from the mixture of\nall different types of FRBs is essential to see this property. Using a much\nlarger sample from the new FRB catalogue (containing 536 FRBs) recently\nreleased by the CHIME/FRB project, combined with a new classification method\ndeveloped based on unsupervised machine learning, we carried out further\nscrutiny of the relation.

This\ncorrelation becomes weaker and insignificant at higher redshifts (z > 0.3),\npossibly due to the lack of the faint FRBs at high-z and/or the redshift\nevolution of the correlation. The scattering time in the CHIME/FRB catalogue\nshows an intriguing trend: it varies along the line obtained from linear fit on\nthe energy versus duration plane between these two parameters.

Unfortunately, simple binary tactile sensors alone cannot determine\nthe context of the human contact -- whether it is a deliberate interaction or\nan unintended collision that requires safety manoeuvres. Many published methods\nclassify discrete interactions using more advanced tactile sensors or by\nanalysing joint torques. Instead, we propose to augment the intention\nrecognition capabilities of simple binary tactile sensors by adding a\nrobot-mounted camera for human posture analysis. Different interaction\ncharacteristics, including touch location, human pose, and gaze direction, are\nused to train a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify whether a\ntouch is intentional or not with an F1-score of 86%. We demonstrate that\nmultimodal intention recognition is significantly more accurate than monomodal\nanalyses with the collaborative robot Baxter. Furthermore, our method can also\ncontinuously monitor interactions that fluidly change between intentional or\nunintentional by gauging the user's attention through gaze. If a user stops\npaying attention mid-task, the proposed intention and attention recognition\nalgorithm can activate safety features to prevent unsafe interactions. We also\nemploy a feature reduction technique that reduces the number of inputs to five\nto achieve a more generalized low-dimensional classifier.

We run zoom-in chemo-dynamical simulations of nineteen halos\nextracted from a cosmological box and follow down to redshift 0. Models are\nvalidated not only on the basis of galaxy global properties, but also the\nstellar abundance ratios. We identify the necessary conditions for the\nformation of first stars in mini-halos and derive constraints on the metal\nejection schemes. The impact of Pop III stars on the final metallicity of UFDs\nis evaluated by considering different IMFs, the influence of pair-instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) and their energetic feedback, as well as the metallicity\nthreshold marks the transition from first stars to the formation of low-mass\nlong-lived stars. The inclusion of Pop III stars does increase the global\nmetallicity of UFDs, though insufficient to resolve the tension with\nobservations. PISNe with progenitor masses above 140Msun do allow to further\nincrease the metal content of UFDs. However, as PISNe are rare and sometimes\nabsent in the faintest UFDs, they have a limited impact on the global faint end\nof the metallicity-luminosity relation. Despite a limited number of\nspectroscopically confirmed members in UFDs, that makes the metallicity\ndistribution of some UFDs uncertain, our analysis reveals this is the\nmetal-rich tail that is missing in the models.

For moons outside of the habitable zone, significant tidal\nheating may raise their surface temperature enough to be considered habitable.\nTidal heating of a moon depends on numerous factors such as eccentricity,\nsemimajor axis, size of parent planet, and presence of additional moons. In\nthis work, we explore the degree of tidal heating possible for multi-moon\nsystems in resonance using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical models.\nThis demonstrates that even for a moon with zero initial eccentricity, when it\nmoves into resonance with an outer moon, it can generate significant\neccentricity and associated tidal heating. Depending on the mass ratio of the\ntwo moons, this resonance can either be short-lived ($\\leq200$ Myr) or continue\nto be driven by the tidal migration of the moons. This tidal heating can also\nassist in making the exomoons easier to discover, and we explore two scenarios:\nsecondary eclipses and outgassing of volcanic species. We then consider\nhypothetical moons orbiting known planetary systems to identify which will be\nbeast suited for finding exomoons with these methods.

These smooth dynamics are interrupted at\nbifurcations, where solutions change qualitatively. Sub-optimal test channels\nmay collide or exchange optimality there, for example. There is typically a\nplethora of sub-optimal solutions, which stems from restrictions of the\nreproduction alphabet.\n  We devise a family of algorithms that exploits the underlying dynamics to\ntrack a given test channel along the rate-distortion curve.

Many modern observability platforms support dimensional models of\ntelemetry signals where the measurements are accompanied by additional\ndimensions used to identify either the resources described by the telemetry or\nthe business-specific attributes of the activities (e.g., a customer\nidentifier). However, most of these platforms lack any semantic understanding\nof the data, by not capturing any metadata about telemetry, from simple aspects\nsuch as units of measure or data types (treating all dimensions as strings) to\nmore complex concepts such as purpose policies. This limits the ability of the\nplatforms to provide a rich user experience, especially when dealing with\ndifferent telemetry assets, for example, linking an anomaly in a time series\nwith the corresponding subset of logs or traces, which requires semantic\nunderstanding of the dimensions in the respective data sets.\n  In this paper, we describe a schema-first approach to application telemetry\nthat is being implemented at Meta. It allows the observability platforms to\ncapture metadata about telemetry from the start and enables a wide range of\nfunctionalities, including compile-time input validation, multi-signal\ncorrelations and cross-filtering, and even privacy rules enforcement. We\npresent a collection of design goals and demonstrate how schema-first approach\nprovides better trade-offs than many of the existing solutions in the industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 20:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

These\nrepresentations, in a lower-dimensional space, extract and compress information\nfrom individual curves. The existing representation learning approaches in\nfunctional data analysis usually use linear mapping in parallel to those from\nmultivariate analysis, e.g., functional principal component analysis (FPCA).\nHowever, functions, as infinite-dimensional objects, sometimes have nonlinear\nstructures that cannot be uncovered by linear mapping. Linear methods will be\nmore overwhelmed given multivariate functional data. For that matter, this\npaper proposes a functional nonlinear learning (FunNoL) method to sufficiently\nrepresent multivariate functional data in a lower-dimensional feature space.\nFurthermore, we merge a classification model for enriching the ability of\nrepresentations in predicting curve labels. Hence, representations from FunNoL\ncan be used for both curve reconstruction and classification. Additionally, we\nhave endowed the proposed model with the ability to address the missing\nobservation problem as well as to further denoise observations. The resulting\nrepresentations are robust to observations that are locally disturbed by\nuncontrollable random noises. We apply the proposed FunNoL method to several\nreal data sets and show that FunNoL can achieve better classifications than\nFPCA, especially in the multivariate functional data setting.

With this motivation, we explore how the measured\nvalues of the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio of Uranus and Neptune can\nconstrain their formation mechanisms. Under the assumption of in-situ\nformation, we investigate three solid accretion modes; a dominant accretion\nmode switches from pebble accretion to drag-enhanced three-body accretion and\nto canonical planetesimal accretion, as the solid radius increases. We consider\na wide radius range of solids that are accreted onto (proto)Neptune-mass\nplanets and compute the resulting accretion rates as a function of both the\nsolid size and the solid surface density. We find that for small-sized solids,\nthe rate becomes high enough to halt concurrent gas accretion, if all the\nsolids have the same size. For large-sized solids, the solid surface density\nneeds to be enhanced to accrete enough amounts of solids within the gas disk\nlifetime. We apply these accretion modes to the formation of Uranus and Neptune\nand show that if the minimum-mass solar nebula model is adopted, solids with\nradius of $\\sim 1$ m to $\\sim 10$ km should have contributed mainly to their\ndeuterium enrichment; a tighter constraint can be derived if the full solid\nsize distribution is determined.

To overcome these issues, we\npresent Leg-UP, a novel attack model based on the Generative Adversarial\nNetwork. Leg-UP learns user behavior patterns from real users in the sampled\n``templates'' and constructs fake user profiles. To simulate real users, the\ngenerator in Leg-UP directly outputs discrete ratings. To enhance attack\ntransferability, the parameters of the generator are optimized by maximizing\nthe attack performance on a surrogate RS model. To improve attack invisibility,\nLeg-UP adopts a discriminator to guide the generator to generate undetectable\nfake user profiles.

Solid-state batteries provide the distinct\nadvantage of outperforming current technology by having a simpler composition,\nbeing easier and cheaper to manufacture, safer and having a higher theoretical\ngravimetric and volumetric energy density. The commercialization of this\ntechnology however, is plagued by its own set of challenges, primarily low\nionic conductivity and interfacial stability of the solid-state electrolyte\nseparating the anode and cathode, a small electrochemical window and sub-par\nmechanical properties. In the last decade considerable progress has been made\nin remedying these issues with garnet-type electrolytes, especially\nLi7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), having emerged the leading contender. This has prompted\nrenewed effects into the field of solid-state ionic's and maximizing the ionic\nconductivity of LLZO by modifying its properties, primarily by means of doping\nwith a varying degree of success.

By reanalyzing its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor\non board the Fermi mission, we find that both time-integrated and time-resolved\nspectra can be fitted well by using a 2SBPL plus blackbody (2SBPL+BB) model in\nthe prompt emission. The bulk Lorentz factors ($\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$) of the\noutflow can be inferred by invoking the observed thermal emission at the\nphotosphere radius within a pure fireball model, and we find out that the\ntemporal evolution of $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light\ncurve. The derived values of $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ are also consistent with the\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$-$L_{\\gamma, \\rm iso}$/$E_{\\gamma, \\rm iso}$ correlations that\nhad been found in other bursts.

The classical\nartificial intelligence algorithms require centralized data collection and\nprocessing which are challenging in realistic intelligent IoT applications due\nto growing data privacy concerns and distributed datasets. Federated Learning\n(FL) has emerged as a distributed privacy-preserving learning framework that\nenables IoT devices to train global model through sharing model parameters.\nHowever, inefficiency due to frequent parameters transmissions significantly\nreduce FL performance. Existing acceleration algorithms consist of two main\ntype including local update considering trade-offs between communication and\ncomputation and parameter compression considering trade-offs between\ncommunication and precision. Jointly considering these two trade-offs and\nadaptively balancing their impacts on convergence have remained unresolved. To\nsolve the problem, this paper proposes a novel efficient adaptive federated\noptimization (EAFO) algorithm to improve efficiency of FL, which minimizes the\nlearning error via jointly considering two variables including local update and\nparameter compression and enables FL to adaptively adjust the two variables and\nbalance trade-offs among computation, communication and precision.

In this work, we reveal a\nsmooth route to connect these two ETH-breaking mechanisms in the Ising chain\nwith transverse and longitudinal fields. Specifically, starting from an initial\nIsing anti-ferromagnetic state, we find that the dynamical system undergoes a\nsmooth non-thermal crossover from QMBS to QI by changing the Ising\ncoupling($J$) and longitudinal field($h$) simultaneously while keeping their\nratio fixed, which corresponds to the Rydberg Hamiltonian with an arbitrary\nnearest-neighbor repulsion. Deviating from this ratio, we further identify a\ncontinuous thermalization trajectory in ($h,J$) plane that is exactly given by\nthe Ising transition line, signifying an intimate relation between\nthermalization and quantum critical point. Finally, we map out a completely\ndifferent dynamical phase diagram starting from an initial ferromagnetic state,\nwhere the thermalization is shown to be equally facilitated by the resonant\nspin-flip at special ratios of $J$ and $h$. By bridging QMBS and QI in Ising\nchains, our results demonstrate the breakdown of ETH in much broader physical\nsettings, which also suggest an alternative way to characterize quantum phase\ntransition via thermalization in non-equilibrium dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 02:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 09:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 03:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

First, we expand the resource theory of randomness (RTR) by\ncalculating the amount of entropy catalytically extractable from a correlated\nor dynamical randomness source. In doing so, we show that no entropy can be\ncatalytically extracted when one cannot implement local projective measurement\non randomness source without altering its state. The RTR, as an archetype of\nthe `concave' resource theory, is complementary to the convex resource theories\nin which the amount of randomness required to erase the resource is a resource\nmeasure. As an application, we prove that quantum operation cannot be hidden in\ncorrelation between two parties without using randomness, which is the\ndynamical generalization of the no-hiding theorem. Second, we study the\nphysical properties of information flow. Popularized quotes like \"information\nis physical\" or \"it from bit\" suggest the matter-like picture of information\nthat can travel with the definite direction while leaving detectable traces on\nits region of departure. To examine the validity of this picture, we focus on\nthat catalysis of randomness models directional flow of information with the\ndistinguished source and recipient. We show that classical information can\nalways spread from its source without altering its source or its surrounding\ncontext, like an immaterial entity, while quantum information cannot. We\nsuggest an approach to formal definition of semantic quantum information and\nclaim that utilizing semantic information is equivalent to using a partially\ndepleted information source. By doing so, we unify the utilization of semantic\nand non-semantic quantum information and conclude that one can always extract\nmore information from an incompletely depleted classical randomness source, but\nit is not possible for quantum randomness sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 03:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

An updated radius-luminosity relationship\nincorporates the flux ratio of optical Fe ii to H$\\beta$ ($\\equiv\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm Fe}$) to correct for a bias in which more highly accreting\nsystems have smaller line-emitting regions than previously realized.

Its efficiency, however, decreases dramatically due to the\nsequential constraint. Although the divide-and-conquer strategy has been\nutilized for efficiency improvement, cluster merging becomes difficult or\ndepends on seriously designed overlap structures. This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to extract the global model for cluster merging and designs a\nparallel SfM solution to achieve efficient and accurate UAV image orientation.\nFirst, based on vocabulary tree retrieval, match pairs are selected to\nconstruct an undirected weighted match graph, whose edge weights are calculated\nby considering both the number and distribution of feature matches. Second, an\nalgorithm, termed weighted connected dominating set (WCDS), is designed to\nachieve the simplification of the match graph and build the global model, which\nincorporates the edge weight in the graph node selection and enables the\nsuccessful reconstruction of the global model. Third, the match graph is\nsimultaneously divided into compact and non-overlapped clusters. After the\nparallel reconstruction, cluster merging is conducted with the aid of common 3D\npoints between the global and cluster models. Finally, by using three UAV\ndatasets that are captured by classical oblique and recent optimized views\nphotogrammetry, the validation of the proposed solution is verified through\ncomprehensive analysis and comparison. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed parallel SfM can achieve 17.4 times efficiency improvement\nand comparative orientation accuracy. In absolute BA, the geo-referencing\naccuracy is approximately 2.0 and 3.0 times the GSD (Ground Sampling Distance)\nvalue in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.

During their mission on Mars,\nPerseverance Rover and Ingenuity collaboratively explore the Martian surface,\nwhere Ingenuity scouts terrain information for rover's safe traversability.\nHence, determining the relative poses between both the platforms is of\nparamount importance for the success of this mission. Driven by this necessity,\nthis work proposes a robust relative localization system based on a fusion of\nneuromorphic vision-based measurements (NVBMs) and inertial measurements.

To circumvent this limitation, high frequency\nactive landmarks are inserted in the scene to guarantee consistent event\nfiring. These landmarks are adopted as salient features to facilitate relative\nlocalization. A novel event-based landmark identification algorithm using\nGaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is developed for matching the landmarks\ncorrespondences formulating our NVBMs. The NVBMs are fused with inertial\nmeasurements in proposed state estimators, landmark tracking Kalman filter\n(LTKF) and translation decoupled Kalman filter (TDKF) for landmark tracking and\nrelative localization, respectively.

In this paper, we aim to study the dynamical\nevolution of asteroid systems the moment after fission. The initial condition\nis modelled as a contact binary, similar to that of Boldrin et al. (2016). Both\nbodies are modelled as ellipsoids, and the secondary is given an initial\nrotation angle about its body-fixed $y$-axis. Moreover, we consider six\ndifferent cases, three where the density of the secondary varies, and three\nwhere we vary its shape. The simulations consider 45 different initial tilt\nangles of the secondary, each with 37 different mass ratios. We start the\ndynamical simulations at the moment the contact binary reaches a spin fission\nlimit, and our model ensures that the closest distance between the surfaces of\nthe two bodies is always kept at 1 cm. The forces, torques and gravitational\npotential between the two bodies are modelled using a newly developed surface\nintegration scheme, giving exact results for two ellipsoids. We find that more\nthan 80% of the simulations end with the two bodies impacting, and collisions\nbetween the bodies are more common when the density of the secondary is lower,\nor when it becomes more elongated. When comparing with data on asteroid pairs\nfrom Pravec et al. (2019) we find that variations in density and shape of the\nsecondary can account for some of the spread seen in the rotation period for\nobserved pairs. Furthermore, the secondary may also reach a spin limit for\nsurface disruption, creating a ternary/multiple system. We find that secondary\nfission typically occurs within the first five hours after the contact binary\nseparates, and is more common when the secondary is less dense or more\nelongated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 09:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

However, this may not\nalways be the most appropriate approach as the regime assignment may be\naffected by small deviations in the distance to the regimes due to noise. To\nmitigate this we develop a sequential probabilistic regime assignment using\nBayes Theorem, which can be applied to previously defined regimes and\nimplemented in real time as new data become available. Bayes Theorem tells us\nthat the probability of being in a regime given the data can be determined by\ncombining climatological likelihood with prior information. The regime\nprobabilities at time $t$ can be used to inform the prior probabilities at time\n$t+1$, which are then used to sequentially update the regime probabilities. We\napply this approach to both reanalysis data and a seasonal hindcast ensemble\nincorporating knowledge of the transition probabilities between regimes.\nFurthermore, making use of the signal present within the ensemble to better\ninform the prior probabilities allows for identifying more pronounced\ninterannual variability.

In this context, the popular history-variable approach suffers from\nvariationally inconsistency and non-quantifiable nature of the error\nintroduced. A better alternative, the penalisation approach, has the potential\nto render the stiffness matrix ill-conditioned.

A popular direction of research is to\nincorporate margins in well-established losses in order to enforce extra\nintra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which, however, were\ndeveloped through heuristic means, as opposed to rigorous mathematical\nprinciples. In this work, we attempt to address this limitation by formulating\nthe principled optimization objective as learning towards the largest margins.\nSpecifically, we firstly define the class margin as the measure of inter-class\nseparability, and the sample margin as the measure of intra-class compactness.\nAccordingly, to encourage discriminative representation of features, the loss\nfunction should promote the largest possible margins for both classes and\nsamples. Furthermore, we derive a generalized margin softmax loss to draw\ngeneral conclusions for the existing margin-based losses. Not only does this\nprincipled framework offer new perspectives to understand and interpret\nexisting margin-based losses, but it also provides new insights that can guide\nthe design of new tools, including sample margin regularization and largest\nmargin softmax loss for the class-balanced case, and zero-centroid\nregularization for the class-imbalanced case. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our strategy on a variety of tasks, including visual\nclassification, imbalanced classification, person re-identification, and face\nverification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 10:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

The competition addresses the problem of\nVision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which\nrequires an agent to follow step-by-step natural language instructions to reach\na target. We present a modular plan-and-control approach for the task. Our\nmodel consists of three modules: the candidate waypoints predictor (CWP), the\nhistory enhanced planner and the tryout controller. In each decision loop, CWP\nfirst predicts a set of candidate waypoints based on depth observations from\nmultiple views. It can reduce the complexity of the action space and facilitate\nplanning. Then, a history-enhanced planner is adopted to select one of the\ncandidate waypoints as the subgoal. The planner additionally encodes historical\nmemory to track the navigation progress, which is especially effective for\nlong-horizon navigation. Finally, we propose a non-parametric heuristic\ncontroller named tryout to execute low-level actions to reach the planned\nsubgoal. It is based on the trial-and-error mechanism which can help the agent\nto avoid obstacles and escape from getting stuck. All three modules work\nhierarchically until the agent stops. We further take several recent advances\nof Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to improve the performance such as\npretraining based on large-scale synthetic in-domain dataset, environment-level\ndata augmentation and snapshot model ensemble.

Estimating disturbances allows a soft robot to\nperform desirable force control. Even in the case of rigid manipulators, force\nestimation at the end-effector is seen as a non-trivial problem. And indeed,\nother current approaches to address this challenge have shortcomings that\nprevent their general application. They are often based on simplified soft\ndynamic models, such as the ones relying on a piece-wise constant curvature\n(PCC) approximation or matched rigid-body models that do not represent enough\ndetails of the problem. Thus, the applications needed for complex human-robot\ninteraction can not be built. Finite element methods (FEM) allow for\npredictions of soft robot dynamics in a more generic fashion. Here, using the\nsoft robot modeling capabilities of the framework SOFA, we build a detailed FEM\nmodel of a multi-segment soft continuum robotic arm composed of compliant\ndeformable materials and fiber-reinforced pressurized actuation chambers with a\nmodel for sensors that provide orientation output. This model is used to\nestablish a state observer for the manipulator. Model parameters were\ncalibrated to match imperfections of the manual fabrication process using\nphysical experiments. We then solve a quadratic programming inverse dynamics\nproblem to compute the components of external force that explain the pose\nerror. Our experiments show an average force estimation error of around 1.2%.\nAs the methods proposed are generic, these results are encouraging for the task\nof building soft robots exhibiting complex, reactive, sensor-based behavior\nthat can be deployed in human-centered environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 11:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

We examined how an educational game designed on\nthe basis of intrinsic integration theory, based on a strong alignment between\ngame and learning goals, supports the learning of Newtonian mechanics. This\nstudy applied a mixed methods approach. An pre and posttest design was used to\nexamine possible learning and transfer effects fostered by playing the\neducational game, Newtons Race. To examine how players played the game, log\ndata of each player was digitally recorded during gameplay. Our findings\ndemonstrated a significant positive learning effect of Newtons Race.

To this end, six\ncommutative subgroups within the SL(3) group are composed to form a homography.\nFor each subgroup, a warping function is proposed to bridge the Lie algebra\nstructure to its corresponding parameters in homography. By taking advantage of\nthe warped convolution, homography learning is formulated into several simple\npseudo-translation regressions. By walking along the Lie topology, our proposed\nWCN is able to learn the features that are invariant to homography. Moreover,\nit can be easily plugged into other popular CNN-based methods.

However, simulation of quantum dynamics via\nTrotter-Suzuki decomposition requires huge number of steps, each of which\naccesses the state vector, and hence the simulation time becomes impractically\nlong.

Invoking an internal collision framework to estimate relevant shock\ninitial conditions, we use an RMS model to generate synthetic photospheric\nspectra. The spectra are then fitted with a standard cutoff power-law (CPL)\nfunction to compare with corresponding GRB catalogues. We find mean values and\nstandard deviations for the low-energy index and the peak energy as\n$\\langle\\alpha_{\\rm cpl}\\rangle = -0.76\\pm 0.227$ and $\\langle\\log(E_{\\rm\npeak}/{\\rm keV})\\rangle = 2.42\\pm 0.408$, respectively.

Common approaches classify the ties as weak and strong ties\nbased on the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three\nnodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, there are strong ties between $A$ and $B$, as well as\n$A$ and $C$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $B$ and $C$. So\nfar, most works discuss the STC in static networks. However, modern large-scale\nsocial networks are usually highly dynamic, providing user contacts and\ncommunications as streams of edge updates. Temporal networks capture these\ndynamics. To apply the STC to temporal networks, we first generalize the STC\nand introduce a weighted version such that empirical a priori knowledge given\nin the form of edge weights is respected by the STC. The weighted STC is hard\nto compute, and our main contribution is an efficient 2-approximative streaming\nalgorithm for the weighted STC in temporal networks. As a technical\ncontribution, we introduce a fully dynamic 2-approximation for the minimum\nweight vertex cover problem, which is a crucial component of our streaming\nalgorithm. Our evaluation shows that the weighted STC leads to solutions that\ncapture the a priori knowledge given by the edge weights better than the\nnon-weighted STC.

Therefore,\nwe propose an approach for reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable\nenvironments. While assuming that the environment behaves like a partially\nobservable Markov decision process with known discrete actions, we assume no\nknowledge about its structure or transition probabilities.\n  Our approach combines Q-learning with IoAlergia, a method for learning Markov\ndecision processes (MDP). By learning MDP models of the environment from\nepisodes of the RL agent, we enable RL in partially observable domains without\nexplicit, additional memory to track previous interactions for dealing with\nambiguities stemming from partial observability. We instead provide RL with\nadditional observations in the form of abstract environment states by\nsimulating new experiences on learned environment models to track the explored\nstates. In our evaluation, we report on the validity of our approach and its\npromising performance in comparison to six state-of-the-art deep RL techniques\nwith recurrent neural networks and fixed memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Considering the growing concern of data\nprivacy, federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted to train STLF models\nfor utility companies (UCs) in recent research. Inspiringly, in wholesale\nmarkets, as it is not realistic for power plants (PPs) to access UCs' data\ndirectly, FL is definitely a feasible solution of obtaining an accurate STLF\nmodel for PPs. However, due to FL's distributed nature and intense competition\namong UCs, defects increasingly occur and lead to poor performance of the STLF\nmodel, indicating that simply adopting FL is not enough. In this paper, we\npropose a DRL-assisted FL approach, DEfect-AwaRe federated soft actor-critic\n(DearFSAC), to robustly train an accurate STLF model for PPs to forecast\nprecise short-term utility electricity demand. Firstly. we design a STLF model\nbased on long short-term memory (LSTM) using just historical load data and time\ndata. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of defects occurrence, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted to assist FL by alleviating\nmodel degradation caused by defects. In addition, for faster convergence of FL\ntraining, an auto-encoder is designed for both dimension reduction and quality\nevaluation of uploaded models. In the simulations, we validate our approach on\nreal data of Helsinki's UCs in 2019. The results show that DearFSAC outperforms\nall the other approaches no matter if defects occur or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 14:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

A proposed model is built based on the training data, and\nthen the performance of the model is assessed using test data. Usually, the\ndata is split randomly into a training and a test set on an ad hoc basis. This\napproach, pivoted on random splitting, works well but more often than not, it\nfails to gauge the generalizing capability of the model with respect to\nperturbations in the input of training and test data. Experimentally, this\nsensitive aspect of randomness in the input data is realized when a new\niteration of a fixed pipeline, from model building to training and testing, is\nexecuted, and an overly optimistic performance estimate is reported. Since the\nconsistency in a model's performance predominantly depends on the data\nsplitting, any conclusions on the robustness of the model are unreliable in\nsuch a scenario. We propose a diagnostic approach to quantitatively assess the\nquality of a given split in terms of its true randomness, and provide a basis\nfor inferring model insensitivity towards the input data.

The combination of beam search and tabular\nprobabilistic-based heuristics has led to a large number of proposals and\nachievements in algorithms for solving the LCS problem. In this work, we\nintroduce a closed-form equation of the probabilistic table calculation for the\nfirst time. Moreover, we present other corresponding forms of the closed-form\nequation and prove all of them. The closed-form equation opens new ways for\nanalysis and further approximations.

Other state-of-the-art approaches that aim to support customers find\nwhat fits them online mostly require a high level of customer engagement and\nprivacy-sensitive data (such as height, weight, age, gender, belly shape,\netc.), or alternatively need images of customers' bodies in tight clothing.\nThey also often lack the ability to produce fit and shape aware visual guidance\nat scale, coming up short by simply advising which size to order that would\nbest match a customer's physical body attributes, without providing any\ninformation on how the garment may fit and look.

BurstCCN\nrelies on burst multiplexing via connection-type-specific STP to propagate\nbackprop-like error signals within deep cortical networks. These error signals\nare encoded at distal dendrites and induce burst-dependent plasticity as a\nresult of excitatory-inhibitory top-down inputs. First, we demonstrate that our\nmodel can effectively backpropagate errors through multiple layers using a\nsingle-phase learning process.

However, in most experimental\nscenarios, the total amount of particles in BEC is determined either by the\ninitial conditions or by the balance between dissipation and pumping. As a\nresult, BEC may possess the thermal equilibrium but almost never the chemical\nequilibrium. In addition, many experimentally achievable BECs are non-ideal due\nto interaction between particles. In the recent work\n[10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.065301], it has been shown that invariant subspaces in\nthe system Hilbert space appear in non-equilibrium BEC in the fast\nthermalization limit. In each of these subspaces, Gibbs distribution is\nestablished with a certain number of particles that makes it possible to\ninvestigate properties of non-ideal non-equilibrium BEC independently in each\ninvariant subspace. In this work, we analyze the BEC stability due to change in\ndispersion curve caused by non-ideal interactions in BEC. Generally, non-ideal\ninteractions lead to the redshift or blueshift of the dispertion curve and to\nthe change in the effective mass of the particles. We show that the redshift of\nthe dispersion curve can lead to the negative compressibility of BEC, whereas\nthe change in the effective mass always makes BEC more stable. We find the\nexplicit condition for the particle density in BEC, at which the negative\ncompressibility appears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 15:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Besides\nthe steady growth of a crack at a prescribed crack velocity, a fracture\ncriterion based on stress intensity factors (SIF) has been implemented. This is\nthe first time, that crack propagation with a mechanically relevant criterion\nis regarded in the context of LBMs. Numerical results are examined to validate\nthe proposed method. The concepts of crack propagation introduced here are not\nlimited to mode III cracks or the simplified deformation assumption of\nantiplane shear. By introducing a rather simple processing step into the\nexisting LBM at the level of individual lattice sites, the overall performance\nof the LBM is maintained. Our findings underline the validity of the LBM as a\nnumerical tool to simulate solids in general as well as dynamic fractures in\nparticular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 10:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 08:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Under normal\ncircumstances this is not issue if there is enough buffer time before\nimplementation of the schedule (e.g. at night for the next day). However, in\ncase of unexpected disruptions such as delayed part deliveries or defectively\nmanufactured goods, the planned schedule may become invalid and swift\nreplanning becomes necessary. Such immediate replanning is unsuited for\nexisting optimal planners due to the computational requirements. This paper\nproposes a novel solution that can effectively and efficiently perform\nreplanning in case of different types of disruptions using an existing plan.\nThe approach is based on the idea to adhere to the existing schedule as much as\npossible, adapting it based on limited local changes. For that purpose an\nagent-based scheduling mechanism has been devised, in which agents represent\nmaterials and production sites and use local optimization techniques and\nnegotiations to generate an adapted (sufficient, but non-optimal) schedule. The\napproach has been evaluated using real production data from Huawei, showing\nthat efficient schedules are produced in short time. The system has been\nimplemented as proof of concept and is currently reimplemented and transferred\nto a production system based on the Jadex agent platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 10:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The\nfeature is to consider one neuron and give it a multivariable Xj (j = 1, 2,.)\nand its function value F(Xj) as data to the input layer.

The described approach is applicable for both CAE-based\ncircuits as well as raw circuits yielded by an image understanding pipeline.\nThe viability of the approach is demonstrated by application to an existing set\nof circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 13:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}
