When we\nwalk into a cathedral, the reverberations as much as appearance inform us of\nthe sanctuary's wide open space. Similarly, as an object moves around us, we\nexpect the sound emitted to also exhibit this movement. While recent advances\nin learned implicit functions have led to increasingly higher quality\nrepresentations of the visual world, there have not been commensurate advances\nin learning spatial auditory representations. To address this gap, we introduce\nNeural Acoustic Fields (NAFs), an implicit representation that captures how\nsounds propagate in a physical scene. By modeling acoustic propagation in a\nscene as a linear time-invariant system, NAFs learn to continuously map all\nemitter and listener location pairs to a neural impulse response function that\ncan then be applied to arbitrary sounds. We demonstrate that the continuous\nnature of NAFs enables us to render spatial acoustics for a listener at an\narbitrary location, and can predict sound propagation at novel locations. We\nfurther show that the representation learned by NAFs can help improve visual\nlearning with sparse views. Finally, we show that a representation informative\nof scene structure emerges during the learning of NAFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 17:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 02:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We have used a\nsemi-atomistic computational approach and examined sodium, calcium and aluminum\ncounterions confined with water between charged surfaces representative of clay\nmaterials, to show that ion-water structuring in nanoscale confinement is at\nthe origin of surface forces between clay particles which are intrinsically\nion-specific. When charged surfaces strongly confine ions and water, the\namplitude and oscillations of the net pressure naturally emerge from the\ninterplay of electrostatics and steric effects, which can not be captured by\nexisting theories. Increasing confinement and surface charge densities promote\nion-water structures that increasingly deviate from the ions' bulk hydration\nshells, being strongly anisotropic and persistent, and self-organizing into\noptimized, nearly solid-like assemblies where hardly any free water is left. In\nthese conditions, strongly attractive interactions can prevail between charged\nsurfaces, due to the dramatically reduced dielectric screening of water and the\nhighly organized water-ion structures.

Current work is almost all based on machine models\ntrained via big data input. Large datasets of examples of code and summaries of\nthat code are used to train an e.g. encoder-decoder neural model. Then the\noutput predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference\nsummaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is\ncompared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a\nreference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or\nROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence\nhave the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that\ncalculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers.\nIn this paper, we conduct an experiment to measure the degree to which various\nword overlap metrics correlate to human-rated similarity of predicted and\nreference summaries. We evaluate alternatives based on current work in semantic\nsimilarity metrics and propose recommendations for evaluation of source code\nsummarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 16:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The key idea is to create index\nadaptively and incrementally as a side-product of query processing. As a\nresult, the database table is indexed partially depending on the query\nworkload. This paper faces a problem of adaptive merging for phase change\nmemory (PCM). The most important features of this memory type are: limited\nwrite endurance and high write latency. As a consequence, adaptive merging\nshould be investigated from the scratch. We solve this problem in two steps.\nFirst, we apply several PCM optimization techniques to the traditional adaptive\nmerging approach. We prove that the proposed method (eAM) outperforms a\ntraditional approach by 60%. After that, we invent the framework for adaptive\nmerging (PAM) and a new PCM-optimized index. It further improves the system\nperformance by 20% for databases where search queries interleave with data\nmodifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 17:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 08:40:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 12:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Such a study was initiated in\nBasu-Ganguly-Hammond, where the difference profile i.e., the difference of\npassage times from two fixed points (say $(\\pm 1,0)$), was considered.

A prime example of\nfunctional activity pattern is hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory\nconsolidation. The switchings between replay events and a low-activity state in\nneural recordings suggests metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability\nhas been attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a\nconcise mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is\nbottom-up: it is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks\nof Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As\nsuch, noise is explicitly linked to spike noise and network size, and fatigue\nis explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesosocpic model, we\nfirst consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal\ncoarse-graining approach of Gillespie (\"chemical Langevin equation\"), which can\nbe naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model.

Since these variables cannot be directly measured, data are\nusually collected in the form of 24-hour recalls of the intakes. The problem of\nestimating the density of the latent long-term average intakes from their\nobserved but error contaminated recalls then becomes a problem of multivariate\ndeconvolution of densities. The underlying densities could potentially vary\nwith the subjects' demographic characteristics such as sex, ethnicity, age,\netc. The problem of density deconvolution in the presence of associated\nprecisely measured covariates has, however, never been considered before, not\neven in the univariate setting. We present a flexible Bayesian semiparametric\napproach to covariate informed multivariate deconvolution. Building on recent\nadvances in copula deconvolution and conditional tensor factorization\ntechniques, our proposed method not only allows the joint and the marginal\ndensities to vary flexibly with the associated predictors but also allows\nautomatic selection of the most influential predictors. Importantly, the method\nalso allows the density of interest and the density of the measurement errors\nto vary with potentially different sets of predictors. We design Markov chain\nMonte Carlo algorithms that enable efficient posterior inference, appropriately\naccommodating uncertainty in all aspects of our analysis. The empirical\nefficacy of the proposed method is illustrated through simulation experiments.\nIts practical utility is demonstrated in the afore-described nutritional\nepidemiology applications in estimating covariate-adjusted long term intakes of\ndifferent dietary components.

Near the Fermi level, the dominant\nstates are mainly contributed by the Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals highly\nhybridized with the O $2p$ orbitals in the nonmagnetic phase, leading to an\n\"effective\" single-orbital low-energy model.

Thus, it is challenging to apply such models to\nlong movie understanding tasks, which typically require sophisticated\nlong-range temporal reasoning. The recently introduced video transformers\npartially address this issue by using long-range temporal self-attention.\nHowever, due to the quadratic cost of self-attention, such models are often\ncostly and impractical to use. Instead, we propose ViS4mer, an efficient\nlong-range video model that combines the strengths of self-attention and the\nrecently introduced structured state-space sequence (S4) layer. Our model uses\na standard Transformer encoder for short-range spatiotemporal feature\nextraction, and a multi-scale temporal S4 decoder for subsequent long-range\ntemporal reasoning. By progressively reducing the spatiotemporal feature\nresolution and channel dimension at each decoder layer, ViS4mer learns complex\nlong-range spatiotemporal dependencies in a video. Furthermore, ViS4mer is\n$2.63\\times$ faster and requires $8\\times$ less GPU memory than the\ncorresponding pure self-attention-based model. Additionally, ViS4mer achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in $6$ out of $9$ long-form movie video classification\ntasks on the Long Video Understanding (LVU) benchmark.

During the setup phase, a straightforward calibration\nprocedure, leveraging a scale-aware SLAM algorithm available even on consumer\nsmartphones, allows us to address the scale ambiguity affecting single image\ndepth estimation. We validate our approach through indoor and outdoor images\nemploying a calibrated LiDAR + RGB camera asset. Experimental results highlight\nthat our proposal enables sufficiently reliable estimation of the\ninter-personal distance to monitor social distancing effectively. This fact\nconfirms that despite its intrinsic ambiguity, if appropriately driven single\nimage depth estimation can be a viable alternative to other depth perception\ntechniques, more expensive and not always feasible in practical applications.\nOur evaluation also highlights that our framework can run reasonably fast and\ncomparably to competitors, even on pure CPU systems.

Different quantum algorithms have been proposed to improve a wide\nspectrum of machine learning tasks.

This will\npose serious problems for future quantum machine learning applications in\nsafety and security-critical scenarios. Here, we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting\nqubits.

In this Letter, we show that a quantum effect is\nimportant if the Higgs field mixes with another singlet scalar field whose\ndecay rate is larger than the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates.\nThis effect may be interpreted as the quantum Zeno effect. In either the\nquantum mechanics or the quantum field theory, we show that the resulting\npropagating mode is not the eigenstate of the mass matrix, but it is\napproximately the eigenstate of the interaction. As a consequence, the\ndecoupling of the mixing effect happens at the infinity limit of the decay\nwidth of the exotic scalar even if the na\\\"{i}ve mixing parameter is not small.\nWith a finite decay width of the exotic scalar, we derive the effective mass of\nthe propagating mode in the SM sector, its decay rate, and the couplings at the\n1-loop level. It turns out that the mixed mass eigenstates can mimic the\ndiscovered 125 GeV Higgs boson. This fuzzy Higgs boson can be obtained in a\nsimple perturbative renormalizable model. It is consistent with the 125 GeV SM\nHiggs boson when the mass difference is smaller than ${\\cal O}(0.1)$GeV (${\\cal\nO}(1)$GeV) for ${\\cal O}(1)$ (${\\cal O}(0.01)$) mixing. We argue the possible\nnatural scenario for the tiny mass splitting and the possibility that the upper\nbound of the mass difference is larger for a strongly-coupled singlet sector.\nTo probe the fuzzy Higgs boson scenario, it is difficult to directly produce\nthe singlet sector particles. Nevertheless, the future Higgs factories may\nprobe this scenario by precisely measuring the Higgs boson invisible decay rate\nand the deviation of the Higgs coupling. Applications of the mechanism are also\nmentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Small molecules such as benzene resonate among a few bond\narrangements. In contrast, a large system that stretches over a macroscopic\nlattice may resonate among an extensive number of configurations. This is\nanalogous to a quantum spin liquid as described by Anderson's resonating\nvalence bond (RVB) picture. In this article, we study the intermediate case of\nsomewhat large molecules, the C$_{20}$ and C$_{60}$ fullerenes. We build a\nminimal description in terms of quantum dimer models, allowing for local\nresonance processes and repulsion between proximate $\\pi$-bonds. This allows us\nto characterize ground-states, e.g., with C$_{60}$ forming a superposition of\n5828 dimer covers. Despite the large number of contributing dimer covers, the\nground state shows strong dimer-dimer correlations. Going beyond the ground\nstate, the full spectrum of C$_{60}$ shows many interesting features. Its\nHilbert space is bipartite, leading to spectral reflection symmetry. It has a\nlarge number of protected zero-energy states. In addition, the spectrum\ncontains many scar-like states, corresponding to localized\ndimer-rearrangement-dynamics. Resonance dynamics in QDMs can manifest in the\nbehaviour of defects, potentially binding defects via an effective attractive\ninteraction. To test this notion, we introduce pairs of vacancies at all\npossible separations. Resonance energy reaches its lowest value when the\nvacancies are closest to one another. This suggests confinement of monomers,\nalbeit within a finite cluster.

Varying\nthe spatial distribution of multiple materials gives rise to many interesting\nand potentially unique combinations of anisotropic elastic properties. While\nthe availability of a design approach to cover a large portion of all possible\ncombinations of elastic properties is interesting in itself, it is even more\nimportant to find the extremely rare designs that lead to highly unusual\ncombinations of material properties (e.g., double-auxeticity and high elastic\nmoduli). Here, we used a random distribution of a hard phase and a soft phase\nwithin a regular lattice to study the resulting anisotropic mechanical\nproperties of the network in general and the abovementioned rare designs in\nparticular. The primary challenge to take up concerns the huge number of design\nparameters and the extreme rarity of such designs.

An EV can be charged at home,\nat charging stations near highway ramps, or on parking lots next to office\nbuildings, shops, airports, among other locations. Charging time and duration\ncan be fixed and continuous or flexible and intermittent. EV user preferences\nof charging services depend on many factors (e.g., charging prices, choice of\ndestinations), causing EV charging patterns to shift in real-time. Hence, there\nis a need for a highly flexible EV charging network to support the rapid\nadoption of the technology. This study presents a dynamic scheduling scheme for\nEV charging facilities considering uncertainties in charging demand, charger\navailability, and charging rate.

Many problems which were\nseverely limited using classical solutions are now seeing unprecedented\nsuccess. The rapid proliferation of deep learning methods has led to a sharp\nincrease in their use in consumer and embedded applications. One consequence of\nconsumer and embedded applications is lossy multimedia compression which is\nrequired to engineer the efficient storage and transmission of data in these\nreal-world scenarios. As such, there has been increased interest in a deep\nlearning solution for multimedia compression which would allow for higher\ncompression ratios and increased visual quality.\n  The deep learning approach to multimedia compression, so called Learned\nMultimedia Compression, involves computing a compressed representation of an\nimage or video using a deep network for the encoder and the decoder.

However, there is no fingerprinting scheme aiming at achieving\nliability guarantees when sharing genomic databases. Thus, we are motivated to\nfill in this gap by devising a vanilla fingerprinting scheme specifically for\ngenomic databases. Moreover, since malicious genomic database recipients may\ncompromise the embedded fingerprint by launching effective correlation attacks\nwhich leverage the intrinsic correlations among genomic data (e.g., Mendel's\nlaw and linkage disequilibrium), we also augment the vanilla scheme by\ndeveloping mitigation techniques to achieve robust fingerprinting of genomic\ndatabases against correlation attacks.\n  We first show that correlation attacks against fingerprinting schemes for\ngenomic databases are very powerful. In particular, the correlation attacks can\ndistort more than half of the fingerprint bits by causing a small utility loss\n(e.g.,database accuracy and consistency of SNP-phenotype associations measured\nvia p-values). Next, we experimentally show that the correlation attacks can be\neffectively mitigated by our proposed mitigation techniques.

Towards improving the efficiency of such primitives, a\nnumber of new block ciphers and hash functions over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ were\nproposed. These new primitives also showed that following alternative design\nstrategies to the classical Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) and Feistel\nNetworks leads to more efficient cipher and hash function designs over\n$\\mathbb{F}_p$ specifically for large odd primes $p$.\n  In view of these efforts, in this work we build an \\emph{algebraic framework}\nthat allows the systematic exploration of viable and efficient design\nstrategies for constructing symmetric-key (iterative) permutations over\n$\\mathbb{F}_p$. We first identify iterative polynomial dynamical systems over\nfinite fields as the central building block of almost all block cipher design\nstrategies. We propose a generalized triangular polynomial dynamical system\n(GTDS), and based on the GTDS we provide a generic definition of an iterative\n(keyed) permutation over $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$.\n  Our GTDS-based generic definition is able to describe the three most\nwell-known design strategies, namely SPNs, Feistel networks and Lai--Massey.\nConsequently, the block ciphers that are constructed following these design\nstrategies can also be instantiated from our generic definition. Moreover, we\nfind that the recently proposed \\texttt{Griffin} design, which neither follows\nthe Feistel nor the SPN design, can be described using the generic GTDS-based\ndefinition. We also show that a new generalized Lai--Massey construction can be\ninstantiated from the GTDS-based definition.\n  We further provide generic analysis of the GTDS including an upper bound on\nthe differential uniformity and the correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 18:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 08:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2022 12:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 09:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 28 May 2023 09:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

However, it can\ntake a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to\nprovide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a\nsignificant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness\nand equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative\njudgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law\nof comparative judgment (LCJ). This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as\npossible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is\nhighly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers.\nAlternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can\nincrease bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an\nassessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that\nCJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more\ntraditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be\ncollected.\n  In this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating\nplayers in zero-sum games such as chess. We experimented on a large-scale\nTwitter dataset on the topic of a recent major UK political event (\"Brexit\",\nthe UK's political exit from the European Union) to ask users which tweet they\nfound funnier between a pair selected from ten tweets.

With a goal of restoring electric service in the\nshortest time, the core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the\ngrid into sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for\nblack-start (called sectionalization problem), and then restart all generators\nin each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) as soon as\npossible. Due to the complexity of each problem, the sectionalization and GSS\nproblems are usually solved separately, often resulting in a sub-optimal\nsolution. Our paper develops models and computational methods to solve the two\nproblems simultaneously. We first study the computational complexity of the GSS\nproblem and develop an efficient integer linear programming formulation. We\nthen integrate the GSS problem with the sectionalization problem and develop an\ninteger linear programming formulation for the parallel power system\nrestoration (PPSR) problem to find exact optimal solutions. To solve larger\nsystems, we then develop bounding approaches that find good upper and lower\nbounds efficiently. Finally, to address computational challenges for very large\npower grids, we develop a randomized approach to find a high-quality feasible\nsolution quickly.

PURPOSE: To introduce egs_mird, a new Monte Carlo\napplication built in EGSnrc which allows users to model full patient tissue and\ndensity (using clinical CT images) and radionuclide distribution (using\nclinical PET images) for fast and detailed TRT dose calculation. METHODS: The\nnovel application egs_mird is introduced, including its structure and variation\nreduction approaches. A new egs++ source class egs_internal_source and a\nmodified version of egs_radionuclide_source are described. The new code is\ncompared to other MC calculations of S-value kernels, along with\nself-validation using the electron Fano test. Full patient prostate 177Lu TRT\ncancer treatment simulations are performed using a single set of patient DICOM\nCT and [18F]-DCFPyL PET data. RESULTS: Good agreement is found between S-value\nkernels calculated using egs_mird and those found in the literature. The Fano\ntest is satisfied to 0.1%.

For the 70\\% subsample and with best\nparameters, $3680\\pm 370$ $K^+K^-$ pairs was found to be compared to $3900\\pm\n410$ $K^+K^-$ extracted by means of the Coulomb model. Knowing the efficiency\nof the TOF cut for background suppression, the total number of detected\n$K^+K^-$ pairs was evaluated to be around $40000\\pm 10\\%$, which agrees with\nthe result from the 30\\% subsample. The $K^+K^-$ pair number in the 50\\%\nsubsample differs from the two other values by about three standard deviations,\nconfirming -- as discussed in the paper -- that experimental data in this\nsubsample is less reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 21:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Hall, Leung and Li (Discrete\nApplied Mathematics 2016) proposed a shared processing multitasking scheduling\nmodel which allows a team to continue to work on the primary tasks while\nprocessing the routinely scheduled activities as they occur. The processing\nsharing is achieved by allocating a fraction of the processing capacity to\nroutine jobs and the remaining fraction, which we denote as sharing ratio, to\nthe primary jobs.\n  In this paper, we generalize this model to parallel machines and allow the\nfraction of the processing capacity assigned to routine jobs to vary from one\nto another. The objectives are minimizing makespan and minimizing the total\ncompletion time. We show that for both objectives, there is no polynomial time\napproximation algorithm unless P=NP if the sharing ratios are arbitrary for all\nmachines. Then we consider the problems where the sharing ratios on some\nmachines have a constant lower bound. For each objective, we analyze the\nperformance of the classical scheduling algorithms and their variations and\nthen develop a polynomial time approximation scheme when the number of machines\nis a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 21:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

State-of-the-art methods in predicting pedestrian crossing\nintention often rely on multiple streams of information as inputs, each of\nwhich requires massive computational resources and heavy network architectures\nto generate. However, such reliance limits the practical application of the\nsystems. In this paper, driven the the real-world demands of pedestrian\ncrossing intention prediction models with both high efficiency and accuracy, we\nintroduce a network with only frames of pedestrians as the input. Every\ncomponent in the introduced network is driven by the goal of light weight.\nSpecifically, we reduce the multi-source input dependency and employ light\nneural networks that are tailored for mobile devices. These smaller neural\nnetworks can fit into computer memory and can be transmitted over a computer\nnetwork more easily, thus making them more suitable for real-life deployment\nand real-time prediction. To compensate the removal of the multi-source input,\nwe enhance the network effectiveness by adopting a multi-task learning\ntraining, named \"side task learning\", to include multiple auxiliary tasks to\njointly learn the feature extractor for improved robustness. Each head handles\na specific task that potentially shares knowledge with other heads. In the\nmeantime, the feature extractor is shared across all tasks to ensure the\nsharing of basic knowledge across all layers. The light weight but high\nefficiency characteristics of our model endow it the potential of being\ndeployed on vehicle-based systems. Experiments validate that our model\nconsistently delivers outstanding performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 21:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

In many\nsettings including the Dirichlet problem, it is easy to show that the resulting\nsolution error is proportional to the formal consistency error of the scheme.\nWe make the surprising observation that this need not be true for PDEs posed on\ncompact manifolds without boundary. We propose a particular class of\napproximation schemes built around an underlying monotone scheme with\nconsistency error $O(h^\\alpha)$. By carefully constructing barrier functions,\nwe prove that the solution error is bounded by $O(h^{\\alpha/(d+1)})$ in\ndimension $d$.

Using these error bounds, we further\ndesign a family of provably convergent approximations to the solution gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 23:47:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 14:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

All\nsimulated monatomic liquids exhibit similar structural characteristics and\ntemperature evolution. However, the degree varies significantly in different\nliquids. It is found that the atomic structures in liquid Cu, Ta, and Fe are\nquite similar. However, liquid Ta exhibits more ordered and more densely packed\nstructure features, with more populated icosahedral-like atomic ordering and\nfive-fold HA indexes, less Voronoi entropy, and more regular tetrahedral\nconfigurations. Moreover, the increase of crystal-like clusters in liquid Ta\nslows down with decreasing temperature, and the icosahedral-like clusters\nincrease more quickly, exceeding crystal-like ones, in contrast to other\nliquids. On the contrary, the atomic structures of liquid Al and Zr are more\nsimilar, much more disordered and more loosely packed.

A long cylindrical solenoid lies normally\nthrough the inner radius of a 2D metallic Corbino disk. The current $I_S$\nsurrounding the solenoid produces an azimuthal magnetic vector potential but no\nmagnetic field in the disk. In addition, a radial electric field is generated\nacross the disk by imposing either (a) a potential difference $\\Delta v$ or (b)\na radial charge current ${\\bm I}$ across its inner and outer radii.

This paradigm\nshift enables critical and time-sensitive analytic intelligence to be acquired\nin a timely manner on-board the satellite itself. However, at present, the\non-board processing of multi-spectral satellite images is limited to\nclassification and segmentation tasks. Extending this processing to its next\nlogical level, in this paper we propose a lightweight pipeline for on-board\npanoptic segmentation of multi-spectral satellite images. Panoptic segmentation\noffers major economic and environmental insights, ranging from yield estimation\nfrom agricultural lands to intelligence for complex military applications.\nNevertheless, the on-board intelligence extraction raises several challenges\ndue to the loss of temporal observations and the need to generate predictions\nfrom a single image sample.

Traditionally, this\nsolution is usually obtained by directly solving the acoustic Helmholtz\nequation using a finite difference or finite element algorithm. Solving the\nthree-dimensional Helmholtz equation directly is computationally expensive. For\nquasi-three-dimensional problems, the Helmholtz equation can be processed by\nthe integral transformation approach, which can greatly reduce the\ncomputational cost. In this paper, a numerical algorithm for a\nquasi-three-dimensional sound field that combines an integral transformation\ntechnique, stepwise coupled modes and a spectral method is designed. The\nquasi-three-dimensional problem is transformed into a two-dimensional problem\nusing an integral transformation strategy. A stepwise approximation is then\nused to discretize the range dependence of the two-dimensional problem; this\napproximation is essentially a physical discretization that further reduces the\nrange-dependent two-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem. Finally,\nthe Chebyshev--Tau spectral method is employed to accurately solve the\none-dimensional problem.

To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning based\nsemi-fragile watermarking technique that allows media authentication by\nverifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. Instead of\nidentifying and detecting fake media using visual artifacts, we propose to\nproactively embed a semi-fragile watermark into a real image so that we can\nprove its authenticity when needed.

Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the\nmechanism must be subadditive implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed\nthe sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has\nenabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing\nwell-established impossibility results.\n  Our work addresses a main open question from this literature involving the\ndesign of buy-many mechanisms for multiple buyers. Our main result is that a\nsimple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve\nan $O(\\log m)$ approximation to the revenue of any buy-many mechanism when all\nbuyers have unit-demand preferences over $m$ items. This is the best possible\nas it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where\nno simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation. Our result applies in\nfull generality: even though there are many alternative ways buy-many\nmechanisms can be defined for multi-buyer settings, our result captures all of\nthem at the same time. We achieve this by directly competing with a more\npermissive upper-bound on the buy-many revenue, obtained via an ex-ante\nrelaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 03:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

The design of such systems bears high\nrisk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and\nbehavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and\nuncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure\ncontinuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes.\nA modular and SO system architecture complements these processes to facilitate\nIT system adaptation and evolution. This work proposes a method to use and\nextend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous\noptimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing\nneeds and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations\nby assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service\nadaptations at CPS runtime. The method builds on transferring IT DevOps\nprinciples to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates,\nreuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps\nrequirements derived from literature. We use these requirements to propose a\nDT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled\nDevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for\noperation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and\narchitecture-based CPS adaptation.

Although a qualitative description was possible\nby the Curie-Weiss theory it was obvious that a microscopic model was necessary\nto explain the tendency of the elementary magnetons to prefer parallel ordering\nat low temperatures. Such a model was proposed in 1922 by W. Schottky within\nthe old Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum mechanics and claimed to explain the high\nvalues of the Curie temperatures of certain ferromagnets. Based on this idea\nIsing formulated a new model for ferromagnetism in solids. Simultaneously the\nold quantum mechanics was replaced by new concepts of Heisenberg and\nSchr\\\"odinger and the discovery of spin. Thus Schottky's idea was outperformed\nand finally replaced in 1928 by Heisenberg exchange interaction. This led to a\nreformulation of Ising's model by Pauli at the Solvay conference in 1930.\nNevertheless one might consider Schottky's idea as a forerunner of this\ndevelopment explaining and asserting that the main point is the Coulomb energy\nleading to the essential interaction of neighboring elementary magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 08:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 13:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

In our proposal,\ntwo cavities couple to a dissipative reservoir at multiple points while they\ncouple to a gain reservoir in a single-point way. To detecting a unknown\nparameter using this sensor, a waveguide is coupled to one of the cavities\nwhere detecting fields can pass through for homodyne detection.

Once an outbreak occurs, suppressing the\nspread of the virus in retirement homes is challenging because the residents\nare in contact with each other, and isolation measures cannot be widely\nenforced. Regular testing strategies, on the other hand, have been shown to\neffectively prevent outbreaks in retirement homes. However, high frequency\ntesting may consume substantial staff working time, which results in a\ntrade-off between the time invested in testing, and the time spent providing\nessential care to residents. Thus, developing an optimal testing strategy is\ncrucial to proactively detect infections while guaranteeing efficient use of\nlimited staff time in these facilities. Although numerous efforts have been\nmade to prevent the virus from spreading in long-term care facilities, this is\nthe first study to develop testing strategies based on formal optimization\nmethods. This paper proposes two novel optimization models for testing\nschedules. The models aim to minimize the risk of infection in retirement\nhomes, considering the trade-off between the probability of infection and staff\nworkload. We employ a probabilistic approach in conjunction with the\noptimization models, to compute the risk of infection, including contact rates,\nincidence status, and the probability of infection of the residents. To solve\nthe models, we propose an enhanced local search algorithm by leveraging the\nsymmetry property of the optimal solution. We perform several experiments with\nrealistically sized instances and show that the proposed approach can derive\noptimal testing strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 08:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

To resolve this, recent works focus on\ndeveloping weaker forms of supervision -- e.g., hyperparameters discovered with\na small number of validation samples with spurious attribute annotation -- but\nnone of the methods retain comparable performance to methods using full\nsupervision on the spurious attribute. In this paper, instead of searching for\nweaker supervisions, we ask: Given access to a fixed number of samples with\nspurious attribute annotations, what is the best achievable worst-group loss if\nwe \"fully exploit\" them? To this end, we propose a pseudo-attribute-based\nalgorithm, coined Spread Spurious Attribute (SSA), for improving the\nworst-group accuracy. In particular, we leverage samples both with and without\nspurious attribute annotations to train a model to predict the spurious\nattribute, then use the pseudo-attribute predicted by the trained model as\nsupervision on the spurious attribute to train a new robust model having\nminimal worst-group loss. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets show\nthat our algorithm consistently outperforms the baseline methods using the same\nnumber of validation samples with spurious attribute annotations.

These macroscopic components do\nnot allow fast data processing for, e.g real-time and high-resolution videos.\nThis work introduces Hyplex, a new integrated architecture addressing the\nlimitations discussed above. Hyplex is a CMOS-compatible, fast hyperspectral\ncamera that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces inversely designed\nthrough artificial intelligence. Hyplex does not require spectrometers but\nmakes use of conventional monochrome cameras, opening up the possibility for\nreal-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at inexpensive costs.\nHyplex exploits a model-driven optimization, which connects the physical\nmetasurfaces layer with modern visual computing approaches based on end-to-end\ntraining. We design and implement a prototype version of Hyplex and compare its\nperformance against the state-of-the-art for typical imaging tasks such as\nspectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. In all benchmarks, Hyplex\nreports the smallest reconstruction error. We additionally present what is, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral\ndataset for semantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 09:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

We focus on the supervised setup, in which ground-truth depth is\navailable only at training time.

In particular,\nwe introduce a piecewise planarity prior which states that for each pixel,\nthere is a seed pixel which shares the same planar 3D surface with the former.\nMotivated by this prior, we design a network with two heads. The first head\noutputs pixel-level plane coefficients, while the second one outputs a dense\noffset vector field that identifies the positions of seed pixels. The plane\ncoefficients of seed pixels are then used to predict depth at each position.\nThe resulting prediction is adaptively fused with the initial prediction from\nthe first head via a learned confidence to account for potential deviations\nfrom precise local planarity.

Our analysis indicates detachment in the MAST-U Super-X divertor can be\nseparated into four sequential phases: First, the ionisation region detaches\nfrom the target at detachment onset leaving a region of increased molecular\ndensities downstream. The plasma interacts with these molecules, resulting in\nmolecular ions ($D_2^+$ and/or $D_2^- \\rightarrow D + D^-$) that further react\nwith the plasma leading to Molecular Activated Recombination and Dissociation\n(MAR and MAD), which results in excited atoms and significant Balmer line\nemission. Second, the MAR region detaches from the target leaving a sub-eV\ntemperature region downstream. Third, an onset of strong emission from\nelectron-ion recombination (EIR) ensues. Finally, the electron density decays\nnear the target, resulting in a density front moving upstream.\n  The analysis in this paper indicates that plasma-molecule interactions have a\nlarger impact than previously reported and play a critical role in the\nintensity and interpretation of hydrogen atomic line emission characteristics\non MAST-U. Furthermore, we find that the Fulcher band emission profile in the\ndivertor can be used as a proxy for the ionisation region and may also be\nemployed as a plasma temperature diagnostic for improving the separation of\nhydrogenic emission arising from electron-impact excitation and that from\nplasma-molecular interactions.\n  We provide evidences for the presence of low electron temperatures ($<0.5$\neV) during detachment phases III-IV based on quantitative spectroscopy\nanalysis, a Boltzmann relation of the high-n Balmer line transitions together\nwith an analysis of the brightness of high-n Balmer lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 11:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 15:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

The\nSOTA methods in SBR employ GNN to model neighboring item transitions from\nglobal (i.e, other sessions) and local (i.e, current session) contexts.\nHowever, most existing methods treat neighbors from different sessions equally\nwithout considering that the neighbor items from different sessions may share\nsimilar features with the target item on different aspects and may have\ndifferent contributions. In other words, they have not explored\nfiner-granularity transition information between items in the global context,\nleading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we fill this gap by\nproposing a novel Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural\nNetwork (TIE-DGNN) model to capture finer-granular transition information\nbetween items and try to interpret the reason of the transition by modeling the\nvarious factors of the item. Specifically, we propose a position-aware global\ngraph, which utilizes the relative position information to model the\nneighboring item transition. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks, each\nof which represents a factor, and use disentangling module to separately learn\nthe factor embeddings over the global graph. For local context, we train item\nembeddings by using attention mechanisms to capture transition information from\nthe current session. To this end, our model considers two levels of transition\ninformation. Especially in global text, we not only consider finer-granularity\ntransition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level\ninto account to interpret the key reason for the transition. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nthe SOTA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 11:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

However, when the jet\nemission is not strong, one could expect signatures of X-ray emission from\ninverse Compton scattering of accretion disc photons by the corona. Moreover,\nthe observed X-ray variability can also originate in the disc, and gets\npropagated and amplified by the jet. Here, we present results on the BL Lac\nobject Mrk 421 using the NuSTAR data acquired during 2017 when the source was\nin a moderate X-ray brightness state. For comparison with high jet activity, we\nalso considered one epoch data in April 2013 during a very high X-ray\nbrightness state. Our aim is to explore the possibility of the signature of\naccretion disc emission in the overall X-ray emission from Mrk 421. The\nspectral fitting of the data using the two component advective flow model shows\ngives (a) the size of the dynamic corona at the base of the jet from ~28 to 10\nr$_s$, (b) the disc mass accretion rate from 0.021 to 0.051 $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$,\n(c) the halo mass accretion rate from 0.22 to 0.35 $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$, and (d)\nthe viscosity parameter of the Keplerian accretion disc from 0.18 $-$ 0.25. In\nthe assumed model, the total flux, disc and jet flux correlate with the radio\nflux observed during these epochs. We conclude that the spectra of all the\nepochs of Mrk 421 in 2017 are well described by the accretion disc based two\ncomponent advective flow model. The estimated disc and jet flux relations with\nradio flux show that accretion disc can contribute to the observed X-ray\nemission, when X-ray data (that covers a small portion of the broad band\nspectral energy distribution of Mrk 421) is considered in isolation. However,\nthe present disc based models are disfavoured with respect to the relativistic\njet models when considering the X-ray data in conjunction with data at other\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

The model fitted mass\naccretion rate varied between $0.003\\pm 0.001$ and $0.009\\pm0.002$ $\\dot M_{\\rm\nEdd}$ and the dynamic corona changed from $28\\pm 3$ to $10\\pm1$ $r_g$. We found\nthat the variable absorption column density correlates with the mass accretion\nrate and the geometry of the corona. The derived wind velocity was sufficiently\nlow compared to the escape velocity to drive the wind away from the disc for\nthe epochs when column densities were high. This suggests that the high and\nvariable absorption can be due to failed winds from the disc. Our estimated\nratio of mass outflow to inflow rate from the inner region of the disc lies\nbetween $0.019\\pm0.006$ and $0.12\\pm0.04$. From spectral fitting of the\ncombined data, we found the mass of the central black hole to be constant\n$4.38\\pm0.34 - 4.51\\pm0.29 \\times10^{6} M_\\odot$, consistent with earlier\nfindings. The confidence contours of $N_H$ with other model parameters show\nthat the model fitted parameters are robust and non-degenerate. Our study\nconstrued that the changing accretion rate, which is a fundamental physical\nquantity and the geometry of the corona driving the CL phenomena in NGC\\,1365.\nThe physical picture considered in this work connects both variable continuum\nand variable absorbing medium scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 11:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

To tackle this problem, we propose a distinct Dual-path Actor\nInteraction (DualAI) framework, which flexibly arranges spatial and temporal\ntransformers in two complementary orders, enhancing actor relations by\nintegrating merits from different spatiotemporal paths. Moreover, we introduce\na novel Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) between two interactive\npaths of Dual-AI. Via self-supervised actor consistency in both frame and video\nlevels, MAC-Loss can effectively distinguish individual actor representations\nto reduce action confusion among different actors.

The distance is one of the\nmore straightforward parameters to estimate, yet enormous differences can still\nbe found among published data. This is particularly true for open clusters\nlocated more than a few kpc away. We cross-matched several published catalogues\nand selected the twenty-five most distant open clusters ($>$9000 pc). We then\nperformed a detailed analysis of their fundamental parameters, with emphasis on\ntheir distances, to determine the agreement between catalogues and our\nestimates.} Photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia EDR3 survey was\nemployed. The data was processed with our own membership analysis code\n(pyUPMASK), and our package for automatic fundamental cluster's parameters\nestimation ($\\texttt{ASteCA}$). We find differences in the estimated distances\nof up to several kpc between our results and those catalogued, even for the\ncatalogues that show the best matches with $\\texttt{ASteCA}$ values. Large\ndifferences are also found for the age estimates. As a by-product of the\nanalysis we find that vd Bergh-Hagen 176 could be the open cluster with the\nlargest heliocentric distance catalogued to date. Caution is thus strongly\nrecommended when using catalogued parameters of open clusters to infer\nlarge-scale properties of the Galaxy, particularly for those located more than\na few kpc away.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 12:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Part of\nits success is based on the fact that natural deduction rules present a simple\ncharacterization of logical constants, especially in the case of intuitionistic\nlogic. However, there has been a lot of criticism on extensions of the\nintuitionistic set of rules in order to deal with classical logic. Indeed, most\nof such extensions add, to the usual introduction and elimination rules, extra\nrules governing negation. As a consequence, several meta-logical properties,\nthe most prominent one being harmony, are lost. Dag Prawitz proposed a natural\ndeduction ecumenical system, where classical logic and intuitionistic logic are\ncodified in the same system. In this system, the classical logician and the\nintuitionistic logician would share the universal quantifier, conjunction,\nnegation and the constant for the absurd, but they would each have their own\nexistential quantifier, disjunction and implication, with different meanings.\nPrawitz' main idea is that these different meanings are given by a semantical\nframework that can be accepted by both parties. In this paper, we propose a\ndifferent approach adapting, to the natural deduction framework, Girard's\nmechanism of stoup. This will allow the definition of a pure harmonic natural\ndeduction system for the propositional fragment of Prawitz' ecumenical logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 13:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 08:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

We create initial conditions for\nwhich the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential\nfrom the galaxy and an NFW dark matter halo. Two free parameters associated\nwith the thermodynamic profiles determine the cluster gas fraction and the\ncentral temperature, where the latter can be used to create cool-core or\nnon-cool-core systems. Our simulations include radiative cooling, star\nformation, BH accretion, and stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nfeedback. Even though the energy of AGN feedback is injected thermally and\nisotropically, it leads to anisotropic outflows and buoyantly rising bubbles.\nWe find that the BH accretion rate (BHAR) is highly variable and only\ncorrelates strongly with the star formation rate (SFR) and the ICM when it is\naveraged over more than $1~\\rm Myr$. We generally find good agreement with the\ntheoretical precipitation framework. In $10^{13}~\\rm M_\\odot$ haloes, AGN\nfeedback quenches the central galaxy and converts cool-core systems into\nnon-cool-core systems.

Otherwise, this\nconundrum does not exist in the first place. It is shown here that this\napparent coincidence could be explained as a non-anthropic observational\nselection effect: for us to be typical observers in the comoving (static)\nspacetime volume, the cosmic energy budget must contain a non-vanishing DE\ncomponent. In addition, it is shown that irrespective of the cosmological\ninitial conditions and assuming no `new physics', the Universe is most likely\nto be observed at a time when the conformal Hubble radius, $\\mathcal{H}^{-1}$,\nattains a maximum.

Specifically, in comparison with the case of weak\ninteractions and treating the entire three-electron double-dot hybrid qubit as\nan integral unit, it is shown that the predicted spectroscopic patterns,\noriginating from strong electron correlations, manifest the formation of Wigner\nmolecules (WMs). Signatures of WM formation include: (1) a strong suppression\nof the energy gaps relative to the non-interacting-electrons modeling, and (2)\nthe appearance of a pair of avoided crossings arising between states associated\nwith two-electron occupancies in the left and right wells.

In classical density-functional theory the mean-field\nelectrostatic contribution can be obtained from the first order of a functional\nperturbation of the pair potential for an uncharged reference system of hard\nspheres. This mean-field electrostatic term particularly contributes at\nparticle separations that are forbidden due to hard-core overlap. In this work\nwe modify the mean-field contribution such that the pair potential is constant\nfor distances smaller than the contact distance of the ions. We motivate our\nmodification by the underlying splitting of the potential, which is similar to\nthe splitting of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential and leads to\nhigher-order terms in the respective expansion of the functional around the\nreference system. The resulting formalism involves weighted densities similar\nto the ones found in fundamental measure theory. To test our modifications, we\nanalyze and compare density profiles, direct and total correlation functions,\nand the thermodynamic consistency of the functional via a widely established\nsum rule and the virial pressure formula for our modified functional, for\nestablished functionals, and for data from computer simulations. We found that\nour modifications clearly show improvements compared to the standard mean-field\nfunctional, especially when predicting layering effects and direct correlation\nfunctions in high concentration scenarios; for the latter we also find improved\nconsistency when calculated via different thermodynamic routes. In conclusion,\nwe demonstrate how modifications towards higher order corrections beyond\nmean-field functionals can be made and how they perform, by this providing a\nbasis for systematic future improvements in classical density-functional theory\nfor the description of electrostatic interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 14:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

Moreover, the effect of these\nstochastic sources on the loads depends strongly on the mean environmental\nconditions -- for instance, at low mean wind speeds, inflow turbulence produces\nmuch less variability in loads than at high wind speeds.

The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but\nappears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes\nexhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a\nmaximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases.

To accelerate Bayesian inference, we develop a\nnovel training scheme that uses data to adaptively train a neural-network\nsurrogate simulating the parametric forward model. By simultaneously\nidentifying an approximate posterior distribution over the Biot number, and\nweighting a physics-informed training loss according to this, our approach\napproximates forward and inverse solution together without any need for\nexternal solves. Using a random Chebyshev series, we outline how to approximate\na Gaussian process prior, and using the surrogate we apply Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) to sample from the posterior distribution.

In this work, we study\nthe robustness of VQA models from a novel perspective: visual context. We\nsuggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, i.e., irrelevant\nobjects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the model's reliance on\nvisual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective\nperturbation technique, SwapMix. SwapMix perturbs the visual context by\nswapping features of irrelevant context objects with features from other\nobjects in the dataset. Using SwapMix we are able to change answers to more\nthan 45 % of the questions for a representative VQA model. Additionally, we\ntrain the models with perfect sight and find that the context over-reliance\nhighly depends on the quality of visual representations. In addition to\ndiagnosing, SwapMix can also be applied as a data augmentation strategy during\ntraining in order to regularize the context over-reliance. By swapping the\ncontext object features, the model reliance on context can be suppressed\neffectively. Two representative VQA models are studied using SwapMix: a\nco-attention model MCAN and a large-scale pretrained model LXMERT. Our\nexperiments on the popular GQA dataset show the effectiveness of SwapMix for\nboth diagnosing model robustness and regularizing the over-reliance on visual\ncontext.

These neural network-based methods are\noften used in the form of an ensemble based on multiple model runs from\ndifferent random initializations, resulting in a collection of forecast\ndistributions that need to be aggregated into a final probabilistic prediction.\nWith the aim of consolidating findings from the machine learning literature on\nensemble methods and the statistical literature on forecast combination, we\naddress the question of how to aggregate distribution forecasts based on such\ndeep ensembles. Using theoretical arguments, simulation experiments and a case\nstudy on wind gust forecasting, we systematically compare probability- and\nquantile-based aggregation methods for three neural network-based approaches\nwith different forecast distribution types as output.

One remaining difficulty arises from the non-perturbative nature of\nthe strong force, which leads to the phenomenon of quark confinement at\ndistances on the order of the size of the proton. Here we show that in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quarks and gluons are set free over an\nextended volume, two species of produced vector (spin-1) mesons, namely $\\phi$\nand $K^{*0}$, emerge with a surprising pattern of global spin alignment. In\nparticular, the global spin alignment for $\\phi$ is unexpectedly large, while\nthat for $K^{*0}$ is consistent with zero. The observed spin-alignment pattern\nand magnitude for the $\\phi$ cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms,\nwhile a model with a connection to strong force fields, i.e. an effective proxy\ndescription within the Standard Model and Quantum Chromodynamics, accommodates\nthe current data. This connection, if fully established, will open a potential\nnew avenue for studying the behaviour of strong force fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 15:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 19:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 17:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

In this work, we investigate whether\nthe deep learning method, concretely the 3D U-Net algorithm here, can play a\ncrucial role in foreground subtraction when considering the systematic effect\ncaused by the telescope's primary beam. We consider two beam models, i.e., the\nGaussian beam model as a simple case and the Cosine beam model as a\nsophisticated case. The traditional principal component analysis (PCA) method\nis employed as a comparison and, more importantly, as the preprocessing step\nfor the U-Net method to reduce the sky map dynamic range.

In order to show how well the PCA and U-Net methods can recover\nthe HI signals, we also derive the HI angular power spectra, as well as the HI\n2D power spectra, after performing the foreground subtractions.

In this paper we focus on\na specific instance of agent-based models, which uses reinforcement learning\n(RL) to train the agent how to act in its environment. Reinforcement learning\nagents are usually also Markov processes, which is another type of model that\ncan be used. We test this reinforcement learning agent in a Colonel Blotto\nenvironment1, and measure its performance against Random agents as its\nopponent. We find that the RL agent handily beats a single opponent, and still\nperforms quite well when the number of opponents are increased. We also analyze\nthe RL agent and look at what strategies it has arrived by looking at the\nactions that it has given the highest and lowest Q-values. Interestingly, the\noptimal strategy for playing multiple opponents is almost the complete opposite\nof the optimal strategy for playing a single opponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 16:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

In particular, increasingly accurate cosmological\nobservations have allowed us to discover a form of \"dark energy\", which\npresently dominates the expansion of the universe. On the other hand,\nfundamental problems in the standard cosmological model point towards the\npossibility of a primordial inflationary period. Both these expansion phases\nhave in common the fact that they should be governed by forms of energy with\nproperties much similar to those of vacuum energy of classical or quantum\nfields. In the meanwhile, quantum field theory in curved spaces (QFTCS) has\nproved a rich framework to analyze phenomena of a quantum nature in regimes\nwhere spacetime curvature is relevant, but not too extreme; particularly, it\nyields novel insights on the structure and dynamics of quantum vacuum. In this\ndissertation, we make a thorough exposition of the fundamentals of QFTCS and\npresent some of its applications in cosmological spacetimes. Particular\nattention is given to the construction of an empirical notion of particles\nthrough an idealized model of particle detectors, and to the phenomenon of\nparticle creation in expanding FLRW spacetimes. Further, we develop the\nprocedure of adiabatic renormalization, and use it to compute the renormalized\nstress tensor in these spacetimes. For a noninteracting scalar field in de\nSitter spaces, we find that it takes the form of a cosmological constant,\nalthough a quantitatively self-consistent value with the background expansion\ncan only be found at Planckian densities. We also present a construction of a\nsimple inflationary model, driven by a self-interacting classical scalar field,\nand show how the quantized fluctuations of this field could give rise to a\nnearly scale-invariant power spectrum, like the one that is currently observed\nin the CMB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 20:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The key life-building block\nribose was found in carbonaceous chondrites. Its exogenous delivery onto the\nHadean Earth could be a crucial step toward the emergence of the RNA world.\nHere, we investigate the formation of ribose through a simplified version of\nthe formose reaction inside carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Following up\non our previous studies regarding nucleobases with the same coupled\nphysico-chemical model, we calculate the abundance of ribose within\nplanetesimals of different sizes and heating histories. We perform laboratory\nexperiments using catalysts present in carbonaceous chondrites to infer the\nyield of ribose among all pentoses (5Cs) forming during the formose reaction.\nThese laboratory yields are used to tune our theoretical model that can only\npredict the total abundance of 5Cs. We found that the calculated abundances of\nribose were similar to the ones measured in carbonaceous chondrites. We discuss\nthe possibilities of chemical decomposition and preservation of ribose and\nderived constraints on time and location in planetesimals. In conclusion, the\naqueous formose reaction might produce most of the ribose in carbonaceous\nchondrites. Together with our previous studies on nucleobases, we found that\nlife-building blocks of the RNA world could be synthesized inside parent bodies\nand later delivered onto the early Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 18:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

This paper proposes the monolayer of boron phosphide as a stable\nhighly-efficient water-splitting photocatalyst by high-precision\ndensity-functional theory calculations using a HSE06 functional with a solvent\neffect. The monolayer of boron phosphide has a direct allowed energy gap of\nabout 1.4 eV, and functions as a one-step excitation photocatalyst. It absorbs\nsunlight with wavelengths below about 890 nm (ultraviolet, visible, and\nnear-infrared light) and produces both hydrogen gas and oxygen gas from water\nat a suitable pH condition. By calculating the overpotentials of hydrogen and\noxygen evolution reactions, its photocatalytic effectiveness was confirmed.
