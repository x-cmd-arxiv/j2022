This paper\nexamines the prepare and measure version of multiparty communication through\nquantum key distribution. It is sufficient to have the capability of preparing\nand measuring a single qubit state. The security of the multiparty prepare and\nmeasure QKD is demonstrated by utilizing the well-known techniques of quantum\nerror correction and entanglement purification. We begin by establishing the\nsecurity of the entangled-based version and progress through a series of\nreductions to arrive at our equivalent multiparty prepare and measure version\nof QKD. We establish the security proof of multiparty entangled-based version\nby combining FTQC and classical statistics on the GHZ basis.

We generalize the lattice-dynamics studies on the two-dimensional\nCDW state at van-Hove-singularity (VHS) filling and find that the CDW ordering\ncould develop a central peak at zero frequency while the associated phonon\nundergoes hardening. The particle-hole scatterings between VHS points give rise\nto a low-energy increased charge-density susceptibility, and their coupling to\nthe lattice dynamics induces two poles in the Green function for the\nCDW-associated phonon mode. The zero-frequency pole corresponds to the\ncollective charge-density and phonon coupling mode. The high-frequency one is\nrelated to the high-temperature phonon mode that hardens as reaching the CDW\ntransition.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) of galaxies play an important role in\nthe life and evolution of galaxies due to the impact they exert on certain\nproperties and the evolutionary path of galaxies. It is well known that\ninfrared (IR) emission is useful for selecting galaxies with AGNs, although it\nhas been observed that there is contamination by star-forming galaxies. Aims.\nIn this work we investigate galaxy properties hosting AGNs identified at mid\nand near-IR wavelengths.

While current FSOD methods\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting, G-FSOD addresses this limitation yet\nexhibits a performance drop on novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art\nFSOD.

To evaluate our method, we conduct\nextensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets.

We give an\nimprovement over all the best known upper bounds, some of which have stood for\nover 20 years, for identifying codes in trees, proving the upper bound of\n$(n+\\ell)/2$, where $n$ is the order and $\\ell$ is the number of leaves\n(pendant vertices) of the graph. In addition to being an improvement in size,\nthe new upper bound is also an improvement in generality, as it actually holds\nfor bipartite graphs having no twins (pairs of vertices with the same closed or\nopen neighbourhood) of degree 2 or greater. We also show that the bound is\ntight for an infinite class of graphs and that there are several structurally\ndifferent families of trees attaining the bound. We then use our bound to\nderive a tight upper bound of $2n/3$ for twin-free bipartite graphs of order\n$n$, and characterize the extremal examples, as $2$-corona graphs of bipartite\ngraphs. This is best possible, as there exist twin-free graphs, and trees with\ntwins, that need $n-1$ vertices in any of their identifying codes. We also\ngeneralize the existing upper bound of $5n/7$ for graphs of order $n$ and girth\nat least 5 when there are no leaves, to the upper bound $\\frac{5n+2\\ell}{7}$\nwhen leaves are allowed. This is tight for the $7$-cycle $C_7$ and for all\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 16:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 16:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-14"}

In this paper, we propose an effective bottom-up extension of the\npopular FIND-S algorithm to learn DNF-type rulesets. The algorithm greedily\nfinds a partition of the positive examples. The produced DNF is a set of\nconjunctive rules, each corresponding to the most specific rule consistent with\na part of positive and all negative examples. We also propose two principled\nextensions of this method, approximating the Bayes Optimal Classifier by\naggregating DNF decision rules.

For backdoor attacks to bypass human\ninspection, it is essential that the injected data appear to be correctly\nlabeled. The attacks with such property are often referred to as \"clean-label\nattacks.\" Existing clean-label backdoor attacks require knowledge of the entire\ntraining set to be effective. Obtaining such knowledge is difficult or\nimpossible because training data are often gathered from multiple sources\n(e.g., face images from different users). It remains a question whether\nbackdoor attacks still present a real threat.\n  This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question by designing an\nalgorithm to mount clean-label backdoor attacks based only on the knowledge of\nrepresentative examples from the target class. With poisoning equal to or less\nthan 0.5% of the target-class data and 0.05% of the training set, we can train\na model to classify test examples from arbitrary classes into the target class\nwhen the examples are patched with a backdoor trigger.

We study the cause of\nthe intriguing effectiveness and find that because the trigger synthesized by\nour attack contains features as persistent as the original semantic features of\nthe target class, any attempt to remove such triggers would inevitably hurt the\nmodel accuracy first.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 16:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

The model incorporates the effects of\ninhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback self-consistently and is\ncharacterized by five free parameters (two for the redshift-dependent\nionization efficiency, two for the ionizing escape fraction, and another for\nreionization temperature increment). We constrain these free parameters by\nsimultaneously matching with various observational probes, e.g., estimates of\nthe ionized hydrogen fraction, the CMB scattering optical depth and the galaxy\nUV luminosity function. In addition, we include the low-density IGM temperature\nmeasurements obtained from Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption spectra at $z \\sim 5.5$, a\nprobe not commonly used for Bayesian analysis of reionization parameters. We\nfind that the interplay of the various data sets, particularly inclusion of the\ntemperature data, leads to tightening of the parameter constraints. Our default\nmodels prefer a late end of reionization (at $z \\lesssim 6$), in agreement with\nother recent studies. We can also derive constraints on the duration of\nreionization, $\\Delta z=1.81^{+0.51}_{-0.67}$ and the midpoint of reionization,\n$z_{\\mathrm{mid}}=7.0^{+0.30}_{-0.40}$. The constraints can be further\ntightened by including other available and upcoming data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 17:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2022 16:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

Models that can express large classes of\nreal-valued functions on the Boolean cube are useful for problems involving\ndiscrete-valued data types, including those which are not Boolean. To this\ndate, the commonly used schemes for embedding classical data into variational\nquantum machine learning models encode continuous values. Here we investigate\nquantum embeddings for encoding Boolean-valued data into parameterized quantum\ncircuits used for machine learning tasks. We narrow down representability\nconditions for functions on the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube with respect to\npreviously known results, using two quantum embeddings: a phase embedding and\nan embedding based on quantum random access codes. We show that for any\nreal-valued function on the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube, there exists a\nvariational linear quantum model based on a phase embedding using $n$ qubits\nthat can represent it and an ensemble of such models using $d < n$ qubits that\ncan express any function with degree at most $d$.

This assumption does not hold true when\nthese detectors are deployed in real-world applications, where they encounter\nnew visual domain. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are generally\nemployed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by domain shift. Existing UDA\nmethods operate in an offline manner where the model is first adapted towards\nthe target domain and then deployed in real-world applications. However, this\noffline adaptation strategy is not suitable for real-world applications as the\nmodel frequently encounters new domain shifts. Hence, it becomes critical to\ndevelop a feasible UDA method that generalizes to these domain shifts\nencountered during deployment time in a continuous online manner. To this end,\nwe propose a novel unified adaptation framework that adapts and improves\ngeneralization on the target domain in online settings. In particular, we\nintroduce MemXformer - a cross-attention transformer-based memory module where\nitems in the memory take advantage of domain shifts and record prototypical\npatterns of the target distribution. Further, MemXformer produces strong\npositive and negative pairs to guide a novel contrastive loss, which enhances\ntarget specific representation learning. Experiments on diverse detection\nbenchmarks show that the proposed strategy can produce state-of-the-art\nperformance in both online and offline settings. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to address online and offline adaptation settings for\nobject detection.

Our catalog includes $M_{BH}$\nestimates for a total 689 AGNs, determined from the H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$,\n$MgII\\lambda2798$, and/or $CIV\\lambda1549$ broad emission lines. The core\nsample includes a total of 512 AGNs drawn from the 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky\ncatalog. We also provide measurements for 177 additional AGNs that are drawn\nfrom deeper Swift/BAT survey data. We study the links between $M_{BH}$\nestimates and line-of-sight obscuration measured from X-ray spectral analysis.\nWe find that broad H$\\alpha$ emission lines in obscured AGNs ($\\log (N_{\\rm\nH}/{\\rm cm}^{-2})> 22.0$) are on average a factor of $8.0_{-2.4}^{+4.1}$\nweaker, relative to ultra-hard X-ray emission, and about $35_{-12}^{~+7}$\\%\nnarrower than in unobscured sources (i.e., $\\log (N_{\\rm H}/{\\rm cm}^{-2}) <\n21.5$). This indicates that the innermost part of the broad-line region is\npreferentially absorbed. Consequently, current single-epoch $M_{BH}$\nprescriptions result in severely underestimated ($>$1 dex) masses for Type 1.9\nsources (AGNs with broad H$\\alpha$ but no broad H$\\beta$) and/or sources with\n$\\log (N_{\\rm H}/{\\rm cm}^{-2}) > 22.0$. We provide simple multiplicative\ncorrections for the observed luminosity and width of the broad H$\\alpha$\ncomponent ($L[{\\rm b}{\\rm H}\\alpha]$ and FWHM[bH$\\alpha$]) in such sources to\naccount for this effect, and to (partially) remedy $M_{BH}$ estimates for Type\n1.9 objects.

This paper\ndefines the angular resolution and S/N required for a robust characterization\nof the dynamical state of galaxies up to the EoR. The final aim is to help\ndesign spatially-resolved surveys targeting emission lines of primeval\ngalaxies. We investigate the [CII]-158um emission from z~6-7 LBGs from the\nSERRA cosmological simulation, covering a range of dynamical states: from disks\nto major mergers. We create ALMA mock observations with various data quality\nand apply the kinematic classification methods used in the literature. These\ntests allow us to quantify the performances of such methods as a function of\nangular resolution and S/N. We find that barely-resolved observations do not\nallow the correct dynamical characterization of a galaxy, resulting in the\nmisclassification of all disks in our sample. However, even when using\nspatially-resolved observations with data quality typical of high-z galaxies,\nthe standard kinematic classification methods, based on the analysis of the\nmoment maps, fail to distinguish a merger from a disk. The high angular\nresolution and S/N needed to apply these standard methods successfully can be\nachieved with current data only for a handful of bright galaxies. We propose a\nnew classification method, called PVsplit, that quantifies the asymmetries and\nmorphological features in position-velocity diagrams using three empirical\nparameters. We test PVsplit on our mock data concluding that it can predict\nwhether a galaxy is a disk or a merger provided that S/N $\\gtrsim10$, and the\nmajor axis is covered by $\\gtrsim3$ independent resolution elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-02"}

The inevitable scattering of scalar,\nelectromagnetic and gravitational waves off rotating and charged black holes\nprovides a remarkable demonstration of the energy extraction and subsequent\namplification of scattered waves under the expense of the compact object's\nrotational and electromagnetic energy; a phenomenon known as superradiance.\nCertain circumstances tremendously favor the energy extraction process in such\nextent that linear superradiant instabilities are triggered.

Standard well-examined choices such as the mean or sum aggregation\nfunctions have limited capabilities, as they are not able to capture\ninteractions among neighbors. In this work, we formalize these interactions\nusing an information-theoretic framework that notably includes synergistic\ninformation. Driven by this definition, we introduce the Graph Ordering\nAttention (GOAT) layer, a novel GNN component that captures interactions\nbetween nodes in a neighborhood.

For energies\nat which current neutrino experiments are being operated, a significant\ncontribution to pion production is made by resonance production process. After\nits production, if a pion is absorbed in the nuclear matter, the event may\nbecome indistinguishable from quasi-elastic scattering process and acts as a\nbackground. The estimation of this background is very essential for oscillation\nexperiments and requires good theoretical models for both pion production at\nprimary vertex and after FSI. Due to FSI, the number of final state pions is\nsignificantly different from the number produced at primary vertex. As the\nneutrino detectors can observe only the final state particles, the correct\ninformation about the particles produced at the primary vertex is overshadowed\nby FSI.

In particular, we are interested in few-shot\nsettings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into\nthe sequence generation task, using a generative language model with\nunidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the\nmodel learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need\nof training task-specific layers.

The\ntechnological innovation of agriculture is the active management of this\nnitrogen cycle by applying fertilizer to soil, at first through the production\nof manure excesses but later by the Haber-Bosch industrial process. The use of\nsuch fertilizers has increased the atmospheric abundance of nitrogen-containing\nspecies such as NH$_3$ and N$_2$O as agricultural productivity intensifies in\nmany parts of the world.

In this\npaper, we study the problem of designing a scalable constraints solver for an\nimportant class of constraints named polynomial constraint inequalities (also\nknown as non-linear real arithmetic theory). In this paper, we introduce a\nsolver named PolyARBerNN that uses convex polynomials as abstractions for\nhighly nonlinear polynomials. Such abstractions were previously shown to be\npowerful to prune the search space and restrict the usage of sound and complete\nsolvers to small search spaces. Compared with the previous efforts on using\nconvex abstractions, PolyARBerNN provides three main contributions namely (i) a\nneural network guided abstraction refinement procedure that helps selecting the\nright abstraction out of a set of pre-defined abstractions, (ii) a Bernstein\npolynomial-based search space pruning mechanism that can be used to compute\ntight estimates of the polynomial maximum and minimum values which can be used\nas an additional abstraction of the polynomials, and (iii) an optimizer that\ntransforms polynomial objective functions into polynomial constraints (on the\ngradient of the objective function) whose solutions are guaranteed to be close\nto the global optima.

Spanning a large number of cosmological and\nastrophysical parameters (especially suitable for the dark sector), and\norganized into three main categories (Grid Suite, Supporting Suite, and\nSystematics Suite), the release may be useful for a broader variety of\ncosmological and astrophysical purposes - while primarily developed for\nLyman-Alpha (LyA) forest studies. In particular, the overall architecture of\nthe Grid Suite has been designed to achieve an equivalent resolution up to\n3x3328^3=110 billion particles in a 100 Mpc/h box, corresponding to a 30 kpc/h\nmean grid resolution, which ensures convergence on LyA flux statistics closer\nto the desired 1.0% level that data from surveys such as the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide.

This, however, fails\nto capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance\nvisual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming,\nwe propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to\nexploit such contexts.

A Panoptic Relational\nAttention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature\nmap from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations\nacross semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these\npanoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to\nfocus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of\ninstances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general\nmodule that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture.\nThrough extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like\nCityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable\nimprovements over existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 19:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Here we present neutron powder\ndiffraction, high energy resolution fluorescence detected x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (HERFD-XAS), resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), magnetic\nsusceptibility, and muon spin relaxation data on the related double perovskite\niridates Ba$_2$LuIrO$_6$, Sr$_2$LuIrO$_6$, Ba$_2$ScIrO$_6$, and Sr$_2$ScIrO$_6$\nthat enable us to gain a general understanding of the electronic and magnetic\nproperties for this family of materials. Our HERFD-XAS and RIXS measurements\nestablish $J = 0$ electronic ground states for the Ir$^{5+}$ ions in all cases,\nwith similar values for Hund's coupling $J_{\\rm H}$ and the spin-orbit coupling\nconstant $\\lambda_{\\rm SOC}$. Our bulk susceptibility and muon spin relaxation\ndata find no evidence for long-range magnetic order or spin freezing, but they\ndo reveal weak magnetic signals that are consistent with extrinsic local\nmoments. Our results indicate that the large $\\lambda_{\\rm SOC}$ is the key\ndriving force behind the electronic and magnetic ground states realized in the\n5$d^4$ double perovskite iridates, which agrees well with conventional wisdom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 19:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 22:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

Particles are modeled using the discrete system\nGreen's function (DSGF) approach, which is a volume integral numerical method\nbased on fluctuational electrodynamics. This method is applicable to finite,\nthree-dimensional objects, and all system interactions are defined independent\nof thermal excitation by a generalized system Green's function. The DSGF method\nis deemed suitable to model NFRHT between irregularly shaped particles after\nverification against the analytical solution for chains of two and three SiO2\nspheres. The NFRHT results reveal that geometric irregularity in particles\nleads to a reduction of the total conductance from that of comparable perfect\nspheres at vacuum separation distances smaller than the particle size, a regime\nin which NFRHT is a surface phenomenon. At vacuum separation distances larger\nthan the particle size, NFRHT becomes a volumetric process, and the total\nconductance between irregularly shaped particles converges to that of\ncomparable perfect spheres. Spectral analysis reveals, however, that particle\nirregularity leads to damping and broadening of resonances at all separation\ndistances, thereby highlighting the importance of the DSGF method for spectral\nengineering in the near field. The reduced spectral coherence when particle\nsize is larger than the vacuum separation distance is attributed to coupling of\nsurface phonon-polaritons within the randomly generated, distorted particle\nfeatures.

It is often detrimental in cutting operations causing a\npoor surface finish and decreased tool life. Therefore, chatter detection using\nmachine learning has been an active research area over the last decade. Three\nchallenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection\nat large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of\nchatter features across different processes, the need for automating feature\nextraction, and the existence of limited data for each specific\nworkpiece-machine tool combination. These three challenges can be grouped under\nthe umbrella of transfer learning. This paper studies automating chatter\ndetection by evaluating transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter\ndetection methods. We investigate chatter classification accuracy using a\nvariety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments with\ndifferent cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT), Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Auto-correlation Function\n(ACF), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), and Ensemble Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EEMD).

The proposed scheme is\nemergency vehicle-centered, meaning that it provides an efficient and timely\nrouting for emergency vehicles. In the proposed scheme, model predictive\ncontrol is utilized to control inlet traffic flows by means of network gates,\nas well as configuration of traffic lights across the network. Two schemes are\nconsidered in this paper: i) centralized; and ii) decentralized. In the\ncentralized scheme, a central unit controls the entire network. This scheme\nprovides the optimal solution, even though it might not fulfil real-time\ncomputation requirements for large networks. In the decentralized scheme, each\nintersection has its own control unit, which sends local information to an\naggregator. The main responsibility of this aggregator is to receive local\ninformation from all control units across the network as well as the emergency\nvehicle, to augment the received information, and to share it with the control\nunits. Since the decision-making in decentralized scheme is local and the\naggregator should fulfil the above-mentioned tasks during a traffic cycle which\ntakes a long period of time, the decentralized scheme is suitable for large\nnetworks, even though it may provide a sub-optimal solution. Extensive\nsimulation studies are carried out to validate the proposed schemes, and assess\ntheir performance. Notably, the obtained results reveal that traveling times of\nemergency vehicles can be reduced up to ~50% by using the centralized scheme\nand up to ~30% by using the decentralized scheme, without causing congestion in\nother lanes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 20:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Recently, SNNs with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) have achieved a higher accuracy result on\nimage recognition tasks than other SNN training algorithms. Despite the success\nfrom the algorithm perspective, prior works neglect the evaluation of the\nhardware energy overheads of BPTT due to the lack of a hardware evaluation\nplatform for this SNN training algorithm. Moreover, although SNNs have long\nbeen seen as an energy-efficient counterpart of ANNs, a quantitative comparison\nbetween the training cost of SNNs and ANNs is missing. To address the\naforementioned issues, in this work, we introduce SATA (Sparsity-Aware Training\nAccelerator), a BPTT-based training accelerator for SNNs. The proposed SATA\nprovides a simple and re-configurable systolic-based accelerator architecture,\nwhich makes it easy to analyze the training energy for BPTT-based SNN training\nalgorithms. By utilizing the sparsity, SATA increases its computation energy\nefficiency by $5.58 \\times$ compared to the one without using sparsity. Based\non SATA, we show quantitative analyses of the energy efficiency of SNN training\nand compare the training cost of SNNs and ANNs. The results show that, on\nEyeriss-like systolic-based architecture, SNNs consume $1.27\\times$ more total\nenergy with sparsities when compared to ANNs. We find that such high training\nenergy cost is from time-repetitive convolution operations and data movements\nduring backpropagation. Moreover, to propel the future SNN training algorithm\ndesign, we provide several observations on energy efficiency for different\nSNN-specific training parameters and propose an energy estimation framework for\nSNN training. Code for our framework is made publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 21:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 11:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

The hybrid mode incurs a substantial\nCPU-to-GPU transfer time and relies on main memory bandwidth to feed embeddings\nto GPU for deep learning acceleration. Alternatively, we can store the entire\nembeddings across GPUs to avoid the transfer time and utilize the GPU's High\nBandwidth Memory (HBM). This approach requires GPU-to-GPU backend communication\nand scales the number of GPUs with the size of the embedding tables. To\novercome these concerns, this paper offers a heterogeneous acceleration\npipeline, called Hotline.\n  Hotline leverages the insight that only a small number of embedding entries\nare accessed frequently, and can easily fit in a single GPU's HBM. Hotline\nimplements a data-aware and model-aware scheduling pipeline that utilizes the\n(1) CPU main memory for not-frequently-accessed embeddings and (2) GPUs' local\nmemory for frequently-accessed embeddings. Hotline improves the training\nthroughput by dynamically stitching the execution of popular and not-popular\ninputs through a novel hardware accelerator and feeding to the GPUs.

Media narratives suggest that cultural innovations often originate\nin peripheral communities and then diffuse to the mainstream core; behavioral\nscience suggests that intermediate network positions that bridge between the\nperiphery and the core are especially likely to originate many influential\ncultural innovations. Research has yet to fully adjudicate between these\npredictions because prior work focuses on individual platforms such as Twitter;\nhowever, any single platform is only a small, incomplete part of the larger\nonline cultural ecosystem. In this paper, we perform the first analysis of the\norigins and diffusion of image memes at web scale, via a one-month crawl of all\nindexible online communities that principally share meme images with English\ntext overlays. Our results suggest that communities at the core of the network\noriginate the most highly diffused image memes: the top 10% of communities by\nnetwork centrality originate the memes that generate 62% of the image meme\ndiffusion events on the web. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression\nconfirms that memes from core communities are more likely to diffuse than those\nfrom peripheral communities even when controlling for community size and\nactivity level. However, a replication analysis that follows the traditional\napproach of testing the same question only within a single large community,\nReddit, finds the regression coefficients reversed -- underscoring the\nimportance of engaging in web-scale, cross-community analyses. The\necosystem-level viewpoint of this work positions the web as a highly\ncentralized generator of cultural artifacts such as image memes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 23:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Therefore multimodal models that are robust against\nmodal-incomplete data are highly preferred. Recently, Transformer models have\nshown great success in processing multimodal data. However, existing work has\nbeen limited to either architecture designs or pre-training strategies; whether\nTransformer models are naturally robust against missing-modal data has rarely\nbeen investigated. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to\ncomprehensively investigate the behavior of Transformers in the presence of\nmodal-incomplete data. Unsurprising, we find Transformer models are sensitive\nto missing modalities while different modal fusion strategies will\nsignificantly affect the robustness. What surprised us is that the optimal\nfusion strategy is dataset dependent even for the same Transformer model; there\ndoes not exist a universal strategy that works in general cases. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a principle method to improve the robustness of\nTransformer models by automatically searching for an optimal fusion strategy\nregarding input data. Experimental validations on three benchmarks support the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

In PKA, a user manages private keys\non her devices called authenticators, and services bind the corresponding\npublic keys to her account. To protect private keys, a user uses authenticators\nwhich never export private keys outside. On the other hand, a user regularly\nuses multiple authenticators like PCs and smartphones. She replaces some of her\nauthenticators according to their lifecycle, such as purchasing new devices and\nlosing devices. It is a burden for a user to register, update and revoke public\nkeys in many services every time she registers new accounts with services and\nreplaces some of her authenticators. To ease the burden, we propose a mechanism\nwhere users and services manage public keys based on the owner of\nauthenticators and users can access services with PKA using any of their\nauthenticators. We introduce a key pair called an Ownership Verification Key\n(OVK), which consists of the private key (OVSK) and the corresponding public\nkey (OVPK).

Services verify the ownership of the\nauthenticators using the corresponding OVPK to determine whether binding the\nrequested public key to her account. To protect user privacy while maintaining\nconvenience, authenticators generate a different OVK for each service from the\nseed independently.

Previous studies for\ntemporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference by\nlearning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the\ncollaborative signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but\nhave not been exploited; 2) users also tend to show stationary preferences\nwhile existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we propose an integrated\nlearning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary\npreferences of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a\nuniversal sequence by chronologically arranging all the user-set interactions,\nand then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular, for each user-set\ninteraction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling\ncomponent to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent\ncollaborative signals among different users. This component maintains a memory\nbank to store memories of the related user and elements, and continuously\nupdates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and the past\nmemories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to\ndiscover each user's personalized characteristics according to the historical\nsequence, which adaptively aggregates the previously interacted elements from\ndual perspectives with the guidance of the user's and elements' embeddings.\nFinally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model efficiency,\nwhich can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training\nspeedups on average.

Asymptotically, for a broad\nclass of observables, the distribution of a given observable satisfies a large\ndeviation principle when the dynamics is Markovian, meaning that fluctuations\ncan be characterized in the long-time limit by computing a scaled cumulant\ngenerating function. Calculating this function is not tractable analytically\n(nor often numerically) for complex, interacting systems, so the development of\nrobust numerical techniques to carry out this computation is needed to probe\nthe properties of nonequilibrium materials.

Due to\ndiverse block sizes, the state space and action trajectories are vast to\nexplore. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach for this problem. It\nconsists of a reinforcement-learning designer to propose high-level building\ninstructions and a motion-planning-based action generator to manipulate blocks\nat the low level. For high-level learning, we develop a novel technique,\nprioritized memory resetting (PMR) to improve exploration.

The latter are modeled as bare states in the Hilbert\nspace of a potential model. In this work, we study several potential models\nrelevant to the bare state, and solve their inverse scattering problems. The\nfirst model, called \"cc\", is a separable potential model. We show that it can\napproximate (single-channel short-range) $S$-wave near-threshold physics with\nan error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\beta^3/M_V^3)$, where $\\beta$ sets the maximum\nmomentum of the near-threshold region and $M_V$ is the typical scale of the\npotential. The second model, called \"bc\", serves as the bare-state-dominance\napproximation, where interaction between continuum states is ignored. Under\nthis model, even though the bare state is always crucial for a bound state's\ngeneration, a shallow bound state naturally tends to have a small bare-state\nproportion. Therefore, we need other quantities to quantify the importance of\nthe bare state. The last model, called \"bcc\", is a combination of the first two\nmodels. This model not only serves as a correction to the bare-state-dominance\napproximation, but can also be used to understand the interplay between quark\nand hadron degrees of freedom. This model naturally leads to the presence of a\nCastillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) zero. We consider the energy decomposition of a\nbound state. The potential ratio of the bare-continuum interaction to the\ncontinuum self-interaction is proposed to understand how the bound state is\ngenerated. Model independently, an inequality for the potential ratio is\nderived. Based on the model \"bcc\", the CDD zero can be used to estimate the\npotential ratio.

In this paper, we give an\nin-depth analysis and show that the damage of label shift can be overcome by\naligning the data conditional distribution and correcting the posterior\nprobability. To this end, we propose a novel approach to undo the damage of the\nlabel shift problem in CDSS.

In this paper, we propose DistPro, a novel framework which searches\nfor an optimal KD process via differentiable meta-learning. Specifically, given\na pair of student and teacher networks, DistPro first sets up a rich set of KD\nconnection from the transmitting layers of the teacher to the receiving layers\nof the student, and in the meanwhile, various transforms are also proposed for\ncomparing feature maps along its pathway for the distillation. Then, each\ncombination of a connection and a transform choice (pathway) is associated with\na stochastic weighting process which indicates its importance at every step\nduring the distillation. In the searching stage, the process can be effectively\nlearned through our proposed bi-level meta-optimization strategy. In the\ndistillation stage, DistPro adopts the learned processes for knowledge\ndistillation, which significantly improves the student accuracy especially when\nfaster training is required. Lastly, we find the learned processes can be\ngeneralized between similar tasks and networks.

Viewing each independent set as a collection of $k$\ntokens placed on the vertices of a graph $G$, the two most studied\nreconfiguration steps are token jumping and token sliding. In the token jumping\nvariant of the problem, a single step allows a token to jump from one vertex to\nany other vertex in the graph. In the token sliding variant, a token is only\nallowed to slide from a vertex to one of its neighbors. Like the independent\nset problem, both of the aforementioned problems are known to be W[1]-hard on\ngeneral graphs. A very fruitful line of research has showed that the\nindependent set problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable when restricted to\nsparse graph classes, such as planar, bounded treewidth, nowhere-dense, and all\nthe way to biclique-free graphs. Over a series of papers, the same was shown to\nhold for the token jumping problem. As for the token sliding problem, which is\nmentioned in most of these papers, almost nothing is known beyond the fact that\nthe problem is polynomial-time solvable on trees and interval graphs. We remedy\nthis situation by introducing a new model for the reconfiguration of\nindependent sets, which we call galactic reconfiguration. Using this new model,\nwe show that (standard) token sliding is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of\nbounded degree, planar graphs, and chordal graphs of bounded clique number. We\nbelieve that the galactic reconfiguration model is of independent interest and\ncould potentially help in resolving the remaining open questions concerning the\n(parameterized) complexity of token sliding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 06:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The method takes as inputs the full AC network\nand a pre-computed library of AC load flow data and uses the graph Laplacian to\nconstraint nodal reductions to only be feasible for neighbors of non-reduced\nnodes.

Most previous low-rank network compression\nmethods compress the networks by approximating pre-trained models and\nre-training. However, the optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite\ndifferent from the one in the low-rank manifold. A well-pre-trained model is\nnot a good initialization for the model with low-rank constraints. Thus, the\nperformance of a low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared\nto other network compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attracts\nless attention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method,\nlow-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rank\ncompressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. First,\nwe propose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training and\nprojection onto the low-rank manifold. Compared to re-training on the compact\nmodel, this enables full utilization of model capacity since solution space is\nrelaxed back to Euclidean space after projection. Second, the matrix energy\n(the sum of squares of singular values) reduction caused by projection is\ncompensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transfer the energy of the pruned\nsingular values to the remaining ones. We theoretically show that energy\ntransfer eases the trend of gradient vanishing caused by projection. Third, we\npropose batch normalization (BN) rectification to cut off its effect on the\noptimal low-rank approximation of the weight matrix, which further improves the\nperformance. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified\nthat our method is superior to other low-rank compression methods and also\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art pruning methods.

In addition, a sparse grid quadrature\nfor the high-dimensional parametric approximation is employed and\nsimultaneously balanced with the spatial and stochastic approximation. Our\nadaptive algorithm constructs a sparse grid approximation based on the\nbenefit-cost ratio such that the regularity and thus the decay of the\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve coefficients is not required beforehand. The decay is detected\nand exploited as the algorithm adjusts to the anisotropy in the parametric\nvariables. We include numerical examples for the Darcy problem with a lognormal\npermeability field, which illustrate a good performance of the algorithm: For\nsufficiently smooth random fields, we essentially recover the rate of the\nspatial discretization as asymptotic convergence rate with respect to the\ncomputational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 22:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-17"}

Hence, there is a\nrequirement for faster, more efficient codecs to achieve higher encoding\nefficiency without significant trade-off in terms of both complexity and speed.\nWe present in this work an evaluation of the latest MPEG-5 Part 2 Low\nComplexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) for live gaming video streaming\napplications.

Namely, can artificial intelligence\nautomatically find the boundaries of the optic cup and disc (providing a\nso-called segmented fundus image) and then use the segmented image to identify\nglaucoma with high accuracy. We conducted a comprehensive review on artificial\nintelligence-enabled glaucoma detection frameworks that produce and use\nsegmented fundus images. We found 28 papers and identified two main approaches:\n1) logical rule-based frameworks, based on a set of simplistic decision rules;\nand 2) machine learning/statistical modelling based frameworks. We summarise\nthe state-of-art of the two approaches and highlight the key hurdles to\novercome for artificial intelligence-enabled glaucoma detection frameworks to\nbe translated into clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Previous\nstudies mainly focus on EUV waves with single wavefronts that are generally\nthought to be driven by the lateral expansion of CMEs. Using high\nspatio-temporal resolution multi-angle imaging observations taken by the Solar\nDynamic Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we present\nthe observation of a broad quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave train\ncomposed of multiple wavefronts along the solar surface during the rising phase\nof a GOES M3.5 flare on 2011 February 24. The wave train transmitted through a\nlunate coronal hole (CH) with a speed of 840 +/-67 km/s, and the wavefronts\nshowed an intriguing refraction effect when they passed through the boundaries\nof the CH. Due to the lunate shape of the CH, the transmitted wavefronts from\nthe north and south arms of the CH started to approach each other and finally\ncollided, leading to the significant intensity enhancement at the collision\nsite. This enhancement might hint the occurrence of interference between the\ntwo transmitted wave trains. The estimated magnetosonic Mach number of the wave\ntrain is about 1.13, which indicates that the observed wave train was a weak\nshock. Period analysis reveals that the period of wave train was $\\sim$90\nseconds, in good agreement with that of the accompanying flare.

We establish these conditions for a large class of\nsquare-integrable time series models. This large class enables one to use the\nvariance plot estimator to detect LRD for infinite-variance time series (after\nsuitable transformation). Thus, detection of LRD for infinite-variance time\nseries is another novelty of our paper. A simulation study indicates that the\nvariance plot estimator can detect LRD better than the popular spectral domain\nGPH estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 08:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

Most of\nthose works rely on natural graph-based representations that can then be\nplugged into graph-based learning algorithms such as Gspan. There are two main\nproblems with this approach. The first one is in the cost of computing the\ngraph. Indeed, working with graphs requires one to compute and representing the\nentire state-space of the file under analysis. As such computation is too\ncumbersome, the techniques often rely on developing strategies to compute a\nrepresentative subgraph of the behaviors.

The\ncornerstone of the project is a reliable way of mining idioms from corpora,\nwhich is however a challenge because idioms extensively vary in forms. We\ntackle this by automatically deriving matching rules from their base forms. We\nuse Point-wise Mutual Inclusion (PMI), Term Frequency - Inverse Document\nFrequency (TF-IDF) to model collocations, since both of them are popular metric\nfor pairwise significance. We also try Term Frequency (TF) as the baseline\nmodel. As for implementing the reverse-dictionary, three approaches could be\ntaken: inverted index, graphs and distributional semantics. We choose to take\nthe last approach and implement the reverse dictionary with Word2Vec, because\nit is the most flexible approach of all and Word2Vec is a simple yet strong\nbaseline. Evaluating the methods has revealed rooms for improvement. We learn\nthat we can better identify idioms with the help of slop, wildcard and\nreordering techniques. We also learn that we can get the best of both PMI and\nTF-IDF if we use machine learning to find the sweet spot. Lastly, We learn that\nIdiomify could be further improved with a mixture of inverted index and\ndistributional semantics approach. The limits aside, the proposed methods are\nfeasible, and their benefits to the non-natives are apparent, which therefore\ncan be used to aid the non-natives in acquiring English idioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 08:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Further, NumGLUE promotes\nsharing knowledge across tasks, especially those with limited training data as\nevidenced by the superior performance (average gain of 3.4% on each task) when\na model is jointly trained on all the tasks as opposed to task-specific\nmodeling. Finally, we hope that NumGLUE will encourage systems that perform\nrobust and general arithmetic reasoning within language, a first step towards\nbeing able to perform more complex mathematical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

It is designed as a data attachment for the\nLarge Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework, allowing to\ncompute a meaningful deformation of one shape onto a subset of the other. We\nrefine it in order to control the resulting non-rigid deformations and provide\nconsistent deformations of the shapes along with their ambient space.

However, this is challenging when we want to use\ndiscrete messages to reduce the message size since gradients cannot flow\nthrough a discrete communication channel.

As the majority of efficient driving lines are metallic, the amount of\nwind driving and mass loss is dependent on the stellar metallicity Z. In\naddition, line-driven winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous and clumpy.\nHowever, to date, neither theoretical nor empirical studies of line-driven\nwinds have investigated how such wind clumping may also depend on Z. We\ntheoretically investigated the degree of wind clumping due to the\nline-deshadowing instability (LDI) as a function of Z. We performed\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the LDI with an assumed\none-dimensional radiation line force for a grid of O-star wind models with\nfixed luminosity, but with different metal contents by varying the accumulative\nline strength Qbar describing the total ensemble of driving lines. We find\nthat, for this fixed luminosity, the amount of wind clumping decreases with\nmetallicity. The decrease is clearly seen in the statistical properties of our\nsimulations, but is nonetheless rather weak; a simple power-law fit for the\ndependence of the clumping factor f_cl = <rho^2>/<rho>^2 on metallicity yields\nf_cl ~ Z^(0.15 +/- 0.01). This implies that empirically derived power-law\ndependencies of mass-loss rate Mdot on metallicity -- which were previously\ninferred from spectral diagnostics effectively depending on Mdot*sqrt(f_cl) but\nwithout having any constraints on f_cl(Z) -- should be only modestly altered by\nclumping.

Nowadays, a broad range of applications relies on crack\npropagation control, from the mitigation of damages, e.g., from impacts in\nglass screens or windshields, to industrial processes harnessing fracture to\nachieve clean cuts over large distances. Yet, studying the fracture in real\ntime is a challenging task, since cracks can propagate up to a few km/s in\nmaterials that are often opaque. Here, we report on the in situ investigation\nof cracks propagating at up to 2.5 km/s along a (001) plane of a silicon single\ncrystal, using X-ray diffraction megahertz imaging with intense and\ntime-structured synchrotron radiation. The studied system is based on the Smart\nCut process, where a buried layer in a material (typically Si) is weakened by\nmicro-cracks and then used to drive a macroscopic crack (0.1 m) in a plane\nparallel to the surface with minimal deviation (1 nm). The results we report\nhere provide the first direct confirmation that the shape of the crack front is\nnot affected by the distribution of the micro-cracks, which had been a\npostulate for previous studies based on post-fracture results.

Many applications which are becoming ubiquitous in\nmobile devices do not operate in a controlled environment, and their\nperformance significantly drops due to the lack of pixel resolution. While many\ngeneric super-resolution techniques have been studied to restore low-resolution\nimages for biometrics, the results obtained are not always as desired. Those\ngeneric methods are usually aimed to enhance the visual appearance of the\nscene. However, producing an overall visual enhancement of biometric images\ndoes not necessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Such\ntechniques are designed to restore generic images and therefore do not exploit\nthe specific structure found in biometric images (e.g. iris or faces), which\ncauses the solution to be sub-optimal. For this reason, super-resolution\ntechniques have to be adapted for the particularities of images from a specific\nbiometric modality.

The observed giant arc near the brightest cluster galaxies allowed us\nto estimate the radius of the Einstein ring, which is $ 9.8 \\pm 1.3 $\narcseconds.

Identifying low probability\nevents in data/images is a challenging problem given the high-dimensionality of\nthe data, especially when no (or little) information about the anomaly is\navailable a priori. While plenty of methods are available, the vast majority of\nthem do not scale well to large datasets and require the choice of some (very\noften critical) hyperparameters. Therefore, unsupervised and computationally\nefficient detection methods become strictly necessary. We propose an\nunsupervised method for detecting anomalies and changes in remote sensing\nimages by means of a multivariate Gaussianization methodology that allows to\nestimate multivariate densities accurately, a long-standing problem in\nstatistics and machine learning. The methodology transforms arbitrarily complex\nmultivariate data into a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Since the\ntransformation is differentiable, by applying the change of variables formula\none can estimate the probability at any point of the original domain. The\nassumption is straightforward: pixels with low estimated probability are\nconsidered anomalies. Our method can describe any multivariate distribution,\nmakes an efficient use of memory and computational resources, and is\nparameter-free. We show the efficiency of the method in experiments involving\nboth anomaly detection and change detection in different remote sensing image\nsets.

Such a scheme is not only suitable for\nHermitian systems, but also non-Hermitian systems. It is found that the robust\ndegree of edge state in the Hermitian system becomes stronger and stronger with\nthe increase of N. It tends to be a strongly surface localized form when N is\nlarge enough. In the non-Hermitian system, the skin effect becomes more\napparent, and it approaches the ideal situation with the increase of N. This\nmeans that edge states and skin effects can be observed by taking different N.\nThis scheme has been proved experimentally by designing circuits.

One of the main drawbacks of MKIDs\nis that large arrays would exhibit a pixel yield, the percentage of\nindividually distinguishable pixels to the total number of pixels, of 75 - 80\n%. Imperfections arising during the fabrication can induce an uncontrolled\nshift in the resonance frequency of individual resonators which can end up\nresonating at the same frequency of a different resonator. This makes a number\nof resonators indistinguishable and therefore unusable for imaging. This paper\nproposes an approach to individually re-tune the colliding resonators in order\nto remove the degeneracy and increase the number of MKIDs with unique resonant\nfrequencies. The frequency re-tuning is achieved through a DC bias of the\nresonator, the kinetic inductance of a superconducting thin film is current\ndependent and its dependence is non linear. Even though this approach has been\nalready proposed, an innovative pixel design, described in this paper, may\nsolve two issues previously described in literature such as increased\nelectromagnetic losses to the DC-bias line, and the multiplexibility of\nmultiple resonators on a single feedline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 11:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

A review of historical as well as more recent work on viral capsid\nsymmetries motivates the focus on the icosahedral root system $H_3$. We discuss\na notion of affine extension for non-crystallographic groups with applications\nto fullerenes and viruses. The icosahedrally ordered component of the nucleic\nacid within the virus capsid and the interaction between the two have shed\nlight on the viral assembly process with interesting applications to antiviral\ntherapies, drug delivery and nanotechnology. The Clifford algebra framework is\nvery natural, as it uses precisely the structure that is already implicit in\nthis root system and reflection group context, i.e. a vector space with an\ninner product. In addition, it affords a uniquely simple reflection formula, a\ndouble cover of group transformations, and more insight into the geometry, e.g.\nthe geometry of the Coxeter plane. This approach made possible a range of root\nsystem induction proofs, such as the constructions of $E_8$ from $H_3$ and the\nexceptional 4D root systems from 3D root systems. This makes explicit various\nconnections between what Arnold called Trinities (sets of three exceptional\ncases).

In these models a ball is placed into\na bin with probability proportional to a given function (feedback function),\nwhich depends on the number of existing balls in the bin. Typically, the\nfeedback function is the same for all bins (symmetric feedback), and there are\nno constraints on the number of balls in the bins. In this paper we study\nversions of BB models with two bins, in which the above assumptions are\nviolated. In the first model of interest the feedback functions can depend on a\nbin (BB model with asymmetric feedback). In the case when both feedback\nfunctions are power law and superlinear, a single bin receives all but finitely\nmany balls almost surely, and we study the probability that this happens for a\ngiven bin. In particular, under certain initial conditions we derive the normal\napproximation for this probability, which generalizes the result in [5]\nobtained in the case of the symmetric feedback.

Time-to-event data are\nsometimes discrete either because time itself is discrete or due to grouping of\nfailure times into intervals or rounding off measurements. In addition, the\nfailure of an individual could be one of several distinct failure types, known\nas competing risks (events). Most methods and software packages for survival\nregression analysis assume that time is measured on a continuous scale. It is\nwell-known that naively applying standard continuous-time models with\ndiscrete-time data may result in biased estimators of the discrete-time models.\nThe Python package PyDTS, for simulating, estimating and evaluating\nsemi-parametric competing-risks models for discrete-time survival data, is\nintroduced.

That is, the uncertainty classes of\nunderlying distributions accommodate disturbances that are of order 1 at the\nusual diffusion scale, as opposed to asymptotically vanishing disturbances\nstudied previously in relation to heavy traffic. A main advantage of the\napproach is that the invariance principle underlying diffusion limits makes it\npossible to define uncertainty classes in terms of the first two moments only.\nThe model we consider is a single server queue with multiple job types. The\nproblem is formulated as a zero sum stochastic game played between the system\ncontroller, who determines scheduling and attempts to minimize an expected\nlinear holding cost, and an adversary, who dynamically controls the service\ntime distributions of arriving jobs, and attempts to maximize the cost. The\nheavy traffic asymptotics of the game are fully solved. It is shown that an\nasymptotically optimal policy for the system controller is to prioritize\naccording to an index rule and for the adversary it is to select distributions\nbased on the system's current workload. The workload-to-distribution feedback\nmapping is determined by an HJB equation, which also characterizes the game's\nlimit value. Unlike in the vast majority of results in the heavy traffic\ntheory, and as a direct consequence of the diffusive size disturbances, the\nlimiting dynamics under asymptotically optimal play are captured by a\nstochastic differential equation where both the drift and the diffusion\ncoefficients may be discontinuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 12:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

The Borda counting algorithm\nsimply counts the cumulative scores for each item from these partial ranking\nobservations. This generalizes a previous work of a similar nature by Shah et\nal. using probabilistic pairwise comparison data. The performance of the Borda\ncounting algorithm critically depends on the associated score separation\n$\\Delta_k$ between the $k$-th item and the $(k+1)$-th item.

Our method is tailored for scenes, which are\nprocedurally constructed, based on a given set of building rules. Rendering of\nlarge scenes normally requires the entire scene available in-core, or\nalternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory\nhierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory\nmanagement, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly.\nThe key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction\nstrategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is\navailable in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is\npopulated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire\nscene. Most of the grid cells are not filled with geometry, only those are\npopulated that are potentially seen by the camera.

The quality of those predictions are\nlimited by the climate drivers for the impact models which are nonlinear and\nhighly variable in nature. One way to estimate the uncertainty of the model\ndrivers is to assess the distribution of ensembles of climate forecasts. To\ncapture the uncertainty in the impact model outputs associated with the\ndistribution of the input climate forecasts, each individual forecast ensemble\nmember has to be propagated through the physical model which can imply high\ncomputational costs. It is therefore desirable to train a surrogate model which\nallows predictions of the uncertainties of the output distribution in ensembles\nof climate drivers, thus reducing resource demands. This study considers a\nclimate driven disease model, the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), which predicts\nthe malaria transmission coefficient R0. Seasonal ensembles forecasts of\ntemperature and precipitation with a 6-month horizon are propagated through the\nmodel, predicting the distribution of transmission time series. The input and\noutput data is used to train surrogate models in the form of a Random Forest\nQuantile Regression (RFQR) model and a Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)\nneural network. Comparing the predictive performance, the RFQR better predicts\nthe time series of the individual ensemble member, while the BLSTM offers a\ndirect way to construct a combined distribution for all ensemble members. An\nimportant element of the proposed methodology is that accounting for non-normal\ndistributions of climate forecast ensembles can be captured naturally by a\nBayesian formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 13:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four\nviews that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in\nmammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In\nlight of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods.\nNevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as\nindependent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations\namong them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper we propose a novel\napproach for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized\nhypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our\nnetworks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between\nthe different views that comprise a mammogram, thus mimicking the reading\nprocess performed by clinicians.

Comparison between the optical and X-ray light curves show that\nGRB 201216C is a dark GRB, i.e. the optical emission is significantly absorbed\nand is fainter than expected from the X-ray detections. Our e-MERLIN data also\nshows evidence of diffractive interstellar scintillation. We can study the\ncolumn density along the line-of-sight to the GRB in both the host galaxy, from\nthe damped optical light curve, and the Milky Way, via scintillation studies.\nWe find that the afterglow is best modelled using a jet-cocoon geometry within\na stellar wind environment. Fitting the data with a multi-component model we\nestimate that the optical, X-ray and higher-frequency radio data before ~25days\noriginates from an ultra-relativistic jet with an isotropic equivalent kinetic\nenergy of (0.6-10)x10^52erg and an opening angle of ~1-9deg. The\nlower-frequency radio emission detected by MeerKAT, from day 28 onwards, is\nproduced by the cocoon with a kinetic energy that is between two and seven\norders of magnitude lower (0.02-50)x10^48erg. The energies of the two\ncomponents are comparable to those derived in simulations of such scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 13:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

In this work, we\npresent a large-scale evaluation of modeling choices and their impact on\nzero-shot generalization. In particular, we focus on text-to-text models and\nexperiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and\nencoder-decoder), trained with two different pretraining objectives\n(autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without\nmultitask prompted finetuning.

These defects are called kinks. They are solutions\nof scalar field theories with localized energy which propagate without losing\nits shape. In order to understand the resonance phenomenon exhibited by those\nmodels, we built a toy model where the kink's vibrational mode turns into a\nquasinormal mode. This causes the suppression of resonance windows and,\nconsequently, its fractal structure is lost. Considering a higher order\npolynomial as the scalar field potential, we find kinks with long-range tails,\nwhich decay as a power law. We developed a numerical method to correctly\ninitialize this systems and applied it to a scalar field model containing kinks\nwith long-range tails in both sides. After the collision, the kink-antikink\npair is annihilated for velocities below an ultra-relativistic critical\nvelocity without bion formation. We also investigated a collision between\nwobbling kinks of the double sine-Gordon model. When the kinks are already\nwobbling before colliding, there appears resonance windows with separation\nafter a single bounce. On the second half of the thesis, we focused on\nfermion-kink interactions. We studied what happens when a fermion binds to a\nwobbling kink. The result is that the fermion escapes from the kink as\nradiation and at a constant rate. This occurs if the energy gap between the\ninitial state and the continuum threshold is not too large. Lastly, we\ninvestigated the interaction of a fermion with a background scalar field with\nan impurity that preserves half of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS)\nproperty.

The POLAR\ninstrument was designed as a dedicated transient gamma-ray polarimeter.

A framework is developed here for the unambiguous\ncalculation of momentum flux profiles produced by trapped lee waves, which\ncircumvents the difficulties plaguing the inviscid trapped lee wave theory.\nUsing linear theory, and taking Scorer's two-layer atmosphere as an example,\nthe waves are assumed to be subject to a small dissipation, expressed as a\nRayleigh damping. The resulting wave pattern decays downstream, so the momentum\nflux profile integrated over the area occupied by the waves converges to a\nwell-defined form. Remarkably, for weak dissipation, this form is independent\nof the value of Rayleigh damping coefficient, and the inviscid drag, determined\nin previous studies, is recovered as the momentum flux at the surface. The\ndivergence of this momentum flux profile accounts for the areally-integrated\ndrag exerted by the waves on the atmosphere.

In the\ncontext of the monitoring of potassium, there is the need for a dynamic model\nthat can be used in clinical practice to assess the risk of death related to an\nobserved patient's potassium trajectory.

As a consequence, a novel dynamic survival approach is proposed in\nthis work for the monitoring of potassium in heart failure.

In this paper, we contribute to this\nline of research by studying gender disparity, at scale, in copyright-expired\nliterary texts published in the pre-modern period (defined in this work as the\nperiod ranging from the mid-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century).

It will\nconsist of 512 stations each composed of 256 dual-polarised antennas, and the\nsensitivity of an individual station is pivotal to the performance of the\nentire SKA-Low telescope. The answer to the question in the title is, it\ndepends. The sensitivity of a low frequency array, such as an SKA-Low station,\ndepends strongly on the pointing direction of the digitally formed station beam\nand the local sidereal time (LST), and is different for the two orthogonal\npolarisations of the antennas. The accurate prediction of the SKA-Low\nsensitivity in an arbitrary direction in the sky is crucial for future\nobservation planning. We present here a sensitivity calculator for the SKA-Low\nradio telescope, using a database of pre-computed sensitivity values for two\nrealisations of an SKA-Low station architecture. One realisation uses the\nlog-periodic antennas selected for SKA-Low. The second uses a known benchmark,\nin the form of the bowtie dipoles of the MWA. Data collected by both stations\n(deployed at the MRO in 2019) were used to measure their sensitivity at\nselected frequencies and over at least 24 h intervals, and were compared to the\npredictions described in this paper.

It is thought that intratumor heterogeneity is one of the\nleading determinants of therapeutic resistance and treatment failure. While\nunderstanding antigen heterogeneity is important for effective therapeutics, a\ngood therapy strategy could enhance the therapy efficiency. In this work we\nintroduce an agent-based model to rationalize the outcomes of two types of ACT\ntherapies over heterogeneous tumors: antigen specific ACT therapy and\nmulti-antigen recognition ACT therapy. We found that one dose of antigen\nspecific ACT therapy should be expected to reduce the tumor size as well as its\ngrowth rate, however it may not be enough to completely eliminate it. A second\ndose also reduced the tumor size as well as the tumor growth rate, but, due to\nthe intratumor heterogeneity, it turned out to be less effective than the\nprevious dose. Moreover, an interesting emergent phenomenon results from the\nsimulations, namely the formation of a shield-like structure of cells with low\noncoprotein expression. This shield turns out to protect cells with high\noncoprotein expression. On the other hand, our studies suggest that the earlier\nthe multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy is applied, the more efficient it\nturns. In fact, it could completely eliminate the tumor. Based on our results,\nit is clear that a proper therapeutic strategy could enhance the therapies\noutcomes. In that direction, our computational approach provides a framework to\nmodel treatment combinations in different scenarios and explore the\ncharacteristics of successful and unsuccessful treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 15:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Most existing bias investigation techniques are either\ninapplicable to general image classification tasks or require significant user\nefforts in perusing all data subgroups to manually specify which data\nattributes to inspect. We present VisCUIT, an interactive visualization system\nthat reveals how and why a CNN classifier is biased. VisCUIT visually\nsummarizes the subgroups on which the classifier underperforms and helps users\ndiscover and characterize the cause of the underperformances by revealing image\nconcepts responsible for activating neurons that contribute to\nmisclassifications. VisCUIT runs in modern browsers and is open-source,\nallowing people to easily access and extend the tool to other model\narchitectures and datasets.

The phase field\nmethod for fracture transforms the crack nucleation problem into a minimization\nproblem of the sum of the elastic potential energy and the crack surface\nenergy. Due to the polyconvexity of the formulation, starting from a crackless\nsolid, a standard Newton iteration may lead to a solution with no crack, even\nthough a cracked solution has a lower total energy. As such, the critical load\nfor cracking is highly overestimated. Here, we propose an algorithm termed\n\"parallel universe\" algorithm to capture the global minimum. This algorithm has\ntwo key ingredients: (a) a necessary condition for cracking solely based on the\ncurrent crackless solution, and (b) beginning from when this condition is met,\nNewton iteration with two initial guesses, a crackles one and a cracked one,\nwill both be performed and the converged candidate solution with lower energy\nis accepted as the solution at that load step. Once the cracked candidate\nsolution is accepted, the crackless one is discarded, i.e., only one universe\nis retained. This cracked initial guess is obtained only once for all load\nsteps by solving a series of similar minimization problems with a progressively\nreduced critical crack energy release rate. Numerical examples with isotropic\nand anisotropic critical crack energy release rates indicate that the proposed\nalgorithm is more reliable (as there is no need to retrace) and more efficient\nthan the standard Newton iteration and a well-known backtracking algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 06:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-30"}

We believe that the AutoFi\ntakes a huge step toward automatic WiFi sensing without any developer\nengagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 04:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 14:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

The study of complex systems' persistence involves different\ndefinitions and uses different techniques, depending on whether short-term or\nlong-term persistence is considered. In this paper we discuss the most\nimportant definitions, concepts, methods, literature and latest results on\npersistence in complex systems. Firstly, the most used definitions of\npersistence in short-term and long-term cases are presented. The most relevant\nmethods to characterize persistence are then discussed in both cases. A\ncomplete literature review is also carried out. We also present and discuss\nsome relevant results on persistence, and give empirical evidence of\nperformance in different detailed case studies, for both short-term and\nlong-term persistence. A perspective on the future of persistence concludes the\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 22:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}
