A model example is unconventional superconductivity, which\nis widely believed to arise from the coupling of electrons via spin\nexcitations. In cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the interplay of\ncharge and spin degrees of freedom is also reflected in a zoo of charge and\nspin-density wave orders that are intertwined with superconductivity. A key\nquestion is whether the different types of density waves merely coexist or are\nindeed directly coupled. Here we use a novel neutron diffraction technique with\nsuperior beam-focusing that allows us to probe the subtle spin-density wave\norder in the prototypical high-temperature superconductor La1.88Sr0.12CuO4\nunder applied uniaxial pressure to demonstrate that it is immediately coupled\nwith charge-density wave order. Our result shows that suitable models for\nhigh-temperature superconductivity must equally account for charge and spin\ndegrees of freedom via uniaxial charge-spin stripe fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

However, there has been confusion in the\nliterature regarding the physical condition for the RS formation, and the role\nof magnetic fields in the RS dynamics in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime is\nnot fully understood. Exploiting the shock jump conditions, we characterize the\nproperties of a magnetized RS. We compare the RS dynamics and forming\nconditions from different theories and numerical simulations, and reconcile the\ndiscrepancies among them. The strict RS forming condition is found to be\n$\\sigma < \\sigma_\\mathrm{cr}=(8/3)\\gamma_4^2(n_1/n_4)$, where $n_4$ and $n_1$\nare the rest-frame number densities of the ejecta and the ambient medium,\nrespectively, $\\gamma_4$ is the bulk Lorentz factor, and $\\sigma_\\mathrm{cr}$\nis the critical magnetization. Contrary to previous claims, we prove that this\ncondition agrees with other theoretical and simulated results, which can be\nfurther applied to the setup and consistency check of future numerical\nsimulations. Using this condition, we propose a characteristic radius for RS\nformation, and categorize the magnetized shell into three regimes: 'thick\nshell' (relativistic RS), 'thin shell' (trans-relativistic RS), and 'no RS'\nregimes. The critical magnetization $\\sigma_\\mathrm{cr}$ is generally below\nunity for thin shells, but can potentially reaches $\\sim 100-1000$ in the\n'thick shell' regime.

In a market of\nmobility sharing comprised of TNCs, there are two competing principles, the\neconomies of network scale and the healthy competition between TNCs, which can\nlead to \"segmentation\" of market. To understand the substantiality and\nrelationship of the two competing principles, we need to answer how much\nefficiency loss is generated due to the segmentation of market, and which\nfactors are related to it. Here we show how four critical factors of market\nstructure and characteristics of mobility sharing services -- density of trips\n(thickness), maximum detour allowed for sharing (tightness), market shares\n(unevenness), and spatial segregation of the TNCs (dissolvedness) -- are\nassociated with the efficiency loss, represented as the difference in vehicle\nmiles traveled (VMT) under different market structures.

This\ngeneralizes the policy to novel object instances within the same category. To\ntrain the policy, we propose a novel imitation learning objective jointly with\na geometric representation learning objective using our demonstrations. By\nexperimenting with relocating diverse objects in simulation, we show that our\napproach outperforms baselines with a large margin when manipulating novel\nobjects. We also ablate the importance on 3D object representation learning for\nmanipulation.

However, most of FL algorithms are either based on reliable\ncommunications or assume fixed and known unreliability characteristics. In\npractice, networks could suffer from dynamic channel conditions and\nnon-deterministic disruptions, with time-varying and unknown characteristics.\nTo this end, in this paper we propose a sparsity enabled FL framework with both\ncommunication efficiency and bias reduction, termed as SAFARI. It makes novel\nuse of a similarity among client models to rectify and compensate for bias that\nis resulted from unreliable communications. More precisely, sparse learning is\nimplemented on local clients to mitigate communication overhead, while to cope\nwith unreliable communications, a similarity-based compensation method is\nproposed to provide surrogates for missing model updates. We analyze SAFARI\nunder bounded dissimilarity and with respect to sparse models. It is\ndemonstrated that SAFARI under unreliable communications is guaranteed to\nconverge at the same rate as the standard FedAvg with perfect communications.\nImplementations and evaluations on CIFAR-10 dataset validate the effectiveness\nof SAFARI by showing that it can achieve the same convergence speed and\naccuracy as FedAvg with perfect communications, with up to 80% of the model\nweights being pruned and a high percentage of client updates missing in each\nround.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 16:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

First, we show that the\nHamiltonian of a helical spin chain on a superconductor can be mapped to an\neffective Hamiltonian reminiscent of a semiconductor nanowire with strong\nRashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular, we show that a varying rotation rate\nbetween neighbouring magnetic moments maps to smooth non-uniform potentials in\nthe effective nanowire Hamiltonian. Previously it has been found that trivial\nzero-energy states are abundant in nanowire systems with smooth potentials.\nTherefore, we perform an extensive search for zero-energy bound states in\nhelical spin chain systems with varying rotation rates. Although bound states\nwith near zero-energy do exist for certain dimensionalities and rotation\nprofiles, we find that zero-energy bound states are far less prevalent than in\nsemiconductor nanowire systems with equivalent non-uniformities.

Recent\nstate-of-the-art GNN-based CF approaches simply attribute their performance\nimprovement to the high-order neighbor aggregation ability of GNNs. However, we\nobserve that some powerful deep GNNs such as JKNet and DropEdge, can\neffectively exploit high-order neighbor information on other graph tasks but\nperform poorly on CF tasks, which conflicts with the explanation of these\nGNN-based CF research.

Composites of the MJO show that upper\ntropospheric ice cloud fraction and water vapor anomalies are generally\ncollocated, and that an eastward tilt with height in cloud fraction exists.\nThrough radiative transfer calculations, it is shown that ice clouds have a\nstronger tropospheric radiative forcing than do water vapor anomalies,\nhighlighting the importance of incorporating upper tropospheric/lower\nstratospheric processes into simple models of the MJO. The coupled\ntroposphere-stratosphere linear model previously developed by the authors is\nextended by including a mean wind in the stratosphere and a prognostic equation\nfor cirrus clouds, which are forced dynamically and allowed to modulate\ntropospheric radiative cooling, similar to the effect of tropospheric water\nvapor in previous formulations.

Under varying\nstratospheric wind and interactive cirrus cloud radiation, the MJO-like mode\nhas weaker growth rates under stratospheric westerlies than easterlies,\nconsistent with the observed MJO-QBO relationship.

Many molecular\nline ratios in NGC4526, along with our inferred abundances and CO/H2 conversion\nfactors, are similar to those found in nearby spirals. One striking exception\nis the very low observed 12CO/13CO(1-0) line ratio, $3.4\\pm0.3$, which is\nunusually low for spirals though not for Virgo Cluster early-type galaxies. We\ncarry out radiative transfer modeling of the CO isotopologues with some\narchival (2-1) data, and we use Bayesian analysis with Markov chain Monte Carlo\ntechniques to infer the physical properties of the CO-emitting gas. We find\nsurprisingly low [12CO/13CO] abundance ratios of $7.8^{+2.7}_{-1.5}$ and\n$6.5^{+3.0}_{-1.3}$ at radii of 0.4 kpc and 1 kpc. The emission from the\nhigh-density tracers HCN, HCO+, HNC, CS and CN is also relatively bright, and\nCN is unusually optically thick in the inner parts of NGC4526. These features\nhint that processing in the cluster environment may have removed much of the\ngalaxy's relatively diffuse, optically thinner molecular gas along with its\natomic gas. Angular momentum transfer to the surrounding intracluster medium\nmay also have caused contraction of the disk, magnifying radial gradients such\nas we find in [13CO/C18O]. More detailed chemical evolution modeling would be\ninteresting in order to explore whether the unusual [12CO/13CO] abundance ratio\nis entirely an environmental effect or whether it also reflects the relatively\nold stellar population in this early-type galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 17:41:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 19:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

The high resource demand of speech emotion recognition\nmodels, combined with the the general scarcity of emotion-labelled data are\nobstacles to the development and application of effective solutions in this\nfield. In this paper, we present an approach to jointly circumvent these\ndifficulties. Our method, named RH-emo, is a novel semi-supervised architecture\naimed at extracting quaternion embeddings from real-valued monoaural\nspectrograms, enabling the use of quaternion-valued networks for speech emotion\nrecognition tasks. RH-emo is a hybrid real/quaternion autoencoder network that\nconsists of a real-valued encoder in parallel to a real-valued emotion\nclassifier and a quaternion-valued decoder. On the one hand, the classifier\npermits to optimize each latent axis of the embeddings for the classification\nof a specific emotion-related characteristic: valence, arousal, dominance and\noverall emotion. On the other hand, the quaternion reconstruction enables the\nlatent dimension to develop intra-channel correlations that are required for an\neffective representation as a quaternion entity. We test our approach on speech\nemotion recognition tasks using four popular datasets: Iemocap, Ravdess, EmoDb\nand Tess, comparing the performance of three well-established real-valued CNN\narchitectures (AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG) and their quaternion-valued equivalent\nfed with the embeddings created with RH-emo.

In this paper, we extensively studied\nthe collective processes of a mono-energetic electron beam emitted from a\nthermionic cathode propagating through a cold plasma by performing a large\nnumber of high resolution two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations and using analytical theories. We confirm that the initial stage of\ntwo-stream instability is saturated due to well-known wave-trapping mechanism.\nFurther evolution occurs due to strong wave-wave nonlinear processes. We show\nthat the beam-plasma interaction can be classified into four different physical\nregimes in the parameter space for the plasma and beam parameters. The\ndifferences between the different regimes are analyzed in detail. For the first\ntime, we identified a new regime in strong Langmuir turbulence featured by what\nwe call Electron Modulational Instability (EMI) that could create a local\nLangmuir wave packet growing faster than the ion plasma frequency. Ions do not\nhave time to respond to EMI in the initial growing stage. On a longer\ntimescale, the action of the ponderomotive force produces very strong ion\ndensity perturbations, and eventually the beam-plasma wave interaction stops\nbeing resonant due to strong ion density perturbations. Consequently, in this\nEMI regime, electron beam-plasma interaction occurs in a periodic\n(intermittent) process. The beams are strongly scattered by waves, and the\nLangmuir wave spectrum is significantly broadened, which in turn gives rise to\nstrong heating of bulk electrons. A resulting kappa distribution and a\nwave-energy spectrum, E^2 (k)~k^(-5), are observed in the strong turbulent\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 18:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 06:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Prior work has shown that a\nrobot that can assess its performance can alter human perception of the robot\nand decisions on control allocation. There is also significant evidence in\nrobotics that accurately setting human expectations is critical, especially\nwhen proficiency is below human expectations. Moreover, proficiency assessment\ndepends on context and intent, and a human teammate might increase or decrease\nperformance standards, adapt tolerance for risk and uncertainty, demand\npredictive assessments that affect attention allocation, or otherwise reassess\nor adapt intent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 18:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

A personalized voice\ntrigger score is then obtained as a similarity score between the embeddings of\nenrollment utterances and a test utterance. The personalized embedding allows\nadapting to target speaker's speech when computing the voice trigger score,\nhence improving voice trigger detection accuracy.

Typically, these attacks leverage machine learning\napproaches, but assessing the realism of the threat space has lagged behind the\npace of machine learning advancements, due in-part, to the challenges in\ncurating large real-life datasets. We aim to overcome the challenge of having\nlimited number of real data by introducing a video domain adaptation technique\nthat is able to leverage synthetic data through supervised disentangled\nlearning. Specifically, for a given domain, we decompose the observed data into\ntwo factors of variation: Style and Content. Doing so provides four learned\nrepresentations: real-life style, synthetic style, real-life content and\nsynthetic content. Then, we combine them into feature representations from all\ncombinations of style-content pairings across domains, and train a model on\nthese combined representations to classify the content (i.e., labels) of a\ngiven datapoint in the style of another domain. We evaluate our method on\nreal-life data using a variety of metrics to quantify the amount of information\nan attacker is able to recover. We show that our method prevents our model from\noverfitting to a small real-life training set, indicating that our method is an\neffective form of data augmentation, thereby making keystroke inference attacks\nmore practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 21:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Although FL preserves local data privacy to some extent, it has been\nshown that information about clients' data can still be inferred from model\nupdates. In recent years, various privacy-preserving schemes have been\ndeveloped to address this privacy leakage. However, they often provide privacy\nat the expense of model performance or system efficiency, and balancing these\ntradeoffs is a crucial challenge when implementing FL schemes. In this\nmanuscript, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) framework\nbuilt on the synergy of matrix encryption and system immersion tools from\ncontrol theory. The idea is to immerse the learning algorithm, a Stochastic\nGradient Decent (SGD), into a higher-dimensional system (the so-called target\nsystem) and design the dynamics of the target system so that: the trajectories\nof the original SGD are immersed/embedded in its trajectories, and it learns on\nencrypted data (here we use random matrix encryption). Matrix encryption is\nreformulated at the server as a random change of coordinates that maps original\nparameters to a higher-dimensional parameter space and enforces that the target\nSGD converges to an encrypted version of the original SGD optimal solution. The\nserver decrypts the aggregated model using the left inverse of the immersion\nmap. We show that our algorithm provides the same level of accuracy and\nconvergence rate as the standard FL with a negligible computation cost while\nrevealing no information about the clients' data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 21:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 11:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

We investigate the relative importance of\ndifferent energy terms (kinetic, thermal, magnetic, and gravity - both\nself-gravity and tidal forces) for the formation and evolution of molecular\nclouds and their sub-structures based on the SILCC-Zoom simulations. These\nsimulations follow the self-consistent formation of cold molecular clouds down\nto scales of 0.1 pc from the diffuse supernova-driven interstellar medium in a\nstratified galactic disc. We study the time evolution of seven molecular clouds\n(five with magnetic fields and two without) for 1.5-2 Myr. Using a dendrogram,\nwe identify hierarchical 3D sub-structures inside the clouds with the aim to\nunderstand their dynamics and distinguish between the theories of\ngravo-turbulent fragmentation and global hierarchical collapse. The virial\nanalysis shows that the dense gas is indeed dominated by the interplay of\ngravity and turbulence, while magnetic fields and thermal pressure are only\nimportant for fluffy, atomic structures. Over time, gravitationally bound\nsub-structures emerge from a marginally bound medium (viral ratio $1 \\leq\n\\alpha_{\\rm vir}^{\\rm vol} <2$) as a result of large-scale supernova-driven\ninflows rather than global collapse. A detailed tidal analysis shows that the\ntidal tensor is highly anisotropic. Yet the tidal forces are generally not\nstrong enough to disrupt either large-scale or dense sub-structures but cause\ntheir deformation. By comparing tidal and crossing time scales, we find that\ntidal forces do not seem to be the main driver of turbulence within the\nmolecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 22:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

With the proliferation of large pretrained\nlanguage models, Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has emerged as a new\nparadigm for event extraction in recent times.

The question of whether it is possible to design a\nsingle test for multiple requirements of the system motivates this work. First,\nwe formally define three attributes of a test: a test specification that\ncharacterizes behaviors observed in a test execution, a test environment, and a\ntest policy. Using the merge operator from contract-based design theory, we\nprovide a formalism to construct a merged test specification from two unit test\nspecifications. Temporal constraints on the merged test specification guarantee\nthat non-trivial satisfaction of both unit test specifications is necessary for\na successful merged test execution. We assume that the test environment remains\nthe same across the unit tests and the merged test. Given a test specification\nand a test environment, we synthesize a test policy filter using a receding\nhorizon approach, and use the test policy filter to guide a search procedure\n(e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search) to find a test policy that is guaranteed to\nsatisfy the test specification. This search procedure finds a test policy that\nmaximizes a pre-defined robustness metric for the test while the filter\nguarantees a test policy for satisfying the test specification. We prove that\nour algorithm is sound. Furthermore, the receding horizon approach to\nsynthesizing the filter ensures that our algorithm is scalable. Finally, we\nshow that merging unit tests is impactful for designing efficient test\ncampaigns to achieve similar levels of coverage in fewer test executions.

Because these systems are inherently\nout-of-equilibrium, they pose a range of mathematical challenges. In this\narticle, we investigate how they respond to external perturbations and develop\na new theory that extends the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,\na powerful tool from statistical mechanics which connects the response of a\nsystem to thermodynamic fluctuations. We apply our theory to two paradigmatic\nexamples that span vastly different fields - a birth-death process in forest\necosystems and a targeted search on DNA by proteins. These systems can be\naffected by perturbations which increase their rate of extinction/absorption,\neven though the average or the variance of population sizes are left\nunmodified.

Until recently, the primary focus for\nastrophysical parameter inference from the 21-cm signal centred on the power\nspectrum (PS). However, the cosmic 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian\nrendering the PS sub-optimal for characterising the cosmic signal. In this\nwork, we introduce a new technique to analyse the non-Gaussian information in\nimages of the 21-cm signal called the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST). This\napproach closely mirrors that of convolutional neural networks with the added\nadvantage of not requiring tuning or training of a neural network. Instead, it\ncompresses the 2D spatial information into a set of coefficients making it\neasier to interpret while also providing a robust statistical description of\nthe non-Gaussian information contained in the cosmic 21-cm signal. First, we\nexplore the application of the WST to mock 21-cm images to gain valuable\nphysical insights by comparing to the known behaviour from the 21-cm PS. Then\nwe quantitatively explore the WST applied to the 21-cm signal by extracting\nastrophysical parameter constraints using Fisher Matrices from a realistic 1000\nhr mock observation with the Square Kilometre Array. We find that: (i) the WST\napplied only to 2D images can outperform the 3D spherically averaged 21-cm PS,\n(ii) the excision of foreground contaminated modes can degrade the constraining\npower by a factor of ~1.5-2 with the WST and (iii) higher cadences between the\n21-cm images can further improve the constraining power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 02:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

We call these bugs as \"stateful\" bugs. Usually,\nwhen we are testing a protocol implementation, we do not have a detailed formal\nspecification of the protocol to rely upon.

A key\nchallenge then is to cover the state space without an explicit specification of\nthe protocol.\n  In this work, we posit that manual annotations for state identification can\nbe avoided for stateful protocol fuzzing. Specifically, we rely on a\nprogrammatic intuition that the state variables used in protocol\nimplementations often appear in enum type variables whose values (the state\nnames) come from named constants. In our analysis of the Top-50 most widely\nused open-source protocol implementations, we found that every implementation\nuses state variables that are assigned named constants (with easy to comprehend\nnames such as INIT, READY) to represent the current state.

In particular, we propose a novel\nframework to explore the 3D Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model of the\nhuman body for gait recognition, named SMPLGait. Our framework has two\nelaborately-designed branches of which one extracts appearance features from\nsilhouettes, the other learns knowledge of 3D viewpoints and shapes from the 3D\nSMPL model.

To every node on a DLTTS is\nattached a tag that represents the 'current' knowledge of the adversary,\nacquired from the responses of the answering mechanism of the DBMS to his/her\nqueries, at the nodes traversed earlier, along any given run; this knowledge is\ncompleted at the same node, with further relational deductions, possibly in\ncombination with 'public' information from other databases given in advance. A\n'blackbox' mechanism is also part of a DLTTS, and it is meant as an oracle; its\nrole is to tell if the private information has been deduced by the adversary at\nthe current node, and if so terminate the run. An additional special feature is\nthat the blackbox also gives information on how 'close', or how 'far', the\nknowledge of the adversary is, from the private information P , at the current\nnode.

This is a paradox in conventional evolutionary\nmulti-objective optimization (EMO) that always aim to achieve a well balance\nbetween convergence and diversity. In essence, the ultimate goal of\nmulti-objective optimization is to help a decision maker (DM) identify\nsolution(s) of interest (SOI) achieving satisfactory trade-offs among multiple\nconflicting criteria. Bearing this in mind, this paper develops a framework for\ndesigning preference-based EMO algorithms to find SOI in an interactive manner.\nIts core idea is to involve human in the loop of EMO. After every several\niterations, the DM is invited to elicit her feedback with regard to a couple of\nincumbent candidates.

However, synthesized persons in\nexisting datasets are mostly cartoon-like and in random dress collocation,\nwhich limits their performance. To address this, in this work, an automatic\napproach is proposed to directly clone the whole outfits from real-world person\nimages to virtual 3D characters, such that any virtual person thus created will\nappear very similar to its real-world counterpart. Specifically, based on UV\ntexture mapping, two cloning methods are designed, namely registered clothes\nmapping and homogeneous cloth expansion. Given clothes keypoints detected on\nperson images and labeled on regular UV maps with clear clothes structures,\nregistered mapping applies perspective homography to warp real-world clothes to\nthe counterparts on the UV map. As for invisible clothes parts and irregular UV\nmaps, homogeneous expansion segments a homogeneous area on clothes as a\nrealistic cloth pattern or cell, and expand the cell to fill the UV map.\nFurthermore, a similarity-diversity expansion strategy is proposed, by\nclustering person images, sampling images per cluster, and cloning outfits for\n3D character generation. This way, virtual persons can be scaled up densely in\nvisual similarity to challenge model learning, and diversely in population to\nenrich sample distribution. Finally, by rendering the cloned characters in\nUnity3D scenes, a more realistic virtual dataset called ClonedPerson is\ncreated, with 5,621 identities and 887,766 images.

Non-deterministic\nobservation is a general observation model that includes the case of\nintermittent loss of observations. In this setting, upon the occurrence of an\nevent, the sensor reading may be non-deterministic such that a set of output\nsymbols are all possible. Existing works on fault diagnosis under\nnon-deterministic observations require to consider all possible observation\nrealizations.

In this work, we introduce the concept of\noutput fairness by requiring that, for any output symbols, if it has infinite\nchances to be generated, then it will indeed be generated infinite number of\ntimes. We use an assume-guarantee type of linear temporal logic formulas to\nformally describe this assumption. A new notion called output-fair\ndiagnosability (OF-diagnosability) is proposed. An effective approach is\nprovided for the verification of OF-diagnosability.

The connection between both worlds is typically\nestablished with log messages: the developer provides hints to the (unknown)\noperator, where the cause of an occurred issue is, and vice versa, the operator\ncan report bugs during operation. To fulfil this purpose, developers write log\ninstructions that are structured text commonly composed of a log level (e.g.,\n\"info\", \"error\"), static text (\"IP {} cannot be reached\"), and dynamic\nvariables (e.g. IP {}). However, as opposed to well-adopted coding practices,\nthere are no widely adopted guidelines on how to write log instructions with\ngood quality properties. For example, a developer may assign a high log level\n(e.g., \"error\") for a trivial event that can confuse the operator and increase\nmaintenance costs. Or the static text can be insufficient to hint at a specific\nissue. In this paper, we address the problem of log quality assessment and\nprovide the first step towards its automation. We start with an in-depth\nanalysis of quality log instruction properties in nine software systems and\nidentify two quality properties: 1) correct log level assignment assessing the\ncorrectness of the log level, and 2) sufficient linguistic structure assessing\nthe minimal richness of the static text necessary for verbose event\ndescription. Based on these findings, we developed a data-driven approach that\nadapts deep learning methods for each of the two properties.

State-of-the-art methods utilize both\nvisual cues and linguistic knowledge to tackle this challenging problem.\nSpecifically, they propose iterative language modeling module (IterLM) to\nrepeatedly refine the output sequence from the visual modeling module (VM).\nThough achieving promising results, the vision modeling module has become the\nperformance bottleneck of these methods. In this paper, we newly propose\niterative vision modeling module (IterVM) to further improve the STR accuracy.\nSpecifically, the first VM directly extracts multi-level features from the\ninput image, and the following VMs re-extract multi-level features from the\ninput image and fuse them with the high-level (i.e., the most semantic one)\nfeature extracted by the previous VM. By combining the proposed IterVM with\niterative language modeling module, we further propose a powerful scene text\nrecognizer called IterNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nIterVM can significantly improve the scene text recognition accuracy,\nespecially on low-quality scene text images.

In reality, the prosperity of FL is largely due to a centralized\nframework called FedAvg, in which workers are in charge of model training and\nservers are in control of model aggregation. However, FedAvg's centralized\nworker-server architecture has raised new concerns, be it the low scalability\nof the cluster, the risk of data leakage, and the failure or even defection of\nthe central server. To overcome these problems, we propose Decentralized\nFederated Trusted Averaging (DeFTA), a decentralized FL framework that serves\nas a plug-and-play replacement for FedAvg, instantly bringing better security,\nscalability, and fault-tolerance to the federated learning process after\ninstallation. In principle, it fundamentally resolves the above-mentioned\nissues from an architectural perspective without compromises or tradeoffs,\nprimarily consisting of a new model aggregating formula with theoretical\nperformance analysis, and a decentralized trust system (DTS) to greatly improve\nsystem robustness.

The precondition for\nautomation is the availability of observability tools, with system logs\ncommonly being used. The focus of this paper is log-based failure\nidentification. This problem is challenging because of the instability of the\nlog data and the incompleteness of the explicit logging failure coverage within\nthe code. To address the two challenges, we present CLog as a method for\nfailure identification. The key idea presented herein based is on our\nobservation that by representing the log data as sequences of subprocesses\ninstead of sequences of log events, the effect of the unstable log data is\nreduced. CLog introduces a novel subprocess extraction method that uses\ncontext-aware neural network and clustering methods to extract meaningful\nsubprocesses. The direct modeling of log event contexts allows the\nidentification of failures with respect to the abrupt context changes,\naddressing the challenge of insufficient logging failure coverage. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the learned subprocesses representations\nreduce the instability in the input, allowing CLog to outperform the baselines\non the failure identification subproblems - 1) failure detection by 9-24% on F1\nscore and 2) failure type identification by 7% on the macro averaged F1 score.\nFurther analysis shows the existent negative correlation between the\ninstability in the input event sequences and the detection performance in a\nmodel-agnostic manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 07:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

We demonstrate that the\npositivity requirement is essentially due to a quadratic form. We prove several\nkey characterizations for the new form in a generic way (with an operator\nparameter). We establish the optimal choice of parameter for the\nDouglas-Rachford type methods by solving a simple unconstrained optimization\nproblem. The optimality is in the sense that a non-ergodic worst-case\nconvergence rate bound is minimized. We provide closed-form optimal choices for\nscalar and orthogonal matrix parameters under zero initialization.\nAdditionally, a simple self-contained proof of a sharp linear convergence rate\nfor a $ (1/L) $-cocoercive fixed-point sequence with $ L\\in(0,1) $ is provided\n(as a preliminary result).\n  To our knowledge, an operator parameter is new.

However,\nchallenges arises for clustering networks with increased scale. This paper\nproposes a solution which consists of two motif clustering techniques: standard\nacceleration CHIEF-ST and approximate acceleration CHIEF-AP. Both algorithms\nfirst find the maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs within the target networks to\nlower the network scale, then employ higher-order motifs in clustering. In the\nfirst procedure, we propose to lower the network scale by optimizing the\nnetwork structure with maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs. For CHIEF-ST, we\nillustrate that all target motifs will be kept after this procedure when the\nminimum node degree of the target motif is equal or greater than k. For\nCHIEF-AP, we prove that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix and the\nLaplacian matrix are relatively stable after this step. That is, CHIEF-ST has\nno influence on motif clustering, whereas CHIEF-AP introduces limited yet\nacceptable impact. In the second procedure, we employ higher-order motifs,\ni.e., heterogeneous four-node motifs clustering in higher-order dense networks.\nThe contributions of CHIEF are two-fold: (1) improved efficiency of motif\nclustering for big networks; (2) verification of higher-order motif\nsignificance. The proposed solutions are found to outperform baseline\napproaches according to experiments on real and synthetic networks, which\ndemonstrates CHIEF's strength in large network analysis. Meanwhile,\nhigher-order motifs are proved to perform better than traditional triangle\nmotifs in clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 08:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

This setting is often referred to as the data fusion\nproblem, which differs from traditional missing data problems since no complete\ndata is observed for any subject. We consider a regression analysis when the\noutcome variable and some covariates are collected from two different sources.\nBy leveraging the common variables observed in both data sets, doubly robust\nestimation procedures are proposed in the literature to protect against\npossible model misspecifications. However, they employ only a single propensity\nscore model for the data fusion process and a single imputation model for the\ncovariates available in one data set. It may be questionable to assume that\neither model is correctly specified in practice.

In this work, we propose an asymmetrical model for Cas A, consisting\nof a fast moving jet-like structure and a slowly expanding isotropic shell.\nThis model can account for the multi-wavelength spectra of Cas A, especially\nfor the power-law hard X-ray spectrum from $\\sim$ 60 to 220 keV. The GeV to TeV\nemission from Cas A should be contributed by both hadronic and leptonic\nprocesses. Moreover, the jet-like structure may produce a gamma-ray flux of\n$\\sim 10^{-13}\\rm erg\\ cm^{-2}\\ s^{-1}$ at $\\sim 100$ TeV, to be examined by\nLHAASO and CTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 08:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

In this work,\nwe aim to alleviate this limitation by refining a one-fits-all model using a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The architecture consists of multiple\n(expert) RNN models covering patient sub-populations and refining the\npredictions of the base model. That is, instead of training expert RNN models\nfrom scratch we define them on the residual signal that attempts to model the\ndifferences from the population-wide model. The heterogeneity of various\npatient sequences is modeled through multiple experts that consist of RNN.\nParticularly, instead of directly training MoE from scratch, we augment MoE\nbased on the prediction signal from pretrained base GRU model. With this way,\nthe mixture of experts can provide flexible adaptation to the (limited)\npredictive power of the single base RNN model.

Depending on the background electric field, we observe accelerating,\nsteady and fading negative streamers. Fading occurs in low background fields,\nin which negative streamers undergo a streamer-to-avalanche transition: their\nfield enhancement keeps decreasing and the streamer velocity becomes comparable\nto the maximal electron drift velocity. Our focus is on the steady propagation\nmode, during which streamer properties like radius and velocity hardly change.\nHowever, this mode is unstable, in the sense that a small change in conditions\nleads to acceleration or deceleration. We observe steady negative streamers in\nbackground fields ranging from 9.19 kV/cm to 15.75 kV/cm, indicating that there\nis no unique steady propagation field (or stability field). Another finding is\nthat steady negative streamers are able to keep propagating over tens of\ncentimeters, with only a finite conductive length behind their heads, similar\nto steady positive streamers. Approximately linear relationships are observed\nbetween the optical diameter and properties like the streamer velocity and the\nstreamer head potential. From these linear relations, we obtain rough lower\nbounds of about 0.27 mm to 0.35 mm for the minimal optical diameter of steady\nnegative streamers. The lowest background field in which a steady negative\nstreamer could be obtained is 9.19 kV/cm. In contrast, steady positive\nstreamers have recently been obtained in a background field as low as 4.07\nkV/cm. We find that the properties of steady negative and positive streamers\ndiffer significantly.

The proposed model builds a relationship between the PDE and the\nunderlying processes that the PDE relies on.

Joint species distribution models use\nmulti-species detection-nondetection data to estimate species and community\ndistributions. The analysis of such data is complicated by residual\ncorrelations between species, imperfect detection, and spatial autocorrelation.\nWhile methods exist to accommodate each of these complexities, there are few\nexamples in the literature that address and explore all three complexities\nsimultaneously. Here we developed a spatial factor multi-species occupancy\nmodel to explicitly account for species correlations, imperfect detection, and\nspatial autocorrelation. The proposed model uses a spatial factor dimension\nreduction approach and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes to ensure\ncomputational efficiency for data sets with both a large number of species\n(e.g., > 100) and spatial locations (e.g., 100,000).

Text matching tasks share the same paradigm that\ndetermines the relationship between two given texts. The relationships vary\nfrom task to task, e.g.~relevance in document retrieval, semantic alignment in\nparaphrase identification and answerable judgment in question answering.\nHowever, the essential signals for text matching remain in a finite scope,\ni.e.~exact matching, semantic matching, and inference matching. Ideally, a good\ntext matching model can learn to capture and aggregate these signals for\ndifferent matching tasks to achieve competitive performance, while recent\nstate-of-the-art text matching models, e.g.~Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs),\nare hard to generalize. It is because the end-to-end supervised learning on\ntask-specific dataset makes model overemphasize the data sample bias and\ntask-specific signals instead of the essential matching signals. To overcome\nthis problem, we adopt a specialization-generalization training strategy and\nrefer to it as Match-Prompt.

Languages like P4\nenable to flexibly reprogram the entire packet processing pipeline. Though\nthese devices promise high throughput and ultra-low response times,\nimplementing application-layer tasks in the data plane programming language P4\nis still challenging for an application developer who is not familiar with\nnetworking domain. In this paper, we first identify and examine obstacles and\npain points one can experience when offloading server-based computations to the\nnetwork. Then we present P4RROT, a code generator (in form of a library) which\nallows to overcome these limitations by providing a user-friendly API to\ndescribe computations to be offloaded. After discussing the design choices\nbehind P4RROT, we introduce our proof-of-concept implementation for two P4\ntargets: Netronome SmartNIC and BMv2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 11:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

However, eliminating the\nbackground field in brains containing significant susceptibility sources, such\nas intracranial hemorrhages, is challenging due to the relatively large scale\nof the field induced by these pathological susceptibility sources. Method: This\nstudy proposes a new deep learning-based method, BFRnet, to remove background\nfield in healthy and hemorrhagic subjects. The network is built with the\ndual-frequency octave convolutions on the U-net architecture, trained with\nsynthetic field maps containing significant susceptibility sources. The BFRnet\nmethod is compared with three conventional BFR methods and one previous deep\nlearning method using simulated and in vivo brains from 4 healthy and 2\nhemorrhagic subjects. Robustness against acquisition field-of-view (FOV)\norientation and brain masking are also investigated. Results: For both\nsimulation and in vivo experiments, BFRnet led to the best visually appealing\nresults in the local field and QSM results with the minimum contrast loss and\nthe most accurate hemorrhage susceptibility measurements among all five\nmethods. In addition, BFRnet produced the most consistent local field and\nsusceptibility maps between different sizes of brain masks, while conventional\nmethods depend drastically on precise brain extraction and further brain edge\nerosions. It is also observed that BFRnet performed the best among all BFR\nmethods for acquisition FOVs oblique to the main magnetic field. Conclusion:\nThe proposed BFRnet improved the accuracy of local field reconstruction in the\nhemorrhagic subjects compared with conventional BFR algorithms. The BFRnet\nmethod was effective for acquisitions of titled orientations and retained whole\nbrains without edge erosion as often required by traditional BFR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 12:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

A crucial first step of\nsuch an analysis is the identification of suitable and relevant input\ncoordinates (the so-called features), such as backbone dihedral angles and\ninterresidue distances. As typically only a small subset of those coordinates\nis involved in a specific biomolecular process, it is important to discard the\nremaining uncorrelated motions or weakly correlated noise coordinates. This is\nbecause they may exhibit large amplitudes or long timescales and therefore will\nbe erroneously be considered important by PCA and TICA, respectively. To\ndiscriminate collective motions underlying functional dynamics from\nuncorrelated motions, the correlation matrix of the input coordinates is\nblock-diagonalized by a clustering method. This strategy avoids possible bias\ndue to presumed functional observables and conformational states or variation\nprinciples that maximize variance or timescales.

These new datasets differ\nsubstantially in four aspects of complexity: 1. Chemical diversity (number of\ndifferent elements), 2. system size (number of atoms per sample), 3. dataset\nsize (number of data samples), and 4. domain shift (similarity of the training\nand test set). Despite these large differences, benchmarks on small and narrow\ndatasets remain the predominant method of demonstrating progress in graph\nneural networks (GNNs) for molecular simulation, likely due to cheaper training\ncompute requirements. This raises the question -- does GNN progress on small\nand narrow datasets translate to these more complex datasets? This work\ninvestigates this question by first developing the GemNet-OC model based on the\nlarge Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset. GemNet-OC outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art on OC20 by 16% while reducing training time by a factor of 10.\nWe then compare the impact of 18 model components and hyperparameter choices on\nperformance in multiple datasets. We find that the resulting model would be\ndrastically different depending on the dataset used for making model choices.\nTo isolate the source of this discrepancy we study six subsets of the OC20\ndataset that individually test each of the above-mentioned four dataset\naspects. We find that results on the OC-2M subset correlate well with the full\nOC20 dataset while being substantially cheaper to train on. Our findings\nchallenge the common practice of developing GNNs solely on small datasets, but\nhighlight ways of achieving fast development cycles and generalizable results\nvia moderately-sized, representative datasets such as OC-2M and efficient\nmodels such as GemNet-OC. Our code and pretrained model weights are\nopen-sourced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 12:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 20:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 15:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

First, we present a query language that extends the\nunderlying programming language with wildcards and placeholders, providing an\nintuitive way of formulating queries that is easy to adapt to different\nprogramming languages. Second, to ensure scalability, the approach indexes code\nchanges in a one-time preprocessing step, mapping them into a feature space,\nand then performs an efficient search in the feature space for each query.\nThird, to guarantee precision, i.e., that any returned code change indeed\nmatches the given query, we present a tree-based matching algorithm that checks\nwhether a query can be expanded to a concrete code change.

To overcome the limitations, we propose an implicit\nmotion-compensated network (IMCNet) combining complementary cues\n($\\textit{i.e.}$, appearance and motion) with aligned motion information from\nthe adjacent frames to the current frame at the feature level without\nestimating optical flows. The proposed IMCNet consists of an affinity computing\nmodule (ACM), an attention propagation module (APM), and a motion compensation\nmodule (MCM).

The main contribution of this paper is a frontalization\nmethodology that preserves non-rigid facial deformations in order to boost the\nperformance of visually assisted speech communication. The method alternates\nbetween the estimation of (i)~the rigid transformation (scale, rotation, and\ntranslation) and (ii)~the non-rigid deformation between an arbitrarily-viewed\nface and a face model. The method has two important merits: it can deal with\nnon-Gaussian errors in the data and it incorporates a dynamical face\ndeformation model. For that purpose, we use the generalized Student\nt-distribution in combination with a linear dynamic system in order to account\nfor both rigid head motions and time-varying facial deformations caused by\nspeech production. We propose to use the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation\n(ZNCC) score to evaluate the ability of the method to preserve facial\nexpressions. The method is thoroughly evaluated and compared with several state\nof the art methods, either based on traditional geometric models or on deep\nlearning.

To make up for the absence of source data, most existing\nmethods introduced feature prototype based pseudo-labeling strategies to\nrealize self-training model adaptation. However, feature prototypes are\nobtained by instance-level predictions based feature clustering, which is\ncategory-biased and tends to result in noisy labels since the visual domain\ngaps between source and target are usually different between categories. In\naddition, we found that a monocentric feature prototype may be ineffective to\nrepresent each category and introduce negative transfer, especially for those\nhard-transfer data. To address these issues, we propose a general\nclass-Balanced Multicentric Dynamic prototype (BMD) strategy for the SFDA task.\nSpecifically, for each target category, we first introduce a global inter-class\nbalanced sampling strategy to aggregate potential representative target\nsamples. Then, we design an intra-class multicentric clustering strategy to\nachieve more robust and representative prototypes generation. In contrast to\nexisting strategies that update the pseudo label at a fixed training period, we\nfurther introduce a dynamic pseudo labeling strategy to incorporate network\nupdate information during model adaptation. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed model-agnostic BMD strategy significantly improves representative SFDA\nmethods to yield new state-of-the-art results.

However,\ntheir potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection,\ncommonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate.\nSuch long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by\nanalyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors.\nHere, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity,\nand sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by\nvaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the\ncontext of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around\n190,000 monthly active donors.

While\nBerry curvature and its effects in materials have been studied, detecting\nchanges in the topological invariant, Chern number, is challenging. In this\nregard, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) has emerged as a promising\nplatform to gain electrical control over the Berry curvature hotspots and the\nvalley Chern numbers of its flat bands. In addition, strain induced breaking of\nthe three-fold rotation (C3) symmetry in TDBG, leads to a non-zero first moment\nof Berry curvature called the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which can be sensed\nusing nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect. We reveal, using TDBG, that the BCD detects\ntopological transitions in the bands and changes its sign. In TDBG, the\nperpendicular electric field tunes the valley Chern number and the BCD\nsimultaneously allowing us a tunable system to probe the physics of topological\ntransitions.

Wavefront shaping can undo this\nscrambling, typically one spatial mode at a time - enabling deployment of MMFs\nas ultra-thin micro-endoscopes. In this work we go beyond serial wavefront\nshaping by showing how to simultaneously unscramble all spatial modes emerging\nfrom an MMF in parallel. We introduce a passive multiple-scattering element -\ncrafted through the process of inverse design - that is complementary to an MMF\nand undoes its optical effects. This optical inverter makes possible both\nsingle-shot wide-field imaging and super-resolution imaging through MMFs. Our\ndesign consists of a cascade of diffractive elements, and can be understood\nfrom the perspective of both multi-plane light conversion, and as a physically\ninspired deep diffractive neural network. This physical architecture can\noutperform state-of-the-art electronic neural networks tasked with unscrambling\nlight, as it preserves the phase and coherence information of the optical\nsignals flowing through it. Here we demonstrate our MMF inversion concept\nthrough numerical simulations, and efficiently sort and unscramble up to ~400\nstep-index fibre modes, reforming incoherent images of scenes at arbitrary\ndistances from the distal fibre facet. We also describe how our optical\ninverter can dynamically adapt to see through flexible fibres with a range of\nexperimentally realistic TMs - made possible by moulding optical memory effects\ninto the structure of our design. Although complex, our inversion scheme is\nbased on current fabrication technology so could be realised in the near\nfuture. Beyond imaging through scattering media, these concepts open up a range\nof new avenues for optical multiplexing, communications and computation in the\nrealms of classical and quantum photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 14:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

After the discretization, many of inverse problems are reduced to\nlinear systems. Due to the typical ill-posedness of inverse problems, the\nreduced linear systems are often ill-posed, especially when their scales are\nlarge. This brings great computational difficulty. Particularly, a small\nperturbation in the right side of an ill-posed linear system may cause a\ndramatical change in the solution. Therefore, regularization methods should be\nadopted for stable solutions. In this paper, a new class of accelerated\niterative regularization methods is applied to solve this kind of large-scale\nill-posed linear systems. An iterative scheme becomes a regularization method\nonly when the iteration is early terminated. And a Morozov's discrepancy\nprinciple is applied for the stop criterion. Compared with the conventional\nLandweber iteration, the new methods have acceleration effect, and can be\ncompared to the well-known accelerated v-method and Nesterov method. From the\nnumerical results, it is observed that using appropriate discretization\nschemes, the proposed methods even have better behavior when comparing with\nv-method and Nesterov method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 14:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

To\nsynthesize a tractable solution, the recently developed system level synthesis\n(SLS) framework is leveraged. It is shown that SLS shifts the controller\nsynthesis task from the design of a robust controller to the design of the\nentire set-valued closed-loop system responses. To this end, the closed-loop\nsystem response is entirely characterized by probabilistic set-valued maps from\nthe additive noise to control actions and states. A bi-level convex\noptimization over the achievable set-valued closed-loop responses is then\ndeveloped to optimize the expected value of the LQR cost against the worst-case\nclosed-loop system response. The solution to this robust optimization problem\nmay be too conservative since it aims at enforcing the design constraints for\nall possible system realizations. To deal with this issue, the presented\noptimization problem is next reformulated as a chance-constrained program (CCP)\nin which the guarantees are not intended in a deterministic sense of\nsatisfaction against all possible closed-loop system responses, but are instead\nintended in a probabilistic sense of satisfaction against all but a small\nfraction of the system responses. To approximately solve the CCP without the\nrequirement of knowing the probabilistic description of the uncertainty in the\nsystem matrices, the so-called scenario optimization approach is employed,\nwhich provides probabilistic guarantees based on a finite number of system\nrealizations and results in a convex optimization program with moderate\ncomputational complexity. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to\nillustrate the theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 14:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 13:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 13:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

An effective mitigation is to introduce\nintermediate supervision for solving sub-tasks of the compounded problem.\nRecently, several works have demonstrated high gains by taking a\nstraightforward approach for incorporating intermediate supervision in\ncompounded natural language problems: the sequence-to-sequence LM is fed with\nan augmented input, in which the decomposed tasks' labels are simply\nconcatenated to the original input.

This model makes it possible to\nuse artificial neural networks to solve multidimensional linear optimization\nproblems, the feasible region of which is a bounded non-empty set. To visualize\nthe linear programming problem, an objective hyperplane is introduced, the\norientation of which is determined by the gradient of the linear objective\nfunction: the gradient is the normal to the objective hyperplane. In the case\nof searching a maximum, the objective hyperplane is positioned in such a way\nthat the value of the objective function at all its points exceeds the value of\nthe objective function at all points of the feasible region, which is a bounded\nconvex polytope. For an arbitrary point of the objective hyperplane, the\nobjective projection onto the polytope is determined: the closer the objective\nprojection point is to the objective hyperplane, the greater the value of the\nobjective function at this point. Based on the objective hyperplane, a finite\nregular set of points is constructed, called the receptive field. Using\nobjective projections, an image of a polytope is constructed. This image\nincludes the distances from the receptive points to the corresponding points of\nthe polytope surface.

Even very restricted special cases of BNSL are\ncomputationally hard, and, thus, in practice heuristics such as local search\nare used. A natural approach for a local search algorithm is a hill climbing\nstrategy, where one replaces a given BNSL solution by a better solution within\nsome pre-defined neighborhood as long as this is possible. We study\nordering-based local search, where a solution is described via a topological\nordering of the variables. We show that given such a topological ordering, one\ncan compute an optimal DAG whose ordering is within inversion distance $r$ in\nsubexponential FPT time; the parameter $r$ allows to balance between solution\nquality and running time of the local search algorithm. This running time bound\ncan be achieved for BNSL without structural constraints and for all structural\nconstraints that can be expressed via a sum of weights that are associated with\neach parent set. We also introduce a related distance called `window inversions\ndistance' and show that the corresponding local search problem can also be\nsolved in subexponential FPT time for the parameter $r$. For two further\nnatural modification operations on the variable orderings, we show that\nalgorithms with an FPT time for $r$ are unlikely. We also outline the limits of\nordering-based local search by showing that it cannot be used for common\nstructural constraints on the moralized graph of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 15:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

By deriving new metrics analyzing the dereverberation performance in\nvarious time ranges, we confirm that directly optimizing for a criterion at the\noutput of the multi-channel linear filtering stage results in a more efficient\ndereverberation as compared to placing the criterion at the output of the DNN\nto optimize the PSD estimation. More concretely, we show that training this\nstage end-to-end helps further remove the reverberation in the range accessible\nto the filter, thus increasing the \\textit{early-to-moderate} reverberation\nratio. We argue and demonstrate that it can then be well combined with a\npost-filtering stage to efficiently suppress the residual late reverberation,\nthereby increasing the \\textit{early-to-final} reverberation ratio. This\nproposed two stage procedure is shown to be both very effective in terms of\ndereverberation performance and computational demands, as compared to e.g.\nrecent state-of-the-art DNN approaches. Furthermore, the proposed two-stage\nsystem can be adapted to the needs of different types of hearing-device users\nby controlling the amount of reduction of early reflections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 11:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 15:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To this end, we propose a novel structure-aware protein\nself-supervised learning method to effectively capture structural information\nof proteins. In particular, a well-designed graph neural network (GNN) model is\npretrained to preserve the protein structural information with self-supervised\ntasks from a pairwise residue distance perspective and a dihedral angle\nperspective, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the available\nprotein language model pretrained on protein sequences to enhance the\nself-supervised learning. Specifically, we identify the relation between the\nsequential information in the protein language model and the structural\ninformation in the specially designed GNN model via a novel pseudo bi-level\noptimization scheme. Experiments on several supervised downstream tasks verify\nthe effectiveness of our proposed method.The code of the proposed method is\navailable in \\url{https://github.com/GGchen1997/STEPS_Bioinformatics}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 02:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2022 03:15:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 00:06:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 22:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

It is unclear what role CFC has in information\nprocessing and brain functional connectivity. We construct a model of CFC which\npredicts a computational role for observed $\\theta - \\gamma$ oscillatory\ncircuits in the hippocampus and cortex.

Our results show\nthat employing embeddings from identifiers increases the performance of BERT by\n605% and 4% F1-score in its lower layers and the upper layers, respectively.\nWhen identifiers' embeddings are used in CodeBERT, a code-based PLM, the\nperformance is improved by 21-24% in the F1-score of clone detection. The\nfindings can benefit the research community by using code-specific\nrepresentations instead of applying the common embeddings used in NLP, and open\nnew directions for developing smaller models with similar performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 21:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

In the last decades, several researchers\nhave proposed such procedures, some of which were adopted by seismic code\nguidelines. These procedures usually utilize methods based either on simple\ncalculations or on the application of statistics theory. Recently, the increase\nof the computers' power has led to the development of modern statistical\nmethods based on the adoption of Machine Learning algorithms. These methods\nhave been shown to be useful for predicting seismic performance and classifying\nstructural damage level by means of extracting patterns from data collected via\nvarious sources. A large training dataset is used for the implementation of the\nclassification algorithms. To this end, 90 3D R/C buildings with three\ndifferent masonry infills' distributions are analysed utilizing Nonlinear Time\nHistory Analysis method for 65 real seismic records. The level of the seismic\ndamage is expressed in terms of the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio. A large\nnumber of Machine Learning algorithms is utilized in order to estimate the\nbuildings' damage response. The most significant conclusion which is extracted\nis that the Machine Learning methods that are mathematically well-established\nand their operations that are clearly interpretable step by step can be used to\nsolve some of the most sophisticated real-world problems in consideration with\nhigh accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 15:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}
