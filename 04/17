To mitigate\nthis issue, we design a novel training framework, called Contrastive\nCross-Channel Data Augmentation (C3 DA), which leverages an in-domain generator\nto construct more multi-aspect samples and then boosts the robustness of ABSA\nmodels via contrastive learning on these generated data.

Those problems often require\nfitting differential equation models to target trajectories. Fitting such\nmodels can be difficult because each evaluation of the fit must calculate the\ndistance between the model and target patterns at numerous points along a\ntrajectory. The gradient of the fit with respect to the model parameters can be\nchallenging. Recent technical advances in automatic differentiation through\nnumerical differential equation solvers potentially change the fitting process\ninto a relatively easy problem, opening up new possibilities to study dynamics.\nHowever, application of the new tools to real data may fail to achieve a good\nfit. This article illustrates how to overcome a variety of common challenges,\nusing the classic ecological data for oscillations in hare and lynx\npopulations. Models include simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and\nneural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which use artificial neural\nnetworks to estimate the derivatives of differential equation systems.\nComparing the fits obtained with ODEs versus NODEs, representing small and\nlarge parameter spaces, and changing the number of variable dimensions provide\ninsight into the geometry of the observed and model trajectories. To analyze\nthe quality of the models for predicting future observations, a\nBayesian-inspired preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (pSGLD)\ncalculation of the posterior distribution of predicted model trajectories\nclarifies the tendency for various models to underfit or overfit the data.\nCoupling fitted differential equation systems with pSGLD sampling provides a\npowerful way to study the properties of optimization surfaces, raising an\nanalogy with mutation-selection dynamics on fitness landscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 16:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

In\nrecent years, most gait recognition methods used the person's silhouette to\nextract the gait features. However, silhouette images can lose fine-grained\nspatial information, suffer from (self) occlusion, and be challenging to obtain\nin real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these silhouettes also contain other\nvisual clues that are not actual gait features and can be used for\nidentification, but also to fool the system. Model-based methods do not suffer\nfrom these problems and are able to represent the temporal motion of body\njoints, which are actual gait features. The advances in human pose estimation\nstarted a new era for model-based gait recognition with skeleton-based gait\nrecognition. In this work, we propose an approach based on Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCNs) that combines higher-order inputs, and residual networks to an\nefficient architecture for gait recognition.

In this work, we propose a new\nhybrid channel estimation/prediction (CEP) scheme to reduce overhead in\ntime-division duplex (TDD) wireless cell-free massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The scheme proposes sending a\npilot signal from each user only once in a given number (window) of coherence\nintervals (CIs). Then minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation is used to\nestimate the channel of this CI, while a deep neural network (DNN) is used to\npredict the channels of the remaining CIs in the window. The DNN exploits the\ntemporal correlation between the consecutive CIs and the received pilot signals\nto improve the channel prediction accuracy. By doing so, CE overhead is reduced\nby at least 50 percent at the expense of negligible CE error for practical user\nmobility settings. Consequently, the proposed CEP scheme improves the spectral\nefficiency compared to the conventional MMSE CE approach, especially when the\nnumber of users is large, which is demonstrated numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 20:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Recently, a dynamo mechanism operating in rapidly rotating and\ncrystallizing white dwarfs has been suggested to explain the occurrence rates\nof strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs with close low-mass main sequence\nstar companions. Here we investigate whether the same mechanism may produce\nstrong magnetic fields in close double white dwarfs. The only known strongly\nmagnetic white dwarf that is part of a close double white dwarf system, the\nmagnetic component of NLTT 12758, is rapidly rotating and likely crystallizing\nand therefore the proposed dynamo mechanism represents an excellent scenario\nfor the origin of its magnetic field. Presenting a revised formation scenario\nfor NLTT 12758, we find a natural explanation for the rapid rotation of the\nmagnetic component. We furthermore show that it is not surprising that strong\nmagnetic fields have not been detected in all other known double white dwarfs.\nWe therefore conclude that the incidence of magnetic fields in close double\nwhite dwarfs supports the idea that a rotation and crystallization driven\ndynamo plays a major role in the generation of strong magnetic fields in white\ndwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 01:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

This\npaper tackles this issue by proposing a reinforcement learning assisted deep\nlearning framework for the probabilistic EVCS charging power forecasting to\ncapture its uncertainties. Since the EVCS charging power data are not standard\ntime-series data like electricity load, they are first converted to the\ntime-series format. On this basis, one of the most popular deep learning\nmodels, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used and trained to obtain the\npoint forecast of EVCS charging power. To further capture the forecast\nuncertainty, a Markov decision process (MDP) is employed to model the change of\nLSTM cell states, which is solved by our proposed adaptive exploration proximal\npolicy optimization (AePPO) algorithm based on reinforcement learning.

We argue that IP-level security assessment is not sufficient.\nEventually, the IPs are placed in a platform, such as a system-on-chip (SoC),\nwhere each IP is surrounded by other IPs connected through glue logic and\nshared/private buses.

Here, our first-principles investigation show that a metastable\nsemiconducting H' phase can be formed from the H VSe2 monolayer and some other\nsimilar when these 2D H-phase materials are under uniaxial stress or uniaxial\nstrain. For the uniaxial stress (uniaxial strain) scheme, the H' phase will\nbecome lower in total energy than the H phase at the transition point. The\ncalculated phonon spectra indicate the dynamical stability of the H' structures\nof VSe$_2$, VS$_2$, and CrS$_2$, and the path of phase switching between the H\nand H' VSe$_2$ phases is calculated. For VSe$_2$, the H' phase has stronger\nferromagnetism and its Currier temperature can be substantially enhanced by\napplying uniaxial stress or strain. Spin-resolved electronic structures, energy\nband edges, and effective carrier masses for both of the H and H' phases can be\nsubstantially changed by the applied uniaxial stress or strain, leading to huge\neffective masses near the band edge of the strained H' phase. Analysis\nindicated that the largest bond length difference between the H' and H phases\ncan reach -19\\% for the Se3-Se3' bond, and there is noticeable covalence for\nthe Se3-Se3' bond, which switches the valence of the nearby V atoms, leading to\nthe enhanced ferromagnetism. Therefore, structural and bond reconstruction can\nbe realized by applying uniaxial stress in 2D ferromagnetic H VSe$_2$ and some\nother similar.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is an emerging technology\nfor traffic data collection because of its flexibility and diversity on spatial\nand temporal coverage. Vehicle trajectories are constructed from frame-by-frame\ndetections. The increase of vehicle counts makes multiple-target matching more\nchallenging. Errors are caused by pixel jitter, vehicle shadows, road marks as\nwell as some missing detections. This research proposes a novel framework for\nconstruction of massive vehicle trajectories from aerial videos by matching\nvehicle detections based on traffic flow dynamic features. The You Look Only\nOnce (YOLO) v4 is used for vehicle detection in UAV videos based on Convolution\nNeural Network (CNN). Trajectory construction is proposed in detected bounding\nboxes with trajectory identification, integrity enhancement, and coordinate\ntransformation from image coordinates to the Frenet coordinates. The raw\ntrajectory obtained is then denoised by the ensemble empirical mode\ndecomposition (EEMD). Our framework is tested on two aerial videos taken by a\nUAV on city expressway covering congested and free-flow traffic conditions. The\nresults show that the proposed framework achieves a Recall of 93.00% and\n86.69%, and a Precision of 98.86% and 98.83% for vehicle trajectories in the\nfree-flow and congested traffic conditions.The trajectory processing speed is\nabout 30s per track.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 07:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Clusters of nonaligners\ncoexist with moving clusters of aligners with continual coalescence and\nfragmentation. The behavior of the system with respect to the clustering of\nnonaligners appears to be very different for values of low and high global\ndensities. In the low density regime, for an optimal value of the threshold,\nthe largest cluster of nonaligners grows in size up to a maximum that varies\nlogarithmically with the total number of particles. However, on further\nincreasing the threshold the size decreases. In contrast, for the high density\nregime, an initial abrupt rise is followed by the appearance of a giant cluster\nof nonaligners.

Nested NER is a branch of NER in\nwhich the named entities (NEs) are nested with each other. However, most of the\nprevious studies on nested NER usually apply linear structure to model the\nnested NEs which are actually accommodated in a hierarchical structure. Thus in\norder to address this mismatch, this work models the full nested NEs in a\nsentence as a holistic structure, then we propose a holistic structure parsing\nalgorithm to disclose the entire NEs once for all. Besides, there is no\nresearch on applying corpus-level information to NER currently. To make up for\nthe loss of this information, we introduce Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)\nand other frequency features from corpus-aware statistics for even better\nperformance by holistic modeling from sentence-level to corpus-level.\nExperiments show that our model yields promising results on widely-used\nbenchmarks which approach or even achieve state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we comprehensively\nanalyze the z-axis, x-axis, weight and disambiguation methods in existing LRFs,\nand obtain six z-axis and eight x-axis, five weight and two disambiguation\nmethods.

The critical dynamics near such a critical point needs further\ninvestigation specifically when compared to the critical behavior near the\nstandard absorbing state phase transition. Since the phenomena of learning and\nself-organized criticality (SOC) at the edge of synchronization transition can\nemerge jointly in spiking neural networks due to the presence of spike-timing\ndependent plasticity (STDP), it is tempting to ask: What is the relationship\nbetween synchronization and learning in neural networks? Further, does learning\nbenefit from SOC at the edge of synchronization transition? In this paper, we\nintend to address these important issues. Accordingly, we construct a\nbiologically inspired model of an autonomous cognitive system which learns to\nperform stimulus-response tasks. We train this system using a reinforcement\nlearning rule implemented through dopamine-modulated STDP. We find that the\nsystem exhibits a continuous transition from synchronous to asynchronous neural\noscillations upon increasing the average axonal time delay. We characterize the\nlearning performance of the system and observe that it is optimized near the\nsynchronization transition. We also study neuronal avalanches in the system and\nprovide evidence that optimized learning is achieved in a slightly\nsupercritical state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 15:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Due to the device-heterogeneity, the local\nmodel learning cost and its quality, which can be time-varying, differs from\ndevice to device. We show that this variation results in utility unfairness\nbecause the same global model is shared among the devices. By default, the\nmaster is unaware of the local model computation and transmission costs of the\ndevices, thus it is unable to address the utility unfairness problem. Also, a\ndevice may exploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce\nits expenditure and thereby enhance its utility.

SDGCCA addresses the\nlimitations of other canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based models (e.g.,\ndeep CCA, deep generalized CCA) by considering complex/nonlinear cross-data\ncorrelations and discriminating phenotype groups. Although there are a few\nmethods for nonlinear CCA projections for discriminant purposes of phenotypes,\nthey only consider two views. On the other hand, SDGCCA is the nonlinear\nmultiview CCA projection method for discrimination. When we applied SDGCCA to\nprediction of patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and discrimination of early-\nand late-stage cancers, it outperformed other CCA-based methods and other\nsupervised methods. In addition, we demonstrate that SDGCCA can be used for\nfeature selection to identify important multi-omics biomarkers.

This capacity, once acquired, will\nhelp machines infer the mental states of others from observed contextual action\ntrajectories, enabling future prediction of goals, intention, actions and\nsuccessor representations. The underlying mechanism for such a prediction\nremains unclear, however. Inspired by the observation that humans often infer\nthe character traits of others, then use it to explain behaviour, we propose a\nnew neural ToM architecture that learns to generate a latent trait vector of an\nactor from the past trajectories. This trait vector then multiplicatively\nmodulates the prediction mechanism via a `fast weights' scheme in the\nprediction neural network, which reads the current context and predicts the\nbehaviour. We empirically show that the fast weights provide a good inductive\nbias to model the character traits of agents and hence improves mindreading\nability. On the indirect assessment of false-belief understanding, the new ToM\nmodel enables more efficient helping behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 11:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

The concave plasma mirror can efficiently focus\nreflected laser to match electron beam radius.

However, strong coordination\noften leads to expensive exploration over the exponentially large state-action\nspace. A powerful approach is to decompose team works into roles, which are\nideally assigned to agents with the relevant skills. Training agents to\nadaptively choose and play emerging roles in a team thus allows the team to\nscale to complex tasks and quickly adapt to changing environments. These\npromises, however, have not been fully realised by current role-based\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning methods as they assume either a pre-defined\nrole structure or a fixed team size. We propose a framework to learn role\nassignment and transfer across team sizes. In particular, we train a role\nassignment network for small teams by demonstration and transfer the network to\nlarger teams, which continue to learn through interaction with the environment.\nWe demonstrate that re-using the role-based credit assignment structure can\nfoster the learning process of larger reinforcement learning teams to achieve\ntasks requiring different roles.
