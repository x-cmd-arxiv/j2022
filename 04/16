However, such improvements of the SE are at the cost of\nadditional computational complexity to remove the intentionally introduced\nintersymbol interference. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep\nlearning (DL) to reduce the detection complexity of FTN signaling. To eliminate\nthe need of having a noise whitening filter at the receiver, we first present\nan equivalent FTN signaling model based on using a set of orthonormal basis\nfunctions and identify its operation region. Second, we propose a DL-based list\nsphere decoding (DL-LSD) algorithm that selects and updates the initial radius\nof the original LSD to guarantee a pre-defined number $N_{\\text{L}}$ of lattice\npoints inside the hypersphere. This is achieved by training a neural network to\noutput an approximate initial radius that includes $N_{\\text{L}}$ lattice\npoints. At the testing phase, if the hypersphere has more than $N_{\\text{L}}$\nlattice points, we keep the $N_{\\text{L}}$ closest points to the point\ncorresponding to the received FTN signal; however, if the hypersphere has less\nthan $N_{\\text{L}}$ points, we increase the approximate initial radius by a\nvalue that depends on the standard deviation of the distribution of the output\nradii from the training phase.

At the source redshift of 0.876, the rest-frame delay is 5.8 x\n10^5 s (6.71 d).

Further analysis of the GRB 210204A shows that the late time bump in\nthe light curve is highly unlikely due to underlying SNe at redshift (z) =\n0.876 and is more likely due to the late time flaring activity. The cause of\nthis variability is not clearly quantifiable due to the lack of multi-band data\nat late time constraints by the bad weather conditions.

In LQC, the bounce is extremely well\ncaptured by a $\\rho^2$ term in energy density with a negative sign which\nemerges as a non-perturbative modification to the classical Friedmann and\nRaychaudhuri equations.

This paper\npresents a novel two-phase dynamic throughput and energy optimization model\nthat utilizes an offline decision-search-tree based clustering technique to\nencapsulate and categorize historical data transfer log information and an\nonline search optimization algorithm to find the best application and kernel\nlayer parameter combination to maximize the achieved data transfer throughput\nwhile minimizing the energy consumption. Our model also incorporates an\nensemble method to reduce aleatoric uncertainty in finding optimal application\nand kernel layer parameters during the offline analysis phase. The experimental\nevaluation results show that our decision-tree based model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art solutions in this area by achieving 117% higher throughput on\naverage and also consuming 19% less energy at the end systems during active\ndata transfers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 18:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 22:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

By capturing unique\nimperfections in off-the-shelf radio circuitry, RFP techniques can identify\nwireless devices directly at the physical layer, allowing low-latency\nlow-energy cryptography-free authentication. However, existing Wi-Fi RFP\ntechniques are based on software-defined radio (SDRs), which may ultimately\nprevent their widespread adoption. Moreover, it is unclear whether existing\nstrategies can work in the presence of MU-MIMO transmitters - a key technology\nin modern Wi-Fi standards. Conversely from prior work, DeepCSI does not require\nSDR technologies and can be run on any low-cost Wi-Fi device to authenticate\nMU-MIMO transmitters.

Should an\nAV be examined purely virtually, allowing large numbers of fully controllable\ntests? Or should it be tested under real environmental conditions on a proving\nground? Since different test setups have different strengths and weaknesses, it\nis still an open question how virtual and real tests should be combined. On the\nway to answer this question, this paper proposes transfer importance sampling\n(TIS), a risk estimation method linking different test setups. Fusing the\nconcepts of transfer learning and importance sampling, TIS uses a scalable,\ncost-effective test setup to comprehensively explore an AV's behavior. The\ninsights gained then allow parameterizing tests in a more trustworthy test\nsetup accurately reflecting risks. We show that when using a trustworthy test\nsetup alone is prohibitively expensive, linking it to a scalable test setup can\nincrease efficiency $\\unicode{x2013}$ without sacrificing the result's\nvalidity. Thus, the test setups' individual deficiencies are compensated for by\ntheir systematic linkage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 19:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 16:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

One way to address this limitation\nis to gather additional data that better represents the full operating\nconditions.

There are basically two main approaches to reach this goal,\nnamely via Eulerian or Lagrangian techniques. While the first one magnifies\nmotion implicitly by operating directly on image pixels, the Lagrangian\napproach uses optical flow techniques to extract and amplify pixel\ntrajectories. Microexpressions are fast and spatially small facial expressions\nthat are difficult to detect. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nlocal Lagrangian motion magnification of facial micromovements. Our\ncontribution is three-fold: first, we fine-tune the recurrent all-pairs field\ntransforms for optical flows (RAFT) deep learning approach for faces by adding\nground truth obtained from the variational dense inverse search (DIS) for\noptical flow algorithm applied to the CASME II video set of faces. This enables\nus to produce optical flows of facial videos in an efficient and sufficiently\naccurate way. Second, since facial micromovements are both local in space and\ntime, we propose to approximate the optical flow field by sparse components\nboth in space and time leading to a double sparse decomposition. Third, we use\nthis decomposition to magnify micro-motions in specific areas of the face,\nwhere we introduce a new forward warping strategy using a triangular splitting\nof the image grid and barycentric interpolation of the RGB vectors at the\ncorners of the transformed triangles. We demonstrate the very good performance\nof our approach by various examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 20:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

The extent to which these so-called\nhydrodynamic interactions reduce coalescence rates is embodied in the collision\nefficiency, which is often small and is not generally known. In order to\ncharacterize the mechanisms that determine the collision efficiency, we\nexploited new time-resolved three-dimensional droplet tracking techniques to\nmeasure the positions of cloud droplet pairs settling through quiescent air. We\ndid so with an unprecedented precision that enabled us to calculate the\nrelative positions, velocities, and accelerations of the droplets at droplet\nsurface-to-surface separations as small as about one-tenth of a droplet\ndiameter. We show that relative accelerations clearly distinguish coalescing\nfrom non-coalescing droplet trajectories, the former being associated with\nrelative accelerations that exceeded a threshold value. We outline how relative\naccelerations relate to hydrodynamic interactions, and present scaling\narguments that predict the threshold relative acceleration.

The unifying formalism is\nbased on being able to expand any quantum operator, for bosons, fermions, and\nspin systems, using a universal basis operator Y(u,v) involving mixed Hilbert\nspaces of P and Q, respectively, where P and Q are momentum and position\noperators in CMP (which can be considered as a bozonization of free Bloch\nelectrons which incorporates the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution), whereas these are related to the creation and annihilation\noperators in QFT, where {\\psi}^{{\\dag}}=-iP and {\\psi}=Q. The expansion\ncoefficient is the Fourier transform of the Wigner quantum distribution\nfunction (lattice Weyl transform) otherwise known as the characteristic\ndistribution function. Thus, in principle, fermionization via Jordan-Wigner for\nspin systems, as well as the Holstein--Primakoff transformation from boson to\nthe spin operators can be performed depending on the ease of the calculations.\nUnitary transformation on the creation and annihilation operators themselves is\nalso employed, as exemplified by the Bogoliubov transformation. Moreover,\nwhenever Y(u,v) is already expressed in matrix form, M_{ij}, e.g. the Pauli\nspin matrices, the Jordan--Schwinger transformation is a map to bilinear\nexpressions of creation and annihilation operators which expedites computation\nof representations.

In this paper, we argue that the\nlatent space contains more information to be exploited thus taking one step\nfurther to capitalize on it. Firstly, instead of merely using the source-domain\nprototypes to determine the target pseudo labels as most of the traditional\nmethods do, we bidirectionally produce the target-domain prototypes to degrade\nthose source features which might be too hard or disturbed for the adaptation.\nSecondly, existing attempts simply model each category as a single and\nisotropic prototype while ignoring the variance of the feature distribution,\nwhich could lead to the confusion of similar categories.

However, the existing CS-based methods usually\nobtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two\nlimitations: (i) the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii)\nunresolvable quantization error. These two drawbacks are irreconcilable;\nimprovement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To address these\nchallenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs\nand AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation\ntask is divided into two stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage\nI, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple measurement vectors (MMV)\nproblem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders are\ndesigned to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage\ncan be reduced, which in turn reduces the computational complexity\nsubstantially.

The principle is to exploit\nknowledge from large quantities of continuously generated malware. Existing\nalgorithms practice available malware features for IoT devices and lack\nreal-time prediction behaviors. More research is thus required on malware\ndetection to cope with real-time misclassification of the input IoT data.\nMotivated by this, in this paper we propose an adversarial self-supervised\narchitecture for detecting malware in IoT networks, SETTI, considering samples\nof IoT network traffic that may not be labeled. In the SETTI architecture, we\ndesign three self-supervised attack techniques, namely Self-MDS, GSelf-MDS and\nASelf-MDS. The Self-MDS method considers the IoT input data and the adversarial\nsample generation in real-time. The GSelf-MDS builds a generative adversarial\nnetwork model to generate adversarial samples in the self-supervised structure.\nFinally, ASelf-MDS utilizes three well-known perturbation sample techniques to\ndevelop adversarial malware and inject it over the self-supervised\narchitecture. Also, we apply a defence method to mitigate these attacks, namely\nadversarial self-supervised training to protect the malware detection\narchitecture against injecting the malicious samples. To validate the attack\nand defence algorithms, we conduct experiments on two recent IoT datasets:\nIoT23 and NBIoT. Comparison of the results shows that in the IoT23 dataset, the\nSelf-MDS method has the most damaging consequences from the attacker's point of\nview by reducing the accuracy rate from 98% to 74%.

Recent research heavily\nfocuses on cross-subject and cross-session transfer learning frameworks to\nreduce domain calibration efforts for EEG signals.

Conventional video compression causes\nresolution reduction under limited bandwidth. Semantic video conferencing\nmaintains high resolution by transmitting some keypoints to represent motions\nbecause the background is almost static, and the speakers do not change often.\nHowever, the study on the impact of the transmission errors on keypoints is\nlimited. In this paper, we initially establish a basal semantic video\nconferencing (SVC) network, which dramatically reduces transmission resources\nwhile only losing detailed expressions. The transmission errors in SVC only\nlead to a changed expression, whereas those in the conventional methods destroy\npixels directly. However, the conventional error detector, such as the cyclic\nredundancy check, cannot reflect the degree of expression changes.

To solve these problems, we propose a novel multimodal\nneural network, namely UAMD-Net, for dense depth completion based on fusion of\nbinocular stereo matching and the weak constrain from the sparse point clouds.\nSpecifically, the sparse point clouds are converted to sparse depth map and\nsent to the multimodal feature encoder (MFE) with binocular image, constructing\na cross-modal cost volume.

A clear\nlink between these functions and the moving infinite line source model is then\nestablished. Then, two new exact and integral-free analytical expressions are\nproposed, along with two new first-order approximations. The new analytical\nexpressions proposed take the form of convergent power series involving no\nrecursive evaluations.

To address the challenge that training a (K+1)-class classifier\nwith training samples of only K classes, we propose a deep model based on Soft\nLabeling and Manifold Mixup (SLMM). In our method, soft labeling is used to\nreshape the label distribution of the known intent samples, aiming at reducing\nmodel's overconfident on known intents. Manifold mixup is used to generate\npseudo samples for open intents, aiming at well optimizing the decision\nboundary of open intents. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

It is found that applying the new length\nscale contributes to a more accurate prediction of the separated shear layer\n(SSL).

The computed Strouhal\nnumbers of vortical motions are approximately 0.2 in the initial SSL based on\nthe vorticity thickness and 0.1 around the reattachment based on the separation\nbubble length. Both frequencies increase when moving towards the wing tip due\nto the downwash effect of the tip vortex.

Latent factor analysis (LFA) is a typical\nrepresentation learning method that extracts useful yet latent knowledge from\nHiDS matrices via low-rank approximation. Current LFA-based models mainly focus\non a single-metric representation, where the representation strategy designed\nfor the approximation Loss function, is fixed and exclusive. However,\nreal-world HiDS matrices are commonly heterogeneous and inclusive and have\ndiverse underlying patterns, such that a single-metric representation is most\nlikely to yield inferior performance. Motivated by this, we in this paper\npropose a multi-metric latent factor (MMLF) model.

This problem\nbecomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients\noutside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated\ntraining. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for\nmedical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both\n\\textit{Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL} (IOP-FL). Our inside\npersonalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the\nlocal adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients\nfor common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization.\nMoreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the\nglobal model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an\nadapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing\nscheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically\nincorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test\ndata.

To answer this question, we\ndesign three probing tasks: inclusive sub-event selection, starting sub-event\nselection and temporal ordering to investigate the capabilities of PLMs with\nand without fine-tuning. The three probing tasks can be further used to\nautomatically induce a script for each main event given all the possible\nsub-events. Taking BERT as a case study, by analyzing its performance on script\ninduction as well as each individual probing task, we conclude that the\nstereotypical temporal knowledge among the sub-events is well captured in BERT,\nhowever the inclusive or starting sub-event knowledge is barely encoded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 05:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Existing approaches for query graph generation ignore the semantic\nstructure of a question, resulting in a large number of noisy query graph\ncandidates that undermine prediction accuracies. In this paper, we define six\nsemantic structures from common questions in KGQA and develop a novel\nStructure-BERT to predict the semantic structure of a question. By doing so, we\ncan first filter out noisy candidate query graphs, and then rank the remaining\ncandidates with a BERT-based ranking model.

Their\nunusual evolution with doping, frequency, and temperature has frequently led to\nnon-Fermi-liquid (non-FL) interpretations. Optical conductivity is a major\nchallenge in this context. Here, the optical spectra of two archetypal\ncuprates, underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta }$ and optimally-doped\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta }$, are interpreted based on the standard\nFermi liquid (FL) paradigm. At both dopings, perfect frequency-temperature FL\nscaling is found to be modified by the presence of a second, gapped electronic\nsubsystem. This non-FL component emerges as a well-defined mid-infrared\nspectral feature after the FL contribution -- determined independently by\ntransport -- is subtracted. Temperature, frequency, and doping evolution of the\nMIR feature identify a gapped rather than dissipative response. In contrast,\nthe dissipative response is found to be relevant for pnictides and ruthenates.\nSuch an unbiased FL/non-FL separation is extended across the cuprate phase\ndiagram, capturing all the key features of the normal state and providing a\nnatural explanation why the superfluid density is attenuated on the overdoped\nside. Thus, we obtain a unified interpretation of optical responses and\ntransport measurements in all analyzed physical regimes and all analyzed\ncompounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 21:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 09:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

A common solution is to use textual\nfeatures of relations (e.g., surface name or textual descriptions) as auxiliary\ninformation to bridge the gap between seen and unseen relations. Current\napproaches learn an embedding for each word token in the text. These methods\nlack robustness as they suffer from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.\nMeanwhile, models built on character n-grams have the capability of generating\nexpressive representations for OOV words. Thus, in this paper, we propose a\nHierarchical N-Gram framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (HNZSLP), which\nconsiders the dependencies among character n-grams of the relation surface name\nfor ZSLP. Our approach works by first constructing a hierarchical n-gram graph\non the surface name to model the organizational structure of n-grams that leads\nto the surface name. A GramTransformer, based on the Transformer is then\npresented to model the hierarchical n-gram graph to construct the relation\nembedding for ZSLP.
