However, in astrophysics, the classical approach, which does not\nexplicitly use this smallness, is sometimes used to describe similar processes\nin systems of magnetic monopoles or self-interacting dark matter particles. The\nimportance of such problems is determined by the fact that recombination\nprocesses play a crucial role in the evolution of the large-scale structure of\nthe Universe. Therefore, of particular interest is the fact that the classical\nand quantum expressions for the recombination cross section differ\nsignificantly in magnitude. It is shown that the applicability of quantum and\nclassical approaches to radiative recombination is closely related to the\nradiated angular momentum and its quantization. For situations where the\nclassical approach is not suitable, a semi-classical approach based on the\nangular momentum quantization is proposed, in some respects an alternative to\nthe well-known semi-classical Kramers' approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 18:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

As a\nresult, the field of finite-time thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems has\nblossomed.

Recent controversy on the existence (versus non-existence) of\nvariability in the observation of decay rate can be settled by considering\nmixing in decay configuration. Purpose: Variability in decay rate was\ninvestigated based on the available information of beta decay rate data, solar\nneutrino flux, and energy distribution. Method: Full systematic analysis of the\noscillatory behavior was carried out. Based on the zero threshold energy for\nneutrino absorption in beta emitters, a model for configuration mixing between\ntwo distinct beta disintegration modes $\\beta^\\nu$-disintegration (electron\nfrom neutrino interaction) and the $\\beta^-$-disintegration (electron from\nnatural decay) was proposed. Results: The phenomenon of variability in beta\ndecay rate was related to the possible exothermic neutrino absorption by\nunstable nuclei which, in principle, should include the whole range of flux\nenergies involving flux with energy below the $^{71}$Ga threshold at 0.23 MeV.\nThese two disintegration modes occur independently and model for their apparent\nmixing rate was proposed. Conclusions: The configuration mixing between the two\nmodes causes depletion of radioactive nuclei which is subject to change with\nseasonal solar neutrino variability. Ability to detect this variability was\nfound to be dependent on the Q-value of the $\\beta^\\nu$ disintegration and\ndetection instrument setup. Value of neutrino cross section weighted by the\nratio between $\\beta^\\nu$ and $\\beta^-$ detection efficiencies was found to be\nin the range $10^{-44}$ to $10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$. For experiments that uses the\nend point to determine the neutrino mass, interference due to mixing should be\ntaken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 18:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Various deep-learning-based surrogate\nmodeling techniques have been developed to reduce the simulation costs\nassociated with these applications. However, to construct data-driven surrogate\nmodels, several thousand high-fidelity simulation runs may be required to\nprovide training samples, and these computations can make training\nprohibitively expensive. To address this issue, in this work we present a\nframework where most of the training simulations are performed on coarsened\ngeomodels. These models are constructed using a flow-based upscaling method.\nThe framework entails the use of a transfer-learning procedure, incorporated\nwithin an existing recurrent residual U-Net architecture, in which network\ntraining is accomplished in three steps. In the first step. where the bulk of\nthe training is performed, only low-fidelity simulation results are used. The\nsecond and third steps, in which the output layer is trained and the overall\nnetwork is fine-tuned, require a relatively small number of high-fidelity\nsimulations. Here we use 2500 low-fidelity runs and 200 high-fidelity runs,\nwhich leads to about a 90% reduction in training simulation costs. The method\nis applied for two-phase subsurface flow in 3D channelized systems, with flow\ndriven by wells. The surrogate model trained with multifidelity data is shown\nto be nearly as accurate as a reference surrogate trained with only\nhigh-fidelity data in predicting dynamic pressure and saturation fields in new\ngeomodels. Importantly, the network provides results that are significantly\nmore accurate than the low-fidelity simulations used for most of the training.\nThe multifidelity surrogate is also applied for history matching using an\nensemble-based procedure, where accuracy relative to reference results is again\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 20:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

In the momentum space, the process of structural change corresponds to\ntopological charges split from q=1 into two half charges q=1/2.We analyze\nguided mode resonance (GMR) excitation of the grating structure, and discuss\nthe dispersion relations in the waveguide layer with the position of BIC in\nenergy bands. In addition, the reflectance spectrum is found to exhibit\nasymmetric line-shapes with different values of the asymmetry parameters, M1\nand M2. BIC is transformed into quasi-BIC as the symmetry of the structure is\nbroken. This work demonstrates a double trapezoid structure with strong\nresonance properties, which has significant implications for exploring the\nphenomenon of BIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 03:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

A ground robot explores an indoor\nspace with a single floor and vertical walls, and collects a sequence of\nintensity images and 2D LiDAR datasets. The LiDAR provides accurate depth\ninformation, while the camera captures high-resolution data for semantic\ninterpretation. The alignment of sensor outputs and image segmentation are\ncomputed jointly by aligning LiDAR points, as samples of the room contour, to\nground-wall boundaries in the images. The alignment problem is decoupled into a\ntop-down view projection and a 2D similarity transformation estimation, which\ncan be solved according to the vertical vanishing point and motion of two\nsensors. The recursive random sample consensus algorithm is implemented to\ngenerate, evaluate and optimize multiple hypotheses with the sequential\nmeasurements. The system allows jointly analyzing the geometric interpretation\nfrom different sensors without offline calibration. The ambiguity in images for\nground-wall boundary extraction is removed with the assistance of LiDAR\nobservations, which improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation. The\nlocalization and mapping is refined using the fused data, which enables the\nsystem to work reliably in scenes with low texture or low geometric features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 06:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

We firstly\npropose how compared to normal densities, our target time series seem to be\nassociated with a higher number of rare events, and Gaussian statistics tend to\nunderestimate these events' frequency drastically. To this end, we suggest that\nby imposing Gaussian densities to the natural processes, one will seriously\nneglect the existence of extreme events in many circumstances. The central\nquestion of our study concerns the consideration of the effects of these rare\nevents in the corresponding probability densities and studying their role from\nthe point of view of quantum measurements. To model the non-Gaussian behavior\nof these time-series, we utilize the multifractal random walk (MRW) approach\nand control the non-Gaussianity parameter $\\lambda$ accordingly. Using the\nframework of quantum mechanics, we then examine the role of $\\lambda$ in\nquantum potentials derived for these time series. Our Bohmian quantum analysis\nshows that the derived potential takes some negative values in high frequencies\n(its mean values), then substantially increases, and the value drops again for\nthe rare events. We thus conclude that these events could generate a potential\nbarrier that the system, lingering in a non-Gaussian high-frequency region,\nencounters, and their role becomes more prominent when it comes to transversing\nthis barrier. In this study, as an example of the application of quantum\npotential outside of the micro-world, we compute the quantum potentials for the\nS\\&P financial market time series to verify the presence of rare events in the\nnon-Gaussian densities for this real data and remark the deviation from the\nGaussian case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 06:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

The compound is predicted to be dynamically stable and possesses\nsignificant metallic bonding. Study of thermophysical properties, namely, Debye\ntemperature, Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, acoustic parameters, melting temperature,\nheat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and dominant phonon mode is also\nindicative of soft nature of SrSi2. The electronic band structure calculations\nwithout and with spin-orbit coupling disclose semimetallic character with clear\nWeyl nodes close to the Fermi level. The electronic dispersion is anisotropic\ncharacterized by nearly flat and linear regions within the Brillouin zone.\nOptical parameters at different photon energies are investigated. SrSi2 shows\nexcellent nonselective reflection spectrum across an extended range of energy\nencompassing the visible region implying that the compound under study has\nsignificant potential to be used as an efficient solar energy reflector. SrSi2\nabsorbs ultraviolet light quite efficiently. The compound also possesses high\nrefractive index in the low energy.

Recently, many approaches\nbased on external knowledge are proposed to generate rich semantic and\ninformation conversation. Two types of knowledge have been studied for\nknowledge-aware open-domain dialogue generation: structured triples from\nknowledge graphs and unstructured texts from documents. To take both advantages\nof abundant unstructured latent knowledge in the documents and the information\nexpansion capabilities of the structured knowledge graph, this paper presents a\nnew dialogue generation model, Dynamic Multi-form Knowledge Fusion based\nOpen-domain Chatt-ing Machine (DMKCM).In particular, DMKCM applies an indexed\ntext (a virtual Knowledge Base) to locate relevant documents as 1st hop and\nthen expands the content of the dialogue and its 1st hop using a commonsense\nknowledge graph to get apposite triples as 2nd hop. To merge these two forms of\nknowledge into the dialogue effectively, we design a dynamic virtual knowledge\nselector and a controller that help to enrich and expand knowledge space.\nMoreover, DMKCM adopts a novel dynamic knowledge memory module that effectively\nuses historical reasoning knowledge to generate better responses. Experimental\nresults indicate the effectiveness of our method in terms of dialogue coherence\nand informativeness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 10:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Our approach takes into account the\ninfluence of the temperature on the first-order phonon line and the average\nlattice phonon frequency under intense stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)\nconditions. We further utilize this model to calculate the\ntemperature-dependent thermo-optic coefficient and the Gruneisen parameter of\ndiamond in the visible spectral range. The theory is accompanied by the\ndemonstration of tunable Fourier-limited Stokes nanosecond pulses with a\nstabilized center frequency deviation of less than <4 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 12:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

To date, our knowledge of the processes leading to the\nincorporation of nitrogen into organic chains has been rather limited.

Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the\ntime-series domain do not capture low and high-frequency features at the same\ntime. Further, some of these methods employ large scale models like\ntransformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as\ncontrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a non-contrastive\nself-supervised learning approach efficiently captures low and high-frequency\ntime-varying features in a cost-effective manner. Our method takes raw time\nseries data as input and creates two different augmented views for two branches\nof the model, by randomly sampling the augmentations from same family.\nFollowing the terminology of BYOL, the two branches are called online and\ntarget network which allows bootstrapping of the latent representation. In\ncontrast to BYOL, where a backbone encoder is followed by multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) heads, the proposed model contains additional temporal convolutional\nnetwork (TCN) heads. As the augmented views are passed through large kernel\nconvolution blocks of the encoder, the subsequent combination of MLP and TCN\nenables an effective representation of low as well as high-frequency\ntime-varying features due to the varying receptive fields. The two modules (MLP\nand TCN) act in a complementary manner. We train an online network where each\nmodule learns to predict the outcome of the respective module of target network\nbranch. To demonstrate the robustness of our model we performed extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on five real-world time-series datasets. Our\nmethod achieved state-of-art performance on all five real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 14:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Quarkonium is endowed\nwith a pattern of separated energy scales qualifying it as special probe of\ncomplex environments. Its multiscale nature has made a description in Quantum\nField Theory particularly difficult up to the advent of Nonrelativistic\nEffective Field Theories. We will focus on systems made by two or more heavy\nquarks.

These systems\nare found in numerous applications, and their quantitative verification is\nimportant, but also rather challenging. In particular, given that most systems\nfound in applications are rather big, compositionality and incrementality of\nverification methods are essential.\n  In order to ensure robustness of verification, we replace the Boolean yes-no\nanswers of standard verification with distances. Depending on the application\ncontext, many different types of distances are being employed in quantitative\nverification. Consequently, there is a need for a general theory of system\ndistances which abstracts away from the concrete distances and develops\nquantitative verification at a level independent of the distance. It is our\nview that in a theory of quantitative verification, the quantitative aspects\nshould be treated just as much as input to a verification problem as the\nqualitative aspects are. In this work we develop such a general theory of\nquantitative verification. We assume as input a distance between traces, or\nexecutions, and then employ the theory of games with quantitative objectives to\ndefine distances between quantitative systems. Different versions of the\nquantitative bisimulation game give rise to different types of distances,\nviz.~bisimulation distance, simulation distance, trace equivalence distance,\netc., enabling us to construct a quantitative generalization of van Glabbeek's\nlinear-time--branching-time spectrum.

For this\nwe use modal transition systems, and we develop the quantitative properties of\nthe usual operators for behavioral specification theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 15:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel test pattern generation approach using the powerful SAT attack\non logic locking. A stuck-at fault is modeled as a locked gate with a secret\nkey. Our modeling of stuck-at faults preserves the property of fault activation\nand propagation. We show that the input pattern that determines the key is a\ntest for the stuck-at fault. We propose two different approaches for test\npattern generation. First, a single stuck-at fault is targeted, and a\ncorresponding locked circuit with one key bit is created. This approach\ngenerates one test pattern per fault. Second, we consider a group of faults and\nconvert the circuit to its locked version with multiple key bits. The inputs\nobtained from the SAT tool are the test set for detecting this group of faults.\nOur approach is able to find test patterns for hard-to-detect faults that were\npreviously failed in commercial ATPG tools. The proposed test pattern\ngeneration approach can efficiently detect redundant faults present in a\ncircuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on ITC'99 benchmarks.\nThe results show that we can achieve a perfect fault coverage reaching 100%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 15:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2022 22:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 20:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Prior solutions are unfit for\nlarge-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item\narrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput.

Based on the right norm derivative\n$\\rho_{_{+}}$, we define a mapping $\\rho_{_{\\infty}}$ by \\begin{equation*}\n\\rho_{_{\\infty}}(x,y) =\n\\frac1\\pi\\int_0^{2\\pi}e^{i\\theta}\\rho_{_{+}}(x,e^{i\\theta}y)d\\theta\n\\quad(x,y\\in X). \\end{equation*} The mapping $\\rho_{_{\\infty}}$ has a good\nresponse to some geometrical properties of $X$. For instance, we prove that\n$\\rho_{_{\\infty}}(x,y)=\\rho_{_{\\infty}}(y,x)$ for all $x, y \\in X$ if and only\nif $X$ is an inner product space. In addition, we define a\n$\\rho_{_{\\infty}}$-orthogonality in $X$ and show that a linear mapping\npreserving $\\rho_{_{\\infty}}$-orthogonality has to be a scalar multiple of an\nisometry. A number of challenging problems in the geometry of complex normed\nspaces are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 13:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

The resulting weak 2-groupoid structure can\nbe extended to every finite level. The introduced notions of typoid and typoid\nfunction generalise the notions of setoid and setoid function. A univalent\ntypoid is a typoid satisfying a general version of the univalence axiom. We\nprove some fundamental facts on univalent typoids, their product and\nexponential. As a corollary, we get an interpretation of propositional\ntruncation within the theory of typoids.
