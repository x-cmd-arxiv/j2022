Most existing methods are\npipeline-based, requiring entities as input. However, jointly learning to\nextract entities and relations can improve performance and be more efficient\ndue to shared parameters and training steps. In this paper, we develop a\nsequence-to-sequence approach, seq2rel, that can learn the subtasks of DocRE\n(entity extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction) end-to-end,\nreplacing a pipeline of task-specific components. Using a simple strategy we\ncall entity hinting, we compare our approach to existing pipeline-based methods\non several popular biomedical datasets, in some cases exceeding their\nperformance. We also report the first end-to-end results on these datasets for\nfuture comparison. Finally, we demonstrate that, under our model, an end-to-end\napproach outperforms a pipeline-based approach.

Despite growing research on analysis of\nlifestyle patterns in cities, little is known about the characteristics of\npeople's lifestyles patterns at urban scale. This limitation is primarily due\nto challenges in characterizing lifestyle patterns when human movement data is\naggregated to protect the privacy of users. In this study, we model cities\nbased on aggregated human visitation data to construct a network of places. We\nthen examine the subgraph signatures in the networks of places to map and\ncharacterize lifestyle patterns at city scale. Location-based data from Harris\nCounty, Dallas County, New York County, and Broward County in the United States\nwere examined to reveal lifestyle signatures in cities. For the motif analysis,\ntwo-node, three-node, and four-node motifs without location attributes were\nextracted from human visitation networks. Second, homogenized nodes in motifs\nwere encoded with location categories from NAICS codes. Multiple statistical\nmeasures, including network metrics and motif properties, were quantified to\ncharacterize lifestyle signatures. The results show that: people's lifestyles\nin urban environments can be well depicted and quantified based on distribution\nand attributes of motifs in networks of places; motifs in networks of places\nshow stability in quantity and distance as well as periodicity on weekends and\nweekdays indicating the stability of lifestyle patterns in cities; human\nvisitation networks and lifestyle patterns show similarities across different\nmetropolitan areas implying the universality of lifestyle signatures across\ncities. The findings provide deeper insights into urban lifestyles signatures\nin urban studies and provide important insights for data-informed urban\nplanning and management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 16:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2022 02:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

In this context, investigating and\noptimizing the airflow in urban environments is critical to design comfortable\noutdoor areas as unwanted effects such as windy areas and the formation of heat\npockets have to be avoided. Our UrbanFlow framework enables interactive\narchitectural design allowing for decision making based on simulating urban\nflow. Compared to real-time fluid flow simulation, enabling interactive\narchitecture design poses an even higher computational efficiency challenge as\nevaluating a design by simulation usually requires hundreds of time steps. This\nis addressed based on a highly efficient Eulerian fluid simulator in which we\nincorporate a unified porosity model which is devised to encode digital urban\nmodels containing objects such as buildings and trees. UrbanFlow is equipped\nwith an optimization routine enabling the direct computation of design\nadaptations improving livability and comfort for given parameterized\narchitectural designs. To ensure convergence of the optimization process,\ninstead of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, the Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes equations are solved as this can be done on a relatively coarse\ngrid and allows for the decoupling of the effects of turbulent eddies which are\ntaken into account using a separate turbulence model. As we demonstrate on a\nreal-world example taken from an ongoing architectural competition, this\nresults in a fast convergence of the optimization process which computes a\ndesign adaptation avoiding heat pockets as well as uncomfortable windy areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 16:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The algorithms can use the predictions as a guide to inform\ntheir decisions, and the goal is to achieve much stronger performance\nguarantees when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also\nmaintaining near-optimal worst-case guarantees, even if these predictions are\nvery inaccurate (robustness).

AIMS: By using new near infrared and optical data, we examine\nhow these data constrain the orbital eccentricity and the thermal properties of\nthe planet atmosphere. METHODS: The full light curves acquired by the TESS\nsatellite from two sectors are used to put upper limit on the amplitude of the\nplanet's phase variation and estimate the occultation depth. Two, already\npublished and one, yet unpublished followup observations in the 2MASS K (Ks)\nband are employed to derive a more precise occultation light curve in this near\ninfrared waveband. RESULTS: The merged occultation light curve in the Ks band\ncomprises 4515 data points. The data confirm the results of the earlier\neccentricity estimates, suggesting circular orbit: e=0.005+/-0.015. The high\nvalue of the flux depression of (2.70+/-0.14) ppt in the Ks band excludes\nsimple black body emission at the 10 sigma level and disagrees also with\ncurrent atmospheric models at the (4-7) sigma level. From the analysis of the\nTESS data, in the visual band we found tentative evidence for a near noise\nlevel detection of the secondary eclipse, and placed constraints on the\nassociated amplitude of the planet's phase variation. A formal box fit yields\nan occultation depth of (0.157+/-0.056) ppt. This implies a relatively high\ngeometric albedo of Ag=0.43+/-0.15 for fully efficient atmospheric circulation\nand Ag=0.29+/-0.15 for no circulation at all.

Adequate\nviews to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to\noccupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends,\ndesigners may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside\nwith an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants.\nTo better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design\nfeedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to\ncapture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research\nremains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use\nearly-design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be\nadvantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation,\nplan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper,\nhence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with\n590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to\npredict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an\nexisting view assessment framework through case studies.

We start rather generally by deriving the\nfour-dimensional spectrum and Lagrangian terms from the ten-dimensional theory,\nthrough a process of compactification over six-dimensional Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds, upon which holomorphic poly-stable vector bundles are defined. We\nthen specialise to a class of heterotic string models for which the vector\nbundle is split into a sum of line bundles and the Calabi-Yau manifold is\ndefined as a complete intersection in projective ambient spaces. We develop a\nmethod for calculating holomorphic Yukawa couplings for such models, by\nrelating bundle-valued forms on the Calabi-Yau manifold to their ambient space\ncounterparts, so that the relevant integrals can be evaluated over projective\nspaces. The method is applicable for any of the 7890 CICY manifolds known in\nthe literature, and we show that it can be related to earlier algebraic\ntechniques to compute holomorphic Yukawa couplings. We provide explicit\ncalculations of the holomorphic Yukawa couplings for models compactified on the\ntetra-quadric and on a co-dimension two CICY. A vanishing theorem is\nformulated, showing that in some cases, topology rather than symmetry is\nresponsible for the absence of certain trilinear couplings. In addition, some\nYukawa matrices are found to be dependent on the complex structure moduli and\ntheir rank is reduced in certain regions of the moduli space. In the final\npart, we focus on a method to evaluate the matter field Kahler potential\nwithout knowing the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau metric. This is possible for large\ninternal gauge fluxes, for which the normalisation integral localises around a\npoint on the compactification manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 21:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Continuum modeling reveals that the critical\nradius for this compact-to-dendritic (CTD) transition should be proportional to\nthe particle diffusivity divided by the surface reaction rate. However,\nprevious studies have had limited success verifying that the same scaling\narises in the continuum limit of a particle-based deposition model. This\ndiscrepancy suggests that the continuum model may be missing part of the\nmicroscopic dendrite formation mechanism, a concerning hypothesis given that\nsimilar models are commonly used to study dendritic growth in electrodeposition\nand lithium metal batteries. To clarify the accuracy of such models, we\nreexamine the particle-based CTD transition using larger system sizes, up to\nhundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and an improved paradigm for\nthe surface reaction. Specifically, this paradigm allows us to converge our\nsimulations and to work in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. With\nthese methods, we show that in both two and three dimensions, the behavior of\nthe critical radius is consistent with the scaling of the continuum model. Our\nresults help unify the particle-based and continuum views of the CTD\ntransition. In each of these cases, dendrites emerge when particles can no\nlonger diffuse around the cluster within the characteristic reaction timescale.\nConsequently, this work implies that continuum methods can effectively capture\nthe microscopic physics of dendritic deposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 22:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 01:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 22:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

It aims to complement the longer exposition in a\nrecent paper in 'Foundations of Physics' and to help to make that work more\naccessible. The product picture is a formulation of QED, equivalent to standard\nCoulomb gauge QED, but in which the Hilbert space arises as (a certain physical\nsubspace of) a product of a Hilbert space for the electromagnetic field and a\nHilbert space for charged matter (i.e. the Dirac field) and in which the\nHamiltonian arises as the sum of an electromagnetic Hamiltonian and a charged\nmatter Hamiltonian and an interaction term. (The Coulomb gauge formulation of\nQED is not a product picture because, in it, the longitudinal part of the\nelectromagnetic field is made out of charged matter operators.) We also recall\na 'Contradictory Commutator Theorem' for QED which exposes flaws in previous\nattempts at temporal gauge quantization of QED and we explain how our product\npicture appears to offer a way to overcome those flaws. Additionally, we\ndiscuss the extent to which that theorem generalizes to Yang-Mills fields. We\nalso develop a product picture for nonrelativistic charged particles in\ninteraction with the electromagnetic field and point out how this leads to a\nnovel way of thinking about the theory of many nonrelativistic electrically\ncharged particles with Coulomb interactions. We explain how the provision of a\nproduct picture for QED gives hope that one will be able likewise to have a\nproduct picture for (Yang Mills and) quantum gravity -- the latter being needed\nto make sense of the author's 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis'.

After that, the sliced Wasserstein\nis evaluated by averaging the two corresponding one-dimensional projected\nprobability measures. However, this approach has two limitations. The first\nlimitation is that the spatial structure of images is not captured efficiently\nby the vectorization step; therefore, the later slicing process becomes harder\nto gather the discrepancy information.

To address these limitations, we propose novel slicing\nmethods for sliced Wasserstein between probability measures over images that\nare based on the convolution operators.

To achieve this goal, we entirely rely on two concepts of directional\nderivatives known as subderivative and semi-derivative. We establish the exact\nchain and sum rules for this class of functions via these directional\nderivatives. These calculus rules provide an implementable auto-differentiation\nprocess such as back-propagation in composite functions. The latter calculus\nrules can be used to identify the directional stationary points defined by the\nsubderivative. We show that the distance function of a geometrically derivable\nconstraint set is semi-differentiable, which opens the door for designing\nfirst-order algorithms for non-Clarke regular constrained optimization\nproblems. We propose a first-order algorithm to find a directional stationary\npoint of non-Clarke regular and perhaps non-Lipschitz functions. We introduce a\ndescent property under which we establish the non-asymptotic convergence of our\nmethod with rate $O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$, akin to gradient descent for smooth\nminimization.

However, without\nany encryption and authentication mechanisms, the in-vehicle network using the\nCAN protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Many studies, which are\nmostly based on machine learning, have proposed installing an intrusion\ndetection system (IDS) for anomaly detection in the CAN bus system. Although\nmachine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually\nrequire a large amount of labeled data, which results in high time and labor\ncosts. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised\nlearning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The\nproposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and\ngenerative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled\ndata to learn the manifolds of normal and attack patterns. Then, only a small\nnumber of labeled samples are used in supervised training. The proposed model\ncan detect various kinds of message injection attacks, such as DoS, fuzzy, and\nspoofing, as well as unknown attacks. The experimental results show that the\nproposed model achieves the highest F1 score of 0.99 and a low error rate of\n0.1\\% with limited labeled data compared to other supervised methods. In\naddition, we show that the model can meet the real-time requirement by\nanalyzing the model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters\nand inference time. This study successfully reduced the number of model\nparameters by five times and the inference time by eight times, compared to a\nstate-of-the-art model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 00:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Furthermore,\nwe introduce a zoom-in module that localizes and crops the informative regions\nto encourage the network to learn informative features explicitly. We show that\nour locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on\nchallenging benchmarks, i.e. CUB, AWA2, and SUN. As an additional benefit, our\nmodel points to the visual evidence of the attributes in an image, confirming\nthe improved attribute localization ability of our image representation. The\nattribute localization is evaluated quantitatively with ground truth part\nannotations, qualitatively with visualizations, and through well-designed user\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 02:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

For both UDA and UDE, a model tailored to\na given domain, let it be the source or the target domain, is assumed to well\nhandle samples from the given domain.

The proposed\nstochastic function is sampled from a Gaussian process prior to (1) provide\ninfinite number of joint Gaussian distributions of random context variables\n(diversity-promoting) and (2) explicitly model dependency between context\nvariables (accurate-encoding). To address the learning challenge of Gaussian\nprocesses, we propose an efficient variational inference approach to\napproximate the posterior distribution of random context variables. We evaluate\nour method in two typical text generation tasks: paraphrase generation and text\nstyle transfer. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod improves the generation quality and diversity compared with other\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 04:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Since in many systems read operations vastly outnumber\nRMW operations, we are interested in implementations that emphasize the\nefficiency of read operations.\n  We present a parametrized algorithm for partially synchronous systems where\nprocesses have access to external clocks that are synchronized within\n$\\epsilon$. With this algorithm, every read operation is local (intuitively, it\ndoes not trigger messages). If a read is not concurrent with a conflicting RMW,\nit is performed immediately with no waiting; furthermore, even with a\nconcurrent conflicting RMW, a read experiences very little delay in the\nworst-case. For example, the algorithm's parameters can be set to ensure that\nevery read takes $\\epsilon$ time in the worst-case. To the best of our\nknowledge this is the first algorithm to achieve this bound in the partially\nsynchronous systems that we assume here. Our parametrized algorithm generalizes\nthe (non-parameterized) lease-based algorithm of Chandra et al. [6] where the\nworst-case time for reads is $3\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the maximum message\ndelay.\n  The algorithm's parameters can be used to trade-off the worst-case times for\nread and RMW operations. They can also be used to take advantage of the fact\nthat in many message-passing systems the delay of most messages is order of\nmagnitudes smaller than the maximum message delay~$\\delta$: for example, the\nparameters can be set so that, in \"nice\" periods where message delays are\n$\\delta^* \\ll \\delta$, reads take at most $\\epsilon$ time while RMWs take at\nmost $3 \\delta^*$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 04:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Although\nthe selection of {\\Delta} greatly affects the training results, previous works\nestimate {\\Delta} via an approximation or treat it as a hyper-parameter, which\nis suboptimal. In this paper, we present the Soft Threshold Ternary Networks\n(STTN), which enables the model to automatically determine quantization\nintervals instead of depending on a hard threshold.

Although promising, it relies\non the learnable parameterized positional queries which tend to encode the\ndataset statistics, leading to inaccurate localization for distinct individual\nqueries. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective query design for\nsemantic segmentation termed Dynamic Focus-aware Positional Queries (DFPQ),\nwhich dynamically generates positional queries conditioned on the\ncross-attention scores from the preceding decoder block and the positional\nencodings for the corresponding image features, simultaneously.

In this method, each operation is replicated in time and the\nderived final results are voted to generate the final output. To consider the\neffect of permanent faults, replicating identical operations in time is not\nsufficient, and diversifying the operands is required. To this aim in FT-EALU,\nwe consider three distinct versions of input data and apply the target\noperation to them serially in time. To avoid high time overhead, we employ\nsimple operators such as shift and swap to make an appropriate diversion in\ninput data. Our proposed fault tolerance approach passes the replicated and\ndiverse results to a novel weighted voter that is designed based on the\nreward/punishment strategy. For each version of execution, based on the\nproposed weighting approach a corresponding weight according to its correction\ncapability confronting several faulty scenarios is defined. This weight defines\nthe reliability of the result of each version of execution and determines its\neffect on the final result. The final result is generated bit by bit based on\nthe weight of each execution and its computed result. These weights are\ndetermined statically through a design-time learning scheme according to\napplying several types of faults on various data bits. Based on the capability\nof execution versions on mitigating the permanent faults, positive or negative\nscores are assigned to them. These scores are integrated for several cases and\nnormalized to derive the appropriate weight of each execution at bit level.\nSeveral experiments are performed to show the efficiency of our proposed\napproach and based on them, FT-EALU is capable of correcting about 84.93% and\n69.71% of permanent injected faults on single and double bits of input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 06:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Prior dense pose estimation methods are all based on Mask\nR-CNN framework and operate in a top-down manner of first attempting to\nidentify a bounding box for each person and matching dense correspondences in\neach bounding box. Consequently, these methods lack robustness due to their\ncritical dependence on the Mask R-CNN detection, and the runtime increases\ndrastically as the number of persons in the image increases.

By learning the interrelationship through the\nassociative bridge, the proposed bridging framework is able to obtain the\ntarget modal representations inside the memory network, even with the source\nmodal input only, and it provides rich information for its downstream tasks. We\napply the proposed framework to two tasks: lip reading and speech\nreconstruction from silent video. Through the proposed associative bridge and\nmodality-specific memories, each task knowledge is enriched with the recalled\naudio context, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also verify that the\nassociative bridge properly relates the source and target memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 06:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

E.g., if the system keeps exposing and\nrecommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the\nuser feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in\nstatic recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In\ncontrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive\nrecommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is\nunrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to\nleverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user\nsatisfaction.\n  To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender\nsystem (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with\ncausal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on\nhistorical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user\nsatisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning\nof the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an\nauthentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user\nrating dataset.

This paper presents an effort to understand the influence of actual\nvalues of the north-south component of Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF,\n$B_z$) on the vertical plasma drifts at a location near the EIA and the\ngeomagnetic equator. The strong storm event of October 13, 2016, falling in the\ndescending phase of solar cycle 24, has been taken up as a case study.\nThermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM)\nsimulation runs have been performed under two scenarios: first when no coupling\nis present (IMF $B_z$ = 0 nT) and second when actual observations of the values\nof IMF $B_z$ is given as inputs to the model. Observations show when actual\ndata is fed to the model, there is significant shift of the vertical drift\ntowards westward, while there is an increase in the peak value of the westward\ndrift after the pre-reversal enhancement. This study is an initial effort to\nunderstand the variations in low-latitude plasma motions during the main phase\nof strong geomagnetic storms. This initial work will be followed up with\nunderstanding the global plasma drift variations under the influence of other\ncomponents of the IMF near the EIA and the dip equatorial regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 07:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In a state with\ndefinite angular momentum in the laboratory frame, these moments are forbidden\nby parity (P) and time reversal invariance (T) conservation, meaning their\nexpectation values vanish due to nuclear rotation. However, nuclei with an\noctupole deformation have doublets of close opposite parity rotational states\nwith the same spin, which are mixed by T,P-odd nuclear forces. This mixing\nproduces the orientation of the nuclear axis along nuclear spin and all moments\nexisting in the intrinsic frame appear in the laboratory frame (provided the\nnuclear spin I is sufficiently large to allow such moment). Such a mechanism\nproduces enhanced T,P-violating nuclear moments. This enhancement also takes\nplace in nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode.

Among all methods, graph convolution networks (GCNs) are\nextensively utilized because of their superiority in explicit connection\nmodeling. Within a GCN, the graph correlation adjacency matrix drives feature\naggregation and is the key to extracting predictive motion features.\nState-of-the-art methods decompose the spatiotemporal correlation into spatial\ncorrelations for each frame and temporal correlations for each joint. Directly\nparameterizing these correlations introduces redundant parameters to represent\ncommon relations shared by all frames and all joints. Besides, the\nspatiotemporal graph adjacency matrix is the same for different motion samples\nand cannot reflect sample-wise correspondence variances. To overcome these two\nbottlenecks, we propose dynamic spatiotemporal decompose GC (DSTD-GC), which\nonly takes 28.6% parameters of the state-of-the-art GC. The key of DSTD-GC is\nconstrained dynamic correlation modeling, which explicitly parameterizes the\ncommon static constraints as a spatial/temporal vanilla adjacency matrix shared\nby all frames/joints and dynamically extracts correspondence variances for each\nframe/joint with an adjustment modeling function. For each sample, the common\nconstrained adjacency matrices are fixed to represent generic motion patterns,\nwhile the extracted variances complete the matrices with specific pattern\nadjustments. Meanwhile, we mathematically reformulate GCs on spatiotemporal\ngraphs into a unified form and find that DSTD-GC relaxes certain constraints of\nother GC, which contributes to a better representation capability.

By considering these issues, we\npropose an adaptive size clustering technique that aggregates homogeneous\nrecords in similar clusters, and the size of the clusters is determined after\nthe semantic analysis of the records. To achieve this, we extend the MDAV\nmicroaggregation algorithm to semantically analyze the unstructured records by\nrelying on the taxonomic databases (i.e., WordNet), and then aggregating them\nin homogeneous clusters.

However, in many real-world situations, they inevitably\nsuffer from the issue of outliers, which hinders traditional solvers from\nmaking correct estimates. In this paper, we present a novel, general-purpose\nrobust estimator IMOT (Iterative Multi-layered Otsu's Thresholding) using\nstandard non-minimal solvers to rapidly reject outliers for spatial perception\nproblems. First, we propose a new outlier-robust iterative optimizing framework\nwhere in each iteration all the measurement data are separated into two groups\naccording to the residual errors and only the group with lower residual errors\ncan be preserved for estimation in the next iteration. Second, we introduce and\nemploy the well-known Otsu's method (from image processing) to conduct\nthresholding on the residual errors so as to obtain the best separation\n(grouping) statistically which maximizes the between-class variance. Third, to\nenhance robustness, we design a multi-layered Otsu's thresholding approach in\ncombination with our framework to sift out the true inliers from outliers that\nmight even occupy the majority of measurements. We test our robust estimator\nIMOT on 5 different spatial perception problems including: rotation averaging,\nrotation search, point cloud registration, category-level registration, and\nSLAM. Experiments show that IMOT is robust against 70%--90% of outliers and can\ntypically converge in only 3--10 iterations, being 3--125 times faster than\nexisting robust estimators: GNC and ADAPT.

Public\ntransit fare structures are often a combination of various fare strategies such\nas, e.g., distance-based fares, zone-based fares or flat fares. The rules that\ndetermine the actual ticket price are often very complex. Accordingly, fare\nstructures are notoriously difficult to model as it is in general not\nsufficient to simply assign costs to arcs in a routing graph. Research into\nPOEAP is scarce and usually either relies on heuristics or only considers\nrestrictive fare models that are too limited to cover the full scope of most\nreal-world applications.

Using a low-order\nstochastic thermoacoustic model, we show that the reported abrupt transitions\noccur when an initially stable, supercritical limit cycle becomes unstable,\nleading to a secondary bifurcation to a large amplitude limit cycle solution.\nThe states of combustion noise and intermittency observed in these turbulent\ncombustors are well captured by the additive stochastic noise in the model.\nThrough amplitude reduction, we analyze the underlying potential functions\naffecting the stability of the observed dynamical states.

This\nmakes our self-normalized test tuning parameter free and considerably less\nprone to size distortions at the cost of only small power losses. In\ncombination with an asymptotically justified vector autoregressive sieve\nbootstrap to construct critical values, the self-normalization approach shows\nfurther improvement in small to medium samples when the level of error serial\ncorrelation or regressor endogeneity is large.

An MTSC model that has\nattracted attention recently is ROCKET, based on random convolutional kernels,\nboth because of its very fast training process and its state-of-the-art\naccuracy.

We\nfirst provide an overview of AutoML for DRS models and the related techniques.\nThen we discuss the state-of-the-art AutoML approaches that automate the\nfeature selection, feature embeddings, feature interactions, and model training\nin DRS. We point out that the existing AutoML-based recommender systems are\ndeveloping to a multi-component joint search with abstract search space and\nefficient search algorithm. Finally, we discuss appealing research directions\nand summarize the survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 11:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 12:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Since\nthe treatment of heat flux using MLIPs with regularization can be decomposed\ninto elemental contributions or conducted in frequency space, this approach is\nexpected to be useful for investigating the origin of thermal conductivity\nobtained from the Green-Kubo formula.

Due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth disparity labels in\ndiverse real-world systems, we start from an unsupervised learning perspective.\nHowever, resolution asymmetry caused by unknown degradations between two views\nhinders the effectiveness of the generally assumed photometric consistency. To\novercome this challenge, we propose to impose the consistency between two views\nin a feature space instead of the image space, named feature-metric\nconsistency. Interestingly, we find that, although a stereo matching network\ntrained with the photometric loss is not optimal, its feature extractor can\nproduce degradation-agnostic and matching-specific features. These features can\nthen be utilized to formulate a feature-metric loss to avoid the photometric\ninconsistency. Moreover, we introduce a self-boosting strategy to optimize the\nfeature extractor progressively, which further strengthens the feature-metric\nconsistency. Experiments on both simulated datasets with various degradations\nand a self-collected real-world dataset validate the superior performance of\nthe proposed method over existing solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 12:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In this work,\nwe compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement\nlearning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules.

In domain generalization, the low\ngeneralization ability for unseen target domains is clearly due to overfitting\nto the source domain. To address this problem, previous works have focused on\ngeneralizing the domain by removing or diversifying the styles of the source\ndomain. These alleviated overfitting to the source-style but overlooked\noverfitting to the source-content. In this paper, we propose to diversify both\nthe content and style of the source domain with the help of the wild. Our main\nidea is for networks to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information\nfrom the wild. To this end, we diversify styles by augmenting source features\nto resemble wild styles and enable networks to adapt to a variety of styles.\nFurthermore, we encourage networks to learn class-discriminant features by\nproviding semantic variations borrowed from the wild to source contents in the\nfeature space. Finally, we regularize networks to capture consistent semantic\ninformation even when both the content and style of the source domain are\nextended to the wild.

We study\nthe asymmetry of the stellar component in a sample of well-resolved disky\ngalaxies selected from the last snapshot of the Illustris TNG100 simulation\nbased on their flatness and rotational support. Among 1912 disks, we identify\n161 objects with significant asymmetry in terms of the m=1 Fourier mode of the\nstellar component within (1-2) stellar half-mass radii and describe their\nproperties using three representative examples. The profiles of the m=1 mode\ntypically increase with radius, and the corresponding phase is constant in the\nasymmetric region, signifying a global distortion. Following the evolution of\nthe lopsided disks over time, we find that their history is rather uneventful\nand the occurrence of the asymmetry is fairly recent. Only about 1/3 of the\nlopsided disks experienced any strong interaction recently that could have led\nto the distortion of their shape: 24% were affected by a more massive object\nand 9% underwent a gas-rich merger. Still, a majority of lopsided disks show a\nsignificant increase in their recent star formation rate. The most frequent\nmechanism for the formation of lopsided disks thus seems to be asymmetric star\nformation probably related to gas accretion, although the distortions in the\ngas and stars are not strongly correlated. This picture is supported by the\nfinding that the lopsided population on average contains more gas, has higher\nstar formation rate, lower metallicity and bluer color than the remaining\ndisks. These correlations are similar to those seen in real galaxies, even\nthough the fraction of simulated lopsided disks (8%) is much lower than in\nobservations (30%). The observed correlation between the presence of the\nasymmetry and a bar is not reproduced either. These discrepancies may be due to\noverquenching or insufficient resolution of IllustrisTNG simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 13:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

For simplicity we consider an elliptical\ncell geometry, a setting appropriate to a generic non-spherical animal cell.\nWithin this context we introduce four models of increasing complexity, in each\ncase introducing additional mechanisms that govern the interaction of the MTs\nwith the cell boundary. In order, we consider the cases: MTs that can bind to\nthe boundary with a fixed mean residence time (M0), force-producing MTs that\ncan slide on the boundary towards the cell poles (MS), MTs that interact with a\ngeneric polarity factor that is transported and deposited at the boundary, and\nwhich in turn stabilizes the MTs at the boundary (MP), and a final model in\nwhich both sliding and stabilization by polarity factors is taken into account\n(MSP). In the baseline model (M0), the exponential length distribution of MTs\ncauses most of the interactions at the cell boundary to occur along the shorter\ntransverse direction in the cell, leading to transverse biaxial order. MT\nsliding (MS) is able to reorient the main axis of this biaxial order along the\nlongitudinal axis. The polarization mechanism introduced in MP and MSP\noverrules the geometric bias towards bipolar order observed in M0 and MS, and\nallows the establishment of unipolar order either along the short- (MP) or the\nlong cell axis (MSP).

However, the non-negligible domain gaps between training\nand testing sets make it difficult to learn deep models generalizing well to\ntesting images. The diversity of reflections and scenes further makes it a\nmission impossible to learn a single model being effective to all testing sets\nand real-world reflections. In this paper, we tackle these issues by learning\nSIRR models from a domain generalization perspective. Particularly, for each\nsource set, a specific SIRR model is trained to serve as a domain expert of\nrelevant reflection types. For a given reflection-contaminated image, we\npresent a reflection type-aware weighting (RTAW) module to predict expert-wise\nweights. RTAW can then be incorporated with adaptive network combination\n(AdaNEC) for handling different reflection types and scenes, i.e., generalizing\nto unknown domains. Two representative AdaNEC methods, i.e., output fusion (OF)\nand network interpolation (NI), are provided by considering both adaptation\nlevels and efficiency. For images from one source set, we train RTAW to only\npredict expert-wise weights of other domain experts for improving\ngeneralization ability, while the weights of all experts are predicted and\nemployed during testing. An in-domain expert (IDE) loss is presented for\ntraining RTAW. Extensive experiments show the appealing performance gain of our\nAdaNEC on different state-of-the-art SIRR networks.

Despite the numerous developments in visual tracking, existing\ndeep trackers are still likely to fail when tracking against objects with\ndramatic variation. These deep trackers usually do not perform online update or\nupdate single sub-branch of the tracking model, for which they cannot adapt to\nthe appearance variation of objects. Efficient updating methods are therefore\ncrucial for tracking while previous meta-updater optimizes trackers directly\nover parameter space, which is prone to over-fit even collapse on longer\nsequences. To address these issues, we propose a context-aware tracking model\nto optimize the tracker over the representation space, which jointly\nmeta-update both branches by exploiting information along the whole sequence,\nsuch that it can avoid the over-fitting problem. First, we note that the\nembedded features of the localization branch and the box-estimation branch,\nfocusing on the local and global information of the target, are effective\ncomplements to each other. Based on this insight, we devise a\ncontext-aggregation module to fuse information in historical frames, followed\nby a context-aware module to learn affinity vectors for both branches of the\ntracker.

We discuss in some detail our chosen set of atomic rates and the\ndifferences with those adopted by previous models. The main differences lie in\nthe treatment of electron and proton collision rates and we discuss which\ntransitions are least sensitive to the choice of these rates and therefore best\nsuited to high precision abundance determinations. We have focused our\ncomparisons on the case B approximation where only He and He$^+$ are\nconsidered, but also present results of full models including the bare nuclei,\nphoto-excitation and photo-ionisation and either black-body or observed\nilluminating spectrum in the case of the Orion nebula, to indicate which\nspectral lines are affected by opacity. For those transitions, accurate\nradiative transfer calculations should be performed. We provide tables of\nemissivities for all transitions within $n \\le 5$ and all those between the $n\n\\le 5$ and $n' \\le 25$ states, in the log $T_{\\rm e}$ [K]=10$^{3.0(0.1)4.6}$\nand log $N_{\\rm e}$ [cm$^{-3}$]=10$^{2(0.5)6}$ ranges, and a FORTRAN code to\ninterpolate to any $T_{\\rm e}, N_{\\rm e}$ within these ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 14:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

It is a challenging issue due to the consequences of non-i.i.d.\nproperties of client's data, often referred to as statistical heterogeneity and\nsmall local data samples from the various data distributions. Therefore, to\ndevelop robust generalized global and personalized models, conventional FL\nmethods need redesigning the knowledge aggregation from biased local models\nwhile considering huge divergence of learning parameters due to skewed client\ndata. In this work, we demonstrate that the knowledge transfer mechanism is a\nde facto technique to achieve these objectives and develop a novel knowledge\ndistillation-based approach to study the extent of knowledge transfer between\nthe global model and local models. Henceforth, our method considers the\nsuitability of transferring the outcome distribution and (or) the embedding\nvector of representation from trained models during cross-device knowledge\ntransfer using a small proxy dataset in heterogeneous FL. In doing so, we\nalternatively perform cross-device knowledge transfer following general\nformulations as 1) global knowledge transfer and 2) on-device knowledge\ntransfer. Through simulations on four federated datasets, we show the proposed\nmethod achieves significant speedups and high personalized performance of local\nmodels. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers a more stable algorithm than\nFedAvg during the training, with minimal communication data load when\nexchanging the trained model's outcomes and representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 14:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Current methods address this problem by injecting random variables\nfrom a single latent space into a deterministic motion prediction framework,\nwhich precludes the inherent multi-modality in human motion generation. In\naddition, previous works rarely explore the use of attention to select which\nframes are to be used to inform the generation process up to our knowledge. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Hierarchical Transformer Dynamical\nVariational Autoencoder, HiT-DVAE, which implements auto-regressive generation\nwith transformer-like attention mechanisms. HiT-DVAE simultaneously learns the\nevolution of data and latent space distribution with time correlated\nprobabilistic dependencies, thus enabling the generative model to learn a more\ncomplex and time-varying latent space as well as diverse and realistic human\nmotions. Furthermore, the auto-regressive generation brings more flexibility on\nobservation and prediction, i.e. one can have any length of observation and\npredict arbitrary large sequences of poses with a single pre-trained model.

A critical element of our model is a tendency for cells to turn\ntoward their long axis, arising from a coupling between cell shape and\nvelocity, which gives rise to oscillatory and circular motion. Galvanotaxis is\ninfluenced not only by the field-dependent responses, but also cell speed and\ncell shape relaxation rate.

In this paper, we try\nto alleviate the aforementioned two challenges in lip reading by proposing a\nMulti-head Visual-audio Memory (MVM). Firstly, MVM is trained with audio-visual\ndatasets and remembers audio representations by modelling the\ninter-relationships of paired audio-visual representations. At the inference\nstage, visual input alone can extract the saved audio representation from the\nmemory by examining the learned inter-relationships. Therefore, the lip reading\nmodel can complement the insufficient visual information with the extracted\naudio representations. Secondly, MVM is composed of multi-head key memories for\nsaving visual features and one value memory for saving audio knowledge, which\nis designed to distinguish the homophenes. With the multi-head key memories,\nMVM extracts possible candidate audio features from the memory, which allows\nthe lip reading model to consider the possibility of which pronunciations can\nbe represented from the input lip movement. This also can be viewed as an\nexplicit implementation of the one-to-many mapping of viseme-to-phoneme.\nMoreover, MVM is employed in multi-temporal levels to consider the context when\nretrieving the memory and distinguish the homophenes. Extensive experimental\nresults verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in lip reading and in\ndistinguishing the homophenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 06:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-06"}

General covariance helps us to\ndisentangle a theory's substantive content from its merely representational\nartifacts. It is an indispensable tool for a modern understanding of spacetime\ntheories. Motivated by quantum gravity, one may wish to extend these notions to\nquantum spacetime theories (whatever those are). Relatedly, one might want to\nextend these notions to discrete spacetime theories (i.e., lattice theories).\nThis paper delivers such an extension with surprising consequences.\n  One's first intuition regarding discrete spacetime theories may be that they\nintroduce a great deal of fixed background structure (i.e., a lattice) and\nthereby limit our theory's possible symmetries down to those which preserve\nthis fixed structure (i.e., discrete symmetries). However, as I will discuss,\nthese intuitions are doubly wrong and overhasty. Discrete spacetime theories\ncan and do have continuous translation and rotation symmetries. Moreover, the\nexact same theory can be given a wide variety of lattice structures and can\neven be described with no lattice at all. As my discrete analog of general\ncovariance will reveal: lattice structure is rather less like a fixed\nbackground structure or part of an underlying manifold and rather more like a\ncoordinate system, i.e., merely a representational artifact. Thus, the world\ncannot be \"fundamentally set on a square lattice\" (or any other lattice) any\nmore than it could be \"fundamentally set in a certain coordinate system\". Like\ncoordinate systems, lattice structures are just not the sort of thing that can\nbe fundamental; they are both thoroughly representational. Spacetime cannot be\ndiscrete (even when it might be representable as such).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 12:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 08:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 12:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-19"}

In recent years,\na series of publications have studied and criticized Twitter's APIs and Twitter\nhas partially adapted its existing data streams. The newest Twitter API for\nAcademic Research allows to \"access Twitter's real-time and historical public\ndata with additional features and functionality that support collecting more\nprecise, complete, and unbiased datasets.\" The main new feature of this API is\nthe possibility of accessing the full archive of all historic Tweets. In this\narticle, we will take a closer look at the Academic API and will try to answer\ntwo questions. First, are the datasets collected with the Academic API\ncomplete? Secondly, since Twitter's Academic API delivers historic Tweets as\nrepresented on Twitter at the time of data collection, we need to understand\nhow much data is lost over time due to Tweet and account removal from the\nplatform. Our work shows evidence that Twitter's Academic API can indeed create\n(almost) complete samples of Twitter data based on a wide variety of search\nterms. We also provide evidence that Twitter's data endpoint v2 delivers better\nsamples than the previously used endpoint v1.1. Furthermore, collecting Tweets\nwith the Academic API at the time of studying a phenomenon rather than creating\nlocal archives of stored Tweets, allows for a straightforward way of following\nTwitter's developer agreement. Finally, we will also discuss technical\nartifacts and implications of the Academic API.

Despite that, recent\nworks in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both\naspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In\nthis paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and\nattribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature\nof the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via\ndedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features\nand predicting item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art\nsequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between\nthe most recent item's latent features and the target items embeddings for\nscoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target\nitems to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to\nharness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and\ntheir influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four\nreal-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model\nsignificantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item\nrecommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53% in Normalized Discounted\nCumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed\nseveral state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely\nutilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box\nfashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 13:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

However, it is\ninherently challenging since it needs to capture semantic information from\nshort and ambiguous queries and often requires massive task-specific labeled\ndata. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have advanced various\nnatural language processing tasks because they can extract general semantic\ninformation from large-scale corpora. Therefore, there are unprecedented\nopportunities to adopt PLMs for query understanding. However, there is a gap\nbetween the goal of query understanding and existing pre-training strategies --\nthe goal of query understanding is to boost search performance while existing\nstrategies rarely consider this goal. Thus, directly applying them to query\nunderstanding is sub-optimal. On the other hand, search logs contain user\nclicks between queries and urls that provide rich users' search behavioral\ninformation on queries beyond their content. Therefore, in this paper, we aim\nto fill this gap by exploring search logs. In particular, to incorporate search\nlogs into pre-training, we first construct a query graph where nodes are\nqueries and two queries are connected if they lead to clicks on the same urls.\nThen we propose a novel graph-enhanced pre-training framework, GE-BERT, which\ncan leverage both query content and the query graph. In other words, GE-BERT\ncan capture both the semantic information and the users' search behavioral\ninformation of queries. Extensive experiments on various query understanding\ntasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 16:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

Brain signal processing and\nespecially electroencephalogram (EEG) has recently known a growing interest\nboth in academia and industry. One of the main examples is the increasing\nnumber of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aiming to link brains and computers.\nIn this paper, we present a novel framework allowing us to retrieve the\nattention state, i.e degree of attention given to a specific task, from EEG\nsignals. While previous methods often consider the spatial relationship in EEG\nthrough electrodes and process them in recurrent or convolutional based\narchitecture, we propose here to also exploit the spatial and temporal\ninformation with a transformer-based network that has already shown its\nsupremacy in many machine-learning (ML) related studies, e.g. machine\ntranslation. In addition to this novel architecture, an extensive study on the\nfeature extraction methods, frequential bands and temporal windows length has\nalso been carried out. The proposed network has been trained and validated on\ntwo public datasets and achieves higher results compared to state-of-the-art\nmodels. As well as proposing better results, the framework could be used in\nreal applications, e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nsymptoms or vigilance during a driving assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 08:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

We provide an extensive review of local\nauthority regulation of drone use on public open and green spaces, finding that\nmany local authorities are unaware of the issues being created through: (i)\ninappropriately couched or poorly framed byelaws; (ii) multiple byelaws\ncovering the same area by virtue of overlapping jurisdictions; or (iii) the\nlack readily identifiable policies for drone use on public land.\nOverregulation, inconsistent regulation and regulatory disharmony are causing\nconfusion for recreational drone enthusiasts such that it is never clear which\npublic or crown-owned open and green spaces they are allowed to, or prohibited\nfrom, flying. While the government and local authorities might like them to,\ndrones are not going away.
