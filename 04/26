Methods: We computed coronagraphic H-band raw\ncontrast at 300 [mas] and FWHM of the non-coronagraphic PSF, for a total of 111\ndifferent stars observed between 2016 and 2022 with IRDIS. For this, we\nprocessed a large number of individual frames that were obtained under\ndifferent atmospheric conditions.

Multivariate functional approximation\n(MFA) is a new data model that addresses some of the key challenges of volume\nvisualization. MFA provides high-order evaluation of values and derivatives\nanywhere in the spatial domain, mitigating the artifacts caused by the zero- or\nfirst-order interpolation commonly implemented in existing volume visualization\nalgorithms. MFA's compact representation improves the space complexity for\nlarge-scale volumetric data visualization, while its uniform representation of\nboth structured and unstructured data allows the same ray casting algorithm to\nbe used for a variety of input data types. In this paper, we present MFA-DVR,\nthe first direct volume rendering pipeline utilizing the MFA model, for both\nstructured and unstructured volumetric datasets. We demonstrate improved\nrendering quality using MFA-DVR on both synthetic and real datasets through a\ncomparative study with raw and compressed data.

A more thorough approach focuses on the\nprobability of the interval, not on its size. Most attempts to measure the\nprobability of the life-permitting interval for a given parameter rely on a\nBayesian statistical approach for which the prior distribution of the parameter\nis uniform. However, the parameters in these models often take values in spaces\nof infinite size, so that a uniformity assumption is not possible. This is\nknown as the normalization problem. This paper explains a framework to measure\ntuning that, among others, deals with normalization, assuming that the prior\ndistribution belongs to a class of maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. By\nanalyzing an upper bound of the tuning probability for this class of\ndistributions the method solves the so-called weak anthropic principle, and\noffer a solution, at least in this context, to the well-known lack of\ninvariance of maxent distributions. The implication of this approach is that,\nsince all mathematical models need parameters, tuning is not only a question of\nnatural science, but also a problem of mathematical modeling. Cosmological\ntuning is thus a particular instantiation of a more general scenario.\nTherefore, whenever a mathematical model is used to describe nature, not only\nin physics but in all of science, tuning is present. And the question of\nwhether the tuning is fine or coarse for a given parameter -- if the interval\nin which the parameter is located has low or high probability, respectively --\ndepends crucially not only on the interval but also on the assumed class of\nprior distributions. Novel upper bounds for tuning probabilities are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 16:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Though they can generate highly natural human speech, the\niterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the\nutterance's length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to\ngenerating the whole speech time sequence in parallel and then proposed\nGAN-based, flow-based, and score-based models. This paper proposed a new\nthought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting\nsamples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise\nautoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to\nsynthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different\nfrequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the\npreviously generated one. A full band speech can then be reconstructed by using\nthese generated subbands and a synthesis filter bank. Similarly, in BAR, an\n8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By\nredesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time\ndomain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer\nproportional to the utterance's length but the number of subbands/bits. The\ninference efficiency is hence significantly increased. Besides, a post-filter\nis employed to sample audio signals from output posteriors, and its training\nobjective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed\nautoregressive methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model\nis able to synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration.\nCompared with the baseline autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, the\nproposed model achieves better MOS and shows its good generalization ability\nwhile synthesizing 44 kHz speech or utterances from unseen speakers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 17:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

In this work, we exploit the parent state picture to\nargue that the answer is yes. We propose a range of \"monopole Josephson\neffects\" that arise when two ordered states are separated by a region of the\nparent DSL.

It is, however, a known fact that PSO has a severe\ndrawback in the update of its global best (gbest) particle, which has a crucial\nrole of guiding the rest of the swarm. In this paper, we propose three\nefficient solutions to remedy this problem using the SPSA Algorithm. In the\nfirst approach, gbest is updated with respect to a global estimation of the\ngradient and can avoid getting trapped into a local optimum. The second\napproach is based on the formation of an alternative or artificial global best\nparticle, the so-called aGB, which can replace the native gbest particle for a\nbetter guidance, the decision of which is held by a fair competition between\nthe two. The third approach is based on the update of the swarm particle. For\nthis purpose we use simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)\nfor its low cost. Since SPSA is applied only to the gbest (not to the entire\nswarm) or to the entire swarm, both approaches result thus in a negligible\noverhead cost for the entire PSO process. Both approaches are shown to\nsignificantly improve the performance of PSO over a wide range of non-linear\nfunctions, especially if SPSA and PSO parameters are well selected to fit the\nproblem at hand. As in the basic PSO application, experimental results show\nthat the proposed approaches significantly improved the quality of the\nOptimization process as measured by a statistic analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 18:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Existing learning-based methods\nrely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we\nare the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance\nsegmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each\ndental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we\npresent a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely\nDArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and\ntooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help\nlocate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch\nproposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.\nSpecifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental\narch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve\nregression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to\nrefine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware\nPoint Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.\nMeantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training\nstrategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the\ntooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our\nDArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance\nis superior to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 18:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

At the present day, most haloscope tuning systems are based on\nmechanical devices which can lead to failures due to the complexity of the\nenvironment in which they are used. However, the electronic tuning making use\nof ferroelectric materials can provide a path that is less vulnerable to\nmechanical failures and thus complements and expands current tuning systems. In\nthis work, we present and design a novel concept for using the ferroelectric\nPotassium Tantalate ($KTaO_3$ or KTO) material as a tuning element in\nhaloscopes based on coupled microwave cavities. In this line, the structures\nused in the Relic Axion Detector Exploratory Setup (RADES) group are based on\nseveral cavities that are connected by metallic irises, which act as\ninterresonator coupling elements. In this article, we also show how to use\nthese $KTaO_3$ films as interresonator couplings between cavities, instead of\ninductive or capacitive metallic windows used in the past. These two concepts\nrepresent a crucial upgrade over the current systems employed in the dark\nmatter axions community, achieving a tuning range of $2.23 \\, \\%$ which\nrepresents a major improvement as compared to previous works ($<0.1 \\, \\%$) for\nthe same class of tuning systems.

In this context, the transition from the first generation of\noptical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode to the second generation of\noptical-bypass marked a paradigm shift in redesigning optical transport\nnetworks towards greater network efficiency. Optical-bypass operation has then\nbecome the \\textit{de facto} approach adopted by the majority of carriers in\nboth metro and backbone networks in the last two decades and has remained\nbasically unchanged.

Specifically, built\non fictitious play, we recast the problem into repeatedly solving standard\nFBSDEs with explicit coefficient functions. These coefficient functions are\nused to approximate the MV-FBSDEs' model coefficients with full distribution\ndependence, and are updated by solving another supervising learning problem\nusing training data simulated from the last iteration's FBSDE solutions. We use\ndeep neural networks to solve standard BSDEs and approximate coefficient\nfunctions in order to solve high-dimensional MV-FBSDEs.

This issue is particularly relevant for Nb3Sn\nmagnets, where the loads applied to the Nb3Sn filaments can reach the\ndegradation limits of critical current.

Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a\nneural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and\ntinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank\nfilling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique\nadvantages in learning the \"materials grammars\" together with high-quality\ngeneration, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically\nvalid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\\% charge neutrality and\n84.8\\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher\ncompared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation\nprocess of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned\nmaterials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the\nTCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to\ndiscover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations.

In this contribution, we present a workflow for the\ndevelopment of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of\nthe department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The\nextensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression\nof a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. We found out for\nthe disease AMD a significant deterioration of the visual acuity over time.\nWithin our proposed multistage system, we classify the VA progression into the\nthree groups of therapy \"winners\", \"stabilizers\", and \"losers\" (WSL scheme).\nOur OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks\nresults in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to\ncomplete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a\nmore precise VA modelling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA\nexaminations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict\nthe VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is\ncurrently restricted to IVOM / no therapy. While achieving a prediction\naccuracy of up to 69 % (macro average F1-score) when considering all three\nWSL-based progression groups, this corresponds to an improvement by 11.2 % in\ncomparison to our ophthalmic expertise (57.8 %).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 21:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 11:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Thus,\ntopology-driven network alignment of the protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nnetworks of two species should uncover similar interaction patterns and allow\nidentification of functionally similar proteins. Howver, few of the fifty or\nmore algorithms for PPI network alignment have demonstrated a significant link\nbetween network topology and functional similarity, and none have recovered\northologs using network topology alone. We find that the major contributing\nfactors to this failure are: (i) edge densities in current PPI networks are too\nlow to expect topological network alignment to succeed; (ii) when edge\ndensities are high enough, some measures of topological similarity easily\nuncover functionally similar proteins while others do not; and (iii) most\nnetwork alignment algorithms fail to optimize their own topological objective\nfunctions, hampering their ability to use topology effectively.

In the proposed gLaSDI framework, an autoencoder discovers intrinsic\nnonlinear latent representations of high-dimensional data, while dynamics\nidentification (DI) models capture local latent-space dynamics. An interactive\ntraining algorithm is adopted for the autoencoder and local DI models, which\nenables identification of simple latent-space dynamics and enhances accuracy\nand efficiency of data-driven reduced-order modeling. To maximize and\naccelerate the exploration of the parameter space for the optimal model\nperformance, an adaptive greedy sampling algorithm integrated with a\nphysics-informed residual-based error indicator and random-subset evaluation is\nintroduced to search for the optimal training samples on the fly. Further, to\nexploit local latent-space dynamics captured by the local DI models for an\nimproved modeling accuracy with a minimum number of local DI models in the\nparameter space, a k-nearest neighbor convex interpolation scheme is employed.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various\nnonlinear dynamical problems, including Burgers equations, nonlinear heat\nconduction, and radial advection. The proposed adaptive greedy sampling\noutperforms the conventional predefined uniform sampling in terms of accuracy.\nCompared with the high-fidelity models, gLaSDI achieves 17 to 2,658x speed-up\nwith 1 to 5% relative errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 04:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

This\npaper aims to significantly reduce training costs with effective use of\npreemptible instances, i.e., those that can be obtained at a much cheaper price\nwhile idle, but may be preempted whenever requested by priority users. Doing\nso, however, requires new forms of resiliency and efficiency to cope with the\npossibility of frequent preemptions - a failure model that is drastically\ndifferent from the occasional failures in normal cluster settings that existing\ncheckpointing techniques target.\n  We present Bamboo, a distributed system that tackles these challenges by\nintroducing redundant computations into the training pipeline, i.e., whereby\none node performs computations over not only its own layers but also over some\nlayers in its neighbor. Our key insight is that training large models often\nrequires pipeline parallelism where \"pipeline bubbles\" naturally exist. Bamboo\ncarefully fills redundant computations into these bubbles, providing resilience\nat a low cost. Across a variety of widely used DNN models, Bamboo outperforms\ntraditional checkpointing by 3.7x in training throughput, and reduces costs by\n2.4x compared to a setting where on-demand instances are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Given\nhidden-space representations of samples in each class, REPRINT extrapolates, in\na randomized fashion, augmented examples for target class by using subspaces\nspanned by principal components to summarize distribution structure of both\nsource and target class. Consequently, the examples generated would diversify\nthe target while maintaining the original geometry of target distribution.\nBesides, this method involves a label refinement component which allows to\nsynthesize new soft labels for augmented examples. Compared with different NLP\ndata augmentation approaches under a range of data imbalanced scenarios on four\ntext classification benchmark, REPRINT shows prominent improvements. Moreover,\nthrough comprehensive ablation studies, we show that label refinement is better\nthan label-preserving for augmented examples, and that our method suggests\nstable and consistent improvements in terms of suitable choices of principal\ncomponents.

The IR SBF results from Jensen et\nal. (2021; arXiv:2105.08299) provide a large and uniformly measured sample of\nIR SBF distances which we directly compare with distances to 25 SNIa host\ngalaxies. We divide the Hubble flow SNIa into sub-samples that best match the\ndivergent supernova properties seen in the IR SBF hosts and Cepheid hosts. We\nfurther divide the SNIa into a sample with light curve widths and host masses\nthat are congruent to those found in the SBF-calibrated hosts. We refit the\nlight curve stretch and color correlations with luminosity, and use these\nrevised parameters to calibrate the Hubble flow supernovae with IR SBF\ncalibrators. Relative to the Hubble flow, the average calibrator distance\nmoduli vary by 0.03mag depending on the SNIa subsamples examined and this adds\na 1.8% systematic uncertainty to our Hubble constant estimate.

Contrary to\nin-person conferences, virtual conferences face the challenge of efficiently\nscheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants from\ndifferent timezones and their interests in attending different talks. A natural\nobjective for conference organizers is to maximize efficiency, e.g., total\nexpected audience participation across all talks. However, we show that\noptimizing for efficiency alone can result in an unfair virtual conference\nschedule, where individual utilities for participants and speakers can be\nhighly unequal. To address this, we formally define fairness notions for\nparticipants and speakers, and derive suitable objectives to account for them.\nAs the efficiency and fairness objectives can be in conflict with each other,\nwe propose a joint optimization framework that allows conference organizers to\ndesign schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) among efficiency,\nparticipant fairness and speaker fairness objectives. While the optimization\nproblem can be solved using integer programming to schedule smaller\nconferences, we provide two scalable techniques to cater to bigger conferences.\nExtensive evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the efficacy and\nflexibility of our proposed approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 03:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Second, while most\ncurrent models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique\nself-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation\ncomponents better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware\nGraph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with\nfeature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of\nboth the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph\nwith feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node\nweight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two\nadditional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge\nDiscrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in\nrecommendation process.

Time-frequency masking based approaches have\nbeen shown to work well, but they need additional hyper-parameters to scale the\nmask to limit speech distortion. Such mask scalars are typically hand-tuned and\nchosen conservatively. In this work, we present a technique to predict mask\nscalars using an ASR-based loss in an end-to-end fashion, with minimal increase\nin the overall model size and complexity. We evaluate the approach on two\nrobust ASR tasks: multichannel enhancement in the presence of speech and\nnon-speech noise, and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). Results show that the\npresented algorithm consistently improves word error rate (WER) without the\nneed for any additional tuning over strong baselines that use hand-tuned\nhyper-parameters: up to 16% for multichannel enhancement in noisy conditions,\nand up to 7% for AEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 06:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

These were originally detected as a displacement of\nthe interstellar medium about the midplane, either in terms of vertical\ndistance or vertical velocity. Over the past decade, similar patterns have\nemerged in the Milky Way's stellar disc. We investigate how these vertical\nwaves are triggered by a passing satellite. Using high-resolution\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations, we systematically study how the corrugations\nset up and evolve jointly in the stellar and gaseous discs. We find that the\ngas corrugations follow the stellar corrugations, i.e. they are initially in\nphase although, after a few rotation periods (500-700 Myr), the distinct waves\nseparate and thereafter evolve in different ways. The spatial and kinematic\namplitudes (and thus the energy) of the corrugations dampen with time, with the\ngaseous corrugation settling at a faster rate (~800 Myr versus ~1 Gyr). In\ncontrast, the vertical energy of individual disc stars is fairly constant\nthroughout the galaxy's evolution. This difference arises because corrugations\nare an emergent phenomenon supported by the collective, ordered motions of\nco-spatial ensembles of stars. We show that the damping of the stellar\ncorrugations can be understood as a consequence of incomplete phase mixing,\nwhile the damping of the gaseous corrugations is a natural consequence of the\ndissipative nature of the gas. We suggest that - in the absence of further,\nstrong perturbations - the degree of correlation between the stellar and\ngaseous waves may help to age-date the phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 06:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 01:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-28"}

On many modern cameras, dual-pixel (DP)\nsensors create two-image views, based on which stereo information can be\nexploited to benefit defocus deblurring. Despite the impressive results\nachieved by existing DP defocus deblurring methods, the misalignment between DP\nimage views is still not studied, leaving room for improving DP defocus\ndeblurring. In this work, we propose a Dual-Pixel Alignment Network (DPANet)\nfor defocus deblurring. Generally, DPANet is an encoder-decoder with\nskip-connections, where two branches with shared parameters in the encoder are\nemployed to extract and align deep features from left and right views, and one\ndecoder is adopted to fuse aligned features for predicting the sharp image. Due\nto that DP views suffer from different blur amounts, it is not trivial to align\nleft and right views. To this end, we propose novel encoder alignment module\n(EAM) and decoder alignment module (DAM). In particular, a correlation layer is\nsuggested in EAM to measure the disparity between DP views, whose deep features\ncan then be accordingly aligned using deformable convolutions. DAM can further\nenhance the alignment of skip-connected features from encoder and deep features\nin decoder. By introducing several EAMs and DAMs, DP views in DPANet can be\nwell aligned for better predicting latent sharp image. Experimental results on\nreal-world datasets show that our DPANet is notably superior to\nstate-of-the-art deblurring methods in reducing defocus blur while recovering\nvisually plausible sharp structures and textures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 03:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, in realistic scenarios, these methods suffer from\ninefficiency as new domains are constantly emerging. In this paper, we propose\na robust contrastive alignment method to align text classification features of\nvarious domains in the same feature space by supervised contrastive learning.\nBy this means, we only need two universal feature extractors to achieve\nmulti-domain text classification.

Here we\nexplore further the issue of cartilage boundary lubrication, which has been\nattributed to phospholipid (PL)-exposing layers at the cartilage surface in\npart. A surface force balance (SFB) with unique sensitivity is used to\ninvestigate the normal and frictional interactions of the boundary layers\nformed by PLs extracted from osteoarthritic (OA) human synovial fluid (hSF).\nOur results reveal that vesicles of the OA-hSF lipids rupture spontaneously to\nform bilayers on the mica substrate (which, like the in-vivo articular\ncartilage surface in synovial joints, is negatively-charged) which then undergo\nhemifusion at quite low pressures in the SFB, attributed to the large\nheterogeneity of the hSF lipids. Nanometric friction measurements reveal\nfriction coefficients mu = ca. 0.03 across the hemi-fused bilayer of these\nlipids, indicating residual hydration lubrication at the lipid-headgroup vs.\nsubstrate interface. Addition of calcium ions causes an increase in friction to\nmu = ca. 0.2, attributed either to calcium-bridging attraction of lipid\nheadgroups to the negatively-charged substrate, or a shift of the slip plane to\nthe more dissipative hydrophobic-tail vs. hydrophobic-tail interface. Our\nresults suggest that the heterogeneity and composition of the OA-hSF lipids may\nbe associated with higher friction at the cartilage boundary layers, and thus a\nconnection with greater wear and degradation, due to hemifusion of the exposed\nlipid bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

The\ndesired reference tracking is solved using the well-known flatness and Lyapunov\napproaches. The reference profile is obtained by solving the motion planning\nproblem for the nominal plant. To robustify the closed-loop system in the\npresence of the disturbances and uncertainties, it is then augmented with PI\nfeedback plus a discontinuous component responsible for rejecting matched\ndisturbances with \\textit{a priori} known magnitude bounds. Such control law\nonly requires the information of the system at the same boundary as the control\ninput is located. The resulting dynamic controller globally exponentially\nstabilizes the error dynamics while also attenuating the influence of\nLipschitz-in-time external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. For the\ncase when the motion planning is performed over the uncertain plant, an\nexponential Input-to-State Stability is obtained, preserving the boundedness of\nthe tracking error norm. The proposed controller relies on a discontinuous term\nthat however passes through an integrator, thereby minimizing the chattering\neffect in the plant dynamics.

To develop numerical\nsimulations for predictive and design purposes, macro-scale High Fidelity\nModels (HFMs) of the contact interfaces are required. However, the high\ncomputational cost of such HFMs impedes the feasibility of the simulations. To\nthis end, we propose a model-driven method for constructing hyper-reduced order\nmodels of such assemblies. Focusing on steady-state analysis, we use the\nMulti-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM) to formulate the equations of motion in\nfrequency domain. The reduction basis is constructed through solving a set of\nvibration problems corresponding to fictitious interface conditions.\nSubsequently, a Galerkin projection reduces the order of the model.\nNonetheless, the necessary fine discretization of the interfaces represents a\nbottleneck for achieving high speedups. For this reason, we implement an\nadapted Energy Conserving Weighing and Sampling (ECSW) technique for Hyper\nReduction (HR), thereby allowing significant speedups for meshes of arbitrary\nfineness.

Here we review the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer mean-field theory emphasizing its origin as a\nvariational approximation for the grand potential. The variational parameters\nare the effective fields that enter in the mean-field Hamiltonian, namely the\nHartree-Fock potential and the pairing potential. The superfluid weight is\nusually computed by ignoring the dependence of the effective fields on the\ntwisted boundary conditions. However, it has been pointed out in recent works\nthat this can lead to unphysical results, particularly in the case of lattice\nmodels with flat bands. As a first result, we show that taking into account the\ndependence of the effective fields on the twisted boundary conditions leads in\nfact to the generalized random phase approximation. Our second result is\nproviding the mean-field grand potential as an explicit function of the\none-particle density matrix. This allows us to derive the expression for the\nsuperfluid weight within the generalized random phase approximation in a\ntransparent manner.

For example, a few popular items take up more and more exposure\nopportunities, severely hurting the recommendation quality on niche items --\nknown as the notorious Mathew effect. In this work, we develop a new learning\nparadigm named Cross Pairwise Ranking (CPR) that achieves unbiased\nrecommendation without knowing the exposure mechanism.

Although the convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) has been proven to have excellent performance in image\nsegmentation tasks, it is difficult to obtain global information. The lack of\nglobal information will seriously affect the accuracy of the segmentation\nresults of the lesion area. In addition, there are visual representation\ndifferences between multimodal data of the same patient. These differences will\naffect the results of the automatic segmentation methods. To solve these\nproblems, we propose a segmentation method suitable for multimodal medical\nimages that can capture global information, named TranSiam.

In each path,\nwe utilize convolution to extract detailed information in low level stage, and\ndesign a ICMT block to extract global information in high level stage. ICMT\nblock embeds convolution in the transformer, which can extract global\ninformation while retaining spatial and detailed information. Furthermore, we\ndesign a novel fusion mechanism based on cross attention and selfattention,\ncalled TMM block, which can effectively fuse features between different\nmodalities.

What is the\ninfluence of user experience on the user satisfaction rating of TDS as opposed\nto, or in addition to, utility? We collect data by providing an additional\nannotation layer for dialogues sampled from the ReDial dataset, a widely used\nconversational recommendation dataset. Unlike prior work, we annotate the\nsampled dialogues at both the turn and dialogue level on six dialogue aspects:\nrelevance, interestingness, understanding, task completion, efficiency, and\ninterest arousal. The annotations allow us to study how different dialogue\naspects influence user satisfaction. We introduce a comprehensive set of user\nexperience aspects derived from the annotators' open comments that can\ninfluence users' overall impression. We find that the concept of satisfaction\nvaries across annotators and dialogues, and show that a relevant turn is\nsignificant for some annotators, while for others, an interesting turn is all\nthey need.

The prior (CNN) relies on\nsmall-windowed kernels to capture the regional clues, demonstrating solid local\nexpressiveness. On the contrary, the latter (transformer) establishes\nlong-range global connections between localities for holistic learning.\nInspired by this complementary nature, there is a growing interest in designing\nhybrid models to best utilize each technique. Current hybrids merely replace\nconvolutions as simple approximations of linear projection or juxtapose a\nconvolution branch with attention, without concerning the importance of\nlocal/global modeling. To tackle this, we propose a new hybrid named Adaptive\nSplit-Fusion Transformer (ASF-former) to treat convolutional and attention\nbranches differently with adaptive weights. Specifically, an ASF-former encoder\nequally splits feature channels into half to fit dual-path inputs. Then, the\noutputs of dual-path are fused with weighting scalars calculated from visual\ncues. We also design the convolutional path compactly for efficiency concerns.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks, such as ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10,\nand CIFAR-100, show that our ASF-former outperforms its CNN, transformer\ncounterparts, and hybrid pilots in terms of accuracy (83.9% on ImageNet-1K),\nunder similar conditions (12.9G MACs/56.7M Params, without large-scale\npre-training).

Methods:\nWe conducted a series of 3D MHD simulations of random driving imposed on a\ngravitationally stratified model of the solar atmosphere. In order to\nunderstand differences between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC)\nheating, we considered the effects of changing the characteristic time scales\nof the imposed velocities. We also investigated the effects of the magnitude of\nthe velocity driving. Results: Complex foot point motions lead to a\nproliferation of current sheets and energy dissipation throughout the corona.\nFor a given amplitude, DC driving typically leads to a greater rate of energy\ninjection when compared to AC driving. This leads to the formation of larger\ncurrents, increased heating rates and higher temperatures in DC simulations.\nThere is no difference in the spatial distribution of energy dissipation across\nsimulations, however, energy release events in AC cases tend to be more\nfrequent and last for less time. Higher velocity driving is associated with\nlarger currents, higher temperatures and the corona occupying a larger fraction\nof the simulation volume. In all cases, most of heating is associated with\nsmall energy release events, which occur much more frequently than large\nevents. Conclusions: When combined with observational results showing a greater\nabundance of power in low frequency modes, these findings suggest that energy\nrelease in the corona is likely to be driven by long time scale motions. In the\ncorona, AC and DC driving will occur concurrently and their effects remain\ndifficult to isolate. The distribution of field line temperatures and the\nasymmetry of temperature profiles may reveal the frequency and longevity of\nenergy release events and therefore the relative importance of AC and DC\nheating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 10:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

Approaches that attempt to tackle\nthis inverse design problem include virtual screening, active machine learning\nand genetic algorithms. However, these approaches rely on a molecular database\nor many electronic structure calculations, and significant computational\nsavings could be achieved if there was prior knowledge of (i) whether the\noptoelectronic properties of a parent molecule could easily be improved and\n(ii) what morphing operations on a parent molecule could improve these\nproperties. In this perspective we address both of these challenges from first\nprinciples.

Here, we report femtosecond elastic second harmonic scattering\n(fs-ESHS) of liquid water in comparison to an isotropic liquid (CCl4) and show\nthat water is indeed a non-uniform liquid, The coherent fs-ESHS intensity was\ninterpreted, using molecular dynamics simulations, as arising from charge\ndensity fluctuations and consequentially enhanced nanoscale polarizabilities\naround transient voids having an average lifetime of 300 fs.

These representations are pre-trained by\nself-supervised learning methods that create training signals from the input.\nFor example, typical audio contrastive learning uses temporal relationships\namong input sounds to create training signals, whereas some methods use a\ndifference among input views created by data augmentations. However, these\ntraining signals do not provide information derived from the intact input\nsound, which we think is suboptimal for learning representation that describes\nthe input as it is.\n  In this paper, we seek to learn audio representations from the input itself\nas supervision using a pretext task of auto-encoding of masked spectrogram\npatches, Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM, a variant of Masked Image Modeling\napplied to audio spectrogram). To implement MSM, we use Masked Autoencoders\n(MAE), an image self-supervised learning method. MAE learns to efficiently\nencode the small number of visible patches into latent representations to carry\nessential information for reconstructing a large number of masked patches.\nWhile training, MAE minimizes the reconstruction error, which uses the input as\ntraining signal, consequently achieving our goal.\n  We conducted experiments on our MSM using MAE (MSM-MAE) models under the\nevaluation benchmark of the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS Challenge.

While the technology is evolving rapidly,\nthe prohibitive cost of reads and writes, the high frequency and the peculiar\nnature of errors occurring in DNA storage pose a significant challenge to its\nadoption. In this work we make a novel observation that the probability of\nsuccessful recovery of a given bit from any type of a DNA-based storage system\nhighly depends on its physical location within the DNA molecule. In other\nwords, when used as a storage medium, some parts of DNA molecules appear\nsignificantly more reliable than others. We show that large differences in\nreliability between different parts of DNA molecules lead to highly inefficient\nuse of error-correction resources, and that commonly used techniques such as\nunequal error-correction cannot be used to bridge the reliability gap between\ndifferent locations in the context of DNA storage.

A random sample of cybersecurity content (ten\ntweets and posts) was also classified for sentiments by twenty human annotators\nto evaluate the performance of VADER. Cybersecurity content on Twitter was at\nleast 48% positive, and Reddit was at least 26.5% positive. The positive or\nneutral content far outweighed negative sentiments across both platforms. When\ncompared to human classification, which was considered the standard or source\nof truth, VADER produced 60% accuracy for Twitter and 70% for Reddit in\nassessing the sentiment; in other words, some agreement between algorithm and\nhuman classifiers. Overall, the goal was to explore an uninhibited research\ntopic about cybersecurity sentiment\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 12:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Through DNA sequencing of microbial communities\n(metagenomics), DNA fragments (reads) of the individual microbes can be\nobtained, which through assembly graphs can be combined into long contiguous\nDNA sequences (contigs). Given the complexity of microbial communities, single\ncontig microbial genomes are rarely obtained. Instead, contigs are eventually\nclustered into bins, with each bin ideally making up a full genome. This\nprocess is referred to as metagenomic binning.\n  Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning rely only on the\nlocal features for the individual contigs. These techniques therefore fail to\nexploit the similarities between contigs as encoded by the assembly graph, in\nwhich the contigs are organized. In this paper, we propose to use Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to leverage the assembly graph when learning contig\nrepresentations for metagenomic binning. Our method, VaeG-Bin, combines\nvariational autoencoders for learning latent representations of the individual\ncontigs, with GNNs for refining these representations by taking into account\nthe neighborhood structure of the contigs in the assembly graph.

Most research to date has focused on\nstudying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the\nadvantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has\nled to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current\nunderstanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by\npresenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that\nparticipated in 4 hackathons across two continents. By analyzing the collected\ndata, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of\ncommunication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to\nmaintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based\non individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different\nstrategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the\nteam in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the\nradical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams\nthat kept synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio\nterritories), in a sort of \"radical virtual co-location\". However, others, such\nas interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with\nother participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the\ndifferent communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were\noverwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual\ncollaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how\ntechnologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this\ncollaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 12:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

The preliminary evidence of topological phonon is found along X-W\ndirection, where the linear band touching is observed as compared to type II\nWeyl phononic material ZnSe.

End-to-end training for such tasks\nis limited by the compute device memory constraints and lack of temporal\nannotations at large-scale. These limitations can be addressed by pre-training\non large datasets of temporally trimmed videos supervised by class annotations.\nOnce the video encoder is pre-trained, it is common practice to freeze it\nduring fine-tuning. Therefore, the video encoder does not learn temporal\nboundaries and unseen classes, causing a domain gap with respect to the\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, using temporally trimmed videos prevents to capture\nthe relations between different action categories and the background context in\na video clip which results in limited generalization capacity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel post-pre-training approach without freezing the\nvideo encoder which leverages language.

One main aspect is that CNNs leverage many\nlearnable convolution filters (kernels) to obtain rich feature descriptors and\nthus can have high capacity to encode complex patterns in visual data analysis.\nAlso, CNNs are flexible in designing their network architecture, such as\nMobileNet, ResNet, Xception, etc. Therefore, it is natural to arise a question:\ncan we design graph convolutional layer as flexibly as that in CNNs?\nInnovatively, in this paper, we consider connecting GCNs with CNNs deeply from\na general perspective of depthwise separable convolution operation.\nSpecifically, we show that GCN and GAT indeed perform some specific depthwise\nseparable convolution operations.

We use multiplex network data from two different contexts -- (1) a\nbehavioral network to represent their potential for infectious disease\ntransmission using a \"simple\" epidemiological model, and (2) users from online\nsocial network sites to represent their potential for information spread using\na threshold-based \"complex\" contagion process. Our results show that contagion\non multiplex data is not captured accurately in models developed from the\nuniplex networks even when they are combined, and that the nature of the\ndifferences between the (combined) uniplex and multiplex results depends on the\nspecific spreading process over these networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 14:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

One example is soft fluidic robotics, which exploits fluidic power and\nstiffness gradients. Porous structures are an interesting type for this\napproach, as they are flexible and allow for fluid transport. Within this work,\nthe Infill-Foam (InFoam) is proposed to print structures with graded porosity\nby liquid rope coiling (LRC). By exploiting LRC, the InFoam method could\nexploit the repeatable coiling patterns to print structures. To this end, only\nthe characterization of the relation between nozzle height and coil radius and\nthe extruded length were necessary (at a fixed temperature). Then by adjusting\nthe nozzle height and/or extrusion speed the porosity of the printed structure\ncould be set. The InFoam method was demonstrated by printing porous structures\nusing styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) with porosities ranging from\n46\\% to 89\\%. In compression tests, the cubes showed large changes in modulus\n(more than 200 times), density (-89\\% compared to bulk), and energy\ndissipation. The InFoam method combined coiling and normal plotting to realize\na large range of porosity gradients. This grading was exploited to realize\nrectangular structures with varying deformation patterns, which included\ntwisting, contraction, and bending. Furthermore, the InFoam method was shown to\nbe capable of programming the behavior of bending actuators by varying the\nporosity. Both the output force and stroke showed correlations similar to those\nof the cubes.

The\nchanges in adsorption/degradation properties have been correlated with the\nsimultaneous evolution of defects and structural properties of ZF-W as annealed\nat different temperatures. The plausible mechanism on the interaction of methyl\nblue with the composites on the adsorption/degradation is proposed. These\nfindings give a clear indication on the importance of defects presence in the\nmixed metal oxide composite to obtain high-performance degradation/adsorption\nproperties for sustainable wastewater treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 15:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

To address this problem, we\nintroduce a regression network termed RegPred Net. The exchange rate to\nforecast is treated as a stochastic process. It is assumed to follow a\ngeneralization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as\nthe generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent\ncoefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these\ncoefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the\nnetwork (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very\nsensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global\noptimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate\nheuristic.

The major challenge in CIL is catastrophic\nforgetting, i.e., preserving as much of the old knowledge as possible while\nlearning new tasks. Various techniques, such as regularization, knowledge\ndistillation, and the use of exemplars, have been proposed to resolve this\nissue.

We hypothesize\nthat a more transferable and generalizable feature representation from the base\nmodel would be beneficial to incremental learning.\n  In this work, we adopt multitask learning during base model training to\nimprove the feature generalizability. Specifically, instead of training a\nsingle model with all the base classes, we decompose the base classes into\nmultiple subsets and regard each of them as a task. These tasks are trained\nconcurrently and a shared feature extractor is obtained for incremental\nlearning. We evaluate our approach on two datasets under various\nconfigurations.

Requester\nposts tasks on crowdsourcing platforms, which employ online workers over the\nInternet to complete tasks, then aggregate and return results to requester. How\nto model the interaction between different types of workers and tasks is a hot\nspot. In this paper, we try to model workers as four types based on their\nability: expert, normal worker, sloppy worker and spammer, and divide tasks\ninto hard, medium and easy task according to their difficulty. We believe that\neven experts struggle with difficult tasks while sloppy workers can get easy\ntasks right, and spammers always give out wrong answers deliberately. So, good\nexamination tasks should have moderate degree of difficulty and\ndiscriminability to score workers more objectively. Thus, we first score\nworkers' ability mainly on the medium difficult tasks, then reducing the weight\nof answers from sloppy workers and modifying the answers from spammers when\ninferring the tasks' ground truth. A probability graph model is adopted to\nsimulate the task execution process, and an iterative method is adopted to\ncalculate and update the ground truth, the ability of workers and the\ndifficulty of the task successively. We verify the rightness and effectiveness\nof our algorithm both in simulated and real crowdsourcing scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 05:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

To this end, quickly and reliably finding suitable\ncharging stations may foster an electric vehicle uptake by mitigating drivers'\nanxieties. Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available\nstations based on real-time availability data but struggle with data\ninaccuracy, e.g., due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public\ncharging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search\nmethods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver's\ndetour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and\ntheoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests\ncentralization or sharing of data, e.g., sharing observations of charging\nstations' availability or visit intentions between drivers. Against this\nbackground, we study coordinated stochastic search algorithms, which help to\nreduce station visit conflicts and improve the drivers' charging experience.

Devices with\nphysical separation of the anodic and cathodic zones, photoelectrochemical-type\n(PEC) or with a photovoltaic element integrated in an electrochemical cell\n(PV/EC), are analysed.

A novel representation called\nInteraction-Transformation was recently proposed to alleviate this problem. In\nthis representation, the function form is restricted to an affine combination\nof terms generated as the application of a single univariate function to the\ninteraction of selected variables. This representation obtained competing\nsolutions on standard benchmarks. Despite the initial success, a broader set of\nbenchmarking functions revealed the limitations of the constrained\nrepresentation.\n  In this paper we propose an extension to this representation, called\nTransformation-Interaction-Rational representation that defines a new function\nform as the rational of two Interaction-Transformation functions. Additionally,\nthe target variable can also be transformed with an univariate function. The\nmain goal is to improve the approximation power while still constraining the\noverall complexity of the expression.\n  We tested this representation with a standard Genetic Programming with\ncrossover and mutation.

However, the failure of\na single node may result in cascading failures that will adversely impact the\ndelivery of the service and will result in failure to meet specific objectives.\nThe impact of these failures needs to be minimised at runtime. Three techniques\nare explored in this paper, namely repartitioning, early-exit and\nskip-connection. When an edge node fails, the repartitioning technique will\nrepartition and redeploy the DNN thus avoiding the failed nodes. The early-exit\ntechnique makes provision for a request to exit (early) before the failed node.\nThe skip connection technique dynamically routes the request by skipping the\nfailed nodes. This paper will leverage trade-offs in accuracy, end-to-end\nlatency and downtime for selecting the best technique given user-defined\nobjectives (accuracy, latency and downtime thresholds) when an edge node fails.\nTo this end, CONTINUER is developed. Two key activities of the framework are\nestimating the accuracy and latency when using the techniques for distributed\nDNNs and selecting the best technique. It is demonstrated on a lab-based\nexperimental testbed that CONTINUER estimates accuracy and latency when using\nthe techniques with no more than an average error of 0.28% and 13.06%,\nrespectively and selects the suitable technique with a low overhead of no more\nthan 16.82 milliseconds and an accuracy of up to 99.86%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 18:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}
