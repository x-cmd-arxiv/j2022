In\nthis proof-of-concept study, we consider Kepler-16 and -34 analogues, and\nexamine dust fluids with Stokes numbers in the range $10^{-4} \\le St \\le\n10^{-1}$ and dust-to-gas ratios of 0.01 and 1. For the canonical dust-to-gas\nratio of 0.01, we find the inclusion of the dust has only a minor effect on the\ncavity and stopping locations of embedded planets compared to dust-free\nsimulations. However, for the enhanced dust-to-gas ratio of unity, assumed to\narise because of significant dust drift and accumulation, we find that the dust\ncan have a dramatic effect by shrinking and circularising the inner cavity,\nwhich brings the parking locations of planets closer to the central binary.\nThis work demonstrates the importance of considering both gas and dust in\nstudies of circumbinary discs and planets, and provides a potential means of\nexplaining the orbital properties of circumbinary planets such as Kepler-34b,\nwhich have hitherto been difficult to explain using gas-only hydrodynamical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 16:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In practice, preference\nlists are short, yet stable matching still works well. This raises two\nquestions:\n  $\\bullet$ Why does it work well?\n  $\\bullet$ Which proposals should agents include in their preference lists?\n  We study these questions in a model, introduced by Lee [17], with preferences\nbased on correlated cardinal utilities: these utilities are based on common\npublic ratings of each agent together with individual private adjustments. Lee\nshowed that for suitable utility functions, in large markets, with high\nprobability, for most agents, all stable matchings yield similar valued\nutilities. By means of a new analysis, we strengthen Lee's result, showing that\nin large markets, with high probability, for $\\it all$ but the agents with the\nlowest public ratings, all stable matchings yield similar valued utilities.

This formulation allows one to define arbitrary magnetic sites\nlocalized to predefined spatial regions, hence rendering the problem of finding\nHeisenberg parameters independent of any orbital decomposition of the problem.\nThe susceptibility is calculated in a plane wave basis, which allows for\nsystematic convergence with respect to unoccupied bands and spatial\nrepresentation. We then apply the method to the well-studied problem of\ncalculating adiabatic spin wave spectra for bulk Fe, Co and Ni, finding good\nagreement with previous calculations. In particular, we utilize the freedom of\ndefining magnetic sites to show that the calculated Heisenberg parameters are\nrobust towards changes in the definition of magnetic sites. This demonstrates\nthat the magnetic sites can be regarded as well-defined and thus asserts the\nrelevance of the Heisenberg model description despite the itinerant nature of\nthe magnetic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 16:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In the effort\nof achieving 3D chemistry-climate modeling, the challenge mainly lies in the\nexpensive computing power required for treating a large number of chemical\nspecies and reactions. Motivated by the need for a robust and computationally\nefficient chemical scheme, we devise a mini-chemical network with a minimal\nnumber of species and reactions for H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. We apply a\nnovel technique to simplify the chemical network from a full kinetics model --\nVULCAN by replacing a large number of intermediate reactions with net\nreactions. The number of chemical species is cut down from 67 to 12, with the\nmajor species of thermal and observational importance retained, including\nH$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, NH$_3$, and HCN. The size of the total\nreactions is greatly reduced from $\\sim$ 800 to 20. The mini-chemical scheme is\nvalidated by verifying the temporal evolution and benchmarking the predicted\ncompositions in four exoplanet atmospheres (GJ 1214b, GJ 436b, HD 189733b, HD\n209458b) against the full kinetics of VULCAN. It reproduces the chemical\ntimescales and composition distributions of the full kinetics well within an\norder of magnitude for the major species in the pressure range of 1 bar -- 0.1\nmbar across various metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios.

This has allowed\nus to create highly nontrivial quantum states and put counterintuitive\nquantum-mechanical effects to test beyond the wildest expectations of the\nfounding fathers of quantum physics. The strong-coupling regime comes with\ncertain challenges though: the need for a large isolation makes it difficult to\naccess the system for control or monitoring purposes. In this work we propose a\nway to access such systems through an engineered environment that does not\ncompromise their strong-coupling effects. As a proof of principle, we apply the\napproach to the photon-blockade effect present in nonlinear resonators, but\nargue that the mechanism is quite universal. We also propose an architecture\nbased on superconducting circuits where the required unconventional environment\ncan be implemented, opening the way to the experimental analysis of our ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 17:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The high core mass fraction is traditionally ascribed to\nevaporative loss of silicates, e.g. following a giant impact, but the high\nabundance of moderately volatile elements in the mantle of Mercury is\ninconsistent with reaching temperatures much above 1,000 K during its\nformation. Here we explore the nucleation of solid particles from a gas of\nsolar composition that cools down in the hot inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disc. The high surface tension of iron causes iron particles to\nnucleate homogeneously (i.e., not on a more refractory substrate) under very\nhigh supersaturation. The low nucleation rates lead to depositional growth of\nlarge iron pebbles on a sparse population of nucleated iron nano-particles.\nSilicates in the form of iron-free MgSiO$_3$ nucleate at similar temperatures\nbut obtain smaller sizes due to the much higher number of nucleated particles.\nThis results in a chemical separation of large iron particles from silicate\nparticles with ten times lower Stokes numbers. We propose that such conditions\nlead to the formation of iron-rich planetesimals by the streaming instability.\nIn this view, Mercury formed by accretion of iron-rich planetesimals with a\nsub-solar abundance of highly reduced silicate material. Our results imply that\nthe iron-rich planets known to orbit the Sun and other stars are not required\nto have experienced mantle-stripping impacts. Instead their formation could be\na direct consequence of temperature fluctuations in protoplanetary discs and\nchemical separation of distinct crystal species through the ensuing nucleation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 18:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

This new framework depends on exploiting user feedback to\nlearn a quality function for patterns. Existing approaches have a weakness in\nthat they use static pre-defined low-level features, and attempt to learn\nindependent weights representing their importance to the user. As an\nalternative, we propose to work with more complex features that are derived\ndirectly from the pattern ranking imposed by the user. Learned weights are then\naggregated onto lower-level features and help to drive the quality function in\nthe right direction. We explore the effect of different parameter choices\nexperimentally and find that using higher-complexity features leads to the\nselection of patterns that are better aligned with a hidden quality function\nwhile not adding significantly to the run times of the method.\n  Getting good user feedback requires to quickly present diverse patterns,\nsomething that we achieve but pushing an existing diversity constraint into the\nsampling component of the interactive mining system LetSip.

However, even within the habitable zone planets can still develop\nuninhabitable climate states. Sustaining a temperate climate over geologic\n($\\sim$Gyr) timescales requires a planet contain sufficient internal energy to\npower a planetary-scale carbon cycle. A major component of a rocky planet's\nenergy budget is the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements,\nespecially $^{40}$K, $^{232}$Th, $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. As the planet ages\nand these elements decay, this radiogenic energy source dwindles. Here we\nestimate the probability distribution of the amount of these heat producing\nelements (HPEs) that enter into rocky exoplanets through Galactic history, by\ncombining the system-to-system variation seen in stellar abundance data with\nthe results from Galactic chemical evolution models. Using these distributions,\nwe perform Monte-Carlo thermal evolution models that maximize the mantle\ncooling rate.

Finally, we compare our code with\nother such tools adopted in the literature, which have been developed or used\nfor similar purposes: pyhIIexplorer, SourceExtractor, HIIphot, and astrodendro.\nWe conclude that pyHIIextractor exceeds the performance of previous tools in\naspects such as the number of recovered regions and the distribution of sizes\nand fluxes (an improvement that is especially noticeable for the faintest and\nsmallest regions). pyHIIextractor is therefore an optimals tool to detect\ncandidate HII regions, offering an accurate estimation of their properties and\na good decontamination of the DIG component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 18:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

This has usually been interpreted to mean that WOs are more oxygen\nrich than WCs, and thus further evolved. However, previous studies have failed\nto model this line, leaving the relative abundances uncertain, and the\nrelationship between the two types unresolved. To answer this fundamental\nquestion, we modeled six WCs and two WOs in the LMC using UV, optical, and NIR\nspectra with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN in order to determine their\nphysical properties. We find that WOs are not richer in oxygen; rather, the O\nVI feature is insensitive to the abundance.

A comparison of our results with single-star Geneva and\nbinary BPASS evolutionary models show that while many properties match, there\nis more carbon and less oxygen in the WOs than either set of evolutionary model\npredicts.

We pretrained CERES using ~468 million\nAmazon sessions and find that CERES outperforms strong pretraining baselines by\nup to 9% in three session search and entity linking tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 21:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

The key point is to\ninterpret the master equation in a conservative sense and then to adapt to the\ninfinite dimensional setting earlier arguments for hyperbolic systems deriving\nfrom a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Here, the master equation is indeed\nregarded as an infinite dimensional system set on the space of probability\nmeasures and is formally written as the derivative of the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the mean field control problem\nlying above the mean field game.

In an effort to avoid\narchitecture specific programming and maintain productivity across platforms,\nthe ice-sheet modeling code known as MALI uses high level abstractions to\nintegrate Trilinos libraries and the Kokkos programming model for performance\nportable code across a variety of different architectures. In this paper, we\nanalyze the performance portable features of MALI via a performance analysis on\ncurrent CPU-based and GPU-based supercomputers. The analysis highlights\nperformance portable improvements made in finite element assembly and multigrid\npreconditioning within MALI with speedups between 1.26-1.82x across CPU and GPU\narchitectures but also identifies the need to further improve performance in\nsoftware coupling and preconditioning on GPUs. We also perform a weak\nscalability study and show that simulations on GPU-based machines perform\n1.24-1.92x faster when utilizing the GPUs. The best performance is found in\nfinite element assembly which achieved a speedup of up to 8.65x and a weak\nscaling efficiency of 82.9% with GPUs. We additionally describe an automated\nperformance testing framework developed for this code base using a changepoint\ndetection method.

This is at least in part due to our\ninability to perfectly calibrate the coordinate frames of today's high degree\nof freedom robot arms that link the head to the end-effectors. We present a\nnovel framework combining pre-touch sensing and deep learning to more\naccurately estimate pose in an efficient manner. The use of pre-touch sensing\nallows our method to localize the object directly with respect to the robot's\nend effector, thereby avoiding error caused by miscalibration of the arms.\nInstead of requiring the robot to scan the entire object with its pre-touch\nsensor, we use a deep neural network to detect object regions that contain\ndistinctive geometric features. By focusing pre-touch sensing on these regions,\nthe robot can more efficiently gather the information necessary to adjust its\noriginal pose estimate. Our region detection network was trained using a new\ndataset containing objects of widely varying geometries and has been labeled in\na scalable fashion that is free from human bias. This dataset is applicable to\nany task that involves a pre-touch sensor gathering geometric information, and\nhas been made publicly available.

This generally requires additional quantum\ncircuit executions and measurements, increasing algorithmic complexity.

However, it struggles with a limited performance compared\nto a well-designed Dilated-FCN model for two major problems. First, commonly\nused upsampling methods in the decoder such as interpolation and deconvolution\nsuffer from a local receptive field, unable to encode global contexts. Second,\nlow-level features may bring noises to the network decoder through skip\nconnections for the inadequacy of semantic concepts in early encoder layers. To\ntackle these challenges, a Global Enhancement Method is proposed to aggregate\nglobal information from high-level feature maps and adaptively distribute them\nto different decoder layers, alleviating the shortage of global contexts in the\nupsampling process. Besides, a Local Refinement Module is developed by\nutilizing the decoder features as the semantic guidance to refine the noisy\nencoder features before the fusion of these two (the decoder features and the\nencoder features).

Secondly, the scheduling decisions needs to be made online without\nthe knowledge of future job arrivals.

To present a theoretically\nguaranteed online scheduling algorithm for multi-server jobs without knowing\nactual processing speeds apriori, in this paper, we propose ESDP (Efficient\nSampling-based Dynamic Programming), which learns the distribution of the\nfluctuated processing speeds over time and simultaneously seeks to maximize the\ncumulative overall utility. The cumulative overall utility is formulated as the\nsum of the utilities of successfully serving each multi-server job minus the\npenalty on the operating, maintaining, and energy cost. ESDP is proved to have\na polynomial complexity and a logarithmic regret, which is a State-of-the-Art\nresult. We also validate it with extensive simulations and the results show\nthat the proposed algorithm outperforms several benchmark policies with\nimprovements by up to 73%, 36%, and 28%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 03:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 14:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Remote mentoring, as an effective\nway, can help solve this problem, but traditional methods are limited to plain\ntext, audio, or 2D video, which are not intuitive nor vivid. Augmented reality\n(AR), a thriving technique being widely used for various education scenarios,\nis promising to offer new possibilities of visual experience and interactive\nteaching.

Therefore derivative-free algorithms are highly desirable. We\npropose a framework, which is built on Kalman methodology, to efficiently\nperform Bayesian inference in such inverse problems. The basic method is based\non an approximation of the filtering distribution of a novel mean-field\ndynamical system into which the inverse problem is embedded as an observation\noperator. Theoretical properties of the mean-field model are established for\nlinear inverse problems, demonstrating that the desired Bayesian posterior is\ngiven by the steady state of the law of the filtering distribution of the\nmean-field dynamical system, and proving exponential convergence to it.

Its impacts are not just\nenvironmental, but also economic, with degradation recognised as a key cause of\nreduced agricultural productivity and rural poverty in the developing world.\nThe degradation literature typically emphasises common property or open access\nnatural resources, and how perverse incentives or missing institutions lead\noptimising private actors to degrade them. By contrast, the present paper\nconsiders degradation occurring on private farms in peasant communities. This\nis a critical yet delicate issue, given the poverty of such areas and questions\nabout the role of farmers in either degrading or regenerating rural lands. The\npaper examines natural resource management by peasant farmers in Tanzania. Its\nkey concern is how the local knowledge informing their management decisions\nadapts to challenges associated with environmental degradation and market\nliberalisation. Given their poverty, this question could have direct\nimplications for the capacity of households to meet their livelihood needs.\nBased on fresh empirical data, the paper finds that differential farmer\nknowledge helps explain the large differences in how households respond to the\ndegradation challenge. The implication is that some farmers adapt more\neffectively to emerging challenges than others, despite all being rational,\noptimising agents who follow the strategies they deem best. The paper thus\nprovides a critique of local knowledge, implying that some farmers experience\nadaptation slippages while others race ahead with effective adaptations. The\npaper speaks to the chronic poverty that plagues many rural communities in the\ndeveloping world. It helps explain the failure of proven sustainable\nagriculture technologies to disseminate readily beyond early innovators. Its\nkey policy implication is to inform improved capacity building for such\ncommunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 05:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Current research rarely considers\nthe diversity of intersections and stochastic behaviors of traffic\nparticipants. For practical applications, the randomness usually leads to some\ndevastating events, which should be the focus of autonomous driving. This paper\nintroduces an adversarial learning paradigm to boost the intelligence and\nrobustness of driving policy for signalized intersections with dense traffic\nflow. Firstly, we design a static path planner which is capable of generating\ntrackable candidate paths for multiple intersections with diversified topology.\nNext, a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) is built based on these\ncandidate paths wherein the bounded uncertainty of dynamic models is considered\nto capture the randomness of driving environment. We propose adversarial policy\ngradient (APG) to solve the COCP wherein the adversarial policy is introduced\nto provide disturbances by seeking the most severe uncertainty while the\ndriving policy learns to handle this situation by competition. Finally, a\ncomprehensive system is established to conduct training and testing wherein the\nperception module is introduced and the human experience is incorporated to\nsolve the yellow light dilemma. Experiments indicate that the trained policy\ncan handle the signal lights flexibly meanwhile realizing the smooth and\nefficient passing with a humanoid paradigm. Besides, APG enables a large-margin\nimprovement of the resistance to the abnormal behaviors and thus ensures a high\nsafety level for the autonomous vehicle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 06:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

By\nanalyzing data of 2001-2008, we find that variations of average area (A),\nphoton flux (F), radiative energy (E) and temperature (T) of coronal holes are\nindependent of latitude. Whereas inferred strength of magnetic field structure\nof the coronal holes is dependent on the latitudes and varies from low near the\nequator to high near both the poles.

A small set of seed samples (32\nin our case) are automatically discovered by analyzing the temporal changes,\nwhich are manually labeled to train a segmentation and representation learning\nmodule.

In the subsequent first three observing runs of the\nLIGO/Virgo network, gravitational waves from $\\sim 50$ compact binary mergers\nhave been announced, with more results to come. The events have mostly been\nproduced by binary black holes, but two binary neutron star mergers have so far\nbeen observed, as well as the mergers of two neutron star - black hole systems.\nFurthermore, gravitational waves emitted by core-collapse supernovae, pulsars\nand the stochastic gravitational wave background are within the\nLIGO/Virgo/KAGRA sensitivity band and are likely to be observed in future\nobservation runs. Beyond signal detection, a major challenge has been the\ndevelopment of statistical and computational methodology for estimating the\nphysical waveform parameters and quantifying their uncertainties in order to\naccurately characterise the emitting system. These methods depend on the\nsources of the gravitational waves and the gravitational waveform model that is\nused.

We exhibit the key role played by a new quantity, called\nneighborhood heterogeneity, on the convergence rate of D-SGD. By coupling the\ncommunication topology and the heterogeneity, our analysis sheds light on the\npoorly understood interplay between these two concepts. We then argue that\nneighborhood heterogeneity provides a natural criterion to learn data-dependent\ntopologies that reduce (and can even eliminate) the otherwise detrimental\neffect of data heterogeneity on the convergence time of D-SGD. For the\nimportant case of classification with label skew, we formulate the problem of\nlearning such a good topology as a tractable optimization problem that we solve\nwith a Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

However, contemporary\ntechniques do not make a clear distinction between the range of spatial\nfrequencies that must be reproduced and those that can be omitted. For a given\neccentricity, there is a range of frequencies that are detectable but not\nresolvable. While the accurate reproduction of these frequencies is not\nrequired, an observer can detect their absence if completely omitted. We use\nthis observation to improve the performance of existing foveated rendering\ntechniques. We demonstrate that this specific range of frequencies can be\nefficiently replaced with procedural noise whose parameters are carefully tuned\nto image content and human perception. Consequently, these frequencies do not\nhave to be synthesized during rendering, allowing more aggressive foveation,\nand they can be replaced by noise generated in a less expensive post-processing\nstep, leading to improved performance of the rendering system. Our main\ncontribution is a perceptually-inspired technique for deriving the parameters\nof the noise required for the enhancement and its calibration.

In\nmammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and\nsegregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the\ndynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to\nmechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct\nresponse features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et\nal. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are\nnecessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain\nunclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with\nmanipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By\nsystematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely\nat k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes,\nbut not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 $\\mu$m length\nscale near chromosomes is also essential.

In the designed fusion network, a\nnovel composite attention learning mechanism (combined with a three-level\nfusion strategy) is used to fully integrate the features in these two data\nsources. Finally, inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a novel stepwise\ntraining strategy is designed to yield a final classification result.

In many cases, electroencephalograms signal can provide important\nphysiological information about the activity of the human brain which can be\nused to diagnose epilepsy. However, visual inspection of a large number of\nelectroencephalogram signals is very time-consuming and can often lead to\ninconsistencies in physicians' diagnoses. Quantification of abnormalities in\nbrain signals can indicate brain conditions and pathology so the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signal plays a key role in the diagnosis of\nepilepsy. In this article, an attempt has been made to create a single\ninstruction for diagnosing epilepsy, which consists of two steps. In the first\nstep, a low-pass filter was used to preprocess the data and three separate\nmid-pass filters for different frequency bands and a multilayer neural network\nwere designed. In the second step, the wavelet transform technique was used to\nprocess data. In particular, this paper proposes a multilayer perceptron neural\nnetwork classifier for the diagnosis of epilepsy, that requires normal data and\nepilepsy data for education, but this classifier can recognize normal\ndisorders, epilepsy, and even other disorders taught in educational examples.\nAlso, the value of using electroencephalogram signal has been evaluated in two\nways: using wavelet transform and non-using wavelet transform. Finally, the\nevaluation results indicate a relatively uniform impact factor on the use or\nnon-use of wavelet transform on the improvement of epilepsy data functions, but\nin the end, it was shown that the use of perceptron multilayer neural network\ncan provide a higher accuracy coefficient for experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 14:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

ShorTor functions as an overlay on top of onion routing-Tor's\nexisting routing protocol and is run by Tor relays, making it independent of\nthe path selection performed by Tor clients. As such, ShorTor reduces latency\nwhile preserving Tor's existing security properties. Specifically, the routes\ntaken in ShorTor are in no way correlated to either the Tor user or their\ndestination, including the geographic location of either party. We analyze the\nsecurity of ShorTor using the AnoA framework, showing that ShorTor maintains\nall of Tor's anonymity guarantees. We augment our theoretical claims with an\nempirical analysis. To evaluate ShorTor's performance, we collect a real-world\ndataset of over 400,000 latency measurements between the 1,000 most popular Tor\nrelays, which collectively see the vast majority of Tor traffic. With this\ndata, we identify pairs of relays that could benefit from ShorTor: that is, two\nrelays where introducing an additional intermediate network hop results in\nlower latency than the direct route between them. We use our measurement\ndataset to simulate the impact on end users by applying ShorTor to two million\nTor circuits chosen according to Tor's specification. ShorTor reduces the\nlatency for the 99th percentile of relay pairs in Tor by 148 ms. Similarly,\nShorTor reduces the latency of Tor circuits by 122 ms at the 99th percentile.\nIn practice, this translates to ShorTor truncating tail latencies for Tor which\nhas a direct impact on page load times and, consequently, user experience on\nthe Tor browser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 14:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Instead they are corespondent functions of the production output,\nprices of goods and prices of factors. At the NPCE the total production cost\nreaches its minimum, while the total consumption, without factors expences,\nreaches its maximum. At the same time the production cost is consistent with\nthe production output, the consumption is consistent with the prices for goods\nand the factors availability is consistent with prices for factors. Finding\nNPCE is equivalent to solving a variational inequality (VI) with a particular\nnonlinear operator and a simple feasible set. Under natural assumptions on the\nproduction, consumption and factor operators the NPCE exists and it is unique.\nProjection on the feasible set {\\Omega} is a low cost operation, therefore for\nsolving the VI we use two projection methods. Each of them requires at each\nstep few matrix by vector multiplications and allows, along with convergence\nand convergence rate, establish complexity bound. The methods decompose the\nproblem, so both the primal and the dual variables are computed simultaneously.\nOn the other hand, both methods are pricing mechanisms for establishing NPCE,\nwhich is a generalization of Walras - Wald equilibrium (see [12]) in few\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In this work, we apply a purely\ndata-driven method to (1) learn local interactions of homogeneous swarms\nthrough observation data and to (2) generate similar swarming behaviour using\nthe learned model. In particular, a modified version of dynamic mode\ndecomposition with control, called swarmDMD, is developed and tested on the\ncanonical Vicsek swarm model. The goal is to use swarmDMD to learn inter-agent\ninteractions that give rise to the observed swarm behaviour. We show that\nswarmDMD can faithfully reconstruct the swarm dynamics, and the model learned\nby swarmDMD provides a short prediction window for data extrapolation with a\ntrade-off between prediction accuracy and prediction horizon. We also provide a\ncomprehensive analysis on the efficacy of different observation data types on\nthe modelling, where we find that inter-agent distance yields the most accurate\nmodels.

Herein, we develop\na gas sensor based on doubly resonant PAS in which the acoustic and optical\nwaves are simultaneously enhanced using combined optical and acoustic\nresonators in a centimeter-long configuration. Not only the lower detection\nlimit is enhanced by the double standing waves, but also the upper detection\nlimit is expanded due to the short resonators. As an example, we developed a\nsensor by detecting acetylene (C2H2), achieving a noise equivalent absorption\nof 5.7*10-13 cm-1 and a dynamic range of eight orders. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art PAS gas sensors, the developed sensor increases the\nsensitivity by two orders of magnitude and extends the dynamic range by three\norders of magnitude.

Nowadays, the unidirectional consolidation theory of\nsoils is widely used in certain conditions and approximate calculations. The\nmulti-directional theory of soil consolidation is more reasonable than the\nunidirectional theory in practical applications, but it is much more\ncomplicated in terms of index determination and solution. To address the above\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method using\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the excess pore water\npressure of two-dimensional soil consolidation.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison with\nthe numerical solution of PDE for two-dimensional consolidation. Using this\nmethod, the excess pore water pressure could be predicted simply and\nefficiently. In addition, the method was applied to predict the soil excess\npore water pressure in the foundation in a real case at Tianjin port, China.\nThe proposed deep learning approach can be used to investigate the large and\ncomplex multi-directional soil consolidation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 13:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}
