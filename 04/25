To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed new\nfamilies of learned sparse models that try to match the effectiveness of\nlearned dense models, while leveraging the traditional inverted index data\nstructure for efficiency. Current learned sparse models learn the weights of\nterms in documents and, sometimes, queries; however, they exploit different\nvocabulary structures, document expansion techniques, and query expansion\nstrategies, which can make them slower than traditional sparse models such as\nBM25. In this work, we propose a novel indexing and query processing technique\nthat exploits a traditional sparse model's \"guidance\" to efficiently traverse\nthe index, allowing the more effective learned model to execute fewer scoring\noperations.

The measured electroluminescence spectrum is dominated by a\nstrong near-band edge emission, while deep level and acceptor-related\nluminescence is greatly suppressed. A relatively high reverse breakdown field\nof 2.4 MV/cm without field-plates is achieved.

The animated\nvideo can be produced by warping only the surface fluid layer according to the\nestimation of fluid motions and recombining it with the background. In\naddition, we introduce surface-only fluid simulation, a $2.5D$ fluid\ncalculation version, as a replacement for motion estimation. Specifically, we\nleverage the triangular mesh based on a monocular depth estimator to represent\nthe fluid surface layer and simulate the motion in the physics-based framework\nwith the inspiration of the classic theory of the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian\nmethod, along with a learnable network so as to adapt to complex real-world\nimage textures.

Some ML\nmodels like the decision tree possess inherent interpretability that can be\ndirectly comprehended by humans. Others like artificial neural networks (ANN),\nhowever, rely on external methods to uncover the deduction mechanism. SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) is one of such external methods, which requires a\nbackground dataset when interpreting ANNs. Generally, a background dataset\nconsists of instances randomly sampled from the training dataset. However, the\nsampling size and its effect on SHAP remain to be unexplored. In our empirical\nstudy on the MIMIC-III dataset, we show that the two core explanations - SHAP\nvalues and variable rankings fluctuate when using different background datasets\nacquired from random sampling, indicating that users cannot unquestioningly\ntrust the one-shot interpretation from SHAP. Luckily, such fluctuation\ndecreases with the increase of the background dataset size. Also, we notice an\nU-shape in the stability assessment of SHAP variable rankings, demonstrating\nthat SHAP is more reliable in ranking the most and least important variables\ncompared to moderately important ones. Overall, our results suggest that users\nshould take into account how background data affects SHAP results, with\nimproved SHAP stability as the background sample size increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 20:15:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 08:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 05:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

In order to guarantee security, some keys may be\nshared among the users. After the key sharing phase, each user masks its\ntrained model which is then sent to the server. This paper follows the\ninformation theoretic secure aggregation problem originally formulated by Zhao\nand Sun, with the objective to characterize the minimum communication cost from\nthe K users in the model aggregation phase. Due to user dropouts, the server\nmay not receive all messages from the users. A secure aggregation scheme should\ntolerate the dropouts of at most $K-U$ users. The optimal communication cost is\ncharacterized by Zhao and Sun, but with the assumption that the keys stored by\nthe users could be any random variables with arbitrary dependency. On the\nmotivation that uncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and\ncould be used in large range of applications besides federated learning, in\nthis paper we assume the key variables are mutually independent and each key is\nshared by a group of S users. To the best of our knowledge, all existing secure\naggregation schemes assign coded keys to the users.

This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task\nnetwork to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this\napproach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms\nof symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the application\nof equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations.\nMoreover, doing so can yield improvements in accuracy and generalization\nrelative to both fully-equivariant and non-equivariant baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2022 22:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 21:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

However, a 2L1S\nmodel with a planet companion can describe part of the anomaly, suggesting that\nthe anomaly may be deformed by a tertiary lens component or a close companion\nto the source. From the additional modeling, we find that all the features of\nthe anomaly can be explained with either a triple-lens (3L1S) model or a\nbinary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model obtained under the 3L1S interpretation.\nHowever, it is difficult to validate the 2L2S model because the light curve\ndoes not exhibit signatures induced by the source orbital motion and the\nellipsoidal variations expected by the close separation between the source\nstars according to the model. We, therefore, conclude that the two\ninterpretations cannot be distinguished with the available data, and either can\nbe correct.

Recent powerful transformer-based deep learning\nmodels on vision tasks usually have heavy parameters and bear training\ndifficulty. However, many dense-prediction low-level computer vision tasks,\nsuch as rain streak removing, often need to be executed on devices with limited\ncomputing power and memory in practice. Hence, we introduce a recursive local\nwindow-based self-attention structure with residual connections and propose\nderaining a recursive transformer (DRT), which enjoys the superiority of the\ntransformer but requires a small amount of computing resources.

Moreover, these records must represent the\nlocal seismicity, expressed by ground motion power indicators denominated\nintensity measures (IM). The ability and accuracy to describe the\ncharacteristics of a seismic record play a fundamental role in earthquake\nengineering and damage assessment of geotechnical facilities. None of the\nexisting IMs represents a robust enough predictor of a given seismic demand\n(e.g., residual displacements). Different signals may generate a wide spectrum\nof results, with diverse effects that could produce insignificant damage to\nglobal failure depending on the structure. Usual engineering procedures select\na huge number of records to overcome this limitation and develop a large set of\nnumerical simulations to bound the uncertainty of the results, which becomes a\ntime-consuming approach. This paper presents a new high-fidelity seismic IM to\nperform more accurate ground motion {selection}, which captures the spectral\nproperties of the record for the frequency content that the dam does not\nfilter. This IM represents a way to estimate beforehand a seismic demand,\nexpressed, for instance, in terms of displacements. The proposed IM is applied\nto a finite element model for an upstream tailings dam cross-section, using a\nconstitutive model capable of capturing dynamic liquefaction. The obtained\nresults show that our proposal gives highly reliable correlations with\ndifferent selected demands.

In this work, we\nperformed a full simulation of QEC for the rotated surface codes with a code\ndistance 5, which employs 49 qubits and is within reach of the current\nstate-of-the-art quantum computers. In particular, we evaluate the logical\nerror probability in a realistic noise model that incorporates not only\nstochastic Pauli errors but also coherent errors due to a systematic control\nerror or unintended interactions. While a straightforward simulation of 49\nqubits is not tractable within a reasonable computational time, we reduced the\nnumber of qubits required to 26 qubits by delaying the syndrome measurement in\nsimulation. This and a fast quantum computer simulator, Qulacs, implemented on\nGPU allows us to simulate full QEC with an arbitrary local noise within\nreasonable simulation time. Based on the numerical results, we also construct\nand verify an effective model to incorporate the effect of the coherent error\ninto a stochastic noise model.

Unlike human drivers, current self-driving vehicles cannot\nunderstand the traffic laws, thus rely on the programmers manually writing the\ncorresponding principles into the driving systems. It would be less efficient\nand hard to adapt some temporary traffic laws, especially when the vehicles use\ndata-driven decision-making algorithms. Besides, current self-driving vehicle\nsystems rarely take traffic law modification into consideration. This work aims\nto design a road traffic law adaptive decision-making method. The\ndecision-making algorithm is designed based on reinforcement learning, in which\nthe traffic rules are usually implicitly coded in deep neural networks.

To avoid the loss of packets and keep the\nlow latency, sliding network coding (SNC) is an emerging technology by\ngenerating redundant packets that are the linear combination of the original\ndata packets from the current block and some previous blocks. However, how to\ntake the advantage of re-transmission for SNC is still an open problem since\nhigher reliability could be achieved at the expense of large latency caused by\nround-trip time (RTT). To deal with this issue, in this paper, we consider the\nidea of adjusting the transmission phase and the number of the redundant\npackets for SNC with re-transmission. Specifically, If RTT is large, most of\nthe redundant packets are sent at the first transmission, otherwise,\nre-transmission will be used. We first derive a concise and tight lower bound\nof the block error probability of SNC without re-transmission. Then, based on\nthe bound, the theoretical expressions of the proposed re-transmission schemes\nare derived regarding the block error probability, the average code length, and\nthe average packet latency.

Furthermore, we reveal the general trend of mobility increase from BP\nto BAs and to BSb and conclude that: smaller effective masses, larger sound\nvelocities, higher optical phonon energies, heavy atomic masses, and\nout-of-plane orbitals tend to result in small match between the electron and\nphonon bands, small electron-phonon coupling strengths, and thus high mobility.\nOur work demonstrates that 2D semiconductors can achieve comparable carrier\nmobility to 3D GaAs, thus opening doors to 2D high-performance electronic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 03:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

For most neural network models,\nthe architecture and hyperparameters are typically fine-tuned and optimized in\nexperiments. Input features, however, are often treated as fixed. In the case\nof audio, signals can be mainly expressed in two main ways: raw waveforms\n(time-domain) or spectrograms (time-frequency-domain). In addition, different\nspectrogram types are often used and tailored to fit different applications. In\nour experiments, we allow for this tailoring directly as part of the network.\n  Our experimental results show that using trainable basis functions can boost\nthe accuracy of Keyword Spotting (KWS) by 14.2 percentage points, and lower the\nPhone Error Rate (PER) by 9.5 percentage points. Although models using\ntrainable basis functions become less effective as the model complexity\nincreases, the trained filter shapes could still provide us with insights on\nwhich frequency bins are important for that specific task. From our\nexperiments, we can conclude that trainable basis functions are a useful tool\nto boost the performance when the model complexity is limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 05:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

By representing RTL as a graph and deploying modern graph\nrewriting techniques we can automate the circuit design space exploration,\nallowing us to discover functionally equivalent but optimized architectures.

In this paper, we propose a study aiming to determine which is the best\napproach to train denoising networks for real raw videos: supervision on\nsynthetic realistic data or self-supervision on real data. A complete study\nwith quantitative results in case of natural videos with real motion is\nimpossible since no dataset with clean-noisy pairs exists. We address this\nissue by considering three independent experiments in which we compare the two\nframeworks. We found that self-supervision on the real data outperforms\nsupervision on synthetic data, and that in normal illumination conditions the\ndrop in performance is due to the synthetic ground truth generation, not the\nnoise model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 08:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

In particular, an elegant formulation\nfor the corresponding structural theorems involves the strong product of a path\nand of a bounded treewidth graph, and allows to lift combinatorial results for\nbounded treewidth graphs to graph classes for which the product structure\nholds, such as to planar graphs [Dujmovi\\'c et al., J. ACM, 67(4), 22:1-38,\n2020].\n  In this paper, we join the search for extensions of this powerful tool beyond\nplanarity by considering the h-framed graphs, a graph class that includes\n1-planar, optimal 2-planar, and k-map graphs (for appropriate values of h). We\nestablish a graph product structure theorem for h-framed graphs stating that\nthe graphs in this class are subgraphs of the strong product of a path, of a\nplanar graph of treewidth at most 3, and of a clique of size $3\\lfloor h/2\n\\rfloor +\\lfloor h/3 \\rfloor -1$. This allows us to improve over the previous\nstructural theorems for 1-planar and k-map graphs. Our results constitute\nsignificant progress over the previous bounds on the queue number,\nnon-repetitive chromatic number, and p-centered chromatic number of these graph\nclasses, e.g., we lower the currently best upper bound on the queue number of\n1-planar graphs and k-map graphs from 495 to 81 and from 32225k(k-3) to 61k,\nrespectively. We also employ the product structure machinery to improve the\ncurrent upper bounds of twin-width of planar and 1-planar graphs from 183 to\n37, and from O(1) to 80, respectively. All our structural results are\nconstructive and yield efficient algorithms to obtain the corresponding\ndecompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 08:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

In this paper, we compare the performance of these two different\nmachine learning approaches systematically.

Traditional watermarking schemes often design in a\n\"wider\" rule, which applies one general embedding mechanism to all images. But\nthis will limit the scheme into a robustness-invisibility trade-off, where the\nimprovements of robustness can only be achieved by the increase of embedding\nintensity thus causing the visual quality decay. However, a new scenario comes\nout at this stage that many businesses wish to give high level protection to\nspecific valuable images, which requires high robustness and high visual\nquality at the same time. Such scenario makes the watermarking schemes should\nbe designed in a \"deeper\" way which makes the embedding mechanism customized to\nspecific images. To achieve so, we break the robustness-invisibility trade-off\nby introducing computation cost in, and propose a novel auto-decoder-like\nimage-specified watermarking framework (ISMark). Based on ISMark, the strong\nrobustness and high visual quality for specific images can be both achieved. In\ndetail, we apply an optimization procedure (OPT) to replace the traditional\nembedding mechanism. Unlike existing schemes that embed watermarks using a\nlearned encoder, OPT regards the cover image as the optimizable parameters to\nminimize the extraction error of the decoder, thus the features of each\nspecified image can be effectively exploited to achieve superior performance.\nExtensive experiments indicate that ISMark outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods by a large margin, which improves the average bit error rate by 4.64%\n(from 4.86% to 0.22%) and PSNR by 2.20dB (from 32.50dB to 34.70dB).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 08:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

To address\nthis issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA)\nmethod for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists\nof two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source\nvicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for\nimproving corruption robustness. The integration employs a generative model to\ncharacterize the underlying manifold built by vicinal samples, facilitating the\ngeneration of on-manifold samples. Our proposed VITA significantly outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art augmentation methods, demonstrated in extensive\nexperiments on corruption benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 09:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

This behavior can be\nimitated by computer vision methods by predicting the appearance of vehicles\nbased on emitted light reflections caused by the vehicle's headlights. Since\ncurrent object detection algorithms are mainly based on detecting directly\nvisible objects annotated via bounding boxes, the detection and annotation of\nlight reflections without sharp boundaries is challenging. For this reason, the\nextensive open-source dataset PVDN (Provident Vehicle Detection at Night) was\npublished, which includes traffic scenarios at night with light reflections\nannotated via keypoints.

In this thesis we\nreview what has been done in this topic and go deeper, studying symmetries and\ndissipated quantities of contact systems, and developing the Skinner-Rusk\nformalism for these systems.\n  With regard to classical field theory, we introduce the notion of\nk-precosymplectic manifold and use it to give a geometric description of\nsingular nonautonomous field theories. We also devise a constraint algorithm\nfor these systems.\n  Field theories with damping are described through a modification of the De\nDonder-Weyl Hamiltonian field theory. This is achieved by combining contact\ngeometry and k-symplectic structures, resulting in the k-contact formalism. We\nintroduce two notions of dissipation laws, generalizing the concept of\ndissipated quantity. These developments are also applied to Lagrangian field\ntheory. The Skinner-Rusk formulation for k-contact systems is described in\ndetail and we show how to recover the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms\nfrom it.\n  Throughout the thesis we present several examples in mechanics and field\ntheory.

It aims to alleviate the\nmismatch of linguistic expressions between a query and its potential relevant\ndocuments. Existing PRF methods independently treat revised queries originating\nfrom the same query but using different numbers of feedback documents,\nresulting in severe query drift. Without comparing the effects of two different\nrevisions from the same query, a PRF model may incorrectly focus on the\nadditional irrelevant information increased in the more feedback, and thus\nreformulate a query that is less effective than the revision using the less\nfeedback. Ideally, if a PRF model can distinguish between irrelevant and\nrelevant information in the feedback, the more feedback documents there are,\nthe better the revised query will be. To bridge this gap, we propose the\nLoss-over-Loss (LoL) framework to compare the reformulation losses between\ndifferent revisions of the same query during training. Concretely, we revise an\noriginal query multiple times in parallel using different amounts of feedback\nand compute their reformulation losses. Then, we introduce an additional\nregularization loss on these reformulation losses to penalize revisions that\nuse more feedback but gain larger losses. With such comparative regularization,\nthe PRF model is expected to learn to suppress the extra increased irrelevant\ninformation by comparing the effects of different revised queries. Further, we\npresent a differentiable query reformulation method to implement this\nframework.

This thermal structure is predominantly set by dust\nradiative transfer and viscous (accretional) heating and can be impacted by\ngaps - regions of low dust and gas density that can occur when planets form.\nThe effect of variations in dust surface density on disc temperature has been\npoorly understood until now. In this work, we use the radiative transfer code\nMCMax to model the 2D dust thermal structure with individual gaps corresponding\nto planets with masses of 0.1 M$_J$ - 5 M$_J$ and orbital radii of 3, 5, and 10\nAU. Low dust opacity in the gap allows radiation to penetrate deeper into the\ndisc and warm the midplane by up to 16 K, but only for gaps located in the\nregion of the disc where stellar irradiation is the dominant source of heat\n(here, a$\\gtrsim$4 AU). In viscously-heated regions (a$\\lesssim$4 AU), the\nmidplane of the gap is relatively cooler by up to 100 K. Outside of the gap,\nbroad radial oscillations in heating and cooling are present due to changes in\ndisc flaring. These thermal features affect local segregation of volatile\nelements (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO2, CO) between the dust and gas. We find that\nicelines experience dramatic shifts relative to gapless models: up to 6.5 AU\ntowards the star and 4.3 AU towards the midplane.

With such a large expected load on the power system\nfrom electric vehicles (EVs), it is important to coordinate charging in order\nto balance the supply and demand for electricity. Bidirectional charging,\nenabled through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, will unlock significant\nstorage capacity from stationary EVs that are plugged in. To take this concept\na step further, this paper quantifies the potential revenues to be gained by a\ncommercial EV fleet operator from simultaneously scheduling its trips on a\nday-ahead basis, as well as its charging. This allows the fleet to complete its\ntrips (with user defined trip length and distance), while taking advantage of\nfluctuating energy and ancillary services prices. A mathematical framework for\noptimal trip scheduling is proposed, formulated as a mixed-integer linear\nprogram, and is applied to several relevant scenarios of the present and future\nBritish electricity system.

Deep learning (DL)-based methods\nhave been proposed for CSI compression and feedback to the transmitter.\nAlthough most existing DL-based methods consider the CSI matrix as an image,\nstructural features of the CSI image are rarely exploited in neural network\ndesign. As such, we propose a model of self-information that dynamically\nmeasures the amount of information contained in each patch of a CSI image from\nthe perspective of structural features. Then, by applying the self-information\nmodel, we propose a model-and-data-driven network for CSI compression and\nfeedback, namely IdasNet. The IdasNet includes the design of a module of\nself-information deletion and selection (IDAS), an encoder of informative\nfeature compression (IFC), and a decoder of informative feature recovery (IFR).\nIn particular, the model-driven module of IDAS pre-compresses the CSI image by\nremoving informative redundancy in terms of the self-information. The encoder\nof IFC then conducts feature compression to the pre-compressed CSI image and\ngenerates a feature codeword which contains two components, i.e., codeword\nvalues and position indices of the codeword values. Subsequently, the IFR\ndecoder decouples the codeword values as well as position indices to recover\nthe CSI image. Experimental results verify that the proposed IdasNet noticeably\noutperforms existing DL-based networks under various compression ratios while\nit has the number of network parameters reduced by orders-of-magnitude compared\nwith various existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 11:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

In this work, we use the NIHAO suite of galaxy simulations to\ninvestigate the relation between the transition time through the green valley\nand other galaxy properties. The typical green valley crossing time of our\ngalaxies is approximately 400 Myr, somewhat shorter than observational\nestimates. The crossing of the green valley is triggered by the onset of AGN\nfeedback and the subsequent shut down of star formation. Interestingly the time\nspent in the green valley is not related to any other galaxy properties, such\nas stellar age or metallicity, or the time at which the star formation\nquenching takes place. The crossing time is set by two main contributions: the\nageing of the current stellar population and the residual star formation in the\ngreen valley. These effects are of comparable magnitude, while major and minor\nmergers have a negligible contribution. Most interestingly, we find the time\nthat a galaxy spends to travel through the green valley is twice the\n$e$-folding time of the star formation quenching. This result is stable against\ngalaxy properties and the exact numerical implementation of AGN feedback in the\nsimulation.

Due to its low cost and high\nefficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising\napplication prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through\nperspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of\ndepth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in\naggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments,\nwe quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the\n\"truncated instances\" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main\nbottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple\nfeatures from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still\nsuffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully\nboost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose\nGraph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through\ngraph structure learning (GSL). It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each\nobject query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations,\nespecially at the border regions.

The increased\ndemand for computational power and memory ushers in the exascale era, in which\nsupercomputers are designed to provide enormous computing power to meet these\nneeds. These complex supercomputers consist of numerous compute nodes and are\nconsequently expected to experience frequent faults and crashes.\n  Mathematical solvers, in particular, iterative linear solvers are key\nbuilding block in numerous large-scale scientific applications. Consequently,\nsupporting the recovery of distributed solvers is necessary for scaling\nscientific applications to exascale platforms. Previous recovery methods for\niterative solvers are based on Checkpoint-Restart (CR), which incurs high fault\ntolerance overhead, or intrinsic fault tolerance, which require extra\ncomputation time to converge after failures.\n  Exact state reconstruction (ESR) was proposed as an alternative mechanism to\nalleviate the impact of frequent failures on long-term computations. ESR has\nbeen shown to provide exact reconstruction of the computation state while\navoiding the need for costly checkpointing. However, ESR currently relies on\nvolatile memory for fault tolerance, and must therefore maintain redundancies\nin the RAM of multiple nodes, incurring high memory and network overheads.\n  Recent supercomputer designs feature emerging non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)\ntechnology. This paper investigates how NVRAM can be utilized to devise an\nenhanced ESR-based recovery mechanism that is more efficient and provides full\nresilience. Our mechanism, called in-NVRAM ESR, is based on a novel MPI\nOne-Sided Communication (OSC) over RDMA implementation, and provides full\nresiliency while significantly reducing both the memory footprint and the time\noverhead in comparison with the original ESR design (in-RAM ESR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 12:14:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 20:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

Their quantification of the surface\nroughness, on the other hand, varies considerably. The ocean surface roughness\nis generally represented by the mean square slope, its direct measurement in\nopen ocean remains a challenging task. Microwave ocean remote sensing from\nspace delivers ocean surface roughness information. Satellite platforms offer\nglobal coverage in a broad range of environmental conditions. This paper\npresents lowpass mean square slope (LPMSS) data obtained by spaceborne\nmicrowave altimeters and reflectometers operating at L, Ku, and Ka bands (about\n1.6, 14, and 36 GHz). The LPMSS data represent the spectrally integrated ocean\nsurface roughness with 11, 95, and 250 rad/m upper cutoff wave numbers, the\nmaximum wind speeds are 80, 29, and 25 m/s, respectively. A better\nunderstanding of the ocean surface roughness is important to the goal of\nimproving wind wave spectrum modeling. The analysis presented in this paper\nshows that over two orders of magnitude of the wave number range (0.3 to 30\nrad/m), the spectral components follow a power function relating the\ndimensionless spectrum and the ratio between wind friction velocity and wave\nphase speed. The power function exponent is 0.38, which is considerable smaller\nthan unity as expected from the classical equilibrium spectrum function. It may\nsuggest that wave breaking is not only an energy sink but also a source of\nroughness generation covering a wideband of wavelengths about 20 m and shorter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 12:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

A relativistically expanding plasma shell can\ncompress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce\ncoherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium\nby $\\gamma^2$. This mechanism has been studied in the past by Colgate and\nNoerdelinger (1971), in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this\nwork we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast\nradio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and\nmagnetic field requirements, allowing the spin down energy of regular (or even\nrecycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to\nexplain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time\nevolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics and absence\nof panchromatic counterparts.

In this work, we deal with the problem of finding\nthe optimal offering curve for a risk-averse profit-maximizing generating\ncompany (GENCO) in a data-driven context. In particular, a large GENCO's market\nshare may imply that her offering strategy can alter the marginal price\nformation, which can be used to increase profit. We tackle this problem from a\nnovel perspective. First, we propose a optimization-based methodology to\nsummarize each GENCO's step-wise supply curves into a subset of representative\nprice-energy blocks. Then, the relationship between the market price and the\nresulting energy block offering prices is modeled through a Bayesian linear\nregression approach, which also allows us to generate stochastic scenarios for\nthe sensibility of the market towards the GENCO strategy, represented by the\nregression coefficient probabilistic distributions. Finally, this predictive\nmodel is embedded in the stochastic optimization model by employing a\nconstraint learning approach. Results show how allowing the GENCO to deviate\nfrom her true marginal costs renders significant changes in her profits and the\nmarket marginal price. Furthermore, these results have also been tested in an\nout-of-sample validation setting, showing how this optimal offering strategy is\nalso effective in a real-world market contest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 14:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 18:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven\nmethodology for the prediction and control of extreme events in a chaotic shear\nflow. The approach is based on echo state networks, which are a type of\nreservoir computing that learn temporal correlations within a time-dependent\ndataset. The objective is five-fold. First, we exploit ad-hoc metrics from\nbinary classification to analyse (i) how many of the extreme events predicted\nby the network actually occur in the test set (precision), and (ii) how many\nextreme events are missed by the network (recall). We apply a principled\nstrategy for optimal hyperparameter selection, which is key to the networks'\nperformance. Second, we focus on the time-accurate prediction of extreme\nevents. We show that echo state networks are able to predict extreme events\nwell beyond the predictability time, i.e., up to more than five Lyapunov times.\nThird, we focus on the long-term prediction of extreme events from a\nstatistical point of view. By training the networks with datasets that contain\nnon-converged statistics, we show that the networks are able to learn and\nextrapolate the flow's long-term statistics. In other words, the networks are\nable to extrapolate in time from relatively short time series. Fourth, we\ndesign a simple and effective control strategy to prevent extreme events from\noccurring. The control strategy decreases the occurrence of extreme events up\nto one order of magnitude with respect to the uncontrolled system. Finally, we\nanalyse the robustness of the results for a range of Reynolds numbers.

The\nthermal flux is usually modeled using Spitzer's theory, which is based on local\nCoulomb collisions between the electrons carrying the thermal flux and those in\nthe background. However, often during flares, temperature gradients become\nsufficiently steep that the collisional mean free path exceeds the temperature\ngradient scale size, so that thermal conduction becomes inherently non-local.\nFurther, turbulent angular scattering, which is detectable in nonthermal widths\nof atomic emission lines, can also act to increase the collision frequency and\nso suppress the heat flux. Recent work by Emslie & Bian (2018) extended\nSpitzer's theory of thermal conduction to account for both non-locality and\nturbulent suppression. We have implemented their theoretical expression for the\nheat flux (which is a convolution of the Spitzer flux with a kernel function)\ninto the RADYN flare-modeling code and performed a parameter study to\nunderstand how the resulting changes in thermal conduction affect flare\ndynamics and hence the radiation produced. We find that models with reduced\nheat fluxes predict slower bulk flows, less intense line emission, and longer\ncooling times. By comparing features of atomic emission lines predicted by the\nmodels with Doppler velocities and nonthermal line widths deduced from a\nparticular flare observation, we find that models with suppression factors\nbetween 0.3 to 0.5 relative to the Spitzer value best reproduce observed\nDoppler velocities across emission lines forming over a wide range of\ntemperatures.

However, there\nare other potential sources of such variations, including rotational modulation\ncaused by stellar activity. We aim to investigate four M dwarfs (Ross 318, YZ\nCMi, TYC 3529-1437-1, and EV Lac) with different activity levels and spectral\nsub-types. Our goal is to compare the periodicities seen in 22 activity\nindicators and the stellar RVs, and to examine their stability over time. For\neach star, we calculated GLS periodograms of pseudo-equivalent widths of\nchromospheric lines, indices of photospheric bands, the differential line width\nas a measure of the width of the average photospheric absorption line, the RV,\nthe chromatic index that describes the wavelength dependence of the RV, and CCF\nparameters. We also calculated periodograms for subsets of the data and\ncompared our results to TESS photometry. We find the rotation periods of all\nfour stars to manifest themselves in the RV and photospheric indicators,\nparticularly the TiO~7050 index, whereas the chromospheric lines show clear\nsignals only at lower activity levels. For EV Lac and TYC 3529-1437-1, we find\nepisodes during which indicators vary with the rotation period, and episodes\nduring which they vary with half the rotation period, similarly to photometric\nlight curves. The changing periodicities reflect the evolution of stellar\nactivity features on the stellar surface. We therefore conclude that our\nresults not only emphasise the importance of carefully analysing indicators\ncomplementary to the RV in RV surveys, but they also suggest that it is also\nuseful to search for signals in activity indicators in subsets of the dataset,\nbecause an activity signal that is present in the RV may not be visible in the\nactivity indicators all the time, in particular for the most active stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 14:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Then, given a new contact shape\nobtained from the sensor, we match it against the pre-computed set using an\nobject-specific embedding learned using contrastive learning. We obtain contact\nshapes from the sensor with an object-agnostic calibration step that maps RGB\ntactile observations to binary contact shapes. This mapping, which can be\nreused across object and sensor instances, is the only step trained with real\nsensor data. This results in a perception model that localizes objects from the\nfirst real tactile observation. Importantly, it produces pose distributions and\ncan incorporate additional pose constraints coming from other perception\nsystems, contacts, or priors.\n  We provide quantitative results for 20 objects. Tac2Pose provides high\naccuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while\nregressing meaningful pose distributions to account for those contact shapes\nthat could result from different object poses. We also test Tac2Pose on object\nmodels reconstructed from a 3D scanner, to evaluate the robustness to\nuncertainty in the object model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of\nTac2Pose compared with three baseline methods for tactile pose estimation:\ndirectly regressing the object pose with a neural network, matching an observed\ncontact to a set of possible contacts using a standard classification neural\nnetwork, and direct pixel comparison of an observed contact with a set of\npossible contacts.\n  Website: http://mcube.mit.edu/research/tac2pose.html\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 14:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 10:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

It is necessary to\nefficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for\nquantifying model's uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion\nand nonlinearity may cause the computation intractable. To overcome the\nmultiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale\nfinite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and\nobtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still\ndefined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is\napplied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts on the simulation\nefficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical\ninterpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity.\nThe stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots.\nThe offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of\nthe stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The\nonline snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are\nused to correct the offline reduced model in an increment manner. The\nstochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear\ndynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model.

Although it aims at predicting both\nspot and forward prices, the vast majority of research is focused on short-term\nhorizons which exhibit dynamics unlike in any other market. The reason is that\npower system stability calls for a constant balance between production and\nconsumption, while being weather (both demand and supply) and business activity\n(demand only) dependent. The recent market innovations do not help in this\nrespect. The rapid expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources is not\noffset by the costly increase of electricity storage capacities and\nmodernization of the grid infrastructure. On the methodological side, this\nleads to three visible trends in electricity price forecasting research as of\n2022. Firstly, there is a slow, but more noticeable with every year, tendency\nto consider not only point but also probabilistic (interval, density) or even\npath (also called ensemble) forecasts. Secondly, there is a clear shift from\nthe relatively parsimonious econometric (or statistical) models towards more\ncomplex and harder to comprehend, but more versatile and eventually more\naccurate statistical/machine learning approaches. Thirdly, statistical error\nmeasures are nowadays regarded as only the first evaluation step. Since they\nmay not necessarily reflect the economic value of reducing prediction errors,\nmore and more often, they are complemented by case studies comparing profits\nfrom scheduling or trading strategies based on price forecasts obtained from\ndifferent models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 15:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Most existing studies focus on utilizing inherent\nrelations between homogeneous codes of medical ontology graph to enhance their\nrepresentations using supervised methods, and few studies pay attention to the\nvaluable relations between heterogeneous or homogeneous medical codes from\nhistory EMRs, which further limits the prediction performance and application\nscenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, this paper proposes\nKnowAugNet, a multi-sourced medical knowledge augmented medication prediction\nnetwork which can fully capture the diverse relations between medical codes via\nmulti-level graph contrastive learning framework. Specifically, KnowAugNet\nfirst leverages the graph contrastive learning using graph attention network as\nthe encoder to capture the implicit relations between homogeneous medical codes\nfrom the medical ontology graph and obtains the knowledge augmented medical\ncodes embedding vectors. Then, it utilizes the graph contrastive learning using\na weighted graph convolutional network as the encoder to capture the\ncorrelative relations between homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from\nthe constructed medical prior relation graph and obtains the relation augmented\nmedical codes embedding vectors.

Therefore, we improve it by interpreting the protein sequences as time\nseries and extracting their features using Gate Recurrent Unit(GRU) and\nBidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit(BiGRU). For the drug, our processing method\nis similar to that of GraphDTA, but uses two different graph convolution\nmethods. Subsequently, the representation of drugs and proteins are\nconcatenated for final prediction. We evaluate the proposed model on two\nbenchmark datasets.

Hence, to maintain an overview, automated methods for the mapping and\nvisualization of knowledge domains are necessary and important, e.g., for\nscientific decision makers. Of particular interest in this field is the\ndevelopment of research topics of different entities (e.g., scientific authors\nand venues) over time. However, existing approaches for their analysis are only\nsuitable for single entity types, such as venues, and they often do not capture\nthe research topics or the time dimension in an easily interpretable manner.\n  Hence, we propose a principled approach for \\emph{mapping research\ntrajectories}, which is applicable to all kinds of scientific entities that can\nbe represented by sets of published papers. For this, we transfer ideas and\nprinciples from the geographic visualization domain, specifically trajectory\nmaps and interactive geographic maps.

We observe that our trajectory\nvisualizations of 30 top machine learning venues and 1000 major authors in this\nfield are well interpretable and are consistent with background knowledge drawn\nfrom the entities' publications.

Recently, a number of deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) methods have been proposed to generate approximate optimal\nsolutions to the combinatorial optimization problems. However, the existing\nstudies on DRL have seldom focused on MOCOPs. This study proposes a\nsingle-model deep reinforcement learning framework, called multi-objective\nPointer Network (MOPN), where the input structure of PN is effectively improved\nso that the single PN is capable of solving MOCOPs. In addition, two training\nstrategies, based on representative model and transfer learning, respectively,\nare proposed to further enhance the performance of MOPN in different\napplication scenarios. Moreover, compared to classical meta-heuristics, MOPN\nonly consumes much less time on forward propagation to obtain the Pareto front.\nMeanwhile, MOPN is insensitive to problem scale, meaning that a trained MOPN is\nable to address MOCOPs with different scales. To verify the performance of\nMOPN, extensive experiments are conducted on three multi-objective traveling\nsalesman problems, in comparison with one state-of-the-art model DRL-MOA and\nthree classical multi-objective meta-heuristics.

There exists a large body of research in\nsuccess prediction for MOOCs, focusing mainly on training models from scratch\nfor individual courses. This setting is impractical in early success prediction\nas the performance of a student is only known at the end of the course. In this\npaper, we aim to create early success prediction models that can be transferred\nbetween MOOCs from different domains and topics. To do so, we present three\nnovel strategies for transfer: 1) pre-training a model on a large set of\ndiverse courses, 2) leveraging the pre-trained model by including meta\ninformation about courses, and 3) fine-tuning the model on previous course\niterations. Our experiments on 26 MOOCs with over 145,000 combined enrollments\nand millions of interactions show that models combining interaction data and\ncourse information have comparable or better performance than models which have\naccess to previous iterations of the course. With these models, we aim to\neffectively enable educators to warm-start their predictions for new and\nongoing courses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 09:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Resilience against adversarial attacks can\nhelp AVs navigate safely on the road by avoiding misclassication of signs or\nobjects. This DNN-based study develops a resilient traffic sign classifier for\nAVs that uses a hybrid defense method. We use transfer learning to retrain the\nInception-V3 and Resnet-152 models as traffic sign classifiers. This method\nalso utilizes a combination of three different strategies: random filtering,\nensembling, and local feature mapping. We use the random cropping and resizing\ntechnique for random filtering, plurality voting as ensembling strategy and an\noptical character recognition model as a local feature mapper. This DNN-based\nhybrid defense method has been tested for the no attack scenario and against\nwell-known untargeted adversarial attacks (e.g., Projected Gradient Descent or\nPGD, Fast Gradient Sign Method or FGSM, Momentum Iterative Method or MIM\nattack, and Carlini and Wagner or C&W). We find that our hybrid defense method\nachieves 99% average traffic sign classification accuracy for the no attack\nscenario and 88% average traffic sign classification accuracy for all attack\nscenarios. Moreover, the hybrid defense method, presented in this study,\nimproves the accuracy for traffic sign classification compared to the\ntraditional defense methods (i.e., JPEG filtering, feature squeezing, binary\nfiltering, and random filtering) up to 6%, 50%, and 55% for FGSM, MIM, and PGD\nattacks, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 02:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

The surficial soil particles turn hydrophobic due\nto the deposition of combusted organic matter during wildfires. Afterward,\nraindrops, splash, and erosion form devastating mudflows. We propose a new\nparadigm in which a significant amount of air remains entrapped in\npost-wildfire mudflow via hydrophobic particle-air attraction. Specific\nfindings quantify the amount of air trapped within sand-water volumetric\nconcentrations, the effect of intermixing energy, gravity, and sand particle\nsize on outcome mudflow internal structure.
