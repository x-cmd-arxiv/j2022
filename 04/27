In this work, we\nfor the first time investigate masked visual modeling in video-text\npre-training with the \"dual-encoder\" architecture.

Such a peak is well described in terms of a spin\nresonance mode, i.e., a spin-1 exciton theoretically predicted for quasi-2D\nsuperconductors with a sign-changing gap. The same theories, however, indicate\nthat such a resonance mode should be absent in a three-dimensional (3D) system\nwith a spherical Fermi surface. This raises the question of the fate of the\nspin resonance mode in layered unconventional superconductors that are not\nstrongly anisotropic, such as certain heavy-fermion compounds and potentially\nthe newly discovered nickelate superconductor NdNiO$_2$. Here, we use the\nrandom-phase-approximation to calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility of 3D\nsuperconductors with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap symmetry and corrugated\ncylindrical-like Fermi surfaces. By varying the out-of-plane hopping anisotropy\n$t_z/t$, we demonstrate that the appearance of a spin resonance mode is\ndetermined by the topology of the hot lines -- i.e. lines on the Fermi surface\nthat are connected by the magnetic wave-vector. For an in-plane\nantiferromagnetic wave-vector, the hot lines undergo a topological transition\nfrom open lines to closed loops at a critical $t_z/t$ value. The closed hot\nlines cross the nodal superconducting lines, making the spin resonance mode\noverdamped and incoherent. In contrast, for an out-of-plane antiferromagnetic\nwave-vector, the hot lines remain open and the spin resonance mode remains\nsharp. We discuss the experimental implications of our results for the\nout-of-plane dispersion of the spin resonance mode and, more generally, for\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments on unconventional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 16:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 08:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Here, we show that\nunder $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields, i.e., hopping amplitudes with phases $\\pm\n1$, the fundamental domain of momentum space can assume the topology of a Klein\nbottle. This drastic change of the Brillouin zone theory is due to the\nprojective symmetry algebra enforced by the gauge field. Remarkably, the\nnon-orientability of the Brillouin Klein bottle corresponds to the topological\nclassification by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, in contrast to the Chern number\nvalued in $\\mathbb{Z}$ for the usual Brillouin torus.

In fact, the transcendental\nfunctions of the latter can be conveniently written in terms of impact factors,\ntrajectories, single-emission CEVs and a remainder, which is a function of the\nconformally invariant cross ratios which characterise the six-gluon amplitudes\nin planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Finally, as expected, in the MRK limit the\ntwo-gluon CEV neatly factorises in terms of two single-emission CEVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 17:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the final\nend stages of stellar evolution at the upper-mass end. As part of a\nhomogeneous, magnitude-limited ($V\\leq12$) spectroscopic survey of northern\nGalactic WR stars, this paper aims to establish the observed and intrinsic\nmultiplicity properties of the early-type nitrogen-rich WR population (WNE). We\nobtained high-resolution spectroscopic time series of the complete\nmagnitude-limited sample of 16 WNE stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator\ntelescope at La Palma, typically providing a time base of about two to eight\nyears. We measured relative radial velocities (RVs) using cross-correlation and\nused RV variations to flag binary candidates. Adopting a peak-to-peak RV\nvariability threshold of 50 km/s as a criterion found an observed multiplicity\nfraction of 0.44$\\pm$0.12. Using an updated Monte Carlo method with a Bayesian\nframework, we calculated the three-dimensional likelihood for the intrinsic\nbinary fraction, the maximum period, and the power-law index for the period\ndistribution for the WNE population. We also re-derived multiplicity parameters\nfor the Galactic WC population. We found an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of\n$0.56\\substack{+0.20 \\\\ -0.15}$ for the parent WNE population. For the Galactic\nWC population, we re-derive an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of\n$0.96\\substack{+0.04 \\\\ -0.22}$. The derived multiplicity parameters for the\nWNE population are quite similar to those derived for main-sequence O binaries\nbut differ from those of the WC population. The significant shift in the WC\nperiod distribution towards longer periods is too large to be explained via\nexpansion of the orbit due to stellar winds, and we discuss possible\nimplications of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 18:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

In particular, a one-step Gaussian process (GP) model is trained on\nclosed-loop interaction data to learn the behavior of a TV driven by an unknown\npolicy. Predictions of the nominal trajectory and associated uncertainty are\nrolled out via a sampling-based approach and are used in a model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) policy for the ego vehicle in order to intelligently trade-off\nbetween safety and performance when attempting overtaking maneuvers against a\nTV. We demonstrate the GP-based predictor in closed loop with the MPC policy in\nsimulation races and compare its performance against several predictors from\nliterature. In a Monte Carlo study, we observe that the GP-based predictor\nachieves similar win rates while maintaining safety in up to 3x more races. We\nfinally demonstrate the prediction and control framework in real-time in a\nexperimental study on a 1/10th scale racecar platform operating at speeds of\naround 2.8 m/s, and show a significant level of improvement when using the\nGP-based predictor over a baseline MPC predictor.

An ideal design of the video streaming\nsystem should simultaneously meet three key requirements: (1) low latency of\nencoding and streaming, (2) high accuracy of server-side DNNs, and (3) low\ncompute overheads on the camera. Unfortunately, despite many recent efforts,\nsuch video streaming system has hitherto been elusive, especially when serving\nadvanced vision tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. This\npaper presents AccMPEG, a new video encoding and streaming system that meets\nall the three requirements. The key is to learn how much the encoding quality\nat each (16x16) macroblock can influence the server-side DNN accuracy, which we\ncall accuracy gradient. Our insight is that these macroblock-level accuracy\ngradient can be inferred with sufficient precision by feeding the video frames\nthrough a cheap model. AccMPEG provides a suite of techniques that, given a new\nserver-side DNN, can quickly create a cheap model to infer the accuracy\ngradient on any new frame in near realtime. Our extensive evaluation of AccMPEG\non two types of edge devices (one Intel Xeon Silver 4100 CPU or NVIDIA Jetson\nNano) and three vision tasks (six recent pre-trained DNNs) shows that AccMPEG\n(with the same camera-side compute resources) can reduce the end-to-end\ninference delay by 10-43% without hurting accuracy compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 18:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

Nevertheless, the\nquantitative relationship between driving behaviors and vehicle fuel\nconsumption remains obscure. Addressing this critical missing link will\ncontribute to the improvement of transportation sustainability, as well as\nunderstanding drivers' behavioral diversity. This study proposed an integrated\nmicroscopic driver behavior and fuel consumption model to assess and predict\nvehicle fuel economy with naturalistic highway and local commuting traffic\ndata. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, significant correlation\nresults are revealed between specific individual driving preferences and fuel\neconomy over drivers' frequent commuting routes. Correlation results indicate\nthat the differences in fuel consumption incurred by various driving behaviors,\neven in the same traffic conditions, can be as much as 29% for a light-duty\ntruck and 15% for a passenger car. A Gaussian Process Regression model is\nfurther trained, validated, and tested under different traffic and vehicle\nconditions to predict fuel consumption based on drivers' personalized\nbehaviors. Such a quantitative and personalized model can be used to identify\nand recommend fuel-friendly driving behaviors and routes, demonstrating a\nstrong incentive for relevant stakeholders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 18:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

The uncertainty in $R_0$ limits our\nknowledge of many aspects of the Milky Way, including its total mass and the\nrelative mass of its major components, and any orbital parameters of stars\nemployed in chemo-dynamical analyses. While measurements of $R_0$ have been\nimproving over a century, measurements in the past few years from a variety of\nmethods still find a wide range of $R_0$ being somewhere within $8.0$ to\n$8.5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. The most precise measurements to date have to assume that\nSgr A$^*$ is at rest at the Galactic center, which may not be the case. In this\npaper, we use maps of the kinematics of stars in the Galactic bar derived from\nAPOGEE DR17 and Gaia EDR3 data augmented with spectro-photometric distances\nfrom the \\texttt{astroNN} neural-network method. These maps clearly display the\nminimum in the rotational velocity $v_T$ and the quadrupolar signature in\nradial velocity $v_R$ expected for stars orbiting in a bar. From the minimum in\n$v_T$, we measure $R_0 = 8.23 \\pm 0.12\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. We validate our\nmeasurement using realistic $N$-body simulations of the Milky Way. We further\nmeasure the pattern speed of the bar to be $\\Omega_\\mathrm{bar} =\n40.08\\pm1.78\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}\\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$. Because the bar forms out\nof the disk, its center is manifestly the barycenter of the bar+disc system and\nour measurement is therefore the most robust and accurate measurement of $R_0$\nto date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 19:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-14"}

It is likely that\ncomplex social interactions and individual ideologies shape these disparities.\nComputational models of select factors that reproduce empirical observations\ncan help us understand some of the minimal driving forces behind these complex\nphenomena and therefore aid in their mitigation. Here, we present a simple\nagent-based model of citation practices within academia, in which academics\ngenerate citations based on three factors: their estimate of the collaborative\nnetwork of the field, how they sample that estimate, and how open they are to\nlearning about their field from other academics. We show that increasing\nhomophily -- or the tendency of people to interact with others more like\nthemselves -- in these three domains is sufficient to reproduce observed biases\nin citation practices.

Fully homomorphic\nencryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding\nconfidentiality of data during processing. It allows computation on fully\nencrypted data without the need for decryption, thus fully preserving privacy.\nTo enable processing encrypted data at usable levels of classic security, e.g.,\n128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion -\nthe ciphertext is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types.\nIn this paper, we present MemFHE which is the first accelerator of both client\nand server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters) based\nhomomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory (PIM). PIM alleviates\nthe data movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ\nexecution and extensive parallelism needed for FHE's polynomial operations.\nWhile the client-PIM can homomorphically encrypt and decrypt data, the\nserver-PIM can process homomorphically encrypted data without decryption.\nMemFHE's server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible\nbootstrapping, allowing two encryption techniques and various FHE\nsecurity-levels based on the application requirements.

Selecting a clean sample was favoured over including a higher\nnumber of extragalactic sources. For the final sample, the random and\nsystematic errors in the proper motions are analysed, as well as the\nradio-optical offsets in position for sources in the third realisation of the\nInternational Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3).\n  The Gaia-CRF3 comprises about 1.6 million QSO-like sources, of which 1.2\nmillion have five-parameter astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 and 0.4 million\nhave six-parameter solutions.

As a result, this\npossibility of incorporating vulnerabilities in WebAssembly modules has widened\nthe attack surface of modern web applications. This paper presents Wasmati, a\nstatic analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in WebAssembly\nbinaries. It is based on the generation of a code property graph (CPG), a\nprogram representation previously adopted for detecting vulnerabilities in\nvarious languages but hitherto unapplied to WebAssembly.

This vulnerability has been exploited in \"morph attacks\" in security\nscenarios. Here, we asked whether the \"other-race effect\" (ORE) -- the human\nadvantage for identifying own- vs. other-race faces -- exacerbates morph attack\nsusceptibility for humans. We also asked whether face-identification\nperformance in a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is affected by the\nrace of morphed faces. Caucasian (CA) and East-Asian (EA) participants\nperformed a face-identity matching task on pairs of CA and EA face images in\ntwo conditions. In the morph condition, different-identity pairs consisted of\nan image of identity \"A\" and a 50/50 morph between images of identity \"A\" and\n\"B\". In the baseline condition, morphs of different identities never appeared.\nAs expected, morphs were identified mistakenly more often than original face\nimages. Moreover, CA participants showed an advantage for CA faces in\ncomparison to EA faces (a partial ORE). Of primary interest, morph\nidentification was substantially worse for cross-race faces than for own-race\nfaces. Similar to humans, the DCNN performed more accurately for original face\nimages than for morphed image pairs. Notably, the deep network proved\nsubstantially more accurate than humans in both cases. The results point to the\npossibility that DCNNs might be useful for improving face identification\naccuracy when morphed faces are presented.

One approach to mitigating these artifacts is to image two channels;\none that captures an activity-dependent fluorophore, such as GCaMP, and another\nthat captures an activity-independent fluorophore such as RFP. Because the\nactivity-independent channel contains the same motion artifacts as the\nactivity-dependent channel, but no neural signals, the two together can be used\nto remove the artifacts. Existing approaches for this correction, such as\ntaking the ratio of the two channels, do not account for channel independent\nnoise in the measured fluorescence. Moreover, no systematic comparison has been\nmade of existing approaches that use two-channel signals. Here, we present\nTwo-channel Motion Artifact Correction (TMAC), a method which seeks to remove\nartifacts by specifying a generative model of the fluorescence of the two\nchannels as a function of motion artifact, neural activity, and noise. We\nfurther present a novel method for evaluating ground-truth performance of\nmotion correction algorithms by comparing the decodability of behavior from two\ntypes of neural recordings; a recording that had both an activity-dependent\nfluorophore (GCaMP and RFP) and a recording where both fluorophores were\nactivity-independent (GFP and RFP).

We proposed the hypothesis that heading\nperception is computed from optic acceleration, the temporal derivative of\noptic flow, based on the observation that heading is aligned perfectly with a\npoint on the retina with zero optic acceleration. However, this result was\nderived for a specific scenario used in our experiments, when retinal heading\nand rotational velocity are constant over time. We previously speculated that\nas the change over time in heading or rotation increases, the bias of the\nestimator would increase proportionally, based on the idea that our derived\ncase would approximate what happens in a small interval of time (when heading\nand rotation are nearly constant). In this technical report, we characterize\nthe properties of the optic acceleration field and derive the bias of this\nestimator for the more common case of a fixating observer, i.e., one that moves\nwhile counter-rotating their eyes to stabilize an object on the fovea. For a\nfixating observer tracking a point on a fronto-parallel plane, there are in\nfact two singularities of optic acceleration: one that is always at fixation\n(due to image stabilization) and a second whose bias scales inversely with\nheading, inconsistent with human behavior. For movement parallel to a ground\nplane, there is only one singularity of optic acceleration (at the fixation\npoint), which is uninformative about heading. We conclude that the singularity\nof optic acceleration is not an accurate estimator of heading under natural\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 21:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

This framework can be\napplied to personalized ad placement, whenever the content owner observes the\nwebsite visitors, and hence has the context, but needs to transmit the ads to\nbe shown to a controller that is in charge of placing the marketing content.\nConsequently, the rate-constrained CMAB (RC-CMAB) problem requires the study of\nlossy compression schemes for the policy to be employed whenever the constraint\non the channel rate does not allow the uncompressed transmission of the\ndecision-maker's intentions.

Unfortunately, no\nnetwork alignment algorithm based on topology alone has been able to achieve\nthis aim, though those that include sequence similarity have seen some success.\nWe argue that this failure of topology alone is due to the sparsity and\nincompleteness of the PPI network data of almost all species, which provides\nthe network topology with a small signal-to-noise ratio that is effectively\nswamped when sequence information is added to the mix.

Our\nsimulations indicate that structural correlation consistently allows tissues to\nattain rigidity with less material. We further find that the percolation\nthreshold varies non-monotonically with the degree of correlation, such that it\ndecreases with moderate correlation and once more increases for high\ncorrelation. We explain the eventual reentrance in the dependence of the\nrigidity percolation threshold on correlation as the consequence of large,\nstiff clusters that are too poorly coupled to transmit forces across the\nnetwork. Our study offers deeper understanding of how spatial heterogeneity may\nenable tissues to robustly adapt to different mechanical contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 23:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct\nEFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address\nthis problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data\nto learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new\ntarget bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution\ndrift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between\nbearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit\nVariability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering\nUtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The\nproposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to\nmeasure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing\ndata. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy\nto decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two\nbearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect\nincipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 22:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Increased levels of renewable energy generation,\nas a prominent feature of this evolution, have led to new congestion patterns\nin the transmission network. The transmission system is originally designed for\nconventional energy sources, with predictable flow patterns. Insufficient\ntransfer capability in congested transmission systems results in commitment of\nmore expensive power plants and higher levels of renewable energy curtailment.\nOne way to mitigate congestion is adoption of power flow control through\nvariable-impedance flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. In this\npaper the impacts of power flow control on generation cost, carbon emissions\nand renewable energy curtailment are studied under a wide range of scenarios,\nincluding generation mix from major US regional transmission organizations, and\ndifferent load curves, representing seasonal variations. A two-stage stochastic\nunit commitment, including FACTS adjustment, is used to evaluate the impacts of\nFACTS devices on various types and penetration levels of renewable energy.

On account\nof the surge of infections, accompanied by hospitalizations and deaths due to\nCOVID-19, and lack of a definitive cure at that point, a national emergency was\ndeclared in the United States on March 13, 2020.

Such guidelines caused schools,\ncolleges, and universities, both private and public, in all the 50-United\nStates to switch to remote or online forms of teaching for a significant period\nof time. As a result, Google, the most widely used search engine in the United\nStates, experienced a surge in online shopping of remote learning-based\nsoftware, systems, applications, and gadgets by both educators and students\nfrom all the 50-United States, due to both these groups responding to the\nassociated needs and demands related to switching to remote teaching and\nlearning.

The design of transit schedules is important for the efficient\nand sustainable operation of public transit. However, previous studies usually\nassume fixed demand patterns and ignore uncertainties in demand, which may\ngenerate transit schedules that are vulnerable to demand variations. To address\ndemand uncertainty issues inherent in public transit systems, this paper adopts\nboth stochastic programming (SP) and robust optimization (RO) techniques to\ngenerate robust transit schedules against demand uncertainty. A nominal\n(non-robust) optimization model for the transit frequency setting problem\n(TFSP) under a single transit line setting is first proposed. The model is then\nextended to SP-based and RO-based formulations to incorporate demand\nuncertainty. The large-scale origin-destination (OD) matrices for real-world\ntransit problems make the optimization problems hard to solve. To efficiently\ngenerate robust transit schedules, a Transit Downsizing (TD) approach is\nproposed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We prove that the optimal\nobjective function of the problem after TD is close to that of the original\nproblem (i.e., the difference is bounded from above). The proposed models are\ntested with real-world transit lines and data from the Chicago Transit\nAuthority (CTA). Compared to the current transit schedule implemented by CTA,\nthe nominal TFSP model without considering demand uncertainty reduces\npassengers' wait times while increasing in-vehicle travel times. After\nincorporating demand uncertainty, both stochastic and robust TFSP models reduce\npassengers' wait times and in-vehicle travel times simultaneously.

By\niteratively performing a (meta) gradient descent, high-order gradients are\npropagated to the source examples. These gradients are then used to update the\nweights of source examples, in a way that is relevant to the target\nperformance. As MWR is model-agnostic, it can be applied to any backbone neural\nmodel. Extensive experiments are conducted with various backbone text matching\nmodels, on four widely used datasets and two tasks.

We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind\nproper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet's\ndesign and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that\nwe name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses, we find that\nDeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in\nrepresenting dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on\nshifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies\non a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and\nisolating the rigid components of the dynamics.

Classically, synchronization was characterized in terms of macroscopic\nparameters, such as the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Recently, however, we\nattempted a microscopic description of synchronization, called topological\nsynchronization, and showed that chaotic synchronization is, in fact, a\ncontinuous process that starts in low-density areas of the attractor. Here we\nanalyze the relation between the two emergent phenomena by shifting the\ndescriptive level of topological synchronization to account for the\nmultifractal nature of the visited attractors. Namely, we measure the\ngeneralized dimension of the system and monitor how it changes while increasing\nthe coupling strength. We show that during the gradual process of topological\nadjustment in phase space, the multifractal structures of each strange\nattractor of the two coupled oscillators continuously converge, taking a\nsimilar form, until complete topological synchronization ensues. According to\nour results, chaotic synchronization has a specific trait in various systems,\nfrom continuous systems and discrete maps to high dimensional systems:\nsynchronization initiates from the sparse areas of the attractor, and it\ncreates what we termed as the zipper effect, a distinctive pattern in the\nmultifractal structure of the system that reveals the microscopic buildup of\nthe synchronization process. Topological synchronization offers, therefore, a\nmore detailed microscopic description of chaotic synchronization and reveals\nnew information about the process even in cases of high mismatch parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 02:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

To estimate\nthe bolometric luminosity of AGN, we integrate the accretion disk SEDs from\n1$\\mu$m to 10keV. Our approach self-consistently covers any gaps in\nobservations and does not include reprocessed emission from the torus.

To study how programmers reuse code\non SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study.\nFirst, to capture the development activities of programmers, we collect 342,148\nmodified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these\nmodified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during\ndevelopment.

We count the code\nreuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in\ndifferent years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%,\nand the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased\nyear by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project\nis higher than that of old projects.

Here, we demonstrate that low-entropy regions of hydration\nshells around proteins drive hydrophobic attraction between shape-matched\nlow-entropy regions of the hydration shells, which essentially coordinates\nprotein-protein binding in rotational-configurational space of mutual\norientations and determines the binding affinity. An innovative method was used\nto identify the low-entropy regions of the hydration shells of the RBDs of\nmultiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and the ACE2. We observed integral low-entropy\nregions of hydration shells covering the binding sites of the RBDs and matching\nin shape to the low-entropy region of hydration shell at the binding site of\nthe ACE2. The RBD-ACE2 binding is thus found to be guided by hydrophobic\ncollapse between the shape-matched low-entropy regions of the hydration shells.\nA measure of the low-entropy of the hydration shells can be obtained by\ncounting the number of hydrophilic groups expressing hydrophilicity within the\nbinding sites.

Developing such a predictor typically\nrequires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to\nobtain.

We simultaneously\ndesign the membrane and plant layout yielding optimal membrane module synthesis\nproperties along with the optimal plant design for multiple objectives, feed\nconcentrations, filtration stages, and salt mixtures. The developed process\nmodels and the optimization solver are available open-source, enabling\ncomputational resource-efficient multi-scale optimization in membrane science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 07:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

To this end, we study\nan unsupervised scenario by proposing a novel Self-supervised Text Erasing\n(STE) framework that jointly learns to synthesize training images with erasure\nground-truth and accurately erase texts in the real world. We first design a\nstyle-aware image synthesis function to generate synthetic images with diverse\nstyled texts based on two synthetic mechanisms. To bridge the text style gap\nbetween the synthetic and real-world data, a policy network is constructed to\ncontrol the synthetic mechanisms by picking style parameters with the guidance\nof two specifically designed rewards. The synthetic training images with\nerasure ground-truth are then fed to train a coarse-to-fine erasing network. To\nproduce better erasing outputs, a triplet erasure loss is designed to enforce\nthe refinement stage to recover background textures. Moreover, we provide a new\ndataset (called PosterErase), which contains 60K high-resolution posters with\ntexts and is more challenging for the text erasing task. The proposed method\nhas been extensively evaluated with both PosterErase and the widely-used\nSCUT-Enstext dataset.

The scheme has been used in various\nengineering areas with different approximations in spatial direction. The\nlowest-order mixed method is the most popular one for miscible flow in porous\nmedia. The method is based on a linear Lagrange approximation to the\nconcentration and the zero-order Raviart-Thomas approximation to the\npressure/velocity. However, the optimal error estimate for the lowest-order\ncharacteristics-mixed FEM has not been presented although numerous effort has\nbeen made in last several decades.

Through this technology, secondary users (SUs)\nsense the spectrum opportunities free from primary users (PUs), and\nopportunistically take advantage of these (temporarily) idle portions, known as\nspectrum holes. In this correspondence, we consider a variant of the cognitive\nradio resource allocation problem posed by Martinovic et al. in 2017. The\ndistinguishing feature of this version of the problem is that each SU, due to\nits hardware limitations, imposes the requirement that the to-be-aggregated\nspectrum holes cannot be arbitrarily far from each other. We call this\nrestriction as the Maximal Aggregation Range (MAR) constraint, and refer to\nthis variant of the problem as the MAR-constrained hole assignment problem. The\nproblem can be formalized as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We\npropose a novel binary integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to the\nproblem. The number of constraints in this formulation is the number of\nspectrum holes plus the number of SUs. On the other hand, the number of binary\ndecision variables in the formulation can be prohibitively large, as for each\nlegitimate spectrum allocation to each SU, one variable is needed. We propose a\nbranch-and-price (B&P) framework to tackle this challenge. This framework is in\nfact a branch-and-bound procedure in which at each node of the search tree, we\nutilize the so-called (delayed) column generation technique for solving the LP\nrelaxation of the corresponding subproblem. As evidenced by the numerical\nresults, the LP relaxation bounds are very tight. This allows for a very\neffective pruning of the search space. Compared to the previously suggested\nformulations, the proposed technique can require much less computational\neffort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 09:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

Smart contracts are used occasionally in Bitcoin and are prevalent\nin Ethereum. Public quantum money improves upon cash we use today, yet the\ncurrent constructions do not enable smart contracts. In this work, we define\nand introduce quantum payment schemes, and show how to implement prudent\ncontracts -- a non-trivial subset of the functionality that a network such as\nEthereum provides. Examples discussed include: multi-signature wallets in which\nfunds can be spent by any 2-out-of-3 owners; restricted accounts that can send\nfunds only to designated destinations; and \"colored coins\" that can represent\nstocks that can be freely traded, and their owner would receive dividends. Our\napproach is not as universal as the one used in Ethereum since we do not reach\na consensus regarding the state of a ledger. We call our proposal prudent\ncontracts to reflect this.\n  The main building block is either quantum tokens for digital signatures\n(Ben-David and Sattath QCrypt'17, Coladangelo et al.

Notable advantages of this approach are:\ntransactions are locally verifiable and without latency, the throughput is\nunbounded, and most importantly, it would remove the need for Bitcoin mining.\nOur approach requires a universal large-scale quantum computer and long-term\nquantum memory; hence we do not expect it to be implementable in the next few\nyears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 09:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2022 08:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

The crux of FSS is how to aggregate dense\ncorrelations between support and query images for query segmentation while\nbeing robust to the large variations in appearance and context.

In this work, we\neffectively integrate the context and affinity information via the proposed\nnovel Context and Affinity Transformer (CATrans) in a hierarchical\narchitecture. Specifically, the Relation-guided Context Transformer (RCT)\npropagates context information from support to query images conditioned on more\ninformative support features. Based on the observation that a huge feature\ndistinction between support and query pairs brings barriers for context\nknowledge transfer, the Relation-guided Affinity Transformer (RAT) measures\nattention-aware affinity as auxiliary information for FSS, in which the\nself-affinity is responsible for more reliable cross-affinity.

As a result, there is a growing need to utilize these\narchitectures by introducing shared memory parallelization schemes to software\napplications. OpenMP is the most comprehensive API that implements such\nschemes, characterized by a readable interface. Nevertheless, introducing\nOpenMP into code is challenging due to pervasive pitfalls in management of\nparallel shared memory. To facilitate the performance of this task, many\nsource-to-source (S2S) compilers have been created over the years, tasked with\ninserting OpenMP directives into code automatically. In addition to having\nlimited robustness to their input format, these compilers still do not achieve\nsatisfactory coverage and precision in locating parallelizable code and\ngenerating appropriate directives. In this work, we propose leveraging recent\nadvances in ML techniques, specifically in natural language processing (NLP),\nto replace S2S compilers altogether. We create a database (corpus), Open-OMP,\nspecifically for this goal. Open-OMP contains over 28,000 code snippets, half\nof which contain OpenMP directives while the other half do not need\nparallelization at all with high probability. We use the corpus to train\nsystems to automatically classify code segments in need of parallelization, as\nwell as suggest individual OpenMP clauses.

As the answers to a complex query are\nobtained from a combination of logical operations over sub-queries, the\nembeddings of the answer entities may not always follow a uni-modal\ndistribution in the embedding space.

Even the scope\nof definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories\n(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)\nare perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that\nagents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected\nutilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded\nrationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and\nbiases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent\nadvances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and\ntechnology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality\nwould be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take\ndecision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views\non this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five\nyears) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into\nthree schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of\nprogress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede\nmachine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and\nadvances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.\nThird school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be\nextended by advances in AI and various other fields.

Existing graph\npooling methods commonly consist of two stages, i.e., selecting the top-ranked\nnodes and removing the rest nodes to construct a coarsened graph\nrepresentation. However, local structural information of the removed nodes\nwould be inevitably dropped in these methods, due to the inherent coupling of\nnodes (location) and their features (signals). In this paper, we propose an\nenhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve\nhierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural\ninformation in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph\nlifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the\nremoved nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature\nreduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is\nobtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring\npreserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated\nto the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and\npermutation-invariant. The proposed graph lifting structure is general to be\nintegrated with existing downsampling-based graph pooling methods.

With memory disaggregation, data center compute nodes can directly\naccess memory on adjacent nodes and are therefore able to overcome local memory\nrestrictions, introducing a new data management paradigm for distributed\ncomputing. This paper proposes and demonstrates a memory disaggregated\nin-memory object store framework for big data applications by leveraging the\nnewly introduced ThymesisFlow memory disaggregation system. The framework\nextends the functionality of the pre-existing Apache Arrow Plasma object store\nframework to distributed systems by enabling clients to easily and efficiently\nproduce and consume data objects across multiple compute nodes. This allows big\ndata applications to increasingly leverage parallel processing at reduced\ndevelopment costs. In addition, the paper includes latency and throughput\nmeasurements that indicate only a modest performance penalty is incurred for\nremote disaggregated memory access as opposed to local (~6.5 vs ~5.75 GiB/s).\nThe results can be used to guide the design of future systems that leverage\nmemory disaggregation as well as the newly presented framework.

While previous research has mostly focused on analyzing and\npredicting duplication links, this work aims at understanding the various other\nlink types, their prevalence, and characteristics towards a more reliable link\ntype prediction. For this, we studied 607,208 links connecting 698,790 issues\nin 15 public JIRA repositories. Besides the default types, the custom types\nDepend, Incorporate, Split, and Cause were also common. We manually grouped all\n75 link types used in the repositories into five general categories: General\nRelation, Duplication, Composition, Temporal / Causal, and Workflow. Comparing\nthe structures of the corresponding graphs, we observed several trends. For\ninstance, Duplication links tend to represent simpler issue graphs often with\ntwo components and Composition links present the highest amount of hierarchical\ntree structures (97.7%). Surprisingly, General Relation links have a\nsignificantly higher transitivity score than Duplication and Temporal / Causal\nlinks. Motivated by the differences between the link types and by their\npopularity, we evaluated the robustness of two state-of-the-art duplicate\ndetection approaches from the literature on the JIRA dataset. We found that\ncurrent deep-learning approaches confuse between Duplication and other links in\nalmost all repositories.

This paper presents a\ncrowdsourced study with 158 participants investigating the relation between\nentity-based interaction (an action + its target entity) and the resulting\ninsight. To this end, we generalized the interaction with an existing CO2\nExplorer as entity-based interaction and enabled users to input notes and refer\nto relevant entities to assist their narratives. We logged interactions of\nusers freely exploring the visualization and characterized their externalized\ninsights about the data. Using entity-based interactions and references to\ninfer insight characteristics (category, overview versus detail, and prior\nknowledge), we found evidence that compared with interactions, entity\nreferences improved insight characterization from slight/fair to fair/moderate\nagreements. To interpret prediction outcomes, feature importance and\ncorrelation analysis indicated that, e.g., detailed insights tended to have\nmore mouse-overs in the chart area and cite the vertical reference lines in the\nline chart as evidence.

Our measurements reveal strong differences in the character of\nlayer-substrate interaction for as-grown and delaminated epitaxial layers. A\nmuch weaker interaction of as-grown layers is explained by wrinkles formation\nthat reduces strain at the layer-substrate interface, which for layers\ntransferred to other substrates occurs only in a limited temperature range. The\nmost striking result is the observation of a giant increase in the $E_{1u}$\nphonon energy of up to $\\sim6$ cm$^{-1}$ in a narrow temperature range. We show\nthat the amplitude and temperature range of the anomaly is strongly modified by\nUV light illumination. The observed giant effect is explained in terms of\nstrain generation resulting from charge redistribution between shallow traps\nand different defects, which can be interpreted as a result of strong\nelectron-phonon coupling in hBN.

This\nnew flexible-body immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) approach incorporates the\ngeometrical and domain solution flexibility of the immersed boundary (IB)\nmethod with an accuracy comparable to body-fitted approaches that sharply\nresolve flows and stresses up to the fluid-structure interface. Unlike many IB\nmethods, our ILE formulation uses distinct momentum equations for the fluid and\nsolid subregions with a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy that connects fluid\nand solid subproblems through simple interface conditions. We use a penalty\nmethod involving two representations of the fluid-structure interface. These\ntwo representations are connected by approximate Lagrange multiplier forces\nthat impose kinematic interface conditions. This approach also enables the use\nof multi-rate time stepping, which allows us to take different time step sizes\nfor the fluid and structure subproblems.

The dynamics of the volumetric structural mesh are\ndetermined using a standard finite element approach to large-deformation\nnonlinear elasticity via a nearly incompressible solid mechanics formulation.\nThis formulation also readily accommodates compressible structures for cases in\nwhich part of the solid boundary does not contact the incompressible fluid.\nComparisons are made with computational and experimental benchmarks.

AdaCoach is designed to simulate real customers who\nseek help and actively initiate the dialogue with the customer service agents.\nBesides, AdaCoach uses an automated dialogue evaluation model to score the\nperformance of the customer agent in the training process, which can provide\nnecessary assistance when the newly hired customer service agent encounters\nproblems. We apply recent NLP technologies to ensure efficient run-time\nperformance in the deployed system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst system that trains the customer service agent through human-computer\ninteraction. Until now, the system has already supported more than 500,000\nsimulation training and cultivated over 1000 qualified customer service agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 13:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

The light saturation phenomenon of Kr at 1.75 keV, 1.90\nkeV, 14.30 keV, and 17.50 keV energies is further calculated and researched\nusing the optimized photon flux model theory. We statistically compare the main\nionization paths under those four specific photon energies and calculate the\npopulation changes of various hollow atoms. The results demonstrate that the\nratio of hollow atoms produced at the critical ionization photon energy is\nhigh. Furthermore, the change of position is smooth, showing the significant\ndifference between the generation mode of ions with low photon energy and those\nwith high photon energy, which has important reference significance for\nstudying hollow atoms with medium and high charge states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 14:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2022 16:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Previous studies\nthat do consider AC power flow use either less complex balanced formulations\napplicable to transmission networks, or iterative linearisations derived from\nlocal power flow solutions and prior knowledge of the design. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes a new algorithm for obtaining DES design\ndecisions subject to nonlinear power flow models. The use of regularised\ncomplementarity reformulations for operational constraints that contain binary\nvariables is proposed. This allows the use of large-scale nonlinear solvers\nthat can find locally optimal solutions, eliminating the need for\nlinearisations and prior knowledge while improving accuracy. DES design models\nwith either multiphase optimal power flow (MOPF), which captures inherent phase\nimbalances present in distribution networks, or balanced optimal power flow\nformulations (OPF) are tested using a modified version of the unbalanced IEEE\nEU low-voltage network. Results are compared with a popular linear DES design\nframework, which proposes an infeasible operational schedule when tested with\nMOPF, while the fixed design alone produces the highest annualised costs.\nDespite the increased complexity, DES with MOPF obtains the best solution,\nenabling a greater integration of solar capacity and reducing total annualised\ncost when compared to DES with OPF. The new algorithm achieves a 19%\nimprovement when compared with solving a bi-level model for DES with OPF, where\nthe entire binary topology in the nonlinear model is fixed. The study therefore\nenables the acquisition of DES designs that can work symbiotically within\ndistribution networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 14:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

Recently, data-driven detectors and physics-based\nMoving Target Defences (MTD) have been proposed to detect false data injection\n(FDI) attacks on state estimation. However, the uncontrollable false positive\nrate of the data-driven detector and the extra cost of frequent MTD usage limit\ntheir wide applications. Few works have explored the overlap between these two\nareas. To fill this gap, this paper proposes blending data-driven and\nphysics-based approaches to enhance the detection performance. To start, a\nphysics-informed data-driven attack detection and identification algorithm is\nproposed. Then, an MTD protocol is triggered by the positive alarm from the\ndata-driven detector. The MTD is formulated as a bilevel optimisation to\nrobustly guarantee its effectiveness against the worst-case attack around the\nidentified attack vector. Meanwhile, MTD hiddenness is also improved so that\nthe defence cannot be detected by the attacker. To guarantee feasibility and\nconvergence, the convex two-stage reformulation is derived through duality and\nlinear matrix inequality. The simulation results verify that blending data and\nphysics can achieve extremely high detection rate while simultaneously reducing\nthe false positive rate of the data-driven detector and the extra cost of MTD.\nAll codes are available at https://github.com/xuwkk/DDET-MTD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 14:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Observations from Parker Solar\nProbe's (PSP's) first two solar encounters have formed the basis for many of\nthe described switchback properties and generation mechanisms. However, this\nearly data may not be representative of the typical near-Sun solar wind,\nbiasing our current understanding of these phenomena. One defining switchback\nproperty is the magnetic deflection direction. During the first solar\nencounter, this was primarily in the tangential direction for the longest\nswitchbacks, which has since been discussed as evidence, and a testable\nprediction, of several switchback generation methods. In this study, we\nre-examine the deflection direction of switchbacks during the first eight PSP\nencounters to confirm the existence of a systematic deflection direction. We\nfirst identify switchbacks exceeding a threshold deflection in the magnetic\nfield and confirm a previous finding that they are arc-polarized. In agreement\nwith earlier results from PSP's first encounter, we find that groups of longer\nswitchbacks tend to deflect in the same direction for several hours. However,\nin contrast to earlier studies, we find that there is no unique direction for\nthese deflections, although several solar encounters showed a non-uniform\ndistribution in deflection direction with a slight preference for the\ntangential direction. This result suggests a systematic magnetic configuration\nfor switchback generation, which is consistent with interchange reconnection as\na source mechanism, although this new evidence does not rule out other\nmechanisms, such as the expansion of wave modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 14:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 09:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

Learning the\ncross-similarity of video and text in a joint embedding space is the dominant\napproach. To do so, a contrastive loss is usually employed because it organizes\nthe embedding space by putting similar items close and dissimilar items far.\nThis framework leads to competitive recall rates, as they solely focus on the\nrank of the groundtruth items. Yet, assessing the quality of the ranking list\nis of utmost importance when considering intelligent retrieval systems, since\nmultiple items may share similar semantics, hence a high relevance. Moreover,\nthe aforementioned framework uses a fixed margin to separate similar and\ndissimilar items, treating all non-groundtruth items as equally irrelevant. In\nthis paper we propose to use a variable margin: we argue that varying the\nmargin used during training based on how much relevant an item is to a given\nquery, i.e. a relevance-based margin, easily improves the quality of the\nranking lists measured through nDCG and mAP.

We focus on the role of sidewalls by performing\nsimulations for different gap widths ($W$) between the two confining sidewalls:\nfrom $5$ to $30$ grain sizes ($d$). Our results indicate the existence of two\ndistinct regimes: regime I for flow angles smaller than the critical angle\n$\\theta_c\\approx 40^\\circ$ and regime II at flow angles larger than $\\theta_c$\n. Regime I corresponds to dense flows whereas flows belonging to regime II\nexhibit a strong variation of the volume fraction through the depth. Three\nrelevant lengths are identified in the system: $W$ the gap between sidewalls,\n$l$ the length characterizing the vertical variation of the volume fraction and\n$h$ a characteristic length associated with the vertical variation of the\nstreamwise velocity. Using these lengths we can rescale the profiles of various\nflow properties (e.g. streamwise velocity, granular temperature, particle\nrotation...). In regime II, in contrast to regime I, $l$ and $h$ have a similar\nbehaviour. As a consequence, the rescaled profiles in regime II only involve\n$h$ (or equivalently $l$) and $W$ . Other dissimilarities exist between regimes\nI and II. In particular, the scaling of the flow rate with $h$ (at fixed $W$ )\ndiffers in the two regimes, although they display a similar scaling with $W$\n(at fixed flow angle).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 06:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 06:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}
