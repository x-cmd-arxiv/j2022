No additional candidate neutrino sources were\nidentified by our program, allowing us to place the first constraints on the\nunderlying optical luminosity function of astrophysical neutrino sources.\nTransients with optical absolutes magnitudes brighter that -21 can contribute\nno more than 87% of the total, while transients brighter than -22 can\ncontribute no more than 58% of the total, neglecting the effect of extinction.\nThese are the the first observational constraints on the neutrino emission of\nbright populations such as superluminous supernovae. None of the neutrinos were\ncoincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable to that observed for TXS\n0506+056/IC170922A, suggesting that most astrophysical neutrinos are not\nproduced during such optical flares.

An important case is\nacknowledgement-based contention resolution, in which processors cannot listen\nto the channel at all; all they know is whether or not their own messages have\ngot through. This situation arises frequently in both networking and cloud\ncomputing. The most common acknowledgement-based protocols in practice are\nbackoff protocols - variants of binary exponential backoff are used in both\nEthernet and TCP/IP, and both Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to\nimplement it to handle busy periods.\n  In queueing models, where each processor has a queue of messages, stable\nbackoff protocols are already known (H{\\aa}stad et al., SICOMP 1996). In\nqueue-free models, where each processor has a single message but processors\narrive randomly, it is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans.

As a\nresult, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to\ncope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient\ntraffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on\nhaving access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their\norigin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may\nnot be available in practice.\n  Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning\napproach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with\ndifferent values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In\nparticular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at\neach time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of\nthe network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby\npreserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time\nof users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an\nexpected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the\nnumber of periods over which tolls are updated.

The PCS\nis derived based on the critical band importance function and is applied to\nmodify the targets of the SE model. Specifically, the contrast of target\nfeatures is stretched based on perceptual importance, thereby improving the\noverall SE performance. Compared with post-processing-based implementations,\nincorporating PCS into the training phase preserves performance and reduces\nonline computation. Notably, PCS can be combined with different SE model\narchitectures and training criteria. Furthermore, PCS does not affect the\ncausality or convergence of SE model training.

However, the energy\nconservation condition cannot be matched precisely if the medium is finite and\nonly supports quantized modes.

For\ninstance, in genetic fine-mapping, high correlations between nearby genetic\nvariants make it hard to identify the exact locations of causal variants. So\nthe statistical task is to output as many disjoint regions containing a signal\nas possible, each as small as possible, while controlling false positives.\nSimilar problems arise in any application where signals cannot be perfectly\nlocalized, such as locating stars in astronomical surveys and changepoint\ndetection in sequential data. Common Bayesian approaches to these problems\ninvolve computing a posterior distribution over signal locations. However,\nexisting procedures to translate these posteriors into actual credible regions\nfor the signals fail to capture all the information in the posterior, leading\nto lower power and (sometimes) inflated false discoveries. With this\nmotivation, we introduce Bayesian Linear Programming (BLiP). Given a posterior\ndistribution over signals, BLiP outputs credible regions for signals which\nverifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives.\nBLiP overcomes an extremely high-dimensional and nonconvex problem to\nverifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives.\nBLiP is very computationally efficient compared to the cost of computing the\nposterior and can wrap around nearly any Bayesian model and algorithm. Applying\nBLiP to existing state-of-the-art analyses of UK Biobank data (for genetic\nfine-mapping) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (for astronomical point source\ndetection) increased power by 30-120% in just a few minutes of additional\ncomputation.

One interesting possibility for such anomaly-free axion to\nexplain dark matter (DM) is when it has a mass of order keV and an intermediate\nscale decay constant, since it can be explored through direct search\nexperiments, X-ray observations, various stellar cooling processes, and the\nmisalignment mechanism naturally explains the DM abundance. As a concrete\nrenormalizable model of such axion, we consider an extended Higgs sector with\nglobal flavor symmetry, which consists of three Higgs doublet fields and three\nsinglet Higgs fields with $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ charges. We identify viable\nparameter regions that satisfy theoretical bounds on the Higgs potential and\nvarious experimental limits on this model, and evaluate the mass spectra of the\naxion and extra Higgs bosons. We find that even an anomaly-free axion can\ngenerally couple to photons through mixing with CP-odd Higgs, and that its\nstrength depends on the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets as well\nas the axion mass. As a result, the ratios of the vacuum expectation values of\nthe Higgs doublets are tightly constrained to satisfy the X-ray constraints. We\nshow the favored parameter region where axion DM explains the XENON1T excess.\nWe also demonstrate that the axion-electron coupling is correlated with the\nextra Higgs boson masses and mixing angles for CP-even Higgs bosons. Thus, if\nthe axion is detected in future observations, the extra Higgs boson masses and\nthe coupling of the standard model-like Higgs boson with the weak gauge bosons\nare restricted.

Traditional economic concepts struggle with identifying\nanti-competitive patterns in digital platforms not least due to the complexity\nof market definition. In contrast, performative power is a causal notion that\nis identifiable with minimal knowledge of the market, its internals,\nparticipants, products, or prices.\n  Low performative power implies that a firm can do no better than to optimize\ntheir objective on current data. In contrast, firms of high performative power\nstand to benefit from steering the population towards more profitable behavior.\nWe confirm in a simple theoretical model that monopolies maximize performative\npower. A firm's ability to personalize increases performative power, while\ncompetition and outside options decrease performative power. On the empirical\nside, we propose an observational causal design to identify performative power\nfrom discontinuities in how digital platforms display content.

Most recently, a method is proposed\nfor ranking salient objects in an input video based on a predicted fixation\nmap. It relies solely on the density of the fixations within the salient\nobjects to infer their saliency ranks, which is incompatible with human\nperception of saliency ranking. In this work, we propose to explicitly learn\nthe spatial and temporal relations between different salient objects to produce\nthe saliency ranks. To this end, we propose an end-to-end method for video\nsalient object ranking (VSOR), with two novel modules: an intra-frame adaptive\nrelation (IAR) module to learn the spatial relation among the salient objects\nin the same frame locally and globally, and an inter-frame dynamic relation\n(IDR) module to model the temporal relation of saliency across different\nframes. In addition, to address the limited video types (just sports and\nmovies) and scene diversity in the existing VSOR dataset, we propose a new\ndataset that covers different video types and diverse scenes on a large scale.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in relevant fields.

Previous works have shown that differentiable physics\nsimulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory\noptimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However,\nsuch gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the\nfull simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due\nto local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill,\nthat uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve\nlong-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In\nparticular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a\ngradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable\nsimulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration\ntrajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills\nby finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks.

Moreover, contrasting the representation of the current\nframe and the hidden knowledge makes it possible to infer the scratch position\nin an unsupervised manner, and such defect localization generalizes well to\nreal-world degradations. To better resolve mixed degradation and compensate for\nthe flow estimation error during frame alignment, we propose to leverage more\nexpressive transformer blocks for spatial restoration.

We develop a new strategy for\naccessing a family of fractionalized phases known as quantum spin liquids in\ntwo-dimensional Rydberg arrays. We specifically use effective field theory\nmethods to study arrays assembled from Rydberg chains tuned to an Ising phase\ntransition that famously hosts emergent fermions propagating within each chain.\nThis highly entangled starting point allows us to naturally access spin liquids\nfamiliar from Kitaev's honeycomb model, albeit from an entirely different\nframework. In particular, we argue that finite-range repulsive Rydberg\ninteractions, which frustrate nearby symmetry-breaking orders, can enable\ncoherent propagation of emergent fermions between the chains in which they were\nborn. Delocalization of emergent fermions across the full two-dimensional\nRydberg array yields a gapless Z2 spin liquid with a single massless Dirac\ncone. Here, the Rydberg occupation numbers exhibit universal power-law\ncorrelations that provide a straightforward experimental diagnostic of this\nphase. We further show that explicitly breaking symmetries perturbs the gapless\nspin liquid into gapped, topologically ordered descendants: Breaking lattice\nsymmetries generates toric-code topological order, whereas introducing\nchirality generates non-Abelian Ising topological order. In the toric-code\nphase, we analytically construct microscopic incarnations of non-Abelian\ndefects, which can be created and transported by dynamically controlling the\natom positions in the array. Our work suggests that appropriately tuned Rydberg\narrays provide a cold-atoms counterpart of solid-state 'Kitaev materials' and,\nmore generally, spotlights a new angle for pursuing experimental platforms for\nAbelian and non-Abelian fractionalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Here, we study the most\nrepresentative cases regarding the scientific interest of KNe from binary\nneutron stars, and we evaluate the observational prospects and performance of\nMAAT on the GTC to do the following: a) study the impact of the equation of\nstate on the KN light curve, and determine to what extent bounds on neutron\nstar (NS) radii or compactness deriving from KN peak magnitudes can be\nidentified and b) measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with precision improved\nby up to 40$\\%$, when both gravitational wave data and photometric-light curves\nare used. In this context we discuss how the equation of state, the viewing\nangle, and the distance affect the precision and estimated value of $H_0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 23:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

As epidemiologic studies of mixtures can be expensive\nto conduct, it behooves researchers to incorporate prior knowledge about\nmixtures into their analyses. This work extends the Bayesian multiple index\nmodel (BMIM), which assumes the exposure-response function is a non-parametric\nfunction of a set of linear combinations of pollutants formed with a set of\nexposure-specific weights. The framework is attractive because it combines the\nflexibility of response-surface methods with the interpretability of linear\nindex models. We propose three strategies to incorporate prior toxicological\nknowledge into construction of indices in a BMIM: (a) constraining index\nweights, (b) structuring index weights by exposure transformations, and (c)\nplacing informative priors on the index weights. We propose a novel prior\nspecification that combines spike-and-slab variable selection with informative\nDirichlet distribution based on relative potency factors often derived from\nprevious toxicological studies. In simulations we show that the proposed priors\nimprove inferences when prior information is correct and can protect against\nmisspecification suffered by naive toxicological models when prior information\nis incorrect. Moreover, different strategies may be mixed-and-matched for\ndifferent indices to suit available information (or lack thereof). We\ndemonstrate the proposed methods on an analysis of data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey and incorporate prior information on\nrelative chemical potencies obtained from toxic equivalency factors available\nin the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 18:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

However, it is not known how\nsuch representation might help animals to manage uncertainty in their\ndecision-making. Existing methods for SR learning do not capture uncertainty\nabout the estimated SR.

First, Kalman temporal\ndifference approach, which is a combination of the Kalman filter and the\ntemporal difference method, is used within the AKF-SR framework to cast the SR\nlearning procedure into a filtering problem to benefit from the uncertainty\nestimation of the SR, and also decreases in memory requirement and sensitivity\nto model's parameters in comparison to deep neural network-based algorithms. An\nadaptive Kalman filtering approach is then applied within the proposed AKF-SR\nframework in order to tune the measurement noise covariance and measurement\nmapping function of Kalman filter as the most important parameters affecting\nthe filter's performance. Moreover, an active learning method that exploits the\nestimated uncertainty of the SR to form the behaviour policy leading to more\nvisits to less certain values is proposed to improve the overall performance of\nan agent in terms of received rewards while interacting with its environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 19:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery\nof new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to\nread and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings\nare a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular\nstring representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late\n1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several\nshortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid\nresults with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new\nlanguage for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\\% robustness:\nSELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings).

In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based,\nranked-choice election protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and\nscalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to cast their\nvotes via zero-knowledge proofs anonymously. Robustness is realized by removing\nthe direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using\ntimed-state machines. Results show that ElectAnon is scalable amongst existing\nworks as it reduces the gas consumption up to 89% compared to previous works.\nThe proposed protocol includes a candidate proposal system and swappable\ntallying libraries.

An alternative approach to\nmulti-trait GWAS is to reverse the functional relation between genotypes and\ntraits, by fitting a multivariate regression model to predict genotypes from\nmultiple traits simultaneously. However, current reverse genotype prediction\napproaches are mostly based on linear models. Here, we evaluated random forest\nregression (RFR) as a method to predict SNPs from imaging QTs and identify\nbiologically relevant associations.

The\neffect of the cosmological coupling $\\Lambda$ is accommodated within a possible\nbehaviour of $\\phi$. We analyze the dynamics of $\\phi$ in the phase space,\nthereby showing the existence of an attractor point for reasonable hypotheses\non the potential $V(\\phi)$ and no particular assumption on the Hubble function.\nThe phase space analysis is performed both with the linear stability theory and\nvia the more general Lyapunov's method. Either method lead to the conclusion\nthat the condition $\\dot{G}/G=\\sigma\\left(\\dot{c}/c\\right)$ where $\\sigma=3$\nmust hold for the rest of cosmic evolution after the system gets to the\nglobally asymptotically stable fixed point and the dynamics of $\\phi$ ceases.\nThis result provides a physical foundation for the phenomenological model\nadmitting $\\left(G/G_{0}\\right)=\\left(c/c_{0}\\right)^{3}$ used recently to\ninterpret cosmological and astrophysical data. The thus co-varying couplings\n$G$ and $c$ impact the cosmic evolution after the dynamical system settles to\nequilibrium. This impact is investigated by constructing the generalized\ncontinuity equation in our scalar-tensor model and considering two possible\nregimes for the varying speed of light -- decreasing $c(a)$ and increasing\n$c(a)$ -- while solving our modified Friedmann equations. The solutions to the\nlatter equations make room for radiation- and matter-dominated eras that\nprogress to a dark-energy-type of accelerated expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 22:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 22:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 22:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The four major\nsatellites have nearly circular, co-planar orbits and the ratio of the\nsatellite system and planetary mass resembles Jupiter's satellite system,\nsuggesting the Uranian system was similarly formed within a disk produced by\ngas co-accretion. However, Uranus is a retrograde rotator with a high\nobliquity. The satellites orbit in its highly tilted equatorial plane in the\nsame sense as the planet's retrograde rotation, a configuration that cannot be\nexplained by co-accretion alone. In this work we investigate the first stages\nof the co-accretion + giant impact scenario proposed by Morbidelli et al.\n(2012) for the origin of the Uranian system. In this model, a satellite system\nformed by co-accretion is destabilized by a giant impact that tilts the planet.\nThe primordial satellites collide and disrupt, creating an outer debris disk\nthat can re-orient to the planet's new equatorial plane and accrete into\nUranus' 4 major satellites. The needed reorientation out to distances\ncomparable to outermost Oberon requires that the impact creates an inner disk\nwith $\\ge 1\\%$ of Uranus' mass. We here simulate giant impacts that\nappropriately tilt the planet and leave the system with an angular momentum\ncomparable to that of the current system. We find that such impacts do not\nproduce inner debris disks massive enough to realign the outer debris disk to\nthe post-impact equatorial plane.

In order to optimize the\nperformance-cost trade-off, one would select features to observe a priori.\nHowever, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of\npredictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the\nchallenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic\nand light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before\nactually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle\nFDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight\nDynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature\nsubset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that\ncharacterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its\ncore is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent\non previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to\nobserve. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the\nperformance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice. Extensive results\ndemonstrate that VFDS selects different features under changing contexts,\nnotably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy.\nMoreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be\ninterpretable and associated with the different activity types.

It is particularly appealing because of its ability\nto leverage existing data. However, many practical problems call for\ndecision-making with some auxiliary information, and DRO in the context of\nconditional distribution is not straightforward. We propose a conditional\nkernel distributionally robust optimization (CKDRO) method that enables robust\ndecision making under conditional distributions through kernel DRO and the\nconditional mean operator in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In\nparticular, we consider problems where there is a correlation between the\nunknown variable y and an auxiliary observable variable x. Given past data of\nthe two variables and a queried auxiliary variable, CKDRO represents the\nconditional distribution P(y|x) as the conditional mean operator in the RKHS\nspace and quantifies the ambiguity set in the RKHS as well, which depends on\nthe size of the dataset as well as the query point. To justify the use of RKHS,\nwe demonstrate that the ambiguity set defined in RKHS can be viewed as a ball\nunder a metric that is similar to the Wasserstein metric. The DRO is then\ndualized and solved via a finite dimensional convex program. The proposed CKDRO\napproach is applied to a generation scheduling problem and shows that the\nresult of CKDRO is superior to common benchmarks in terms of quality and\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 23:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Over the\npast several years, researchers in academia and industry used machine learning\n(ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for\ncomputer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets collected by various\norganizations to train ML models for predicting intrusions. In many of the\ndatasets used in such systems, data are imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have\nequal amount of samples). With unbalanced data, the predictive models developed\nusing ML algorithms may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect\naccuracy in predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used\nover-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome\nthis problem.

Our experimental\nsetting of driven nonlinear oscillators coupled via a programmable switch\nmatrix leads to a unique energy minimizer when one such exists, and probes\nfrustration where appropriate. Theoretical modeling of the electronic\noscillators and their couplings allows us to accurately reproduce the\nqualitative features of the experimental results.

Recently, low-latency provenance\nembedding algorithms have received traction in vehicular networks owing to\nstrict deadlines on the delivery of packets. While existing low-latency\nprovenance embedding methods focus on reducing the packet delay, they assume a\ncomplete graph on the underlying topology due to the mobility of the\nparticipating nodes. We identify that the complete graph assumption leads to\nsub-optimal performance in provenance recovery, especially when the vehicular\nnetwork is sparse, which is usually observed outside peak-hour traffic\nconditions. As a result, we propose a two-part approach to design provenance\nembedding algorithms for sparse vehicular networks.

We derive tight upper bounds on the performance of our strategies,\nand show that the derived bounds, when optimized with appropriate constraints,\ndeliver design parameters that outperform existing methods.

NSGA-II is used for finding\nthe \\textit{pareto optimal front} for the NAS problem and the best architecture\nin the pareto front is returned as the searched architecture. Exerimentally,\nNEvoNAS gives better results on 2 different search spaces while using\nsignificantly less computational resources as compared to previous EA-based\nmethods.

Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or\nlarger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar\nFocus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different\nfrom the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a\nspecific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view.\nAccordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one\nwith the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such\nlinear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening\nangle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to\nthe scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable\nEFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field\ncan be reconstructed by compensating the \"missing EFS lines\" given a sparse\nlight field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially\nin the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity.

We propose a hybrid\ncontroller that switches from attitude to position control to allow the robot\nto fall horizontally and recover to the original position.

Our general idea is firstly assuming a causal\ngraph underlying item correlations, and then we learn the causal graph jointly\nwith the sequential recommender model by fitting the real user behavior data.\nMore specifically, in order to satisfy the causality requirement, the causal\ngraph is regularized by a differentiable directed acyclic constraint.\nConsidering that the number of items in recommender systems can be very large,\nwe represent different items with a unified set of latent clusters, and the\ncausal graph is defined on the cluster level, which enhances the model\nscalability and robustness.

In a recent study by Muramulla $et.al.^1$, a discontinuous\ndecrease of turbulence intensity is observed in a vertical particle-laden\nturbulent channel-flow for a critical volume fraction O($10^{-3}$). The\ncollapse of turbulent intensity is found out to be a result of catastrophic\nreduction of turbulent energy production rate. Mechanistically, particle-fluid\ncoupling in particle-laden turbulent Couette-flow differs from that in a closed\nchannel flow. In this article, the turbulence modulation in Couette-flow by\ninertial particles is explored through two-way coupled DNS where particle\nvolume fraction ($\\phi$) is varied from $1.75\\times10^{-4}$ to\n$1.05\\times10^{-3}$ and Reynolds Number based on half-channel width ($\\delta$)\nand wall velocity ($U$) ($Re_{\\delta}$) is $750$.

In\nthis work, we revisit this phenomenon using \\emph{in situ} analysis of a model\nsteel-abrasive contact geometry, complemented by analytical calculations. It is\nfound that the temperature within the contact zone, for typical contact\nconditions used, is far from the melting point and that spherical particles do\nnot form in the absence of oxygen. We thereby propose a modification of the\nmelting-resolidification hypothesis, involving an intermediate exothermic\noxidation stage, and provide quantitative evidence for each step of the\nprocess. Our results have implications for a wide class of abrasive systems\nthat involve the formation and utilization of spherical metallic particles\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 05:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

We present results from a suite of GRMHD simulations of\naccreting neutron stars for dipole, quadrupole, and quadrudipolar stellar field\ngeometries. This is a first step towards simulating realistic hotspot shapes in\na general relativistic framework to understand hotspot variability in accreting\nmillisecond pulsars. We find that the location and size of the accretion\ncolumns resulting in hotspots changes significantly depending on initial\nstellar field strength and geometry. We also find that the strongest\ncontributions to the stellar torque are from disk-connected fieldlines and the\npulsar wind, leading to spin-down in almost all of the parameter regime\nexplored here. We further analyze angular momentum transport in the accretion\ndisk due to large scale magnetic stresses, turbulent stresses, wind- and\ncompressible effects which we identify with convective motions. The disk\ncollimates the initial open stellar flux forming jets. For dipoles, the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction can either enhance or reduce jet power compared\nto the isolated case. However for quadrupoles, the disk always leads to an\nenhanced net open flux making the jet power comparable to the dipolar case. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of observed neutron star jets and provide a\nviable mechanism to explain radio power both in the low- and high-magnetic\nfield case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 07:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Existing OpenQA systems might suffer from\nthe issues of question complexity and ambiguity, as well as insufficient\nbackground knowledge. Recently, conversational OpenQA is proposed to address\nthese issues with the abundant contextual information in the conversation.\nPromising as it might be, there exist several fundamental limitations including\nthe inaccurate question understanding, the coarse ranking for passage\nselection, and the inconsistent usage of golden passage in the training and\ninference phases. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose a\nframework with Multifaceted Improvements for Conversational open-domain\nQuestion Answering (MICQA).

Noisy features and\ninappropriate embedding dimension assignments can impair the performance of\nrecommender systems and introduce unnecessary complexity in model training and\nonline serving. Optimizing the input configuration of DNN models, including\nfeature selection and embedding dimension assignment, has become one of the\nessential topics in feature engineering. Typically, feature selection and\nembedding dimension search are optimized sequentially, i.e., feature selection\nis performed first, followed by embedding dimension search to determine the\noptimal dimension size for each selected feature. In contrast, this paper\nstudies the joint optimization of feature selection and embedding dimension\nsearch. To this end, we propose a differentiable neural \\textbf{i}nput\n\\textbf{razor}, namely \\textbf{i-Razor}. Specifically, inspired by recent\nadvances in neural architecture search, we introduce an end-to-end\ndifferentiable model to learn the relative importance between different\nembedding regions of each feature. Furthermore, a flexible pruning algorithm is\nproposed to simultaneously achieve feature filtering and dimension size\nderivation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets in the\nClick-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction task demonstrate the efficacy and\nsuperiority of i-Razor in balancing model complexity and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 08:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e.,\nit is not limited to a particular application and can be used to solve\ndifferent types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of\na planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard\nclassical planning formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance\nof many of these extensions is well known, most planners, especially optimal\nplanners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The lack of\nsupport not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but\neven if it is possible to model the problems without these extensions, it often\nleads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling practically impossible\nas the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.\n  In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning\nfor different expressive extensions of classical planning, all capturing\ndifferent aspects of the problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms,\nplanning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and\ntop-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability\nresults, highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively\nsupport the corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search and\nshow that the search performance does not always benefit from the use of a\nheuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even\nunder the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic.

To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods\nhave been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However,\none common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task\nselection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary\ntasks close to the target task.

The actual ionic bulk density is determined by means of the impedance\nspectroscopy technique using two approaches for the data analysis: A first\napproach scrutinizing the real part's plateau of the cell's electric impedance\nspectrum versus the bulk density of dopant when the impedance is written in the\nseries representation. A second one via extraction of the ionic density from\nsimultaneously fitting of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance\nspectrum by using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model. The validity of this\nprocedure reposes on the hypothesis that both the diffusion coefficient and the\ndielectric constant are independent from the salt concentration in the explored\nrange of concentrations.

Actual causality focuses on\nspecific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical\nin realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is\ncomplementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents)\nare responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under\na widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under\nuncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes\n(Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between\nPOMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection\nbetween Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language\nfor describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions\nof actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known\ndefinitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel\ndefinition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between\nagents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual\ncausality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is\nimportant to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent\nparticipates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of\nresponsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of\nresponsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting\nfor the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based\nexperiment, we compare different definitions of actual causality and\nresponsibility attribution methods. The empirical results demonstrate the\nqualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual causality\nand their impact on attributed responsibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 09:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 11:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

However, compared with the\nmethods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved\nbetter performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit\nthe intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically\nsummarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression\ntasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to\nthe ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the\nprobabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of\ndistance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third,\nthe label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct\nfor different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of\ndifficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a\nnovel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely\nunimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the\nlearning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal.\nFurthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted\ndistribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed\nconcentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the\nground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive\nexperimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head\npose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated\nloss compared with existing loss functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 09:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

In\npractice, the experimenter needs to know all past outcomes at the end of the\nexperiment, and that requires the presence of probes carrying the corresponding\nrecords. In this picture a composite system+probes can be seen to undergo an\nunbroken unitary evolution until the end of the trial, where the state of the\nprobes is examined. For these two descriptions to agree one requires a\nparticular type of coupling between a probe and the system, which we discuss in\nsome details. With this in mind, we consider two different ways to extend the\ndescription of a quantum system's past beyond what is actually measured and\nrecorded. One is to look for quantities whose values can be ascertained without\naltering the existing probabilities. Such \"elements of reality\" can be found,\nyet they suffer from the same drawback as their EPR counterparts. The probes\ndesigned to measure non-commuting operators frustrate each other if set up to\nwork jointly, so no simultaneous values of such quantities can be established\nconsistently. The other possibility is to investigate the system's response to\nweekly coupled probes. Such weak probes are shown either to reduce to a small\nfraction the number of cases where the corresponding values are still\naccurately measured, or lead only to the evaluation of the system's probability\namplitudes, or their combinations. It is difficult, we conclude, to see in\nquantum mechanics anything other than a formalism for predicting the\nlikelihoods of the recorded outcomes of actually performed observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 10:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Their performances are often\nconstrained by the extremely sparse user-item interactions, unavailable side\ninformation, or very limited domain-shared users.

Unlike pointwise (node-to-surface or point-to-surface)\ncontact algorithms in the Galerkin framework, the CCS formulation passes the\ncontact patch test to machine precision by naturally exploiting the favorable\nproperties of isogeometric collocation. Compared with approaches where the\ndiscretization of both bulk and contact surfaces is based on collocation, the\nCCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly\nnon-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS\nalgorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing\nisogeometric analysis code with minimal effort.

We report measurements of\nsurface-average magnetic fields in 292 M dwarfs from a comparison with\nradiative transfer calculations; for 260 of them, this is the first measurement\nof this kind. Our data were obtained from more than 15,000 high-resolution\nspectra taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation between\naverage field strength, <B>, and Rossby number, $Ro$, resembling the\nwell-studied rotation-activity relation. Among the slowly rotating stars, we\nfind that magnetic flux, $\\Phi_\\textrm{B}$, is proportional to rotation period,\n$P$, and among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do not\ngrow significantly beyond the level set by the available kinetic energy.\nFurthermore, we find close relations between nonthermal coronal X-ray emission,\nchromospheric H$\\alpha$ and Ca H&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together,\nthese relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity relation can\nbe traced back to a dependence of the magnetic dynamo on rotation. We advocate\nthe picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar\nsurface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the\navailable kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average field strengths\nand nonthermal emission that are independent of the choice of the convective\nturnover time. We also find that Ca H&K emission saturates at average field\nstrengths of $\\langle B \\rangle \\approx 800$ G while H$\\alpha$ and X-ray\nemission grow further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars.\nThis is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario predicting that in the\nmost rapidly rotating stars coronal plasma would be cooled to chromospheric\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 10:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}

The results of a storage and\ngeneration optimal expansion model with network effects for spatiotemporally\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous load profiles are compared. A case study is\nperformed using a 3-bus network of London, Manchester, and Glasgow in Britain\nfor load and weather data for representative weeks. Using heterogeneous heating\ndemand data changes storage sizing: under a business-as-usual budget, 26% more\ntotal storage is built on an energy and power basis, and this storage is\ndistributed among all of the buses in the heterogeneous case. Under a\nlow-carbon budget, total energy storage at all buses increases 2 times on an\nenergy basis and 40% on a power basis. The energy to power ratio of storage at\neach bus also increases when accounting for heterogeneity; this change suggests\nthat storage will be needed to provide energy support in addition to power\nsupport for electric heating in high-renewable power systems. Accounting for\nheterogeneity also increases modeled systems costs, particularly capital costs,\nbecause of the need for higher generation capacity in the largest load center\nand coincidence of local peak demand at different buses.

While this modification in fact\nsuccessfully tackles both drawbacks of the Dirichlet-Neumann approach, the\nprice to be paid is a strong dependency on the Robin weighting parameter, with\nvery limited a priori knowledge about good choices. This work proposes a\nstrategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths.\nThe resulting quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-Neumann scheme is compared to both\nRobin- and Dirichlet-Neumann variants. The numerical tests demonstrate that it\ndoes not only provide faster convergence, but also massively reduces the\ninfluence of the Robin parameter, mitigating the main drawback of the\nRobin-Neumann algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 11:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 07:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually\nremoves weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a\nsmaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly\nreduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation.\nHowever, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are\nexpensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning\nmethod CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly\nparallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both\naccuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight\nis to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads\nand hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each\nparameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise\ndistillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models\nduring optimization.

In order\nto push performance further, it is therefore crucial to account for noise when\nperforming the identification. To address this problem, this paper proposes the\nuse of a forward system identification using (PG)NNs from noisy data.\nAfterwards, two methods are proposed for inverting PGNNs to design a\nfeedforward controller for high-precision motion control. The developed\nmethodology is validated on a real-life industrial linear motor, where it\nshowed significant improvements in tracking performance with respect to the\ndirect inverse identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 13:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 4, a zero-shot adaptive TTS\nsystem for high-quality speech synthesis. We model the speaker characteristics\nsystematically to improve the generalization on new speakers. Generally, the\nmodeling of speaker characteristics can be categorized into three steps:\nextracting speaker representation, taking this speaker representation as\ncondition, and synthesizing speech/mel-spectrogram given this speaker\nrepresentation. Accordingly, we improve the modeling in three steps: 1) To\nextract speaker representation with better generalization, we factorize the\nspeaker characteristics into basis vectors and extract speaker representation\nby weighted combining of these basis vectors through attention. 2) We leverage\nconditional layer normalization to integrate the extracted speaker\nrepresentation to TTS model. 3) We propose a novel supervision loss based on\nthe distribution of basis vectors to maintain the corresponding speaker\ncharacteristics in generated mel-spectrograms.

With the rapid development of internet technology and big data\nscience, a large amount of data are expressed as signals defined on graphs. In\norder to establish the theory of filtering, windowed Fourier transform and\nwavelet transform in the setting of graph signals, we need to extend the shift\noperation of classical signals to graph signals.\n  It is a fundamental problem since the vertex set of a graph is usually not a\nvector space and the addition operation cannot be defined on the vertex set of\nthe graph. In this paper, based on our understanding on the core role of shift\noperation in classical signal processing we propose the concept of atomic\nfilters, which can be viewed as a weak form of the shift operator for graph\nsignals.

The property of real-preserving\nholds naturally in the classical signal processing, but no the research has\nbeen reported on this topic in the graph signal setting. With these conditions\nwe propose the concept of normal atomic filters for graph signals, which\ndegenerates into the classical shift operator under mild conditions if the\ngraph is circulant.

Finally, as an application, atomic filters are\nutilized to construct time-frequency atoms which constitute a frame of the\ngraph signal space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 14:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

However, the interpretation of SCLC measurements for\nmetal-halide perovskites is problematic due to mobile ionic defects which\nredistribute to screen electrostatic fields in devices during measurements. To\novercome this, an SCLC measurement protocol was recently suggested that\nminimises ionic charge redistribution by probing the current during millisecond\nvoltage pulses superimposed on a background bias. Here, we use drift-diffusion\nsimulations with mobile ions to assess the validity of the MG law for analysing\nboth the standard and new protocol JV measurements. We simulated idealised\nperovskite devices with differing mobile ion densities and compared them with\nsimulations and measurements of devices with typical contact materials. We\nfound the validity region for the MG law is limited to perovskites with mobile\nion densities lower than the device's equilibrium charge carrier density\n(<10^17 cm-3 for 400 nm thick methylammonium lead iodide films) and contacts\nwith injection/extraction barriers <=0.1 eV. The latter limitation can be\npartially overcome by increasing the device thickness, whereas the former\nlimitation cannot. This restricts the range of perovskite layer compositions\nand viable contact materials that can be reliably analysed with the MG law.\nApproaches such as estimating trap densities from the apparent voltage onset to\ntrap-free SCLC regime should also be critically reviewed since they rely on the\nsame potentially invalid assumptions as the MG law. Our results demonstrate\nthat extracting meaningful and accurate values for metal halide perovskite\nmaterial properties from SCLC maybe challenging, or often not possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 14:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

In this paper, a novel\ntopology-optimized federated edge learning (TOFEL) scheme is proposed to tackle\nthe heterogeneity issue in federated learning and to improve the\ncommunication-and-computation efficiency. Specifically, a problem of jointly\noptimizing the aggregation topology and computing speed is formulated to\nminimize the weighted summation of energy consumption and latency. To solve the\nmixed-integer nonlinear problem, we propose a novel solution method of\npenalty-based successive convex approximation, which converges to a stationary\npoint of the primal problem under mild conditions. To facilitate real-time\ndecision making, an imitation-learning based method is developed, where deep\nneural networks (DNNs) are trained offline to mimic the penalty-based method,\nand the trained imitation DNNs are deployed at the edge devices for online\ninference. Thereby, an efficient imitate-learning based approach is seamlessly\nintegrated into the TOFEL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed TOFEL scheme accelerates the federated learning process, and achieves\na higher energy efficiency.

Because distribution networks\ninclude a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such\nas individual consumers, transformer stations and feeders loads, it is\nimpractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for\neach load separately. Furthermore, such local models ignore the strong\ndependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial\nproximity and the characteristics of the distribution network. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a global modeling approach based on deep learning\nfor efficient forecasting of a large number of loads in distribution networks.\nIn this way, the computational burden of training a large amount of local\nforecasting models can be largely reduced, and the cross-series information\nshared among different loads can be utilized. Additionally, an unsupervised\nlocalization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also\nproposed to localize/personalize the forecasting model to different groups of\nloads and to improve the forecasting accuracy further.

Existing clique model mainly focuses on unsigned networks.\nHowever, in real world, many applications are modeled as signed networks with\npositive and negative edges. As the signed networks hold their own properties\ndifferent from the unsigned networks, the existing clique model is inapplicable\nfor the signed networks. Motivated by this, we propose the balanced clique\nmodel that considers the most fundamental and dominant theory, structural\nbalance theory, for signed networks. Following the balanced clique model, we\nstudy the maximal balanced clique enumeration problem (MBCE) which computes all\nthe maximal balanced cliques in a given signed network and the maximum balanced\nclique search problem (MBCS) which computes the balanced clique with maximum\nsize. We show that MBCE problem and MBCS problem are both NP-Hard. For the MBCE\nproblem, a straightforward solution is to treat the signed network as two\nunsigned networks and leverage the off-the-shelf techniques for unsigned\nnetworks. However, such a solution is inefficient for large signed networks. To\naddress this problem, in this paper, we first propose a new maximal balanced\nclique enumeration algorithm by exploiting the unique properties of signed\nnetworks. Based on the new proposed algorithm, we devise two optimization\nstrategies to further improve the efficiency of the enumeration. For the MBCS\nproblem, we propose a new search framework based on search space partition. To\nfurther improve the efficiency of the new framework, we propose multiple\noptimization strategies regarding to redundant search branches and invalid\ncandidates. We conduct extensive experiments on large real datasets.

However, existing few LDP\nstudies over streams are either applicable to finite streams only or suffering\nfrom insufficient protection. This paper investigates this problem by proposing\nLDP-IDS, a novel $w$-event LDP paradigm to provide practical privacy guarantee\nfor infinite streams at users end, and adapting the popular budget division\nframework in centralized differential privacy (CDP). By constructing a unified\nerror analysi for LDP, we first develop two adatpive budget division-based LDP\nmethods for LDP-IDS that can enhance data utility via leveraging the\nnon-deterministic sparsity in streams.

We here focus on the properties of the extended\nemission line regions (EELRs) that can be studied with unprecedented detail\nthanks to the depth of these observations. Line emission in the 10 FRIs is, in\nmost cases, confined to within <4 kpc, while large-scale (>4 kpc) ionized gas\nis seen in all but two of the 26 FRIIs. It usually takes the form of elongated\nor filamentary structures, typically extending between 10 and 30 kpc, but also\nreaching distances of ~80 kpc. We find that 1) the large-scale ionized gas\nstructures show a tendency to be oriented at large angles from the radio axis,\nand 2) the gas on a scale of a few kpc from the nucleus often shows ordered\nrotation with a kinematical axis forming a median angle of 65 degrees with the\nradio axis. We also discuss the velocity field and ionization properties of the\nEELRs. The observed emission line structures appear to be associated with\ngaseous \"superdisks\" formed after a gas rich merger. The different properties\nof the EELR can be explained with a combination of the source evolutionary\nstate and the orientation of the \"superdisk\" with respect to the radio axis.\nThe general alignment between the superdisks and radio axis might be produced\nby stable and coherent accretion maintained over long timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 15:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

In this paper, an exact MSE expression for implicitly defined estimators\nwith a symmetric and unimodal objective function is given.

It usually requires to incorporate the sensitive attribute\nlabels as prediction targets. However, in many scenarios the sensitive\nattribute labels of many samples can be unknown, and it is difficult to train a\nstrong discriminator based on the scarce data with observed attribute labels,\nwhich may lead to generate unfair representations. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-supervised fair representation learning approach based on adversarial\nvariational autoencoder, which can reduce the dependency of adversarial fair\nmodels on data with labeled sensitive attributes. More specifically, we use a\nbias-aware model to capture inherent bias information on sensitive attribute by\naccurately predicting sensitive attributes from input data, and we use a\nbias-free model to learn debiased fair representations by using adversarial\nlearning to remove bias information from them. The hidden representations\nlearned by the two models are regularized to be orthogonal. In addition, the\nsoft labels predicted by the two models are further integrated into a\nsemi-supervised variational autoencoder to reconstruct the input data, and we\napply an additional entropy regularization to encourage the attribute labels\ninferred from the bias-free model to be high-entropy. In this way, the\nbias-aware model can better capture attribute information while the bias-free\nmodel is less discriminative on sensitive attributes if the input data is well\nreconstructed. Extensive experiments on two datasets for different tasks\nvalidate that our approach can achieve good representation learning fairness\nunder limited data with sensitive attribute labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 15:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Benifiting\nfrom this characteristic, FR is commonly considered fairly secured. However, we\nargue that there is still possible and necessary security improvement could be\nmade in FR. To prove our opinion, in this paper we present FedRecAttack, a\nmodel poisoning attack to FR aiming to raise the exposure ratio of target\nitems. In most recommendation scenarios, apart from private user-item\ninteractions (e.g., clicks, watches and purchases), some interactions are\npublic (e.g., likes, follows and comments). Motivated by this point, in\nFedRecAttack we make use of the public interactions to approximate users'\nfeature vectors, thereby attacker can generate poisoned gradients accordingly\nand control malicious users to upload the poisoned gradients in a well-designed\nway. To evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of FedRecAttack, we conduct\nextensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different sizes from two\ncompletely different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed FedRecAttack achieves the state-of-the-art effectiveness while its\nside effects are negligible. Moreover, even with small proportion (3%) of\nmalicious users and small proportion (1%) of public interactions, FedRecAttack\nremains highly effective, which reveals that FR is more vulnerable to attack\nthan people commonly considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 05:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 10:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

Statistical variations in circuit outcomes that arise from\nill-characterized fluctuations in device noise may lead to computational errors\nand irreproducible results. While device characterization offers a direct\nassessment of noise, an outstanding concern is how such metrics bound the\nreproducibility of a given quantum circuit. Here, we first directly assess the\nreproducibility of a noisy quantum circuit, in terms of the Hellinger distance\nbetween the computational results, and then we show that device\ncharacterization offers an analytic bound on the observed variability.

In conjunction with the Alcock-Paczy\\'nski (AP)\neffect, which arises from the changing ratio of angular to spatial/redshift\nsize of (presumed) spherically-symmetric source distributions with distance,\nthe BAO measurement is viewed as one of the most powerful tools to use in\nassessing the geometry of the Universe. In this paper, we employ five BAO peak\nmeasurements from the final release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, at\naverage redshifts <z>=0.38, 0.51, 0.70, 1.48 and 2.33, to carry out a direct\nhead-to-head comparison of the standard model, Lambda-CDM, and one of its\nprincipal competitors, known as the R_h=ct universe. For completeness, we\ncomplement the AP diagnostic with a volume-averaged distance probe that assumes\na constant comoving distance scale r_d. Both probes are free of uncertain\nparameters, such as the Hubble constant, and are therefore ideally suited for\nthis kind of model selection. We find that R_h=ct is favored by these\nmeasurements over the standard model based solely on the AP effect, with a\nlikelihood ~75% versus ~25%, while Planck-Lambda-CDM is favored over R_h=ct\nbased solely on the volume-averaged distance probe, with a likelihood ~80%\nversus ~20%. A joint analysis using both probes produces an inconclusive\noutcome, yielding comparable likelihoods to both models. We are therefore not\nable to confirm with this work that the BAO data, on their own, support an\naccelerating Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 12:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 12:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

Objects with masses of at least 10^4 solar could be formed for\ninefficient radiative feedback, whereas ~10^3 solar mass objects could be\nformed when the accretion time is limited via feedback. These masses will vary\ndepending on the environment and could be considerably larger, particularly due\nto the continuous infall of gas into the cloud. As a result, one may form\nintermediate mass black holes of ~ 10^4 solar masses or more.

To overcome the above challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end\nzero-shot HOI Detection (EoID) framework via vision-language knowledge\ndistillation. We first design an Interactive Score module combined with a\nTwo-stage Bipartite Matching algorithm to achieve interaction distinguishment\nfor human-object pairs in an action-agnostic manner.

Our study contributes to a growing body of literature using passive\nobservations to explore who benefits from access to nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 13:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

The new version\ntypically runs with 75\\% more throughput than the previous version, which we\nattribute to improved multithreading. We provide lessons and recommendations\nfor other digital forensics tool maintainers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 17:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}
