In this paper, we present a new advanced numerical model to simulate\nthe wave-induced response of a floating structure that is moored in an\narbitrary nearshore region. The model is based on the non-hydrostatic approach,\nand implemented in the open-source model SWASH, which provides an efficient\nnumerical framework to simulate the nonlinear wave evolution over variable\nbottom topographies. The model is extended with a solution to the rigid body\nthat is tightly coupled to the hydrodynamic equations. The model was validated\nfor two test cases that consider different floating structures of increasing\ngeometrical complexity: a cylindrical geometry that is representative of a\nwave-energy-converter, and a vessel with a more complex shaped hull. A range of\nwave conditions were considered, varying from monochromatic to short-crested\nsea states. Model predictions of the excitation forces, added mass, radiation\ndamping, and the wave-induced response agreed well with benchmark solutions to\nthe potential flow equations. Besides the response to the primary wave\n(sea-swell) components, the model was also able to capture the second-order\ndifference-frequency forcing and response of the moored vessel. Importantly,\nthe model captured the wave-induced response with a relatively coarse vertical\nresolution, allowing for applications at the scale of a realistic harbour or\ncoastal region. The proposed model thereby provides a new tool to seamlessly\nsimulate the nonlinear evolution of waves over complex bottom topography and\nthe wave-induced response of a floating structure that is moored in coastal\nwaters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Such mixing may give rise to\nnon-trivial effects that are different from the Standard Model predictions. We\norganize our discussions based on two scenarios, roughly depending on whether\nan interference between oscillation and decay occurs, or whether the\nnew-physics effects associated with the $n$-$\\eta$ mixing contribute to the\nabsorptive mixing amplitude. If an oscillation process is not accompanied by an\ninterference between oscillation and decay, or the new-physics interactions do\nnot contribute to the absorptive mixing amplitude, such a process can be\nclassified as pure oscillation. Otherwise, it can be classified as impure\noscillation. In the scenario of pure oscillation, CP-violation arising from the\nMajorana phase can manifest itself through the $n$-$\\bar{n}$ oscillation\nprocess and may lead to observable effects.

Specifically, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to\ncompress the channel into a latent space with adaptive dimensionality. To\nquantize this compressed channel, the feedback bits are smartly allocated to\nthe latent space dimensions by minimizing the normalized mean squared error\n(NMSE) distortion. Finally, the quantization codebook is determined with\nk-means clustering. Numerical simulations show that our strategy improves the\nzero-forcing beamforming sum rate by 17%, compared to CsiNetPro.

Provider-fair and -biased\nnews representations are learned from news content and provider IDs\nrespectively, which are further aggregated to build fair and biased user\nrepresentations based on user click history. All of these representations are\nused in model training while only fair representations are used for user-news\nmatching to achieve fair news recommendation.

The DFT approach is based on statistical analysis of\nsmall-size solid-liquid coexistence MD simulations. It eliminates the risk of\nmetastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also\nsignificantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional\nlarge-scale coexistence method. Being both accurate and efficient (at the speed\nof several days per material), it is considered as one of the best methods for\ndirect DFT melting temperature calculation.

This paper presents\nCholecTriplet2021: an endoscopic vision challenge organized at MICCAI 2021 for\nthe recognition of surgical action triplets in laparoscopic videos. The\nchallenge granted private access to the large-scale CholecT50 dataset, which is\nannotated with action triplet information. In this paper, we present the\nchallenge setup and assessment of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods\nproposed by the participants during the challenge. A total of 4 baseline\nmethods from the challenge organizers and 19 new deep learning algorithms by\ncompeting teams are presented to recognize surgical action triplets directly\nfrom surgical videos, achieving mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 4.2%\nto 38.1%. This study also analyzes the significance of the results obtained by\nthe presented approaches, performs a thorough methodological comparison between\nthem, in-depth result analysis, and proposes a novel ensemble method for\nenhanced recognition. Our analysis shows that surgical workflow analysis is not\nyet solved, and also highlights interesting directions for future research on\nfine-grained surgical activity recognition which is of utmost importance for\nthe development of AI in surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 18:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 20:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Existing\nmethods often treat this problem as cross-view image retrieval, and use learned\ndeep features to match the ground-level query image to a partition (eg, a small\npatch) of the satellite map. By these methods, the localization accuracy is\nlimited by the partitioning density of the satellite map (often in the order of\ntens meters). Departing from the conventional wisdom of image retrieval, this\npaper presents a novel solution that can achieve highly-accurate localization.\nThe key idea is to formulate the task as pose estimation and solve it by\nneural-net based optimization. Specifically, we design a two-branch {CNN} to\nextract robust features from the ground and satellite images, respectively. To\nbridge the vast cross-view domain gap, we resort to a Geometry Projection\nmodule that projects features from the satellite map to the ground-view, based\non a relative camera pose. Aiming to minimize the differences between the\nprojected features and the observed features, we employ a differentiable\nLevenberg-Marquardt ({LM}) module to search for the optimal camera pose\niteratively. The entire pipeline is differentiable and runs end-to-end.\nExtensive experiments on standard autonomous vehicle localization datasets have\nconfirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Notably, e.g., starting from\na coarse estimate of camera location within a wide region of 40m x 40m, with an\n80% likelihood our method quickly reduces the lateral location error to be\nwithin 5m on a new KITTI cross-view dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 19:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 12:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Using a multimodal approach,\nthis exchange interaction is measured in MnBi2Te4, the first realized intrinsic\nmagnetic topological insulator. Interrogating nonequilibrium spin dynamics,\nitinerant bands are found to exhibit a strong exchange coupling to localized Mn\nspins. Momentum-resolved ultrafast electron scattering and magneto-optic\nmeasurements reveal that itinerant spins disorder via electron-phonon\nscattering at picosecond timescales.

To guarantee a robust connection between these two worlds, DTs\nshould maintain accurate representations of the physical applications, while\npreserving synchronization between real and digital entities. In this paper, a\nnovel edge continual learning framework is proposed to accurately model the\nevolving affinity between a physical twin (PT) and its corresponding cyber twin\n(CT) while maintaining their utmost synchronization. In particular, a CT is\nsimulated as a deep neural network (DNN) at the wireless network edge to model\nan autonomous vehicle traversing an episodically dynamic environment. As the\nvehicular PT updates its driving policy in each episode, the CT is required to\nconcurrently adapt its DNN model to the PT, which gives rise to a\nde-synchronization gap. Considering the history-aware nature of DTs, the model\nupdate process is posed a dual objective optimization problem whose goal is to\njointly minimize the loss function over all encountered episodes and the\ncorresponding de-synchronization time. As the de-synchronization time continues\nto increase over sequential episodes, an elastic weight consolidation (EWC)\ntechnique that regularizes the DT history is proposed to limit\nde-synchronization time. Furthermore, to address the plasticity-stability\ntradeoff accompanying the progressive growth of the EWC regularization terms, a\nmodified EWC method that considers fair execution between the historical\nepisodes of the DTs is adopted. Ultimately, the proposed framework achieves a\nsimultaneously accurate and synchronous CT model that is robust to catastrophic\nforgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve an\naccuracy of 90 % while guaranteeing a minimal desynchronization time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 23:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In\nthis work, we present a simple yet effective framework, DualPrompt, which\nlearns a tiny set of parameters, called prompts, to properly instruct a\npre-trained model to learn tasks arriving sequentially without buffering past\nexamples. DualPrompt presents a novel approach to attach complementary prompts\nto the pre-trained backbone, and then formulates the objective as learning\ntask-invariant and task-specific \"instructions\". With extensive experimental\nvalidation, DualPrompt consistently sets state-of-the-art performance under the\nchallenging class-incremental setting. In particular, DualPrompt outperforms\nrecent advanced continual learning methods with relatively large buffer sizes.\nWe also introduce a more challenging benchmark, Split ImageNet-R, to help\ngeneralize rehearsal-free continual learning research.

In this work, we study\npre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end\nmanner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and\nsemantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision,\npre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these\nconstraints or are semantically incoherent.

Self-adaptive MR approaches\nhave been proposed but they tend to be brittle: Sometimes they decay the MR to\nzero, thus halting evolution. To make self-adaptive MR robust, this paper\nintroduces the Group Elite Selection of Mutation Rates (GESMR) algorithm. GESMR\nco-evolves a population of solutions and a population of MRs, such that each MR\nis assigned to a group of solutions. The resulting best mutational change in\nthe group, instead of average mutational change, is used for MR selection\nduring evolution, thus avoiding the vanishing MR problem. With the same number\nof function evaluations and with almost no overhead, GESMR converges faster and\nto better solutions than previous approaches on a wide range of continuous test\noptimization problems. GESMR also scales well to high-dimensional\nneuroevolution for supervised image-classification tasks and for reinforcement\nlearning control tasks. Remarkably, GESMR produces MRs that are optimal in the\nlong-term, as demonstrated through a comprehensive look-ahead grid search.\nThus, GESMR and its theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate how\nself-adaptation can be harnessed to improve performance in several applications\nof evolutionary computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 01:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

This paper\nproposes a new dimension reduction framework based on rotated multi-fidelity\nGaussian process regression and a Bayesian active learning scheme when the\navailable precise observations are insufficient. By drawing samples from the\ntrained rotated multi-fidelity model, the so-called supervised dimension\nreduction problems can be solved following the idea of the sliced average\nvariance estimation (SAVE) method combined with a Gaussian process regression\ndimension reduction technique.

Previously studied drifting and driftless second sound are two\nlimiting cases of the theory, corresponding to the drift and diffusive part of\nthe energy flux, respectively. We find that due to the presence of quadratic\nflexural phonons the drifting second sound does not exist in the thermodynamic\nlimit, while the driftless mode is less affected. This is understood as a\nresult of infinite effective inertia of flexual phonons, due to their constant\ndensity states and divergent Bose-Einstein distribution in the long wave length\nlimit. Consequently, the group velocity of the drifting mode is smaller than\nthat of the driftless mode. However, upon tensile strain, the velocity of\ndrifting mode becomes larger. Both of them increase with tensile strain due to\nthe linearization of the flexural phonon dispersion. Our results clarify\nseveral puzzles encountered previously and pave the way for exploring wave-like\nheat transport beyond hydrodynamic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 03:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

One\nof the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only\nobtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point\nobservations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently,\nmodeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and\ndynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories\nfrom a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is\ndeterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially\nrandom yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to\npoint B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of\nleast action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value.\nTo satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the\nLagrangian Schr\\\"odinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it\napproximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized\nneural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster\ncomputation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for\nhigh-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the\nLagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 03:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 10:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 13:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 11:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 02:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Here we use published ab initio\ncalculations of the static electrical response tensors of the H2 molecule to\nconstruct the perturbed rovibrational eigensystem and its ground state\nabsorptions. We restrict attention to two simple field configurations that are\nrelevant to condensed hydrogen molecules in the interstellar medium: a uniform\nelectric field, and the field of a point-like charge. The energy eigenstates\nare mixtures of vibrational and angular momentum eigenstates so there are many\ntransitions that satisfy the dipole selection rules. We find that mixing is\nstrongest amongst the states with high vibrational excitation, leading to\nhundreds of absorption lines across the optical and near infrared. These\nspectra are very different to that of the field-free molecule, so if they\nappeared in astronomical data they would be difficult to assign. Furthermore in\na condensed environment the excited states likely have short lifetimes to\ninternal conversion, giving the absorption lines a diffuse appearance. We\ntherefore suggest electrified H2 as a possible carrier of the Diffuse\nInterstellar Bands (DIBs). We further argue that in principle it may be\npossible to account for all of the DIBs with this one carrier. However, despite\nelectrification the transitions are not very strong and a large column of\ncondensed H2 would be required, making it difficult to reconcile this\npossibility with our current understanding of the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 05:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

To enable the deadlock recovery with automated vehicles and with\nhuman-driven vehicles, A-DRIVE includes two components: V2V communication-based\nA-DRIVE and Local perception-based A-DRIVE. V2V communication-based A-DRIVE is\ndesigned for homogeneous traffic environments in which all the vehicles are\nconnected and automated. Local perception-based A-DRIVE is for mixed traffic,\nwhere CAVs, non-connected automated vehicles, and human-driven vehicles\nco-exist and cooperate with one another.

To tackle these issues, recent works have\nshown promising results by simultaneously reasoning for different people.\nHowever, in most cases this is done by only considering pairwise person\ninteractions, hindering thus a holistic scene representation able to capture\nlong-range interactions. This is addressed by approaches that jointly process\nall people in the scene, although they require defining one of the individuals\nas a reference and a pre-defined person ordering, being sensitive to this\nchoice. In this paper, we overcome both these limitations, and we propose an\napproach for multi-person 3D pose estimation that captures long-range\ninteractions independently of the input order. For this purpose, we build a\nresidual-like permutation-invariant network that successfully refines\npotentially corrupted initial 3D poses estimated by an off-the-shelf detector.\nThe residual function is learned via Set Transformer blocks, that model the\ninteractions among all initial poses, no matter their ordering or number. A\nthorough evaluation demonstrates that our approach is able to boost the\nperformance of the initially estimated 3D poses by large margins, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on standardized benchmarks.

To configure multi-receptive\nfield features, DGFA which takes the proposed dilated graph convolution\n(DGConv) as its basic building block, is designed to aggregate multi-scale\nfeature representation by capturing dilated graphs with various receptive\nregions. By simultaneously considering penalizing the receptive field\ninformation with point sets of different resolutions as calculation bases, we\nintroduce Pyramid Decoders driven by MALoss for the diversity of receptive\nfield bases. Combining these two aspects, DGFA-Net significantly improves the\nsegmentation performance of instances with similar spatial structures.\nExperiments on S3DIS, ShapeNetPart and Toronto-3D show that DGFA-Net\noutperforms the baseline approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art\nsegmentation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 08:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2022 04:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 11:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-04"}

Recently there is a trend in e-commerce that the recommended items are\norganized as two-dimensional grid-based panels where users can view the items\nin both vertical and horizontal directions. Presenting items in grid-based\nresult panels poses new challenges to recommender systems because existing\nmodels are all designed to output sequential lists while the slots in a\ngrid-based panel have no explicit order. Directly converting the item rankings\ninto grids (e.g., pre-defining an order on the slots)overlooks the\nuser-specific behavioral patterns on grid-based pan-els and inevitably hurts\nthe user experiences. To address this issue, we propose a novel Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) to place the items in 2D grid-based result panels at the final\nre-ranking stage of the recommender systems. The model, referred to as\nPanel-MDP, takes an initial item ranking from the early stages as the input.\nThen, it defines the MDP discrete time steps as the ranks in the initial\nranking list, and the actions as the slots in the grid-based panels, plus a\nNULL action. At each time step, Panel-MDP sequentially takes an action of\nselecting one slot for placing an item of the initial ranking list, or\ndiscarding the item if NULL action is selected. The process is continued until\nall of the slots are filled. The reinforcement learning algorithm of DQN is\nemployed to implement and learn the parameters in the Panel-MDP.

An $n$-vertex graph\nis given, each edge/arc assigned two weights. Let us call them \"cost\" and\n\"length\" for definiteness. Finding a min-cost upper-bounded length path between\na given pair of vertices is required. The problem is NP-hard even when the\nlengths of all edges are the same. Therefore, various approximation algorithms\nhave been proposed in the literature for it. The constraint on path length can\nbe accounted for by considering one edge weight equals to a linear combination\nof cost and length. By varying the multiplier value in a linear combination, a\nfeasible solution delivers a minimum to the function with new weights. At the\nsame time, Dijkstra's algorithm or its modifications are used to construct the\nshortest path with the current weights of the edges. However, with\ninsufficiently large graphs, this approach may turn out to be time-consuming.\nIn this article, we propose to look for a solution, not in the original graph\nbut specially constructed hierarchical structures (HS). We show that the\nshortest path in the HS is constructed with $O(m)$-time complexity, where $m$\nis the number of edges/arcs of the graph, and the approximate solution in the\ncase of integer costs and lengths of the edges is found with $O(m\\log n)$-time\ncomplexity. The a priori estimate of the algorithm's accuracy turned out to\ndepend on the parameters of the problem and can be significant. Therefore, to\nevaluate the algorithm's effectiveness, we conducted a numerical experiment on\nthe graphs of roads of megalopolis and randomly constructed unit-disk graphs\n(UDGs). The numerical experiment results show that in the HS, a solution close\nto optimal one is built 10--100 times faster than in the methods which use\nDijkstra's algorithm to build a min-weight path in the original graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 09:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

It is found that the local correlation tracking\n(LCT)-based $H_m^p$ is larger than $H_m^c$ in $1\"$, and that the Differential\nAffine Velocity Estimator-based $H_m^p$ is more consistent with $H_m^c$ than\nthe LCT-based $H_m^p$. $H_m^p$ is more consistent with $H_m^c$ in evaluation\nfrom $2\"$ than from $1\"$. Moreover, $H_m^c - H_m^p$ systematically shows\nconsistency with the Hemispheric Helicity Rule (over 55\\%), no matter which\nresolution and method are used. These estimations suggest that the consistency\nof $H_m^c$ and $H_m^p$ is partly dependent on the resolution of the\nmagnetograms and the calculation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 09:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Following classical reinforcement learning, these\nobjectives have to be combined into a single reward function. In contrast,\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods learn from vectors of\nper-objective rewards instead. In the case of multi-policy MORL, sets of\ndecision policies for various preferences regarding the conflicting objectives\nare optimized. This is especially important when target preferences are not\nknown during training or when preferences change dynamically during\napplication. While it is, in general, straightforward to extend a\nsingle-objective reinforcement learning method for MORL based on linear\nscalarization, solutions that are reachable by these methods are limited to\nconvex regions of the Pareto front. Non-linear MORL methods like Thresholded\nLexicographic Ordering (TLO) are designed to overcome this limitation.\nGeneralized MORL methods utilize function approximation to generalize across\nobjective preferences and thereby implicitly learn multiple policies in a\ndata-efficient manner, even for complex decision problems with high-dimensional\nor continuous state spaces. In this work, we propose \\textit{generalized\nThresholded Lexicographic Ordering} (gTLO), a novel method that aims to combine\nnon-linear MORL with the advantages of generalized MORL. We introduce a deep\nreinforcement learning realization of the algorithm and present promising\nresults on a standard benchmark for non-linear MORL and a real-world\napplication from the domain of manufacturing process control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 10:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Overheating causes irreversible damage to circuit components and can\nalso lead to fire, explosions, and injuries. Accordingly, in the advent of 2D\nmaterial-based electronics, an understanding of their thermal properties in\naddition to their electric ones is crucial to enable efficient transfer of\nexcess heat away from the electronic components. In this work we propose\nstructures based on free-standing, few-layer, nanopatterned MoS2 that insulate\nand guide heat in the in-plane direction. We arrive at these designs via a\nthorough study of the in-plane thermal conductivity as a function of thickness,\nporosity, and temperature in both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2 membranes.\nTwo-laser Raman thermometry was employed to measure the thermal conductivities\nof a set of free-standing MoS2 flakes with diameters greater than 20 um and\nthicknesses from 5 to 40 nm, resulting in values from 30 to 85 W/mK,\nrespectively. After nanopatterning a square lattice of 100-nm diameter holes\nwith a focused ion beam we have obtained a greater than 10-fold reduction of\nthe thermal conductivities for the period of 500 nm and values below 1 W/mK for\nthe period of 300 nm. The results were supported by equilibrium molecular\ndynamic simulations for both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2. The selective\npatterning of certain areas results in extremely large difference in thermal\nconductivities within the same material. Exploitation of this effect enabled\nfor the first time thermal insulation and heat guiding in the few-layer MoS2.\nThe patterned regions act as high thermal resistors: we obtained a thermal\nresistance of 4x10-6 m2K/W with only four patterned lattice periods of 300 nm,\nhighlighting the significant potential of MoS2 for thermal management\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 10:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

In\nthis paper, a novel monocular omnidirectional depth estimation model, namely\nHiMODE is proposed based on a hybrid CNN+Transformer (encoder-decoder)\narchitecture whose modules are efficiently designed to mitigate distortion and\ncomputational cost, without performance degradation. Firstly, we design a\nfeature pyramid network based on the HNet block to extract high-resolution\nfeatures near the edges. The performance is further improved, benefiting from a\nself and cross attention layer and spatial/temporal patches in the Transformer\nencoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a spatial residual block is\nemployed to reduce the number of parameters. By jointly passing the deep\nfeatures extracted from an input image at each backbone block, along with the\nraw depth maps predicted by the transformer encoder-decoder, through a context\nadjustment layer, our model can produce resulting depth maps with better visual\nquality than the ground-truth. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the\nsignificance of each individual module.

Moreover, most recent\ndiscussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, missing out on synthesizing\nthe wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles.\n3. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL,\nstarting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm\nfamilies, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML\nprinciples. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction\ntasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical\nmethods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for\necological problems.

As decision making in the context of epidemic\nmitigation is hard, reinforcement learning provides a methodology to\nautomatically learn prevention strategies in combination with complex epidemic\nmodels. Current research focuses on optimizing policies w.r.t. a single\nobjective, such as the pathogen's attack rate. However, as the mitigation of\nepidemics involves distinct, and possibly conflicting criteria (i.a.,\nprevalence, mortality, morbidity, cost), a multi-objective approach is\nwarranted to learn balanced policies. To lift this decision-making process to\nreal-world epidemic models, we apply deep multi-objective reinforcement\nlearning and build upon a state-of-the-art algorithm, Pareto Conditioned\nNetworks (PCN), to learn a set of solutions that approximates the Pareto front\nof the decision problem. We consider the first wave of the Belgian COVID-19\nepidemic, which was mitigated by a lockdown, and study different deconfinement\nstrategies, aiming to minimize both COVID-19 cases (i.e., infections and\nhospitalizations) and the societal burden that is induced by the applied\nmitigation measures. We contribute a multi-objective Markov decision process\nthat encapsulates the stochastic compartment model that was used to inform\npolicy makers during the COVID-19 epidemic. As these social mitigation measures\nare implemented in a continuous action space that modulates the contact matrix\nof the age-structured epidemic model, we extend PCN to this setting. We\nevaluate the solution returned by PCN, and observe that it correctly learns to\nreduce the social burden whenever the hospitalization rates are sufficiently\nlow. In this work, we thus show that multi-objective reinforcement learning is\nattainable in complex epidemiological models and provides essential insights to\nbalance complex mitigation policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 11:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

These\nemergent magnetochiral effects can lead to frequency nonreciprocity of spin\nwaves, which has been shown to be a bulk effect of dipolar origin and is\nrelated to a curvature-induced symmetry breaking in the magnetic volume\ncharges. So far, such effects have been investigated theoretically mostly for\nthin shells, where the spatial profiles of the spin waves can be assumed to be\nhomogeneous along the thickness. Here, using a finite-element dynamic-matrix\napproach, we investigate the transition of the spin-wave spectrum from thin to\nthick curvilinear shells, at the example of magnetic nanotubes in the vortex\nstate. With increasing thickness, we observe the appearance of higher-order\nradial modes which are strongly hybridized and resemble the\nperpendicular-standing-waves (PSSWs) in flat films. Along with an increasing\ndispersion asymmetry, we uncover the curvature-induced non-reciprocity of the\nmode profiles. This is explained in a very simple picture general for thick\ncurvilinear shells, considering the inhomogeneity of the emergent geometric\nvolume charges along the thickness of the shell. Such curvature-induced\nmode-profile asymmetry also leads to non-reciprocal hybridization which can\nfacilitate unidirectional spin-wave propagation. With that, we also show how\ncurvature allows for nonlinear three-wave splitting of a higher-order radial\nmode into secondary modes which can also propagate unidirectionally.

In\nthis paper, we empirically analyze the vital differences between CBFT and CFFT.\nThe former transforms features based on the flat-world assumption, which may\ncause distortion of regions lying above the ground plane. The latter is limited\nin the segmentation performance due to the absence of geometric priors and\ntime-consuming computation.

In this work, we address the task of\nzero-shot domain adaptation, also known as domain generalization, for FSOD.\nSpecifically, we assume that neither images nor labels of the novel classes in\nthe target domain are available during training. Our approach for solving the\ndomain gap is two-fold. First, we leverage a meta-training paradigm, where we\nlearn the domain shift on the base classes, then transfer the domain knowledge\nto the novel classes. Second, we propose various data augmentations techniques\non the few shots of novel classes to account for all possible domain-specific\ninformation. To constraint the network into encoding domain-agnostic\nclass-specific representations only, a contrastive loss is proposed to maximize\nthe mutual information between foreground proposals and class embeddings and\nreduce the network's bias to the background information from target domain.

It encompasses everything from concrete\ninstructions to abstract descriptions of the world. Despite this, natural\nlanguage is often challenging to learn from: it is difficult for machine\nlearning methods to make appropriate inferences from such a wide range of\ninput. This paper proposes a generalization of reward design as a unifying\nprinciple to ground linguistic communication: speakers choose utterances to\nmaximize expected rewards from the listener's future behaviors. We first extend\nreward design to incorporate reasoning about unknown future states in a linear\nbandit setting. We then define a speaker model which chooses utterances\naccording to this objective.

Contrary to the case of fixed based manipulators with\nprismatic or rotary joints, the state space of moving-base robotic systems such\nas humanoids, quadruped robots, or aerial manipulators cannot be globally\nparametrized by a finite number of independent coordinates. This impossibility\nis a direct consequence of the fact that the state of these systems includes\nthe system's global orientation, formally described as an element of the\nspecial orthogonal group SO(3). As a consequence, obtaining the linearization\nof the equations of motion for these systems is typically resolved, from a\npractical perspective, by locally parameterizing the system's attitude by means\nof, e.g., Euler or Cardan angles. This has the drawback, however, of\nintroducing artificial parameterization singularities and extra derivative\ncomputations. In this contribution, we show that it is actually possible to\ndefine a notion of linearization that does not require the use of a local\nparameterization for the system's orientation, obtaining a mathematically\nelegant, recursive, and singularity-free linearization for moving-based robot\nsystems. Recursiveness, in particular, is obtained by proposing a nontrivial\nmodification of existing recursive algorithms to allow for computations of the\ngeometric derivatives of the inverse dynamics and the inverse of the mass\nmatrix of the robotic system. The correctness of the proposed algorithm is\nvalidated by means of a numerical comparison with the result obtained via\ngeometric finite difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 13:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In the case of mean differences between classes, this question has\nbeen well studied. However, in many contemporary applications, notably in\nbiomedicine, group differences at the level of covariance or graphical model\nstructure are important. Motivated by such applications, in this paper we ask\nwhether linear projections can preserve differences in second order structure\nbetween latent groups. We focus on unsupervised projections, which can be\ncomputed without knowledge of class labels. We discuss a simple theoretical\nframework to study the behaviour of such projections which we use to inform an\nanalysis via quasi-exhaustive enumeration. This allows us to consider the\nperformance, over more than a hundred thousand sets of data-generating\npopulation parameters, of two popular projections, namely random projections\n(RP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Across this broad range of\nregimes, PCA turns out to be more effective at retaining second order signals\nthan RP and is often even competitive with supervised projection. We complement\nthese results with fully empirical experiments showing 0-1 loss using simulated\nand real data. We study also the effect of projection dimension, drawing\nattention to a bias-variance trade-off in this respect.

The scattering\nmechanism is that of an elastic string of length L that re-radiates as a\nresponse to an incoming wave. The scatterers are thus not static but have their\nown dynamics. A Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation is established, and a\nWard-Takahashi Identity (WTI) is demonstrated. The BS equation is written as a\nspectral problem that, using the WTI, is solved in the diffusive limit. To\nleading order a diffusion behavior indeed results, and an explicit formula for\nthe diffusion coeffcient is obtained. It can be evaluated in an Independent\nScattering Approximation (ISA) in the absence of intrinsic damping. It depends\nnot only on the bare longitudinal and transverse wave velocities but also on\nthe renormalized velocities, as well as attenuation coeffcients, of the\ncoherent waves. The influence of the length scale given by L, and of the\nresonant behavior for frequencies near the resonance frequency of the strings,\ncan be explicitly identified. A Kubo representation for the diffusion constant\ncan be identified. Previous generic results, obtained with an energy transfer\nformalism, are recovered when the number of dislocations per unit volume is\nsmall. This includes the equipartition of diffusive energy density which,\nhowever, does not hold in general.

The\nlatter orientation is tied with polarization plane, rotation of which causes\nrotation of the cruciform jets by the same angle. To shed light on the\nexperimental data we performed molecular dynamics simulation of droplet\nexpansion induced by angle-dependent heating.\n  Our simulation shows that the jet directions are determined by an oriented\nangle-dependent energy distribution within a frontal hemisphere layer of\ndroplet after absorption of linearly polarized light. As a result, the produced\nflow velocity field guided by surface tension forms two high-speed opposite\njets oriented across the electric field vector as in our experiment.\n  A shock-wave pulse generated in the frontal layer has angle-dependent\namplitude inherited from the oriented energy deposition. The release part of\nshock pulse produces a cavitation zone nearby the droplet center, and thus an\nexpanding spherical shell is formed from the droplet.

Recent developments in\nvoxel-by-voxel 3D printing have enabled extreme levels of control over the\nmaterial deposition, yielding complex micro-architected materials. However,\nspatial complexity makes it a formidable challenge to find the optimal\ndistribution of both hard and soft phases. To address this, a nonlinear\ncoarse-graining approach is developed, where foam-based constitutive equations\nare used to predict the mechanics of biomimetic composites. The proposed\napproach is validated by comparing coarse-grained finite element predictions\nagainst full-field strain distributions measured using digital image\ncorrelation. To evaluate the degree of coarse-graining on model accuracy,\npre-notched specimens decorated with a binarized version of a renowned painting\nwere modeled. Subsequently, coarse-graining is used to predict the fracture\nbehavior of bio-inspired composites incorporating complex designs, such as\nfunctional gradients and hierarchical organizations. Finally, as a showcase of\nthe proposed approach, the inverse coarse-graining is combined with a\ntheoretical model of bone tissue adaptation to optimize the microarchitecture\nof a 3D-printed femur. The predicted properties were in exceptionally good\nagreement with the corresponding experimental results. Therefore, the\ncoarse-graining method allows the design of advanced architected materials with\ntunable and predictable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

While in one dimension substantial evidence for the\nexistence of such a many-body localized (MBL) phase exists, the behavior in\nhigher dimensions remains an open puzzle. In two-dimensional disordered\nsystems, for instance, it has been argued that rare regions may lead to\nthermalization of the whole system through a mechanism dubbed the avalanche\ninstability. In quasiperiodic systems, rare regions are altogether absent and\nthe fate of a putative many-body localized phase has hitherto remained largely\nunexplored. In this work, we investigate the localization properties of two\nmany-body quasiperiodic models, which are two-dimensional generalizations of\nthe Aubry-Andr\\'e model. By studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of large\nsystems, we find a long-lived MBL phase, in contrast to random systems.\nFurthermore, we show that deterministic lines of weak potential, which appear\nin investigated quasiperiodic models, support large-scale transport, while the\nsystem as a whole does not thermalize. Our results demonstrate that\nquasiperiodic many-body systems have the remarkable and counter-intuitive\ncapability of exhibiting coexisting localization and transport properties - a\nphenomenon reminiscent of the behavior of supersolids.

This paper\ninvestigates the application of EIT during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery\nas a means to identify targets during operations.

This work\nallows us to evaluate each data source along various dimensions, such as\ncompleteness, correctness, and interlinking with other sources, all critical\naspects of current knowledge representation technologies.\n  Conclusions: Our contributions directly benefit stakeholders in the\nbiomedical and health domain (patients, healthcare professionals, companies,\nregulatory authorities, and researchers), who will now have a better overview\nof the access to and distribution of medical facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 11:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-27"}

To resolve this controversy and develop a more robust understanding of\nglobal flow regimes in the solar interior, we apply a \"forward-modeling\"\napproach to the analysis of helioseismic signatures of meridional circulation\nprofiles obtained from numerical simulations. We employ the global acoustic\nmodeling code GALE to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves through\nregimes of mean mass flows generated by global hydrodynamic and\nmagnetohydrodynamic models: EULAG, the Pencil Code, and the Rayleigh code.\nThese models are used to create synthetic dopplergram data products, used as\ninputs for local time-distance helioseismology techniques. Helioseismic\ntravel-time signals from solutions obtained through global numerical\nsimulations are compared directly with inferences from solar observations, in\norder to set additional constraints on global model parameters in a direct way.\nWe show that even though these models are able to replicate solar-like\ndifferential rotation, the resulting rotationally-constrained convection\ndevelops a multi-cell global meridional circulation profile that is measurably\ninconsistent with local time-distance inferences of solar observations.\nHowever, we find that the development of rotationally-unconstrained convection\nclose to the model surface is able to maintain solar-like differential\nrotation, while having a significant impact on the helioseismic travel-time\nsignal, replicating solar observations within one standard deviation of the\nerror due to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

While having more\ninformation on architecture instability is, in general, useful for any software\ndevelopment project, it is especially important in Open Source Software (OSS)\nprojects where the supervision of the development process is more difficult to\nachieve. In particular, we are interested when OSS projects grow from a small\ncontrolled environment (i.e., the cathedral phase) to a community-driven\nproject (i.e., the bazaar phase). In such a transition, the project often\nexplodes in terms of software size and number of contributing developers.\nHence, the complexity of the newly added features, and the frequency of the\ncommits and files modified may cause significant variations of the instability\nof the structure of the classes and packages. Consequently, in this registered\nreport we suggest ways to analyze the instability in OSS projects, especially\nduring that sensitive phase where they become community-driven.

To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a low-parameter model, named\nLow Resource Heart-Network (LRH-Net), which uses fewer leads to detect ECG\nanomalies in a resource-constrained environment. A multi-level knowledge\ndistillation process is used on top of that to get better generalization\nperformance on our proposed model.
