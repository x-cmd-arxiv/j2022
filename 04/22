However, they could introduce security risks as\nwell. Many TPL detection methods have been proposed to detect TPL reuse in\nAndroid bytecode or in source code. This paper focuses on detecting TPL reuse\nin binary code, which is a more challenging task. For a detection target in\nbinary form, libraries may be compiled and linked to separate dynamic-link\nfiles or built into a fused binary that contains multiple libraries and\nproject-specific code. This could result in fewer available code features and\nlower the effectiveness of feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a\nbinary TPL reuse detection framework, LibDB, which can effectively and\nefficiently detect imported TPLs even in stripped and fused binaries. In\naddition to the basic and coarse-grained features (string literals and exported\nfunction names), LibDB utilizes function contents as a new type of feature. It\nembeds all functions in a binary file to low-dimensional representations with a\ntrained neural network. It further adopts a function call graph-based\ncomparison method to improve the accuracy of the detection. LibDB is able to\nsupport version identification of TPLs contained in the detection target, which\nis not considered by existing detection methods. To evaluate the performance of\nLibDB, we construct three datasets for binary-based TPL reuse detection.

Similar to SRE19, it featured two core evaluation tracks, namely audio\nand audio-visual, as well as an optional visual track. In addition to offering\nfixed and open training conditions, it also introduced new challenges for the\ncommunity, thanks to a new multimodal (i.e., audio, video, and selfie images)\nand multilingual (i.e., with multilingual speakers) corpus, termed WeCanTalk,\ncollected outside North America by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). These\nchallenges included: 1) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test\nsegments originating from different domains (i.e., telephony versus video), and\n2) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments spoken in\ndifferent languages (i.e., cross-lingual trials). This paper presents an\noverview of SRE21 including the tasks, performance metric, data, evaluation\nprotocol, results and system performance analyses. A total of 23 organizations\n(forming 15 teams) from academia and industry participated in SRE21 and\nsubmitted 158 valid system outputs. Evaluation results indicate: audio-visual\nfusion produce substantial gains in performance over audio-only or visual-only\nsystems; top performing speaker and face recognition systems exhibited\ncomparable performance under the matched domain conditions present in this\nevaluation; and, the use of complex neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet)\nalong with angular losses with margin, data augmentation, as well as long\nduration fine-tuning contributed to notable performance improvements for the\naudio-only speaker recognition task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

In knowledge graphs, different entities may have a relation with the\nsame entity; for example, many actors starred in one movie. Such a\nnon-injective relation pattern cannot be well modeled by the translation or\nrotation operations in existing translation distance based KGE methods. To\ntackle the challenge, we propose a translation distance-based KGE method called\nSpaceE to model relations as linear transformations. The proposed SpaceE embeds\nboth entities and relations in knowledge graphs as matrices and SpaceE\nnaturally models non-injective relations with singular linear transformations.\nWe theoretically demonstrate that SpaceE is a fully expressive model with the\nability to infer multiple desired relation patterns, including symmetry,\nskew-symmetry, inversion, Abelian composition, and non-Abelian composition.\nExperimental results on link prediction datasets illustrate that SpaceE\nsubstantially outperforms many previous translation distance based knowledge\ngraph embedding methods, especially on datasets with many non-injective\nrelations.

This breaking triggers the electroweak (EW)\nsymmetry breaking through a mixed quartic coupling between the $U(1)$ Higgs\nfield and the SM Higgs doublet. For two Higgs boson mass eigenstates after the\nsymmetry breaking, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs boson) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs\nboson), we calculate the Higgs boson trilinear coupling ($g_{h_{1} h_{2}\nh_{2}}$) in the model by setting the Higgs boson mass spectrum to be $M_{h_1} >\n2 M_{h_2}$. For a common Higgs mass spectrum and mixing angle between two Higgs\nfields, we find that $g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$ in the classically conformal model\nis highly suppressed compared to that calculated for the conventional Higgs\npotential, where the $U(1)$ and EW symmetry breaking originate from the\nnegative squared masses for the Higgs fields at the tree-level. Thus, this\ncoupling suppression is a striking nature of the radiative origin of EW\nsymmetry breaking. We then consider how to distinguish this origin at the\nproposed International Linear Collider (ILC) via precise measurements of\nanomalous SM Higgs boson couplings and the search for anomalous SM Higgs boson\ndecay $h_1 \\rightarrow h_2 h_2$ followed by $h_2 \\to b \\bar{b}$. We conclude\nthat once the anomalous couplings are measured at the ILC, the observation of\nthe anomalous Higgs boson decay is promising in the conventional Higgs\npotential, while this decay process is highly suppressed and undetectable for\nthe classically conformal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 17:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

The first builds on methods that use\nso-called parent-child constraints, but enforces those constraints on an\nabstracted network which enables an equivalent formulation with significantly\nless variables and constraints. The second formulation builds on existing\napproaches which directly generate constraints disallowing loops, and through\nan iterative approach seeks to limit the number of these constraints which must\nbe enforced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 17:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

These clusters are formed\nby aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an\nelectromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material\n(beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to\nstart showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the\n3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters\naround the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in\nthese satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy\nresolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been\nassociated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which\ndoes not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup\ninteractions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade\nduring LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the\nincreasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods\nare being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning\narchitectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms.\nThese more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more\nresilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy\nresolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the\nchallenges of training the models as well the opportunity that this new\napproach offers to unify the ECAL energy measurement with the particle\nidentification steps used in the global CMS photon and electron reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 17:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

It is well known that VG possesses two\ninvariants, or constants of motion, corresponding to kinetic energy and squared\nangular momentum, giving oscillatory solutions to its equations of motion. Nine\ndistinct subclasses of the VG have been identified, two of which the Euler\ngyroscope and Lorenz gyrostat are each known to have two constants. This paper\ncharacterizes quadratic invariants of the VG and each of its subclasses,\nshowing how these enjoy two invariants even when rendered in terms of a\nnon-invertible transformation of parameters, leading to a transformed Volterra\ngyrostat (TVG). If the quadratic coefficients of the TVG sum to zero, as they\ndo for the VG, the system conserves energy. In all of these cases, the flows\npreserve volume. However, physical models where the quadratic coefficients do\nnot sum to zero are ubiquitous, and characterization of invariants and the\nresulting dynamics for this more general class of models with volume\nconservation but without energy conservation is lacking. This paper provides\nthe first such characterization for each of the subclasses of the VG in the\nabsence of energy conservation, showing how the number of invariants depends on\nthe number of linear feedback terms. It is shown that the gyrostat with three\nlinear feedback terms has no invariants. The number of invariants circumscribes\nthe possible dynamics for these three-dimensional flows, and those without any\ninvariants are shown to admit rich dynamics including chaos. This gives rise to\na broad class of three-dimensional volume conserving chaotic flows, arising\nnaturally from model reduction techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 18:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 17:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Our framework consists of four main components of a CPS problem, namely,\n1) problem formulation, 2) knowledge representation, 3) method of knowledge\nmanipulation, and 4) method of evaluation. We conclude our survey with open\nresearch questions, and suggested directions for the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 18:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

Recent research on relation extraction showed that\nprompt-based learning improves the performance on both fine-tuning on full\ntraining set and few-shot training.

In this\npaper, we investigate prompting for biomedical relation extraction, with\nexperiments on the ChemProt dataset. We present a simple yet effective method\nto systematically generate comprehensive prompts that reformulate the relation\nextraction task as a cloze-test task under a simple prompt formulation. In\nparticular, we experiment with different ranking scores for prompt selection.\nWith BioMed-RoBERTa-base, our results show that prompting-based fine-tuning\nobtains gains by 14.21 F1 over its regular fine-tuning baseline, and 1.14 F1\nover SciFive-Large, the current state-of-the-art on ChemProt.

If every ranker\nreturns highly relevant items in the top ranks, it becomes difficult to\nrecognize meaningful differences between them and to build reusable test\ncollections. Several recent papers explore pairwise preference judgments as an\nalternative to traditional graded relevance assessments. Rather than viewing\nitems one at a time, assessors view items side-by-side and indicate the one\nthat provides the better response to a query, allowing fine-grained\ndistinctions. If we employ preference judgments to identify the probably best\nitems for each query, we can measure rankers by their ability to place these\nitems as high as possible. We frame the problem of finding best items as a\ndueling bandits problem. While many papers explore dueling bandits for online\nranker evaluation via interleaving, they have not been considered as a\nframework for offline evaluation via human preference judgments. We review the\nliterature for possible solutions. For human preference judgments, any usable\nalgorithm must tolerate ties, since two items may appear nearly equal to\nassessors, and it must minimize the number of judgments required for any\nspecific pair, since each such comparison requires an independent assessor.\nSince the theoretical guarantees provided by most algorithms depend on\nassumptions that are not satisfied by human preference judgments, we simulate\nselected algorithms on representative test cases to provide insight into their\npractical utility. Based on these simulations, one algorithm stands out for its\npotential. Our simulations suggest modifications to further improve its\nperformance.

Unfortunately, although system designers can\ntheoretically adapt commodity DRAM chips to meet their particular design goals\n(e.g., by reducing access timings to improve performance, implementing\nsystem-level RowHammer mitigations), we observe that designers today lack\nsufficient insight into commodity DRAM chips' reliability characteristics to\nimplement these techniques in practice. In this work, we make a case for DRAM\nmanufacturers to provide increased transparency into key aspects of DRAM\nreliability (e.g., basic chip design properties, testing strategies). Doing so\nenables system designers to make informed decisions to better adapt commodity\nDRAM to meet modern systems' needs while preserving its cost advantages.\n  To support our argument, we study four ways that system designers can adapt\ncommodity DRAM chips to system-specific design goals: (1) improving DRAM\nreliability; (2) reducing DRAM refresh overheads; (3) reducing DRAM access\nlatency; and (4) mitigating RowHammer attacks. We observe that adopting\nsolutions for any of the four goals requires system designers to make\nassumptions about a DRAM chip's reliability characteristics. These assumptions\ndiscourage system designers from using such solutions in practice due to the\ndifficulty of both making and relying upon the assumption.\n  We identify DRAM standards as the root of the problem: current standards\nrigidly enforce a fixed operating point with no specifications for how a system\ndesigner might explore alternative operating points. To overcome this problem,\nwe introduce a two-step approach that reevaluates DRAM standards with a focus\non transparency of DRAM reliability so that system designers are encouraged to\nmake the most of commodity DRAM technology for both current and future DRAM\nchips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 19:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Part of the MDE task is, therefore, to learn which\nvisual cues in the image can be used for depth estimation, and how. With\ntraining data limited by cost of annotation or network capacity limited by\ncomputational power, this is challenging. In this work we demonstrate that\nexplicitly injecting visual cue information into the model is beneficial for\ndepth estimation. Following research into biological vision systems, we focus\non semantic information and prior knowledge of object sizes and their\nrelations, to emulate the biological cues of relative size, familiar size, and\nabsolute size.

To compensate for growing error rates,\nboth memory manufacturers and consumers use error-mitigation mechanisms that\nimprove manufacturing yield and allow system designers to meet reliability\ntargets. Developing effective error mitigations requires understanding the\nerrors' characteristics (e.g., worst-case behavior, statistical properties).\nUnfortunately, we observe that proprietary on-die Error-Correcting Codes (ECC)\nused in modern memory chips introduce new challenges to efficient error\nmitigation by obfuscating CPU-visible error characteristics in an\nunpredictable, ECC-dependent manner.\n  This dissertation builds a detailed understanding of how on-die ECC\nobfuscates the statistical properties of main memory error mechanisms using a\ncombination of real-chip experiments and statistical analyses. We\nexperimentally study memory errors, examine how on-die ECC obfuscates their\nstatistical characteristics, and develop new testing techniques to overcome the\nobfuscation.

The addition of\nlensing information, even when restricted to the Northern Galactic Cap,\nimproves constraints to $\\Omega_m = 0.300 \\pm 0.008$, $H_0 = 69.21 \\pm 0.77$\nand $\\sigma_8 = 0.707 \\pm 0.035$, in tension with CMB and cosmic shear\nconstraints. The combination of $\\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ are consistent with\nPlanck, though their constraints derive mostly from redshift-space clustering.\nThe low $\\sigma_8$ value are driven by cross correlations with CMB lensing in\nthe low redshift bin ($z\\simeq 0.38$) and at large angular scales, which show a\n$20\\%$ deficit compared to expectations from galaxy clustering alone. We\nconduct several systematics tests on the data and find none that could fully\nexplain these tensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 20:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 18:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Algorithms for both formulations traverse a search tree, which grows\nexponentially with the size of the graph or the value of $k$.\n  Parallelizing the traversal of the vertex cover search tree on GPUs is\nchallenging for multiple reasons. First, the search tree is a narrow binary\ntree which makes it difficult to extract enough sub-trees to process in\nparallel to fully utilize the GPU's resources. Second, the search tree is\nhighly imbalanced which makes load balancing across a massive number of\nparallel GPU workers challenging. Third, keeping around all the intermediate\nstate needed to traverse many sub-trees in parallel puts high pressure on the\nGPU's memory resources and may act as a limiting factor to parallelism.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an approach to traverse the vertex\ncover search tree in parallel using GPUs while handling dynamic load balancing.\nEach thread block traverses a different sub-tree using a local stack, however,\nwe also use a global worklist to balance load. Blocks contribute branches of\ntheir sub-trees to the global worklist on an as-needed basis, while blocks that\nfinish their sub-trees get new ones from the global worklist. We use degree\narrays to represent intermediate graphs so that the representation is compact\nin memory to avoid limiting parallelism, but self-contained which is necessary\nfor load balancing.

While meeting others is pleasant, it also increases the\nrisk of infection. We consider this dilemma by introducing a game-theoretic\nnetwork creation model in which selfish agents can form bilateral connections.\nThey benefit from network neighbors, but at the same time, they want to\nmaximize their distance to all other agents. This models the inherent conflict\nthat social distancing rules impose on the behavior of selfish agents in a\nsocial network. Besides addressing this familiar issue, our model can be seen\nas the inverse to the well-studied Network Creation Game by Fabrikant et al.\n[PODC 2003] where agents aim at being as central as possible in the created\nnetwork. Thus, our work is in-line with studies that compare minimization\nproblems with their maximization versions.\n  We look at two variants of network creation governed by social distancing. In\nthe first variant, there are no restrictions on the connections being formed.\nWe characterize optimal and equilibrium networks, and we derive asymptotically\ntight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The second variant\nis the model's generalization that allows restrictions on the connections that\ncan be formed. As our main result, we prove that Swap-Maximal Routing-Cost\nSpanning Trees, an efficiently computable weaker variant of Maximum\nRouting-Cost Spanning Trees, actually resemble equilibria for a significant\nrange of the parameter space. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds on the\nPrice of Anarchy and Price of Stability.

We show that the spectrum\nof the Gegenbauer matrix converges in distribution to a Marchenko-Pastur law.\n  This problem is motivated by the study of the prediction error of kernel\nridge regression (KRR) in the polynomial regime $n \\asymp d^\\kappa, \\kappa >0$.\nPrevious work showed that for $\\kappa \\not\\in \\mathbb{N}$, KRR fits exactly a\ndegree-$\\lfloor \\kappa \\rfloor$ polynomial approximation to the target\nfunction. In this paper, we use our characterization of the kernel matrix to\ncomplete this picture and compute the precise asymptotics of the test error in\nthe limit $n/d^\\kappa \\to \\psi$ with $\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In this case, the\ntest error can present a double descent behavior, depending on the effective\nregularization and signal-to-noise ratio at level $\\kappa$. Because this double\ndescent can occur each time $\\kappa$ crosses an integer, this explains the\nmultiple descent phenomenon in the KRR risk curve observed in several previous\nworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 22:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

In\ncontrast, in this paper, a holistic goal-oriented semantic communication\nframework is proposed to enable a speaker and a listener to cooperatively\nexecute a set of sequential tasks in a dynamic environment. A common language\nbased on a hierarchical belief set is proposed to enable semantic\ncommunications between speaker and listener. The speaker, acting as an observer\nof the environment, utilizes the beliefs to transmit an initial description of\nits observation (called event) to the listener. The listener is then able to\ninfer on the transmitted description and complete it by adding related beliefs\nto the transmitted beliefs of the speaker. As such, the listener reconstructs\nthe observed event based on the completed description, and it then takes\nappropriate action in the environment based on the reconstructed event. An\noptimization problem is defined to determine the perfect and abstract\ndescription of the events while minimizing the transmission and inference costs\nwith constraints on the task execution time and belief efficiency. Then, a\nnovel bottom-up curriculum learning (CL) framework based on reinforcement\nlearning is proposed to solve the optimization problem and enable the speaker\nand listener to gradually identify the structure of the belief set and the\nperfect and abstract description of the events.

However, there's a trade-off: a lower\nheap limit reduces memory use but increases garbage collection time. Classic\nmethods for setting heap limits include manually tuned heap limits and\nmultiple-of-live-size rules of thumb, but it is not clear when one rule is\nbetter than another or how to compare them.\n  We address this problem with a new framework where heap limits are set for\nmultiple heaps at once. Our key insight is that every heap limit rule induces a\nparticular allocation of memory across multiple processes, and this allocation\ncan be sub-optimal. We use our framework to derive an optimal \"square-root\"\nheap limit rule, which minimizes total memory usage for any amount of total\ngarbage collection time. Paradoxically, the square-root heap limit rule\nachieves this coordination without communication: it allocates memory optimally\nacross multiple heaps without requiring any communication between those heaps.\n  To demonstrate that this heap limit rule is effective, we prototype it for\nV8, the JavaScript runtime used in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other\nbrowsers, as well as in server-side frameworks like node.js and Deno.

Here we described a new potential candidate: an optically pumped\natomic co-magnetometer(OPACM) for moving MEGs recording.

In this article, the magnetic field\ncompensation is studied theoretically and we find that the compensation is\nclosely related to several parameters such as the electron spin magnetic field,\nthe nuclear spin magnetic field and the holding magnetic field. Based on the\nmodel, the magnetic field compensation could be optimized. We also\nexperimentally studied the magnetic field compensation and the responses of the\nOPACM to different frequencies of magnetic field are measured. We show that the\nOPACM owns a clear suppression of low frequency magnetic field under 1Hz and\nresponse to magnetic field's frequencies around the band of the MEGs.

The\nILC is available within the middle layers of the CNN model as a high-level\ndescription of the visual content (e.g., a saliency image) with respect to the\nego-centric view. In our framework, the ILC and OLC are mapped to a state\nvector and subsequently used to train a multiview NBV planner via deep\nreinforcement learning. Experiments using the public NCLT dataset validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 04:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 05:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}

Notably, cyanobacteria contain carboxysome organelles\nwhich are central to carbon fixation and can be older (if inherited from parent\ncells) or younger (if created after division) than the enveloping cell.\nMotivated by a desire to understand how carboxysome age impacts growth at the\ncolony level, we develop a multi-structured model which allows for an arbitrary\n(but finite) number of structure variables. We then derive and solve the\nrenewal equation for cell division to obtain an asymptotic solution, and show\nthat, under certain conditions, a stable structural distribution is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 06:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

The\ncommonly used back-end models are the cosine scoring and the probabilistic\nlinear discriminant analysis (PLDA) scoring.

This paper presents an investigation on the relation\nbetween the two scoring approaches, aiming to explain the above\ncounter-intuitive observation. It is shown that the cosine scoring is\nessentially a special case of PLDA scoring. In other words, by properly setting\nthe parameters of PLDA, the two back-ends become equivalent.

Besides the shift of features, we\nreveal that the intermediate layers' representational shift (IRS) also matters\nsince it disrupts batch normalization, which is another crucial cause of\ncatastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we propose ConFiT, a fine-tuning\nmethod incorporating two components, cross-convolution batch normalization\n(Xconv BN) and hierarchical fine-tuning. Xconv BN maintains pre-convolution\nrunning means instead of post-convolution, and recovers post-convolution ones\nbefore testing, which corrects the inaccurate estimates of means under IRS.\nHierarchical fine-tuning leverages a multi-stage strategy to fine-tune the\npre-trained network, preventing massive changes in Conv layers and thus\nalleviating IRS. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method\nremarkably outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with lower storage\noverhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 06:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 07:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

The predominance of this setup in\nconversation response ranking has lead to a great deal of attention to building\nneural re-rankers, while the first-stage retrieval step has been overlooked.\nSince the correct answer is always available in the candidate list of $n$\nresponses, this artificial evaluation setup assumes that there is a first-stage\nretrieval step which is always able to rank the correct response in its top-$n$\nlist. In this paper we focus on the more realistic task of full-rank retrieval\nof responses, where $n$ can be up to millions of responses.

Earlier pipeline designs allow\nmultiple versions of model parameters to co-exist (similar to asynchronous\ntraining), and cannot ensure the same model convergence and accuracy\nperformance as without pipelining. Synchronous pipelining has recently been\nproposed which ensures model performance by enforcing a synchronization barrier\nbetween training iterations. Nonetheless, the synchronization barrier requires\nwaiting for gradient aggregation from all microbatches and thus delays the\ntraining progress. Optimized pipeline planning is needed to minimize such wait\nand hence the training time, which has not been well studied in the literature.\nThis paper designs efficient, near-optimal algorithms for expediting\nsynchronous pipeline-parallel training of modern large DNNs over arbitrary\ninter-GPU connectivity.

An additional factor\naffecting the reduction of attainable landing sites is the low angular velocity\nof Venus own rotation. This study proposes a new approach to expand the\nattainable landing areas. The approach is based on the use of the gravitational\nfield of Venus to transfer the spacecraft to an orbit resonant to the Venusian\none with a ratio of periods of 1:1. All the simulations were performed at the\npatched conic approximation. As an example, we considered a flight to Venus at\nlaunch in 2029 or 2031.

It has been demonstrated that there is always at\nleast one launch date within the launch window, allowing the spacecraft to\nreach almost any point on the surface of Venus.

In our design, we use a reflective\nSLM as a mirror in one of the arms of a Michelson interferometer, and scan the\ninterferometer by varying the phase across the SLM display. For achieving the\nlatter, we apply a checkerboard phase mask on the SLM display where the gray\nvalue varies between 0-255, thereby imparting a dynamic phase of up to\n262{\\deg} to the incident light beam. We couple a supercontinuum source into\nthe interferometer in order to mimic an astronomical object such as the Sun,\nand choose a central wavelength of 637.4 nm akin to the strong emission line of\nFe X present in the solar spectrum. We use a bandwidth of 30 nm, and extract\nfringes corresponding to a spectral resolution of 3.8 nm which is limited by\nthe reflectivity of the SLM. We also demonstrate a maximum wavelength\ntunability of ~8 nm by varying the phase over the phase mask with a spectral\nsampling of around 0.03 nm between intermediate fringes. The checkerboard phase\nmask can be adapted close to real time on time-scales of a few tens of\nmilliseconds to obtain spectral information for other near-contiguous\nwavelengths. The compactness, potential low cost, low power requirements,\nreal-time tunability and lack of moving mechanical parts in the setup implies\nthat it can have very useful applications in settings which require near\nreal-time, multi-wavelength spectroscopic applications, and is especially\nrelevant in space astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

The\nmain idea is to iteratively apply operations (e.g., fact deletions), starting\nfrom an inconsistent database, until we reach a database that is consistent\nw.r.t. the given set of constraints. This gives us the flexibility of choosing\nthe probability with which we apply an operation, which in turn allows us to\ncalculate the probability of an operational repair, and thus, the probability\nwith which a consistent answer is entailed. A natural way of assigning\nprobabilities to operations is by targeting the uniform probability\ndistribution over a reasonable space such as the set of operational repairs,\nthe set of sequences of operations that lead to an operational repair, and the\nset of available operations at a certain step of the repairing process. This\nleads to what we generally call uniform operational CQA. The goal of this work\nis to perform a data complexity analysis of both exact and approximate uniform\noperational CQA, focusing on functional dependencies (and subclasses thereof),\nand conjunctive queries. The main outcome of our analysis (among other positive\nand negative results), is that uniform operational CQA pushes the efficiency\nboundaries further by ensuring the existence of efficient approximation schemes\nin scenarios that go beyond the simple case of primary keys, which seems to be\nthe limit of the classical approach to CQA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

In particular, the feature-level\nadversarial attack is one recent branch that can enhance the transferability\nvia disturbing the intermediate features. The existing methods usually create a\nguidance map for features, where the value indicates the importance of the\ncorresponding feature element and then employs an iterative algorithm to\ndisrupt the features accordingly. However, the guidance map is fixed in\nexisting methods, which can not consistently reflect the behavior of networks\nas the image is changed during iteration. In this paper, we describe a new\nmethod called Feature-Momentum Adversarial Attack (FMAA) to further improve\ntransferability. The key idea of our method is that we estimate a guidance map\ndynamically at each iteration using momentum to effectively disturb the\ncategory-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on\ndifferent target models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Most existing FSS methods implement such\nsupport-query interactions by solely leveraging plain operations - e.g., cosine\nsimilarity and feature concatenation - for segmenting the query objects.\nHowever, these interaction approaches usually cannot well capture the intrinsic\nobject details in the query images that are widely encountered in FSS, e.g., if\nthe query object to be segmented has holes and slots, inaccurate segmentation\nalmost always happens. To this end, we propose a dynamic prototype convolution\nnetwork (DPCN) to fully capture the aforementioned intrinsic details for\naccurate FSS. Specifically, in DPCN, a dynamic convolution module (DCM) is\nfirstly proposed to generate dynamic kernels from support foreground, then\ninformation interaction is achieved by convolution operations over query\nfeatures using these kernels. Moreover, we equip DPCN with a support activation\nmodule (SAM) and a feature filtering module (FFM) to generate pseudo mask and\nfilter out background information for the query images, respectively. SAM and\nFFM together can mine enriched context information from the query features. Our\nDPCN is also flexible and efficient under the k-shot FSS setting.

Performing actions in such\ndomains always entails costs of consuming some resource, such as time, money,\nor energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from totally known\nto totally unknown and even unknowable probabilities of costs. Think of robotic\ndomains, where actions and their costs are non-deterministic due to uncertain\nfactors like obstacles. Choosing which action to perform considering its cost\non the available resource requires taking a stance on risk. Thus, these domains\ncall for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while embracing\nrisk. Taking Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as a widely used planning\ntechnique in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches\ndo not account for risk. That is, computing most probable or optimal plans\nusing actions with single-valued costs is only enough to express risk\nneutrality. In this work, we postulate that HTN planning can become risk aware\nby considering expected utility theory, a representative concept of decision\ntheory that enables choosing actions considering a probability distribution of\ntheir costs and a given risk attitude expressed using a utility function. In\nparticular, we introduce a general framework for HTN planning that allows\nmodelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs\nupon which we define risk-aware HTN planning as an approach that accounts for\nthe different risk attitudes and allows computing plans that go beyond risk\nneutrality. In fact, we layout that computing risk-aware plans requires finding\nplans with the highest expected utility. Finally, we argue that it is possible\nfor HTN planning agents to solve specialised risk-aware HTN planning problems\nby adapting some existing HTN planning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 12:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Among them,\noxygenated fuels have the advantage of significantly reducing pollutant\nemissions and can therefore be used as carbon-neutral substitute fuels for\ntransportation. In this work, the sooting propensity of different oxymethylene\nethers (OMEn) is investigated using a combined experimental and numerical study\non a series of burner-stabilized premixed flames under mild to severe sooting\nconditions. Herein, mixtures of ethylene in combination with the three\nindividual OMEn for n=2-4 are compared in terms of soot formation behavior with\npure ethylene flames. The kinetic mechanism from Sun et al. (Proc. Combust.\nInst. 36, 1269-1278, 2017) for oxymethylene ether OMEn combustion with n=1-3 is\nextended to include OME4 decomposition and combustion kinetics. In the\nnumerical simulations, the kinetic mechanism is combined with a detailed\nquadvariate soot model which uses the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments\nand validated with Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser-Induced\nIncandescence (LII) measurements. It is observed, that the three investigated\nOMEn with n=2-4 show similar sooting behavior, mainly reducing larger\naggregates while not significantly affecting the formation of smaller\nparticles.

Even though there are\nextensions of VQE-type methods for excited states, these methods suffer from\noptimization problems. Alternatively, the quantum Krylov subspace (QKS) concept\nhas been proposed to calculate ground and excited states, providing a low-cost\nalternative to quantum phase estimation. However, current QKS methods rely on a\npre-generated subspace via real- or imaginary-time evolutions.

The residues of eigenstates are used to expand the Krylov subspace,\nleading to a compact Krylov subspace close to the exact solutions.\nConsequently, fast convergence is achieved compared to other QKS methods (e.g.,\nquantum Lanczos). The newly proposed QDavidson algorithm is employed to study\nthe excited-state properties of various systems, including the Heisenberg spin\nmodel and real molecules on quantum simulators.

The\nproblem can be seen as a generalization of the classic list update problem to\ntrees, and finds applications in reconfigurable datacenter networks. We are\ngiven a fixed balanced binary tree T connecting n nodes V = {v_1, ... , v_n}. A\nsource node v_0, attached to the root of the tree, issues communication\nrequests to nodes in V, in an online and adversarial manner; the access cost of\na request to a node v, is given by the current depth of v in T. The online\nalgorithm can try to reduce the access cost by performing swap operations, with\nwhich the position of a node is exchanged with the position of its parent in\nthe tree; a swap operation costs one unit. The objective is to design an online\nalgorithm which minimizes the total access cost plus adjustment cost\n(swapping). Avin et al. recently presented Random-Push, a constant competitive\nonline algorithm for this problem, based on random walks, together with an\nanalysis exploiting the most recently used (MRU) property of random walks.\n  We study analytically and empirically, online algorithms for this problem. In\nparticular, we explore how to derandomize Random-Push. We consider a simple\nderandomized algorithm which we call Rotor-Push, as its behavior is reminiscent\nof rotor walks. We first prove that Rotor-Push is constant competitive: its\ncompetitive ratio is 12 and hence by a factor of five lower than the best\nexisting competitive ratio. In contrast to Random-Push, the algorithm does not\nfeature the MRU property, which requires a new analysis. We present a\nsignificantly improved and simpler analysis for the randomized algorithm,\nshowing that it is 16-competitive. We compare empirically all self-adjusting\nsingle-source tree networks, using synthetic and real data with varying\nlocality and observe that Rotor-Push and Random-Push have almost identical\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

The\nadvantage of the latter type, which includes Boltzmann rationality, is the\nability to make accurate predictions in new environments without extensive data\nwhen humans are actually close to optimal.

In particular, the mathematical structure of this\nlimit, which is now well-established thanks to its reformulation as an optimal\ntransport problem, points to the use of very different ingredients (or\nfeatures) with respect to the traditional ones used in present approximations.\nWe focus on strategies to use these new ingredients to build approximations for\ncomputational chemistry and highlight future promising directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

However, our ability to use this\ninformation to generate actionable insights about residential electricity\ndemand remains limited. In this research, we propose and test a new framework\nfor understanding residential electricity demand by using a dynamic energy\nlifestyles approach that is iterative and highly extensible. To obtain energy\nlifestyles, we develop a novel approach that applies Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA), a method commonly used for inferring the latent topical\nstructure of text data, to extract a series of latent household energy\nattributes. By doing so, we provide a new perspective on household electricity\nconsumption where each household is characterized by a mixture of energy\nattributes that form the building blocks for identifying a sparse collection of\nenergy lifestyles. We examine this approach by running experiments on one year\nof hourly smart meter data from 60,000 households and we extract six energy\nattributes that describe general daily use patterns. We then use clustering\ntechniques to derive six distinct energy lifestyle profiles from energy\nattribute proportions. Our lifestyle approach is also flexible to varying time\ninterval lengths, and we test our lifestyle approach seasonally (Autumn,\nWinter, Spring, and Summer) to track energy lifestyle dynamics within and\nacross households and find that around 73% of households manifest multiple\nlifestyles across a year. These energy lifestyles are then compared to\ndifferent energy use characteristics, and we discuss their practical\napplications for demand response program design and lifestyle change analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Here, we hypothesize that a high curvature hemi-ellipsoid detector\nresults in measurable differences in light distribution from events at\ndifferent depths in the crystal. This was tested by analyzing the scintillation\nlight in hemi-ellipsoid detector using Monte-Carlo (Geant4) and evaluation of\nboth the localization error at detector and the back-projected errors in\nobject-space. We used Geant4 to simulate the propagation of scintillation light\nin a monolithic hemi-ellipsoidal CsI crystal. A look-up table (LUT) was created\nto map the points inside the crystal to the expected light pattern on the\ncrystal surface using Geant4. In thirteen zones across the crystal, gamma-rays\nwere simulated and the resulting scintillator light intensity on the surface\nwas captured, serving as our experimental interactions. A\nPoisson-statistics-based algorithm was developed to limit the search of the\ngamma-ray event locations into small regions of the LUT and fine-tuned by\ninterpolating between selected LUT points by comparing the light distribution\nof the gamma interactions and LUT light patterns. The localized events were\nindividually back-projected to the object mid-plane, and the errors recorded.\nExcluding some outliers (up to 2%), the localized errors averaged over all the\nzones was 0.71 (+/-0.44) mm with a worse case of 1.36 (+/-0.67) mm at the apex.\nWhen back-projected to the midplane of the object for Cardiac SPECT, the errors\nwere <1mm and average error was 0.4(+/-0.22) mm, due to the high system\nmagnification afforded by the detector. Thus, for our high sensitivity system,\nwe were also able to achieve high resolution, assuming perfect pinhole\ncollimator resolution recovery for Cardiac SPECT application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

NMDC significantly changes major anatomy of the dynamics,\ni.e. it gives new late-time attractor trajectories in acceleration regions. The\nholographic part clearly affects pattern of trajectories. However, for the\nholographic part to affect shape of the acceleration region, the NMDC field\nmust be in presence. To constrain the model at late time, variation of\ngravitational constant is considered.

Existing attack methods construct such adversaries by randomly\nselecting some clean data from the benign set and then embedding a trigger into\nthem.

We further argue that the structures of brain and natural\nenvironment are closely related.\n  Results: We propose that the structural regularity of the brain takes the\nform of net fragments (self-organized network patterns) and that these serve as\nthe powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalize\nfrom few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals\nand concrete situations.\n  Conclusions: Our results have important bearings on open problems in\nartificial neural network research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 10:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

In recent years,\nseveral countries have made huge investments in developing smart cities to\noffer sustainable living. However, there are some challenges to overcome in\nsmart city development, such as traffic and transportation man-agement, energy\nand water distribution and management, air quality and waste management\nmonitoring, etc. The capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and\nartificial intelligence (AI) can help to achieve some goals of smart cities,\nand there are proven examples from some cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, etc.\nHowever, the adoption of AI and the IoT in developing countries has some\nchallenges. The analysis of challenges hindering the adoption of AI and the IoT\nare very limited. This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the\ncausal relationships among the challenges in smart city development, and\ncontains several parts that conclude the previous scholars work, as well as\nindependent research and investigation, such as data collection and analysis\nbased on DEMATEL. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to extract key\nchal-lenges for the adoption of AI and the IoT. These helped us to proceed with\nthe investigation and analyze the adoption status. Therefore, using the PRISMA\nmethod, 10 challenges were identified from the literature review. Subsequently,\ndetermination of the causal inter-relationships among the key challenges based\non expert opinions using DEMATEL is performed. This study explored the driving\nand dependent power of the challenges, and causal relationships between the\nbarriers were established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 14:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

One possibility is that it gives rise to gravity.\nIn the optical-mechanical analogy in general relativity, relativistic light\ndeflection is treated as refraction in an optical medium of varying density\ngradient. We now model the optical medium analogue of spacetime as a real\ngraviton conjugate interlinking all masses. Gravitons in local mass systems are\nassumed to be organized in coherent quantum states overlapping with those of\nparticles within spacetime structures. With the Hubble redshift, however,\ngravitons acquire longer wavelengths as they are shifted to less coherent\nstates. Assuming that the momentum and energy lost from gravitons is\ntransferrable to particles, mutual screening by masses then gives rise to an\nattractive force with a magnitude consistent with gravity. Some possible\ncosmological implications of the model are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Introduced in 2009, the GSA already\nhas several versions and applications. However, its performance depends on the\nvalues of its parameters, which are determined empirically. Hence, its\ngenerality is compromised, because the parameters that are suitable for a\nparticular application are not necessarily suitable for another. This paper\nproposes the Gravitational Search Algorithm with Normalized Gravitational\nConstant (GSA-NGC), which defines a new heuristic to determine the initial\ngravitational constant of the GSA. The new heuristic is grounded in the\nBrans-Dicke theory of gravitation and takes into consideration the multiple\ndimensions of the search space of the application. It aims to improve the final\nsolution and reduce the number of iterations and premature convergences of the\nGSA. The GSA-NGC is validated experimentally, proving to be suitable for\nvarious applications and improving significantly the generality, performance,\nand efficiency of the GSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 21:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}
