We apply this analysis framework to a series of\nreplica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of linear and 1-1\ncoarse-grained homo-oligomer models which fold into stable, configurationally\nwell-defined molecular knots, in order to better understand the parameters\nleading to stable and cooperative folding of these knots.

It is\nenvisioned to enhance the signal coverage in cases when the direct link of the\ncommunication is weak. Recently, beam training based on codebook selection is\nproposed to obtain the optimized phase configuration of the RIS. After that,\nthe data is transmitted and received by using the classical coherent\ndemodulation scheme (CDS). This training approach is able to avoid the large\noverhead required by the channel sounding process, and it also circumvents\ncomplex optimization problems. However, the beam training still requires the\ntransmission of some reference signals to test the different phase\nconfigurations of the codebook, and the best codeword is chosen according to\nthe measurement of the received energy of the reference signals. Then, the\noverhead due to the transmission of reference signals reduces the spectral\nefficiency. In this paper, a zero overhead beam training for RIS is proposed,\nrelying on data transmission and reception based on non-CDS (NCDS). At the BS,\nthe received differential data can also be used for the determination of the\nbest beam for the RIS. Therefore, the efficiency of the system is significantly\nenhanced since reference signals are fully avoided. After choosing the best\ncodebook, NCDS is still more suitable to transmit information for high mobility\nscenarios as compared to the classical CDS. Analytical expressions for the\nSignal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) for the non-coherent\nRIS-empowered system are presented. Moreover, a detailed comparison between the\nNCDS and CDS in terms of efficiency and complexity is also given.

Compressive\nsensing's vast repertoire of applications in areas such as communications and\nimage reconstruction stems from the traditional approach of utilizing\nnon-linear optimization to exploit the sparsity assumption by selecting the\nlowest-weight (i.e. maximum sparsity) signal consistent with all acquired\nmeasurements. Recent efforts in the literature consider instead a data-driven\napproach, training tensor networks to learn the structure of signals of\ninterest. The trained tensor network is updated to \"project\" its state onto one\nconsistent with the measurements taken, and is then sampled site by site to\n\"guess\" the original signal. In this paper, we take advantage of this computing\nprotocol by formulating an alternative \"quantum\" protocol, in which the state\nof the tensor network is a quantum state over a set of entangled qubits.\nAccordingly, we present the associated algorithms and quantum circuits required\nto implement the training, projection, and sampling steps on a quantum\ncomputer. We supplement our theoretical results by simulating the proposed\ncircuits with a small, qualitative model of LIDAR imaging of earth forests. Our\nresults indicate that a quantum, data-driven approach to compressive sensing,\nmay have significant promise as quantum technology continues to make new leaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 16:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 16:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

We thus consider the two-component case, that\nis a system of heavy and light stars with assigned mass ratio ($\\mu$) and\nassigned global relative abundance ($\\alpha$; the ratio of the total mass of\nthe heavy and light stars). The system is imagined to start from an initial\ncondition in which the two species are well mixed and have identical spatial\nand velocity distributions and to evolve into a final configuration in which\ncollisions have generated equipartition and mass segregation. Initial and final\ndistribution functions are assumed to be Maxwellian.

However, conventional simulation suffers from being\ntrapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. Thus, most\ncomputational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. This leads\nto an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of\nprotein movements in affordable simulation time. The advancement of deep\nlearning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. Variational\nautoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional\nrepresentation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key\nfeatures of the input data. Based on this characteristic, we proposed a new\nadaptive sampling method, latent space assisted adaptive sampling for protein\ntrajectories (LAST), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational\nspace. This method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoders training,\n(ii) seed structure selection on the latent space and (iii) conformational\nsampling through additional MD simulations. The proposed approach is validated\nthrough the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable\nstates of E. Coli adenosine kinase (ADK) and two native states of Vivid (VVD).\nIn all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of\nconformation distributions. Moreover, large conformational changes were\nobserved in a shorter simulation time when compared with conventional MD (cMD)\nsimulations in both systems. In metastable ADK simulations, LAST explored two\ntransition paths toward two stable states while cMD became trapped in an energy\nbasin. In VVD light state simulations, LAST was three times faster than cMD\nsimulation with a similar conformational space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 16:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

However, more sophisticated phishing attacks (such as spear-phishing\nand whaling) are rarely designed to get the end-user to visit a website.\nInstead, they attempt to get the end-user to perform some other action, for\nexample, transferring money from their bank account to the mal-actors account.\nThese attacks are rarer, and before-the-click defence has been investigated\nless than after-the-click defence.

We studied\nobservations from the Parker Solar Probe of a sheath observed at 0.5 au in\nMarch 2019, ahead of a slow streamer blowout CME. To examine the MHD-scale\nturbulent properties, we calculated fluctuation amplitudes, magnetic\ncompressibility, partial variance of increments (PVI), cross helicity\n($\\sigma_c$), residual energy ($\\sigma_r$), and the Jensen-Shannon permutation\nentropy and complexity. The sheath consisted of slow and fast flows separated\nby a 15-min change in magnetic sector that coincided with current sheet\ncrossings and a velocity shear zone. Fluctuation amplitudes and PVI were\ngreater through the sheath than upstream. Fluctuations had mostly negative\n$\\sigma_r$ and positive $\\sigma_c$ in the sheath, the latter indicating an\nanti-sunward sense of propagation. The velocity shear region marked an increase\nin temperature and specific entropy, and the faster flow behind had local\npatches of positive $\\sigma_r$ as well as higher fluctuation amplitudes and\nPVI. Fluctuations in the preceding wind and sheath were stochastic, with the\nsheath fluctuations showing lower entropy and higher complexity than upstream.\nThe two-part sheath structure likely resulted from a warp in the heliospheric\ncurrent sheet (HCS) being swept up and compressed. The ejecta accelerated and\nheated the wind at the sheath rear, which then interacted with the slower wind\nahead of the HCS warp. This caused differences in fluctuation properties across\nthe sheath. Sheaths of slow ICMEs can thus have complex structure where\nfluctuation properties are not just downstream shock properties, but are\ngenerated within the sheath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 16:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

In this work, the nonparametric framework of kernel\nregression is used to accumulate the FLA number density contributions of\nindividual droplets in accordance with the spatial structure of the dispersed\nphase. The high variation which is observed in the droplet number density field\nfor unsteady flows is accounted for by using the Eulerian-Lagrangian\ntransformation tensor, which is central to the FLA, to specify the size and\nshape of the kernel associated with each droplet. This procedure enables a high\nlevel of structural detail to be retained, and it is demonstrated that far\nfewer droplets have to be tracked in order to reconstruct a faithful Eulerian\nrepresentation of the dispersed phase. Furthermore, the kernel regression\nprocedure is easily extended to higher dimensions, and inclusion of the droplet\nradius within the phase space description additionally enables the droplet size\ndistribution and its statistics, such as average and variance, to be determined\nfor polydisperse flows.

Here, we continue to examine the different dynamics encountered\nwhen these structures are considered as concentrations in a volume-filling\nmagnetic field rather than as isolated entities in a field-free background. Via\n2.5D numerical simulations, we consider the buoyant rise of magnetic flux\nconcentrations from a radiative zone through an overshooting convection zone\nthat self-consistently (via magnetic pumping) arranges a volume-filling\nlarge-scale background field. This work extends earlier papers that considered\nthe evolution of such structures in a purely adiabatic stratification with an\nassumed form of the background field. This earlier work established the\nexistence of a bias that created an increased likelihood of successful rise for\nmagnetic structures with one (relative) orientation of twist and a decreased\nlikelihood for the other. When applied to the solar context, this bias is\ncommensurate with the solar hemispherical helicity rules (SHHR). This paper\nestablishes the robustness of this selection mechanism in a model incorporating\na more realistic background state, consisting of overshooting convection and a\nturbulently-pumped mean magnetic field. Ultimately, convection only weakly\ninfluences the selection mechanism, since it is enacted at the initiation of\nthe rise, at the edge of the overshoot zone. Convection does however add\nanother layer of statistical fluctuations to the bias, which we investigate in\norder to explain variations in the SHHR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 17:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

In particular, to solve the inherent\nambiguity among four implicit variables, i.e., camera position, shape, texture,\nand illumination, we introduce an explainable structural causal map (SCM) to\nbuild our model. The proposed model structure follows the spirit of the causal\nmap, which explicitly considers the prior template in the camera estimation and\nshape prediction. When optimization, the causality intervention tool, i.e., two\nexpectation-maximization loops, is deeply embedded in our algorithm to (1)\ndisentangle four encoders and (2) facilitate the prior template. Extensive\nexperiments on two 2D fashion benchmarks (ATR and Market-HQ) show that the\nproposed method could yield high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.

Compilers are required to introduce SWAP operations in order to perform\ntwo-qubit gates between non-adjacent qubits. SWAPs increase the number of gates\nand depth of programs, making them even more vulnerable to errors. Moreover,\nthey relocate qubits which affect SWAP selections for future gates in a\nprogram. Thus, compilers must select SWAP routes that not only minimize the\noverheads for the current operation, but also for future gates. Existing\ncompilers tend to select paths with the fewest SWAPs for the current\noperations, but do not evaluate the impact of the relocations from the selected\nSWAP candidate on future SWAPs. Also, they converge on SWAP candidates for the\ncurrent operation and only then decide SWAP routes for future gates, thus\nseverely restricting the SWAP candidate search space for future operations.\n  We propose ForeSight, a compiler that simultaneously evaluates multiple SWAP\ncandidates for several operations into the future, delays SWAP selections to\nanalyze their impact on future SWAP decisions and avoids early convergence on\nsub-optimal candidates. Moreover, ForeSight evaluates slightly longer SWAP\nroutes for current operations if they have the potential to reduce SWAPs for\nfuture gates, thus reducing SWAPs for the program globally. As compilation\nproceeds, ForeSight dynamically adds new SWAP candidates to the solution space\nand eliminates the weaker ones. This allows ForeSight to reduce SWAP overheads\nat program-level while keeping the compilation complexity tractable.

In this paper, rather than making the\nstandard no unmeasured confounding assumption, we extend the recently proposed\nproximal causal inference framework of Miao et al.

However, manually\ndesigning a good loss is a big challenge due to the complexity of the problem.\nA large fraction of previous work focuses on handcrafted loss functions, which\nneeds significant expertise and human effort. In this paper, inspired by the\nrecent development of automated machine learning, we propose an automatic loss\nfunction generation framework, AutoLossGen, which is able to generate loss\nfunctions directly constructed from basic mathematical operators without prior\nknowledge on loss structure. More specifically, we develop a controller model\ndriven by reinforcement learning to generate loss functions, and develop\niterative and alternating optimization schedule to update the parameters of\nboth the controller model and the recommender model. One challenge for\nautomatic loss generation in recommender systems is the extreme sparsity of\nrecommendation datasets, which leads to the sparse reward problem for loss\ngeneration and search. To solve the problem, we further develop a reward\nfiltering mechanism for efficient and effective loss generation. Experimental\nresults show that our framework manages to create tailored loss functions for\ndifferent recommendation models and datasets, and the generated loss gives\nbetter recommendation performance than commonly used baseline losses. Besides,\nmost of the generated losses are transferable, i.e., the loss generated based\non one model and dataset also works well for another model or dataset.

One approach to incorporate the\npreferences in multi-objective BO is to use a scalarising function and build a\nsingle surrogate model (mono-surrogate approach) on it. This approach has two\nmajor limitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function\nand the objective functions may not be similar.

Accurate, efficient models of\nstorm surge are needed both to assess long-term risk and to guide emergency\nmanagement decisions. While high-fidelity regional- and global-ocean\ncirculation models such as the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model can\naccurately predict storm surge, they are very computationally expensive. Here\nwe develop a novel surrogate model for peak storm surge prediction based on a\nmulti-stage approach. In the first stage, points are classified as inundated or\nnot. In the second, the level of inundation is predicted . Additionally, we\npropose a new formulation of the surrogate problem in which storm surge is\npredicted independently for each point. This allows for predictions to be made\ndirectly for locations not present in the training data, and significantly\nreduces the number of model parameters. We demonstrate our modeling framework\non two study areas: the Texas coast and the northern portion of the Alaskan\ncoast. For Texas, the model is trained with a database of 446 synthetic\nhurricanes. The model is able to accurately match ADCIRC predictions on a test\nset of synthetic storms. We further present a test of the model on Hurricanes\nIke (2008) and Harvey (2017). For Alaska, the model is trained on a dataset of\n109 historical surge events. We test the surrogate model on actual surge events\nincluding the recent Typhoon Merbok (2022) that take place after the events in\nthe training data. For both datasets, the surrogate model achieves similar\nperformance to ADCIRC on real events when compared to observational data. In\nboth cases, the surrogate models are many orders of magnitude faster than\nADCIRC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 20:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 18:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Many physical properties in multiscale media often vary\nin very different scales. In order to capture multiscale information well, the\ndimension of collected data may be high. To accurately construct the models of\ndynamical systems in multiscale media, we use high spatial dimension of\nobservation data. It is challenging to compute the Koopman operators using the\nvery high dimensional data. Thus, the strategy of reduced-order modeling is\nproposed to treat the difficulty. The proposed reduced-order modeling includes\ntwo stages: offline stage and online stage. In offline stage, a block-wise low\nrank decomposition is used to reduce the spatial dimension of initial snapshot\ndata. For the nonautonomous dynamical systems, real-time observation data may\nbe required to update the Koopman operators. The online reduced-order modeling\nis proposed to correct the offline reduced-order modeling. Three methods are\ndeveloped for the online reduced-order modeling: fully online, semi-online and\nadaptive online. The adaptive online method automatically selects the fully\nonline or semi-online and can achieve a good trade-off between modeling\naccuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 20:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 18:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

A crucial element for network performance is the protocol\nstack, namely the sets of rules and data formats that determine how the nodes\nin the network exchange information. A great effort has been put to devise\nformal techniques to synthesize (offline) network protocols, starting from\nsystem specifications and strict assumptions on the network environment.\nHowever, offline design can be hard to apply in the most modern network\napplications, either due to numerical complexity, or to the fact that the\nenvironment might be unknown and the specifications might not available. In\nthese cases, online protocol design and adaptation has the potential to offer a\nmuch more scalable and robust solution. Nevertheless, so far only a few\nattempts have been done towards online automatic protocol design. Here, we\nenvision a protocol as an emergent property of a network, obtained by an\nenvironment-driven Distributed Hill Climbing algorithm that uses node-local\nreinforcement signals to evolve, at runtime and without any central\ncoordination, a network protocol from scratch.

In the VEM, the basis\nfunctions are defined as the solution of a local elliptic partial differential\nequation, and are never explicitly computed in the implementation of the\nmethod. The stifness matrix of each element is built by using the elliptic\nprojection operator of the internal virtual work (bilinear form) and it\nconsists of two terms: a consistency term that is exactly computed (linear\npatch test is satisfied) and a correction term (ensures stability) that is\northogonal to affine displacement fields and has the right scaling.

In these advanced fuels, thermal energy transport under\nirradiation is directly related to reactor performance as well as reactor\nsafety. The science of thermal transport in nuclear fuel is a grand challenge\ndue to both computational and experimental complexities. Here, we provide a\ncomprehensive review of thermal transport research on two actinide oxides: one\ncurrently in use in commercial nuclear reactors, uranium dioxide (UO2), and one\nadvanced fuel candidate material, thorium dioxide (ThO2). In both materials,\nheat is carried by lattice waves or phonons. Crystalline defects caused by\nfission events effectively scatter phonons and lead to a degradation in fuel\nperformance over time. Bolstered by new computational and experimental tools,\nresearchers are now developing the foundational work necessary to accurately\nmodel and ultimately control thermal transport in advanced nuclear fuel. We\nbegin by reviewing research aimed at understanding thermal transport in perfect\nsingle crystals. The absence of defects enables studies that focus on the\nfundamental aspects of phonon transport. Next, we review research that targets\ndefect generation and evolution. Here, the focus is on ion irradiation studies\nused as surrogates for damage caused by fission products. We end this review\nwith a discussion of modeling and experimental efforts directed at predicting\nand validating mesoscale thermal transport in the presence of irradiation\ndefects. While efforts into these research areas have been robust, challenging\nwork remains in developing holistic tools to capture and predict thermal energy\ntransport across widely varying environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

Localization using only one camera can be challenging in\nmedium-to-large-sized environments because similar-looking images are often\nobserved repeatedly, especially in indoor environments. To overcome this issue,\nwe propose a learning-based localization method that simultaneously utilizes\nthe spatial consistency from topological maps and the temporal consistency from\ntime-series images captured by the robot. Our method combines a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to embed image features and a recurrent-type graph neural\nnetwork to perform accurate localization. When training our model, it is\ndifficult to obtain the ground truth pose of the robot when capturing images in\nreal-world environments. Hence, we propose a sim2real transfer approach with\nsemi-supervised learning that leverages simulator images with the ground truth\npose in addition to real images. We evaluated our method quantitatively and\nqualitatively and compared it with several state-of-the-art baselines. The\nproposed method outperformed the baselines in environments where the map\ncontained similar images. Moreover, we evaluated an image-based navigation\nsystem incorporating our localization method and confirmed that navigation\naccuracy significantly improved in the simulator and real environments when\ncompared with the other baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

To this end, we obtained near-infrared\nspectroscopic observations of a sample of low-redshift bulgeless galaxies with\nmid-infrared colors suggestive of AGN. We find additional evidence of AGN\nactivity (such as coronal lines and broad permitted lines) in 69$\\%$ (9/13) of\nthe sample, demonstrating that mid-infrared selection is a powerful tool to\ndetect AGN. More than half of the galaxies with confirmed AGN activity show\nfast outflows in [O III] in the optical and/or [Si VI] in the NIR, with the\nlatter generally having much faster velocities that are also correlated to\ntheir spatial extent.

The fact that they lack a\nsignificant bulge component indicates that secular processes, likely\nindependent of major mergers, grew these BHs to supermassive sizes. Finally, we\nanalyze the rotational gas kinematics and find two notable exceptions: two AGN\nhosts with outflows that appear to be rotating faster than expected. There is\nan indication that these two galaxies have stellar masses significantly lower\nthan expected from their dark matter halo masses. This, combined with the\nobserved AGN activity and strong gas outflows may be evidence of the effects of\nAGN feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-01"}

Some of the reason for this are their low-cost, their\npolarisation-insensitive and their high-refresh rates. As such, in this\nmanuscript we put forward a novel technique characterised by its high\nstability, which is achieved through a common-path interferometer.

The paper assumes that the geo-satellite is\nconnected to the HAPS using free-space-optical backhaul link. The HAPS,\nequipped with multiple antennas, aims at transmitting the geo-satellite data to\nthe users via radio-frequency (RF) links using spatial-multiplexing. Each\nground BS, on the other hand, is equipped with multiple antennas, but directly\nserves the users through the RF links. The paper then focuses on maximizing the\nnetwork-wide throughput, subject to HAPS payload connectivity constraint, HAPS\nand BSs power constraints, and backhaul constraints, so as to jointly determine\nthe user association strategy of each user (i.e., user to geo-satellite via\nHAPS, or user to BS), and their associated beamforming vectors. We tackle such\na mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem using an iterative approach,\nwhere the user association is determined using a combination of integer linear\nprogramming and generalized assignment problems, and where the beamforming\nstrategy is found using a weighted-minimum-mean-squared-error approach.

However, the existing\nTTA methods lack feature distribution alignment between the source and target\ndomains, which unsupervised domain adaptation mainly addresses, because\naccessing the source dataset is prohibited in the TTA setting. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel TTA method, named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe),\nwhich explicitly aligns the source and target feature distributions at test\ntime. To perform alignment without accessing the source data, CAFe uses\nauxiliary feature statistics (mean and covariance) pre-computed on the source\ndomain, which are lightweight and easily prepared. Further, to improve\nefficiency and stability, we propose feature grouping, which splits the feature\ndimensions into groups according to their correlations by using spectral\nclustering to avoid degeneration of the covariance matrix.

However,\nthe converted spiking neural network often suffers from performance degradation\nand a considerable time delay.

The proposed framework combines the two fundamentally different\nclassical optimization approaches for the development of coarse-grained model\nparameters; namely bottom-up and top-down approaches. This is achieved through\nintegrating the optimization algorithms into a machine learning (ML) model,\ntrained using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. In the bottom-up\napproach, bonded interactions of the CG model are optimized using deep neural\nnetworks (DNN), where atomistic bonded distributions are matched. The atomistic\ndistributions emulate the local chain structure. In the top-down approach,\noptimization of nonbonded potentials is accomplished by reproducing the\ntemperature-dependent experimental density. We demonstrate that CG model\nparameters achieved through our machine-learning enabled hybrid optimization\nframework fulfills the thermodynamic consistency and transferability issues\nassociated with the classical approaches to coarse-graining model polymers. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and transferability of the developed CG\nmodel, using our novel framework through accurate predictions of chain size as\nwell as chain dynamics, including the limiting behavior of the glass transition\ntemperature, diffusion, and stress relaxation spectrum, where none were\nincluded in the potential parameterization process.

Based on the\nidea, we propose the Staged Sparse Row (SSR) sparse matrix representation that\ncan efficiently cover applications on structured grids. With SSR\nrepresentation, users can intuitively define SSR matrices using generator\nfunctions and use SSR matrices through a concise object-oriented interface.

Multiple challenges hamper the applications of vision-based vehicle\nRe-ID methods: (1) The appearances of different vehicles of the same\nbrand/model are often similar; However, (2) the appearances of the same vehicle\ndiffer significantly from different viewpoints. Previous methods mainly use\nmanually annotated multi-attribute datasets to assist the network in getting\ndetailed cues and in inferencing multi-view to improve the vehicle Re-ID\nperformance. However, finely labeled vehicle datasets are usually unattainable\nin real application scenarios. Hence, we propose a Discriminative-Region\nAttention and Orthogonal-View Generation (DRA-OVG) model, which only requires\nidentity (ID) labels to conquer the multiple challenges of vehicle Re-ID.The\nproposed DRA model can automatically extract the discriminative region\nfeatures, which can distinguish similar vehicles. And the OVG model can\ngenerate multi-view features based on the input view features to reduce the\nimpact of viewpoint mismatches. Finally, the distance between vehicle\nappearances is presented by the discriminative region features and multi-view\nfeatures together. Therefore, the significance of pairwise distance measure\nbetween vehicles is enhanced in acomplete feature space.

This year marks the $101$-st\nanniversary of R.U.R., a play by the writer Karel \\v{C}apek, often credited\nwith introducing the word \"robot\". The word used to refer to feudal forced\nlabourers in Slavic languages. Indeed, it points to one key characteristic of\nrobotic systems: they are mere slaves, have no rights, and execute our wills\ninstruction by instruction, without asking anything in return. The relationship\nwith us humans is commensalism; in biology, commensalism subsists between two\nsymbiotic species when one species benefits from it (robots boost productivity\nfor humans), while the other species neither benefits nor is harmed (can you\nreally argue that robots benefit from simply functioning?).\n  We then distinguish robots from \"living machines\", that is, machines infused\nwith life. If living machines should ever become a reality, we would need to\nshift our relationship with them from commensalism to mutualism. The\ndistinction is not subtle: we experience it every day with domesticated\nanimals, that exchange serfdom for forage and protection. This is because life\nhas evolved to resist any attempt at enslaving it; it is stubborn.\n  In the path towards living machines, let us ask: what has been achieved by\nrobotics in the last $100$ years? What is left to accomplish in the next $100$\nyears? For us, the answers boil down to three words: juice, need (or death),\nand embodiment, as we shall see in the following.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 08:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

Firstly, let the queue model be Ber/G/1/1, we obtain the\nAoI-distribution by introducing a two-dimensional AoI-stochastic process and\nsolving its steady state, which describes the random evolutions of AoI and age\nof packet in system simultaneously. In this case, actually we analyze a more\ngeneral queue called probabilistic preemption Ber/G/1/1, where the packet\nservice is allowed to be preempted with certain probabilities. As a special\ncase, stationary AoI-distribution for the system with Ber/Geo/1/1 queue is\nobtained either. For the system having size 2, two specific queues are\nconsidered, i.e., the Ber/Geo/1/2 and Ber/Geo/1/2* queues. The core idea to\nfind the stationary AoI-distribution is that the random transitions of\nthree-dimensional vector including AoI at the receiver, the packet age in\nservice, and the age of waiting packet can be fully described, such that a\nthree-dimensional AoI process is constituted. The stationary distribution of\nthree-dimensional process then gives the stationary AoI distribution as one of\nits marginal distributions. For both cases, the explicit expressions of\nAoI-distribution are derived, thus giving the complete description of the\nsteady state AoI for the system. For all the cases, since the steady state of a\nlarger-dimensional AoI process is solved, so that except the AoI-distribution,\nwe obtain more. For instance, the distributions of packet system time and\nwaiting time for size-two updating system, and the so-called violation\nprobabilities that AoI exceeds certain threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 08:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

In addition, we design\ninter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD\niterations to rectify the intrinsic information loss in most deep unfolding\nnetworks (DUN) through a multi-scale and spatial-adaptive way. By integrating\nthe flexible gradient descent and informative proximal mapping, we unfold the\niterative PGD algorithm into a trainable DNN. Extensive experiments on various\nimage restoration tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of\nstate-of-the-art performance, interpretability, and generalizability.

This poses a challenge\nparticularly in intelligent diagnosis systems where initially only training\ndata of a limited number of diseases are available. In this case, updating the\nintelligent system with data of new diseases would inevitably downgrade its\nperformance on previously learned diseases. Inspired by the process of learning\nnew knowledge in human brains, we propose a Bayesian generative model for\ncontinual learning built on a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. In this\nmodel, knowledge of each old class can be compactly represented by a collection\nof statistical distributions, e.g. with Gaussian mixture models, and naturally\nkept from forgetting in continual learning over time. Unlike existing\nclass-incremental learning methods, the proposed approach is not sensitive to\nthe continual learning process and can be additionally well applied to the\ndata-incremental learning scenario. Experiments on multiple medical and natural\nimage classification tasks showed that the proposed approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches which even keep some images of old classes during\ncontinual learning of new classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 08:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

It breaks with the classic design paradigm of\nShannon by aiming to transmit the meaning of a message, i.e., semantics, rather\nthan its exact copy and thus allows for savings in information rate. In this\nwork, we extend the fundamental approach from Basu et al. for modeling\nsemantics to the complete communications Markov chain. Thus, we model semantics\nby means of hidden random variables and define the semantic communication task\nas the data-reduced and reliable transmission of messages over a communication\nchannel such that semantics is best preserved.

In this second paper, we aim at deriving simultaneous expressions for\nthe excitation rate, damping rate, and modal surface effect associated with any\ngiven p-mode, as an explicit function of the statistical properties of the\nturbulent velocity field. We reduce the stochastic wave equation to complex\namplitude equations for the normal oscillating modes of the system. We then\nderive the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation for the real amplitudes and phases\nof all the oscillating modes of the system simultaneously. The effect of the\nfinite-memory time of the turbulent fluctuations (comparable to the period of\nthe modes) on the modes themselves is consistently and rigorously accounted\nfor, by means of the simplified amplitude equation formalism. This formalism\naccounts for mutual linear mode coupling in full, and we then turn to the\nspecial single-mode case. This allows us to derive evolution equations for the\nmean energy and mean phase of each mode, from which the excitation rate, the\ndamping rate, and the modal surface effect naturally arise.\n  We show that the expression for the excitation rate of the modes is identical\nto previous results obtained through a different modelling approach, thus\nsupporting the validity of the formalism presented here. We also recover the\nfact that the damping rate and modal surface effect correspond to the real and\nimaginary part of the same single complex quantity. We explicitly separate the\ndifferent physical contributions to these observables, in particular the\nturbulent pressure contribution and the joint effect of the\npressure-rate-of-strain correlation and the turbulent dissipation. We show that\nthe former dominates for high-frequency modes and the latter for low-frequency\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 09:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

While\nin the high density regime, a fraction of the dimers become rotationally jammed\ninto local clusters, and the system exhibits spinodal-decomposition like\ntwo-phase morphologies. For high enough densities, the system becomes\ncompletely jammed in both rotational and translational degrees of freedom. Such\na simple system is found to exhibit rich and multiscale disordered\nhyperuniformities among the above phases: the absorbing state shows a critical\nhyperuniformity of the strongest class and subcritically preserves the\nvanishing density-fluctuation scaling up to some length scale; the\nlocally-jammed state shows a two-phase hyperuniformity conversely beyond some\nlength scale with respect to the phase cluster sizes; the totally jammed state\nappears to be a monomer crystal, but intrinsically loses large-scale\nhyperuniformity.

After an initial computation step, our approach\nallows to instantaneously obtain the exact multipole decomposition for any\nillumination. Most importantly, since all possible illuminations are included\nin the generalized polarizabilities, our formalism allows to calculate the\ntotal density of multipole modes, regardless of a specific illumination, which\nis not possible with the conventional multipole expansion. Finally, our\napproach directly provides the optimum illumination field distributions that\nmaximally couple to specific multipole modes.

The\naim is to compare the computed mode spectra with the observations and to study\nmode stability.\n  At fixed radius, we solve the eigenvalue problem numerically using a\nspherical harmonics decomposition of the velocity stream function. Due to the\npresence of viscous critical layers, the spectrum consists of four different\nfamilies: Rossby modes, high-latitude modes, critical-latitude modes, and\nstrongly damped modes. For each longitudinal wavenumber m<4, up to three\nRossby-like modes are present on the sphere, in contrast to the equatorial beta\nplane where only the equatorial Rossby mode is present. The least damped modes\nin the model have eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions that resemble the\nobserved modes; the comparison improves when the radius is taken in the lower\nhalf of the convection zone. For radii above 0.75R and Ekman numbers E<10^{-4},\nat least one mode is unstable.

Two common\napproaches to achieve this distributed learning is synchronous and asynchronous\nweight update. In this manuscript, we have explored very simplistic synchronous\nweight update mechanisms. It has been seen that with an increasing number of\nworker nodes, the performance degrades drastically. This effect has been\nstudied in the context of extreme imbalanced classification (e.g. outlier\ndetection). In practical cases, the assumed conditions of i.i.d. may not be\nfulfilled. There may also arise global class imbalance situations like that of\noutlier detection where the local servers receive severely imbalanced data and\nmay not get any samples from the minority class. In that case, the DNNs in the\nlocal servers will get completely biased towards the majority class that they\nreceive. This would highly impact the learning at the parameter server (which\npractically does not see any data). It has been observed that in a parallel\nsetting if one uses the existing federated weight update mechanisms at the\nparameter server, the performance degrades drastically with the increasing\nnumber of worker nodes. This is mainly because, with the increasing number of\nnodes, there is a high chance that one worker node gets a very small portion of\nthe data, either not enough to train the model without overfitting or having a\nhighly imbalanced class distribution.

To overcome the two\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Relation guided Set Matching (HyRSM)\napproach that incorporates two key components: hybrid relation module and set\nmatching metric.

After spontaneous symmetry breaking the model has\na Standard-Model-like phenomenology and a hidden scalar sector with a viable\nDark Matter candidate supplemented by explicit CP violation that solely occurs\nin the hidden sector. The model `CP in the Dark' has been implemented in the\nC++ code BSMPT v2.3 which performs a global minimisation of the\nfinite-temperature one-loop corrected effective potential and searches for\nSFOEWPTs. An SFOEWPT is found to be allowed in a broad range of the parameter\nspace. Furthermore, there are parameter scenarios where spontaneous CP\nviolation is generated at finite temperature. The in addition spontaneously\nbroken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry then leads to mixing between the dark and the\nvisible sector so that CP violation in the dark is promoted at finite\ntemperature to the visible sector and thereby provides additional sources of CP\nviolation that are not restricted by the electric dipole moment measurements at\nzero temperature.

By properly adjusting this\nregularization term we show that the loss curves become smoother, and at the\nsame time Regotron consistently produces monotonic alignments in unseen\nexamples even at an early stage (13\\% of the total number of epochs) of its\ntraining process, whereas the fully converged Tacotron2 fails to do so.\nMoreover, our proposed regularization method has no additional computational\noverhead, while reducing common TTS mistakes and achieving slighlty improved\nspeech naturalness according to subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) collected\nfrom 50 evaluators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 12:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 10:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-15"}

Exact balancing alleviates the\nextreme weight and model misspecification issues that may incur when one\nimplements inverse probability weighting. It eliminates covariate imbalance by\nimposing balancing constraints in an optimization problem. The optimization\nproblem can nevertheless be infeasible when there is bad overlap between the\ncovariate distributions in the treated and control groups or when the\ncovariates are high-dimensional. Recently, approximate balancing was proposed\nas an alternative balancing framework, which resolves the feasibility issue by\nusing inequality moment constraints instead. However, it can be difficult to\nselect the threshold parameters when the number of constraints is large.\nMoreover, moment constraints may not fully capture the discrepancy of covariate\ndistributions. In this paper, we propose Mahalanobis balancing, which\napproximately balances covariate distributions from a multivariate perspective.\nWe use a quadratic constraint to control overall imbalance with a single\nthreshold parameter, which can be tuned by a simple selection procedure. We\nshow that the dual problem of Mahalanobis balancing is an l_2 norm-based\nregularized regression problem, and establish interesting connection to\npropensity score models. We further generalize Mahalanobis balancing to the\nhigh-dimensional scenario.

We use images in the\nfar-infrared at 70 micron and 160 micron to derive dust temperatures and dust\nmasses in the wind-ISM interaction regions around a sample of carbon-rich and\noxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The dust temperature and mass\nare determined in two ways. First directly from the data using the ratio of the\nmeasured fluxes and assuming opacities for dust with a constant grain size of\n0.1 micron. We then perform 3D dust-radiative transfer models spatially\nconstrained by the observations to consistently calculate the temperature and\nmass. For the radiative transfer models each model contains one constant grain\nsize, which is varied between 0.01 micron to 5.0 micron. We find that the\nobserved dust mass in the wind-ISM interaction regions is consistent with mass\naccumulated from the stellar winds. For the carbon-rich sources adding the\nspatial constraints in the radiative transfer models results in preferentially\nlarger grain sizes (approx. 2 micron). For the oxygen-rich sources the spatial\nconstraints result in too high temperatures in the models, making it impossible\nto fit the observed far-infrared ratio irrespective of the grain size used,\nindicating a more complex interplay of grain properties and the stellar\nradiation field.

Given this\ngoal, a natural question is: can we efficiently incorporate the relationships\namong light field cues while identifying clean labels in a unified framework?\nWe address this question by formulating the learning as a joint optimization of\nintra light field features fusion stream and inter scenes correlation stream to\ngenerate the predictions. Specially, we first introduce a pixel forgetting\nguided fusion module to mutually enhance the light field features and exploit\npixel consistency across iterations to identify noisy pixels. Next, we\nintroduce a cross scene noise penalty loss for better reflecting latent\nstructures of training data and enabling the learning to be invariant to noise.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our framework showing that it learns saliency prediction\ncomparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised light field saliency methods.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/OLobbCode/NoiseLF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 12:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

Given $(u, v)$ and a\npacket of weight $x$ going from $u$ to $v$, player $u$ can either accept or\nreject the packet. If player $u$ accepts the packet, their capacity on link\n$(u,v)$ decreases by $x$. Correspondingly, player $v$ capacity on $(u,v)$\nincreases by $x$. If a player rejects the packet, this will entail a cost\nlinear in the weight of the packet. A link is \"rechargeable\" in the sense that\nthe total capacity of the link has to remain constant, but the allocation of\ncapacity at the ends of the link can depend arbitrarily on players' decisions.\nThe goal is to minimise the sum of the capacity injected into the link and the\ncost of rejecting packets.

Less\ninvestigated are however the benefits of exploiting RIS with suitably designed\nbeamforming strategies for optimized localization and synchronization\nperformance. In this paper, a novel low-complexity method for joint\nlocalization and synchronization based on an optimized design of the base\nstation (BS) active precoding and RIS passive phase profiles is proposed, for\nthe challenging case of a single-antenna receiver. The theoretical position\nerror bound is first derived and used as metric to jointly optimize the BS-RIS\nbeamforming, assuming a priori knowledge of the user position. By exploiting\nthe low-dimensional structure of the solution, a novel codebook-based robust\ndesign strategy with optimized beam power allocation is then proposed, which\nprovides low-complexity while taking into account the uncertainty on the user\nposition. Finally, a reduced-complexity maximum-likelihood based estimation\nprocedure is devised to jointly recover the user position and the\nsynchronization offset. Extensive numerical analysis shows that the proposed\njoint BS-RIS beamforming scheme provides enhanced localization and\nsynchronization performance compared to existing solutions, with the proposed\nestimator attaining the theoretical bounds even at low signal-to-noise-ratio\nand in the presence of additional uncontrollable multipath propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

In such cases, one might be interested in\nmodifying the instance so that the existence of a stable outcome with the\ndesired properties is ensured.\n  We focus on three different modifications. In stable roommates problems with\nall capacities being one, we give a simpler proof to show that removing an\nagent from each odd cycle of a stable partition is optimal. We further show\nthat the problem becomes NP-complete if the capacities are greater than one, or\nthe deleted agents must belong to a fixed subset of vertices.\n  Motivated by inverse optimization problems, we investigate how to modify the\npreferences of the agents as little as possible so that a given matching\nbecomes stable.

Hyperspectral images are often generated in large quantities at a\nrelatively coarse spatial resolution.

This work introduces the Spatial-Spectral\nImage Reconstruction and Clustering with Diffusion Geometry (DSIRC) algorithm\nfor partitioning highly mixed hyperspectral images.

In particular, for\neach pixel, DSIRC locates spectrally correlated pixels within a data-adaptive\nspatial neighborhood and reconstructs that pixel's spectral signature using\nthose of its neighbors. DSIRC then locates high-density, high-purity pixels far\nin diffusion distance (a data-dependent distance metric) from other\nhigh-density, high-purity pixels and treats these as cluster exemplars, giving\neach a unique label. Non-modal pixels are assigned the label of their diffusion\ndistance-nearest neighbor of higher density and purity that is already labeled.\nStrong numerical results indicate that incorporating spatial information\nthrough image reconstruction substantially improves the performance of\npixel-wise clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

In this study, we focus on the plume behaviour\nin the near-field, demonstrating that for moderate injection rates the plume\nwill reach a steady state, whereby it matches the buoyancy velocity over a few\nplume width-scales from the injection point. However, for very small injection\nrates an instability occurs in which the steady plume breaks apart due to the\ninsurmountable density contrast with the surrounding fluid. The steady shape of\nthe plume in the near-field only depends on a single dimensionless parameter,\nwhich is the ratio between the inlet velocity and the buoyancy velocity. A\nlinear stability analysis is performed, indicating that for small velocity\nratios an infinitesimal perturbation can be constructed that becomes unstable,\nwhilst for moderate velocity ratios the shape is shown to be stable. Finally,\nwe comment on the application of such flows to the context of CO$_2$\nsequestration in porous geological reservoirs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, due to their large number of parameters, they are\nresource-intensive both to deploy and to fine-tune. Researchers have created\nseveral methods for distilling language models into smaller ones to increase\nefficiency, with a small performance trade-off. In this paper, we create\nseveral different distilled versions of the state-of-the-art Dutch RobBERT\nmodel and call them RobBERTje. The distillations differ in their distillation\ncorpus, namely whether or not they are shuffled and whether they are merged\nwith subsequent sentences. We found that the performance of the models using\nthe shuffled versus non-shuffled datasets is similar for most tasks and that\nrandomly merging subsequent sentences in a corpus creates models that train\nfaster and perform better on tasks with long sequences. Upon comparing\ndistillation architectures, we found that the larger DistilBERT architecture\nworked significantly better than the Bort hyperparametrization. Interestingly,\nwe also found that the distilled models exhibit less gender-stereotypical bias\nthan its teacher model. Since smaller architectures decrease the time to\nfine-tune, these models allow for more efficient training and more lightweight\ndeployment of many Dutch downstream language tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 14:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

It is shown\nthat the computed optimal gain, which can be seen as a transfer function of the\nsystem, follows a first-order low-pass filter equation, recovering the results\nof Touber and Sandham (JFM, 2011). This behaviour is understood as proceeding\nfrom the excitation of a single stable, steady global mode whose damping rate\nsets the time scale of the filter. Different Mach and Reynolds numbers are\nstudied, covering different recirculation lengths $L$. This damping rate is\nfound to scale as $1/L$, leading to a constant Strouhal number $St_L$ as\nobserved in the literature. It is associated with a breathing motion of the\nrecirculation bubble. This analysis furthermore supports the idea that the\nlow-frequency dynamics of the SWBLI is a forced dynamics, in which background\nperturbations continuously excite the flow.

At low wave\nnumbers of the order of $L$, a modal mechanism similar to that of 2D\nperturbations is found and exhibits larger values of the optimal gain. At\nlarger wave numbers of the order of the boundary layer thickness, the growth of\nstreaks, which results from a non-modal mechanism, is detected. No interaction\nwith the recirculation region is observed. Based on these results, the\npotential prevalence of 3D effects in the low-frequency dynamics of the SWBLI\nis discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 14:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Whilst batch queue systems are not\nideal in supporting such workloads, many disadvantages can be worked around by\naccurately predicting when a waiting job will start to run. However there are\nnumerous challenges in achieving such a prediction with high accuracy, not\nleast because the queue's state can change rapidly and depend upon many\nfactors. In this work we explore a novel machine learning approach for\npredicting queue wait times, hypothesising that such a model can capture the\ncomplex behaviour resulting from the queue policy and other interactions to\ngenerate accurate job start times.\n  For ARCHER2 (HPE Cray EX), Cirrus (HPE 8600) and 4-cabinet (HPE Cray EX) we\nexplore how different machine learning approaches and techniques improve the\naccuracy of our predictions, comparing against the estimation generated by\nSlurm.

In such videos, it is challenging for computer\nvision systems to understand high-level concepts such as goal-directed\nbehavior, an ability present in humans from a very early age. Inculcating this\nability in artificially intelligent agents would make them better social\nlearners by allowing them to evaluate human action under a teleological lens.\nTo validate the ability of deep learning models to perform this task, we curate\nthe W-Oops dataset, built upon the Oops dataset [15]. W-Oops consists of 2,100\nunintentional human action videos, with 44 goal-directed and 30 unintentional\nvideo-level activity labels collected through human annotations. Due to the\nexpensive segment annotation procedure, we propose a weakly supervised\nalgorithm for localizing the goal-directed as well as unintentional temporal\nregions in the video leveraging solely video-level labels. In particular, we\nemploy an attention mechanism-based strategy that predicts the temporal regions\nwhich contribute the most to a classification task. Meanwhile, our designed\noverlap regularization allows the model to focus on distinct portions of the\nvideo for inferring the goal-directed and unintentional activity while\nguaranteeing their temporal ordering. Extensive quantitative experiments verify\nthe validity of our localization method. We further conduct a video captioning\nexperiment which demonstrates that the proposed localization module does indeed\nassist teleological action understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 14:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

These interpretable matrices are deemed as trainable\ntensors in neural networks (NNs). The NNs are devised according to the\ndifferentiable semantics of LPs.

One of the most accepted theories suggests a\nviolent scenario involving high-eccentricity migration followed by tidal\ncircularization. Here, we present the discovery of a four planet system\norbiting the bright (V=10.5) K6 dwarf star TOI-500. The innermost planet is a\ntransiting, Earth-sized USP planet with an orbital period of $\\sim$ 13 hours, a\nmass of 1.42 $\\pm$ 0.18 M$_{\\oplus}$, a radius of $1.166^{0.061}_{-0.058}$\nR$_{\\oplus}$, and a mean density of 4.89$^{+1.03}_{-0.88}$ gcm$^{-3}$. Via\nDoppler spectroscopy, we discovered that the system hosts three outer planets\non nearly circular orbits with periods of 6.6, 26.2, and 61.3d and minimum\nmasses of 5.03 $\\pm$ 0.41 M$_{\\oplus}$, 33.12 $\\pm$ 0.88 M$_{\\oplus}$ and\n15.05$^{+1.12}_{-1.11}$ M$_{\\oplus}$, respectively. The presence of both a USP\nplanet and a low-mass object on a 6.6-day orbit indicates that the architecture\nof this system can be explained via a scenario in which the planets started on\nlow-eccentricity orbits, then moved inwards through a quasi-static secular\nmigration. Our numerical simulations show that this migration channel can bring\nTOI-500 b to its current location in 2 Gyrs, starting from an initial orbit of\n0.02au. TOI-500 is the first four planet system known to host a USP Earth\nanalog whose current architecture can be explained via a non-violent migration\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Field\ndependent measurements yield the superconducting phase diagram with an upper\ncritical field of Hc2(0) ~ 0.95 T, corresponding to a superconducting coherence\nlength of {\\xi} ~18.6 nm. The gap ratio deduced from specific heat anomaly,\n2{\\Delta}0/kBTc is 3.46, a value close to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nvalue of 3.53.

The anisotropy of the exciton delocalization is\ndetermined by the local anisotropy of the structure, whereas the exciton\nextends orthogonally to the chains formed by the crystal structure. Moreover,\nwe show that the bright exciton goes together with a dark exciton of even\nlarger binding energy and more pronounced anisotropy.

Much of the existing literature has emphasized that, for the\npermutation p-value to be valid, one must first pick a subgroup $G$ of\npermutations (which could equal the full group) and then recalculate the test\nstatistic on permuted data using either an exhaustive enumeration of $G$, or a\nsample from $G$ drawn uniformly at random. In this work, we demonstrate that\nthe focus on subgroups and uniform sampling are both unnecessary for validity\n-- in fact, a simple random modification of the permutation p-value remains\nvalid even when using an arbitrary distribution (not necessarily uniform) over\nany subset of permutations (not necessarily a subgroup). We provide a unified\ntheoretical treatment of such generalized permutation tests, recovering all\nknown results from the literature as special cases. Thus, this work expands the\nflexibility of the permutation test toolkit available to the practitioner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 17:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 May 2022 17:45:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 15:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 12:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

This work presents three methodologies\nto fill in this gap. The first is an incentive-compatible methodology that\ndetermines a \"ground truth\" measurement of users' value of speed in terms of US\ndollars, and find that users would accept a performance losses of 10%, 20%, and\n30% to their personal computer in exchange for \\$2.27, \\$4.07, and \\$4.43 per\nday, respectively. However, while highly accurate the methodology is a\npainstaking process and does not scale with large numbers of participants. To\nallow for scalability, we introduce a second methodology -- a lab-based\nsimulation experiment -- which finds that users would accept a permanent\nperformance loss of 10%, 20%, and 30% to their personal computer in exchange\nfor \\$127, \\$169, and \\$823, respectively. Finally, to allow for even greater\nscalability, we introduce a third methodology -- a survey -- and observe that\nthe lack of incentive compatibility and the lack of hands-on experience with\nthrottled device performance skews the results significantly, thus\ndemonstrating the need for lab-based or incentive compatible study designs.

One experimental parameter which has received significantly less\nattention is that of the phase of the solid ice under investigation. In this\npresent study, we have performed systematic 2 keV electron irradiations of the\namorphous and crystalline phases of pure CH3OH and N2O astrophysical ice\nanalogues. Radiation-induced decay of these ices and the concomitant formation\nof products were monitored in situ using FT-IR spectroscopy. A direct\ncomparison between the irradiated amorphous and crystalline CH3OH ices revealed\na more rapid decay of the former compared to the latter. Interestingly, a\nsignificantly lesser difference was observed when comparing the decay rates of\nthe amorphous and crystalline N2O ices. These observations have been\nrationalised in terms of the strength and extent of the intermolecular forces\npresent in each ice. The strong and extensive hydrogen-bonding network that\nexists in crystalline CH3OH (but not in the amorphous phase) is suggested to\nsignificantly stabilise this phase against radiation-induced decay. Conversely,\nalthough alignment of the dipole moment of N2O is anticipated to be more\nextensive in the crystalline structure, its weak attractive potential does not\nsignificantly stabilise the crystalline phase against radiation-induced decay,\nhence explaining the smaller difference in decay rates between the amorphous\nand crystalline phases of N2O compared to those of CH3OH. Our results are\nrelevant to the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and icy Solar System\nobjects, which may experience phase changes due to thermally-induced\ncrystallisation or space radiation-induced amorphisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 23:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

In other\nwords, temporally and spatially distributed teams and organizations can develop\nand work on a software application. The simplest case is to outsource\nproduction and employ workforce at distributed sites so that multiple\ndistributed teams can work on a project within a parallel framework. If this\ndistribution is global, it will be called the global software evolution or\ndevelopment. A higher level of distribution is defined as decentralization and\ndecentralized software evolution, which means that software development can be\nindependent of the initial provider. It also means that software execution is\nindependent of the initial provider and the initial system so that the software\napplication can easily be reused in different and new projects. However, the\nhigh level architecture is managed within a practically centralized framework\nin the decentralized software evolution. Most of the large scale open-source\nprojects are exemplars of this level. In terms of distribution, there is a\nhigher level of decentralized software evolution called \"distributed cognition\nand leadership\". At this level of distribution, all system levels evolve within\na distributed framework, and there are no centralized points in the project\nnetwork and its evolution process. Some open-source software applications are\nthe exemplars of this last level.

Methods: Two SARS-CoV-2 models were\nprepared as engineered lentiviruses pseudotyped with the G protein of the\nvesicular stomatitis virus, and with the characteristic Spike protein of\nSARS-CoV-2. Samples were preparations in two biofluids (saline solution and\nartificial saliva), in four concentrations, and deposited as 5-{\\mu}L droplets\non a supporting plate. The angles of maximal degree of linear polarization\n(DLP) of light diffusely scattered from dry residues were determined using\nMueller polarimetry of 87 samples at 405 nm and 514 nm. A polarimetric camera\nwas used for simultaneous imaging of several samples under 380-420 nm\nillumination at angles similar to those of maximal DLP. A per-pixel image\nanalysis included quantification and combination of polarization feature\ndescriptors in other 475 samples.

It is well-known that, although\ntrajectories of a chaotic system have sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions, i.e. the famous ``butterfly-effect'', their statistical properties\nare often insensitive to small disturbances. This kind of chaos (such as\ngoverned by the Lorenz equations) is called normal-chaos. However, a new\nconcept, i.e. ultra-chaos, has been reported recently, whose statistics are\nunstable to tiny disturbances. Thus, ultra-chaos represents higher disorder\nthan normal chaos. In this paper, we illustrate that ultra-chaos widely exists\nin Lagrangian trajectories of fluid particles in steady-state ABC flow.\nMoreover, solving the NS equation when $Re=50$ with the ABC flow plus a very\nsmall disturbance as the initial condition, it is found that trajectories of\nnearly all fluid particles become ultra-chaotic when the transition from\nlaminar to turbulence occurs. These numerical experiments and facts highly\nsuggest that ultra-chaos should have a relationship with turbulence. This paper\nidentifies differences between ultra-chaos and sensitivity of statistics to\nparameters. Possible relationships between ultra-chaos and the Poincar\\'{e}\nsection, ultra-chaos and ergodicity/non-ergodicity, etc., are discussed.

Current\nstandard approach to estimate DASF from canopy bidirectional reflectance factor\n(BRF) is based on the assumption that in the weakly absorbing 710 to 790 nm\nspectral interval, leaf scattering does not change much with the concentration\nof dry matter and thus its variation can be neglected.

Metals are frequently used for\nthese surfaces due to their durability, but many metals also possess\nantimicrobial properties which function through a variety of mechanisms. This\nwork investigates metallic alloys comprised of several bioactive metals with\nthe target of achieving broad-spectrum, rapid bioactivity through synergistic\nactivity. An entropy-motivated stabilization paradigm is proposed to prepare\nscalable alloys of copper, silver, nickel and cobalt. Using combinatorial\nsputtering, thin-film alloys were prepared on 100 mm wafers with 50%\ncompositional grading of each element across the wafer. The films were then\nannealed and investigated for alloy stability. Bioactivity testing was\nperformed on both the as-grown alloys and the annealed films using four\nmicroorganisms -- Phi6, MS2, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli -- as\nsurrogates for human viral and bacterial pathogens. Testing showed that after\n30 s of contact with some of the test alloys, Phi6, an enveloped,\nsingle-stranded RNA bacteriophage that serves as a SARS-CoV 2 surrogate, was\nreduced up to 6.9 orders of magnitude (>99.9999%). Additionally, the\nnon-enveloped, double-stranded DNA bacteriophage MS2, and the Gram-negative E.\ncoli and Gram-positive B. subtilis bacterial strains showed a 5.0, 6.4, and 5.7\nlog reduction in activity after 30, 20 and 10 minutes, respectively.\nBioactivity in the alloy samples showed a strong dependence on the composition,\nwith the log reduction scaling directly with the Cu content. Concentration of\nCu by phase separation after annealing improved activity in some of the\nsamples.

In recent years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented\nreality (AR) technologies have been shown to be promising avenues to improve\nthe convenience of rehabilitative prosthesis training systems. However, it is\nuncertain if the comprehensive efficacy and effectiveness of VR or AR assistive\ntools are adequate compared to conventional prosthetic tools and if not,\nwhether enhancements can be made through incorporation of other technical\nparadigms.\n  This work first presents a mixed reality system we developed for prosthesis\ncontrol and training. Five able-bodied subjects are involved to perform\nthree-dimensional object manipulation tasks in analogous AR and VR\nenvironments. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied to assess subjects\nperformances within the two paradigms. Based on the comparative analysis, we\nfind that VR-based environment promotes more efficient motion along with higher\ntask completion rate and path efficiency while AR paradigm allows subjects to\nperform motor tasks with shorter time consumed. Another study is conducted to\nevaluate the efficiency and feasibility of AR-facilitated prosthesis control\nsystem compared to that in real-world and if any technical additions can be\napplied to improve the AR-based system. Three able-bodied subjects were engaged\nin the experiment to perform object manipulation tasks in a) physical\nenvironment, b) AR-without-bypass environment, and c) AR-with-bypass\nenvironment.

One such universal\nfunction, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on\nits environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts\nto maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received\nsensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been\napplied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we\nexpand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied\nby a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment\nas a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of\nmorphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher\nfitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may\nbe a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment.

That is, given a collection of time\nseries over a varying parameter, when has the structure of the underlying\ndynamical system changed? For this task, we turn to the field of topological\ndata analysis (TDA), which encodes information about the shape and structure of\ndata. The idea of utilizing tools from TDA for signal processing tasks, known\nas topological signal processing (TSP), has gained much attention in recent\nyears, largely through a standard pipeline that computes the persistent\nhomology of the point cloud generated by the Takens' embedding. However, this\nprocedure is limited by computation time since the simplicial complex generated\nin this case is large, but also has a great deal of redundant data. For this\nreason, we turn to a more recent method for encoding the structure of the\nattractor, which constructs an ordinal partition network (OPN) representing\ninformation about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions\nof state space. The result is a weighted graph whose structure encodes\ninformation about the underlying attractor. Our previous work began to find\nways to package the information of the OPN in a manner that is amenable to TDA;\nhowever, that work only used the network structure and did nothing to encode\nthe additional weighting information. In this paper, we take the next step:\nbuilding a pipeline to analyze the weighted OPN with TDA and showing that this\nframework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system and\nimproves the accuracy of the dynamic state detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 18:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 19:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

To\nachieve this goal, CPs have built large-scale datacenters. This leads, however,\nto underutilized resources and an increase in costs. A way to improve the\nutilization of resources is to reclaim the unused parts and resell them at a\nlower price. Providing SLA guarantees to customers on reclaimed resources is a\nchallenge due to their high volatility. Some state-of-the-art solutions\nconsider keeping a proportion of resources free to absorb sudden variation in\nworkloads. Others consider stable resources on top of the volatile ones to fill\nin for the lost resources. However, these strategies either reduce the amount\nof reclaimable resources or operate on less volatile ones such as Amazon Spot\ninstance. In this paper, we proposed RISCLESS, a Reinforcement Learning\nstrategy to exploit unused Cloud resources. Our approach consists of using a\nsmall proportion of stable on-demand resources alongside the ephemeral ones in\norder to guarantee customers SLA and reduce the overall costs. The approach\ndecides when and how much stable resources to allocate in order to fulfill\ncustomers' demands. RISCLESS improved the CPs' profits by an average of 15.9%\ncompared to state-of-the-art strategies. It also reduced the SLA violation time\nby an average of 36.7% while increasing the amount of used ephemeral resources\nby 19.5% on average\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 06:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Compared with the machine learning or deep learning\nmethods that depend on the pre-defined model and the training dataset for\nsolving SR problems, GP is more focused on finding the solution in a search\nspace. Although GP has good performance on large-scale benchmarks, it randomly\ntransforms individuals to search results without taking advantage of the\ncharacteristics of the dataset. So, the search process of GP is usually slow,\nand the final results could be unstable.To guide GP by these characteristics,\nwe propose a new method for SR, called Taylor genetic programming (TaylorGP)\n(Code and appendix at https://kgae-cup.github.io/TaylorGP/). TaylorGP leverages\na Taylor polynomial to approximate the symbolic equation that fits the dataset.\nIt also utilizes the Taylor polynomial to extract the features of the symbolic\nequation: low order polynomial discrimination, variable separability, boundary,\nmonotonic, and parity. GP is enhanced by these Taylor polynomial techniques.\nExperiments are conducted on three kinds of benchmarks: classical SR, machine\nlearning, and physics. The experimental results show that TaylorGP not only has\nhigher accuracy than the nine baseline methods, but also is faster in finding\nstable results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 13:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

In this application, timely identifying the missing items is an ongoing\nengineering problem. A feasible solution to this problem is to map each tag to\na time slot and verify the presence of a tag by comparing the status of the\npredicted time slot and the actual time slot. However, existing works are time\ninefficient because they only verify tags one by one in singleton slots but\nignore the collision slots mapped by multiple tags. To accelerate the\nidentification process, we use bit tracking to verify tags in collision slots\nand design two protocols accordingly. We first propose the Sequential String\nbased Missing Tag Identification (SSMTI) protocol, which converts all time\nslots to collision slots and enables tags in each slot to reply to a designed\nstring simultaneously. By using bit tracking to decode the combined string, the\nreader can verify multiple tags together. To improve the performance of SSMTI\nwhen most tags are missing, we further propose the Interactive String based\nMissing Tag Identification (ISMTI) protocol. ISMTI improves the strategies of\ndesigning strings for each collided tag so that the reader can verify more tags\nusing shorter strings than SSMTI.Besides, ISMTI can dynamically adjust the\nverification mechanism according to the proportion of missing tags to maintain\ntime efficiency. We also provide theoretical analysis for proposed protocols to\nminimize execution time and evaluate their performance through extensive\nsimulations. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed SSMTI and\nISMTI can reduce the time cost by as much as 39.74% and 68.87%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 07:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

We are on the verge of two new transitions that will\ntransform robotics. One is already under way -- the miniaturization of robots,\nto the point where invisible, microscopic robots could be around us and inside\nus, performing monitoring or even life-saving functions. We have seen\nsystematic bio-inspired efforts to create microbe-like, microscopic robots. The\ntrend has parallels with miniaturization in the electronics industry, where\nexponentially smaller and more energy efficient units have been produced each\ngeneration. To put this statement in context, examples already include magnetic\nmicroswimmer robots, employing bacterial modes of locomotion, which are\nbiocompatible, potentially ready for integration within our bodies. They\nrequire lithography to create clever microscopic screw-type structures, enough\nto produce the cork-screw swimming movement. Such micro-robots have\nencapsulated, picked, and delivered cells, protecting them from shear forces in\nfluids, while others have captured non-motile sperm, propelled them, and\nultimately fertilized an egg. We explore how such developments in micro-robots\nwill change our world in the relatively near future. The second trend is\nbottom-up robotics, growing robots from a solution medium, as if they were\nbacteria. This field is emerging at the intersection of a number of\ndisciplines, discussed below. An overarching common theme is the creation of\nartificial life from a non-biological starting point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 18:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}
