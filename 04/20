Such models are\nparticularly useful in clustering tasks where the number of clusters is\nunknown. Despite their potential and mathematical elegance, however, DPMMs have\nyet to become a mainstream tool widely adopted by practitioners. This is\narguably due to a misconception that these models scale poorly as well as the\nlack of high-performance (and user-friendly) software tools that can handle\nlarge datasets efficiently. In this paper we bridge this practical gap by\nproposing a new, easy-to-use, statistical software package for scalable DPMM\ninference. More concretely, we provide efficient and easily-modifiable\nimplementations for high-performance distributed sampling-based inference in\nDPMMs where the user is free to choose between either a multiple-machine,\nmultiple-core, CPU implementation (written in Julia) and a multiple-stream GPU\nimplementation (written in CUDA/C++). Both the CPU and GPU implementations come\nwith a common (and optional) python wrapper, providing the user with a single\npoint of entry with the same interface. On the algorithmic side, our\nimplementations leverage a leading DPMM sampler from (Chang and Fisher III,\n2013). While Chang and Fisher III's implementation (written in MATLAB/C++) used\nonly CPU and was designed for a single multi-core machine, the packages we\nproposed here distribute the computations efficiently across either multiple\nmulti-core machines or across mutiple GPU streams.

The nature of such\nregulatory mechanisms in different tissues, and how to incorporate them in\nmodels of stem cell population dynamics, is incompletely understood. The\ncritical birth-death (CBD) process is widely used to model stem cell\npopulations, capturing key phenomena, such as scaling laws in clone size\ndistributions. However, the CBD process neglects regulatory mechanisms. Here,\nwe propose the birth-death process with volume exclusion (vBD), a variation of\nthe birth-death process that considers crowding effects, such as may arise due\nto limited space in a stem cell niche. While the deterministic rate equations\npredict a single non-trivial attracting steady state, the master equation\npredicts extinction and transient distributions of stem cell numbers with three\npossible behaviours: long-lived quasi-steady state, and short-lived bimodal or\nunimodal distributions. In all cases, we approximate solutions to the vBD\nmaster equation using a renormalised system-size expansion, quasi-steady state\napproximation and the WKB method. Our study suggests that the size distribution\nof a stem cell population bears signatures that are useful to detect negative\nfeedback mediated via volume exclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 17:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 02:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-19"}

Traditionally, cavitation in solids is defined as an\nunstable expansion of a void or a defect within a material. The critical\napplied load needed to trigger this instability - the critical pressure - is a\nlengthscale independent material property and has been predicted by numerous\ntheoretical studies for a breadth of constitutive models. While these studies\nusually assume that cavitation initiates from defects in the bulk of an\notherwise homogeneous medium, an alternative and potentially more ubiquitous\nscenario can occur if the defects are found at interfaces between two distinct\nmedia within the body. Such interfaces are becoming increasingly common in\nmodern materials with the use of multi-material composites and layer-by-layer\nadditive manufacturing methods. However, a criterion to determine the threshold\nfor interfacial failure, in analogy to the bulk cavitation limit, has yet to be\nreported. In this work we fill this gap. Our theoretical model captures a\nlengthscale independent limit for interfacial cavitation, and is shown to agree\nwith our observations at two distinct lengthscales, via two different\nexperimental systems. To further understand the competition between the two\ncavitation modes (bulk versus interface) we expand our investigation beyond the\nelastic response to understand the ensuing unstable propagation of delamination\nat the interface.

Although domain wall\nmotion in ferro- and antiferromagnets has been studied, in spiral magnets it is\nstill poorly understood despite 20 years of active research since the discovery\nof spiral multiferroics. The problem of the domain wall motion in a spiral\nmagnet is a compelling one, the more so the magnetic domain walls in cycloidal\nspiral phase are also ferroelectric, thus enabling electric control of\nmagnetism, i.e. domain wall motion under the action of an external electric\nfield. Phase transition to a spiral phase leads to a formation of chiral\ndomains with opposite spin rotation senses, that are separated by chiral domain\nwalls. Spiral order breaks inversion symmetry and induces a ferroelectric\npolarization, whose sign is determined by the chirality of the domain. Thus the\nspiral order allows for the manipulation of spins via an external electric\nfield. Here we study domain wall motion in magnets with spiral ground state,\nthat are the most basic non-collinear magnets. We formulate a simplified\nvariational model and derive the equation of motion for the domain wall driven\nby an external electric field. The results are corroborated with atomistic spin\ndynamics simulations. The results suggest a linear dependence of the wall speed\non the external electric field, and a peculiar dependence on the system\ngeometry and domain structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 17:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 07:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

Brumer's perspective arose by generalizing\nStickelberger's work regarding the factorization of Gauss sums and the\nannihilation of class groups of cyclotomic fields. These viewpoints were\nsynthesized by Tate, who stated the Brumer-Stark conjecture in its current\nform.\n  The conjecture considers a totally real field $F$ and a finite abelian CM\nextension $H/F$. It states the existence of $p$-units in $H$ whose valuations\nat places above $p$ are related to the special values of the $L$-functions of\nthe extension $H/F$ at $s=0$. Essentially equivalently, the conjecture states\nthat a Stickelberger element associated to $H/F$ annihilates the (appropriately\nsmoothed) class group of $H$. This conjecture has been refined by many authors\nin multiple directions.\n  We conclude by stating our results toward these various conjectures and\nsummarizing the proofs.

This can explain the bottom heavy stellar mass function of Early-type\ngalaxies as they are the result of the merger of disk galaxies where the\nphysical conditions of the star forming gas vary significantly both in time and\nspace. The effect of IMF variations is compared to that due to other effects\nsuch as variations in the shape of the initial cluster mass function,\nmetallicity, and galactic SFR. We find that the effect of IMF variations is a\ndominant factor that always affects the characteristic mass of the IGIMF. We\ncompare our results to a sample of ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies (UFDs).\nTheir present-day stellar mass function is an analog to their IGIMF at the time\ntheir stellar populations have formed. We show that the slope of the IGIMF of\nthe UFDs can only be reproduced when IMF variations of the same order as those\nmeasured in the present-day Milky Way are included.

Most existing deep recommender systems,\nhowever, focus on designing sophisticated neural networks, while neglecting the\nfeature selection process. Typically, they just feed all possible features into\ntheir proposed deep architectures, or select important features manually by\nhuman experts. The former leads to non-trivial embedding parameters and extra\ninference time, while the latter requires plenty of expert knowledge and human\nlabor effort. In this work, we propose an AutoML framework that can adaptively\nselect the essential feature fields in an automatic manner.

For incomplete data, there are often only\n$N_i<N$ observations for variable $i$, which means that using the `complete'\nsample size $N$ implausibly ignores the amounts of missing information inherent\nin incomplete data.

Existing inferential methods for community structure\nmainly focus on unweighted (binary) networks. Many real-world networks are\nnonetheless weighted and a common practice is to dichotomize a weighted network\nto an unweighted one which is known to result in information loss. Literature\non hypothesis testing in the latter situation is still missing. In this paper,\nwe study the problem of testing the existence of community structure in\nweighted networks. Our contributions are threefold: (a). We use the (possibly\ninfinite-dimensional) exponential family to model the weights and derive the\nsharp information-theoretic limit for the existence of consistent test. Within\nthe limit, any test is inconsistent; and beyond the limit, we propose a useful\nconsistent test. (b).

Very and\nultra-high energy cosmic rays can be efficiently accelerated by magnetic\nreconnection in these sources. We here demonstrate this directly, with no\nextrapolations to large scales, by means of three-dimensional relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamical (3D-RMHD) simulations of a Poyinting flux dominated jet.\nWe inject thousands of low-energy protons in the region of a relativistic jet\nthat corresponds to the transition from magnetically to kinetically dominated,\nwhere its magnetization parameter is $\\sigma \\sim 1$. In this region, there is\nefficient fast magnetic reconnection which is naturally driven by\ncurrent-driven-kink instability (CDKI) turbulence in the helical magnetic\nfields of the jet. We find that the particles are accelerated by Fermi process\nin the reconnection regions (and by drift in the final stages) up to energies\n$E \\sim 10^{18}$ eV for background magnetic fields $B \\sim 0.1$ G, and $E \\sim\n10^{20}$ eV for $B \\sim 10$ G.

The energy spectrum of the accelerated particles develops a power-law\ntail with spectral index $p \\sim -1.2$.

We assume that\nusers aim to minimize an internalized cost function, subject to the constraints\nimposed by the human body and the interactive system. In contrast to previous\nlinear approaches used in HCI, MPC can compute optimal controls for nonlinear\nsystems. This allows us to use state-of-the-art biomechanical models and handle\nnonlinearities that occur in almost any interactive system. Instead of torque\nactuation, our model employs second-order muscles acting directly at the\njoints. We compare three different cost functions and evaluate the simulated\ntrajectories against user movements in a Fitts' Law type pointing study with\nfour different interaction techniques. Our results show that the combination of\ndistance, control, and joint acceleration cost matches individual users'\nmovements best, and predicts movements with an accuracy that is within the\nbetween-user variance. To aid HCI researchers and designers, we introduce CFAT,\na novel method to identify maximum voluntary torques in joint-actuated models\nbased on experimental data, and give practical advice on how to simulate human\nmovement for different users, interaction techniques, and tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 20:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

Recent rise of using passively generated mobile data from\nmobile devices have raised questions on using such data for capturing the\nmobility patterns of a population because: 1) there is a great variety of\ndifferent kinds of mobile data and their respective properties are unknown; and\n2) data pre-processing and analysis methods are often not explicitly reported.\nThe high stakes involved with mobility analysis and issues associated with the\npassively generated mobile data call for mobility analysis (including data,\nmethods and results) to be accessible to all, interoperable across different\ncomputing systems, reproducible and reusable by others.

This additional friction acts on a scalar\nfield in the early universe and extracts its energy density into dark\nradiation, the cumulative effect being similar to that of an early dark energy\n(EDE) scenario. The dark radiation automatically redshifts at the minimal\nnecessary rate to improve the Hubble tension. On the other hand, the addition\nof extra radiation to the Universe can improve the LSS tension. We explore this\nmodel in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic\noscillation and supernova data, including the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement and the\nDark Energy Survey Y1 data release in our analysis. Our results indicate a\npreference for the regime where the scalar field converts to dark radiation at\nvery high redshifts, asymptoting effectively to an extra self-interacting\nradiation species rather than an EDE-like injection. In this limit, thermal\nfriction can ease both the Hubble and the LSS tensions, but not resolve them.\nWe find the source of this preference to be the incompatibility of the CMB data\nwith the linear density perturbations of the dark radiation when injected at\nredshifts close to matter-radiation equality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 21:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Our analysis is based on the lightcurves of a\nsample of over 1000 quasars, photometrically monitored over a period of 26\nyears. The intrinsic variations in quasar luminosity are derived from luminous\nquasars where the quasar accretion disc is too large to be microlensed by\nstellar mass bodies, and then synthetic lightcurves for the whole sample are\nconstructed with the same statistical properties.

The capabilities of large transformer models as instruction\nlearners, however, remain poorly understood. We use a controlled synthetic\nenvironment to characterize such capabilities. Specifically, we use the task of\ndeciding whether a given string matches a regular expression (viewed as an\ninstruction) to identify properties of tasks, instructions, and instances that\nmake instruction learning challenging. For instance, we find that our model, a\nfine-tuned T5-based text2text transformer, struggles with large regular\nlanguages, suggesting that less precise instructions are challenging for\nmodels.

This paper presents the preliminary\nresults on evaluating the robustness of ML-based anomaly detection methods in\nsafety-critical CPS against two types of accidental and malicious input\nperturbations, generated using a Gaussian-based noise model and the Fast\nGradient Sign Method (FGSM). We test the hypothesis of whether integrating the\ndomain knowledge (e.g., on unsafe system behavior) with the ML models can\nimprove the robustness of anomaly detection without sacrificing accuracy and\ntransparency. Experimental results with two case studies of Artificial Pancreas\nSystems (APS) for diabetes management show that ML-based safety monitors\ntrained with domain knowledge can reduce on average up to 54.2% of robustness\nerror and keep the average F1 scores high while improving transparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 02:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 05:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

To have a least number\nof bins used, cost-sharing rules play an important role.

Once trained, a subnet can be derived from the\nsupernet (both architecture and trained weights) and deployed directly to the\ntarget platform with little to no retraining or fine-tuning. To train the\nsubnet population, OFA uses a novel training method called Progressive\nShrinking (PS) which is designed to limit the negative impact of interference\nduring training. It is believed that higher interference during training\nresults in lower subnet population accuracies. In this work we take a second\nlook at this interference effect. Surprisingly, we find that interference\nmitigation strategies do not have a large impact on the overall subnet\npopulation performance. Instead, we find the subnet architecture selection bias\nduring training to be a more important aspect. To show this, we propose a\nsimple-yet-effective method called Random Subnet Sampling (RSS), which does not\nhave mitigation on the interference effect. Despite no mitigation, RSS is able\nto produce a better performing subnet population than PS in four\nsmall-to-medium-sized datasets; suggesting that the interference effect does\nnot play a pivotal role in these datasets. Due to its simplicity, RSS provides\na $1.9\\times$ reduction in training times compared to PS. A $6.1\\times$\nreduction can also be achieved with a reasonable drop in performance when the\nnumber of RSS training epochs are reduced.

Most existing studies estimate\ndeterministic dynamic origin-destination (OD) demand, while the day-to-day\nvariation of demand and flow is overlooked. Estimating probabilistic\ndistributions of dynamic OD demand is challenging due to the complexity of the\nspatio-temporal networks and the computational intensity of the\nhigh-dimensional problems. With the availability of massive traffic data and\nthe emergence of advanced computational methods, this paper develops a\ndata-driven framework that solves the probabilistic dynamic origin-destination\ndemand estimation (PDODE) problem using multi-day data. Different statistical\ndistances (e.g., lp-norm, Wasserstein distance, KL divergence, Bhattacharyya\ndistance) are used and compared to measure the gap between the estimated and\nthe observed traffic conditions, and it is found that 2-Wasserstein distance\nachieves a balanced accuracy in estimating both mean and standard deviation.\nThe proposed framework is cast into the computational graph and a\nreparametrization trick is developed to estimate the mean and standard\ndeviation of the probabilistic dynamic OD demand simultaneously. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PDODE framework on both small\nand real-world networks. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed\nPDODE framework can mitigate the overfitting issues by considering the demand\nvariation. Overall, the developed PDODE framework provides a practical tool for\npublic agencies to understand the sources of demand stochasticity, evaluate\nday-to-day variation of network flow, and make reliable decisions for\nintelligent transportation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 05:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

In SAR images, some areas\naffected by ocean phenomena, such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal\nwaves, or discharge from oil spills appear as dark spots on images. Dark spot\ndetection is the first step in the detection of oil spills, which then become\noil slick candidates. The accuracy of dark spot segmentation ultimately affects\nthe accuracy of oil slick identification. Although some advanced deep learning\nmethods that use pixels as processing units perform well in remote sensing\nimage semantic segmentation, detecting some dark spots with weak boundaries\nfrom noisy SAR images remains a huge challenge. We propose a dark spot\ndetection method based on superpixels deeper graph convolutional networks\n(SGDCN) in this paper, which takes the superpixels as the processing units and\nextracts features for each superpixel. The features calculated from superpixel\nregions are more robust than those from fixed pixel neighborhoods.

However, existing works\nfocused on exacting temporal motif are not scalable to large-scale temporal\ngraph data, due to their heavy computational costs or inherent inadequacy of\nparallelism. In this work, we propose a scalable parallel framework for exactly\ncounting temporal motifs in large-scale temporal graphs. We first categorize\nthe temporal motifs based on their distinct properties, and then design\ncustomized algorithms that offer efficient strategies to exactly count the\nmotif instances of each category. Moreover, our compact data structures, namely\ntriple and quadruple counters, enable our algorithms to directly identify the\ntemporal motif instances of each category, according to edge information and\nthe relationship between edges, therefore significantly improving the counting\nefficiency. Based on the proposed counting algorithms, we design a hierarchical\nparallel framework that features both inter- and intra-node parallel\nstrategies, and fully leverages the multi-threading capacity of modern CPU to\nconcurrently count all temporal motifs. Extensive experiments on sixteen\nreal-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate the superiority and capability\nof our proposed framework for temporal motif counting, achieving up to 538*\nspeedup compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

If these data would otherwise be normally distributed, their\nspread can be conveniently represented by a multivariate normal distribution\ntruncated to the non-negative space under a unit simplex. Here this\ndistribution is called the simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution.\nFor calculations on truncated distributions, it is often useful to obtain rapid\nestimates of their integral, mean and covariance; these quantities\ncharacterising the truncated distribution will generally possess different\nvalues to the corresponding non-truncated distribution. In this paper, three\ndifferent approaches that can estimate the integral, mean and covariance of any\nsimplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution are described and compared.\nThese three approaches are (1) naive rejection sampling, (2) a method described\nby Gessner et al. that unifies subset simulation and the Holmes-Diaconis-Ross\nalgorithm with an analytical version of elliptical slice sampling, and (3) a\nsemi-analytical method that expresses the integral, mean and covariance in\nterms of integrals of hyperrectangularly-truncated multivariate normal\ndistributions, the latter of which are readily computed in modern mathematical\nand statistical packages.

By definition, memristors are sensitive to the\nhistory of electrical stimuli, to which they respond by varying their\nelectrical resistance across a continuum of nonvolatile states. Recently, much\neffort has been devoted to developing devices that present an analogous\nresponse to optical excitation. Here we realize a new class of device, a\ntunnelling photo-memristor, whose behaviour is bimodal: both electrical and\noptical stimuli can trigger the switching across resistance states in a way\ndetermined by the dual optical-electrical history. This unique behaviour is\nobtained in a device of ultimate simplicity: an interface between a\nhigh-temperature superconductor and a transparent semiconductor. The\nmicroscopic mechanism at play is a reversible nanoscale redox reaction between\nboth materials, whose oxygen content determines the electron tunnelling rate\nacross their interface. Oxygen exchange is controlled here via illumination by\nexploiting a competition between electrochemistry, photovoltaic effects and\nphoto-assisted ion migration. In addition to their fundamental interest, the\nunveiled electro-optic memory effects have considerable technological\npotential. Especially in combination with high-temperature superconductivity\nwhich, beyond facilitating the high connectivity required in neuromorphic\ncircuits, brings photo-memristive effects to the realm of superconducting\nelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 06:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

At each iteration, the algorithm is given an oracle\naccess to a stochastic estimate of the Hessian matrix. The oracle model\nincludes popular algorithms such as Subsampled Newton and Newton Sketch.\nDespite using second-order information, these existing methods do not exhibit\nsuperlinear convergence, unless the stochastic noise is gradually reduced to\nzero during the iteration, which would lead to a computational blow-up in the\nper-iteration cost. We propose to address this limitation with Hessian\naveraging: instead of using the most recent Hessian estimate, our algorithm\nmaintains an average of all the past estimates. This reduces the stochastic\nnoise while avoiding the computational blow-up. We show that this scheme\nexhibits local $Q$-superlinear convergence with a non-asymptotic rate of\n$(\\Upsilon\\sqrt{\\log (t)/t}\\,)^{t}$, where $\\Upsilon$ is proportional to the\nlevel of stochastic noise in the Hessian oracle. A potential drawback of this\n(uniform averaging) approach is that the averaged estimates contain Hessian\ninformation from the global phase of the method, i.e., before the iterates\nconverge to a local neighborhood. This leads to a distortion that may\nsubstantially delay the superlinear convergence until long after the local\nneighborhood is reached. To address this drawback, we study a number of\nweighted averaging schemes that assign larger weights to recent Hessians, so\nthat the superlinear convergence arises sooner, albeit with a slightly slower\nrate. Remarkably, we show that there exists a universal weighted averaging\nscheme that transitions to local convergence at an optimal stage, and still\nexhibits a superlinear convergence rate nearly (up to a logarithmic factor)\nmatching that of uniform Hessian averaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 07:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 07:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

In the FOLTR process, clients\nparticipate in a federation to jointly create an effective ranker from the\nimplicit click signal originating in each client, without the need to share\ndata (documents, queries, clicks). A well-known factor that affects the\nperformance of federated learning systems, and that poses serious challenges to\nthese approaches, is that there may be some type of bias in the way data is\ndistributed across clients. While FOLTR systems are on their own rights a type\nof federated learning system, the presence and effect of non-IID data in FOLTR\nhas not been studied. To this aim, we first enumerate possible data\ndistribution settings that may showcase data bias across clients and thus give\nrise to the non-IID problem. Then, we study the impact of each setting on the\nperformance of the current state-of-the-art FOLTR approach, the Federated\nPairwise Differentiable Gradient Descent (FPDGD), and we highlight which data\ndistributions may pose a problem for FOLTR methods. We also explore how common\napproaches proposed in the federated learning literature address non-IID issues\nin FOLTR. This allows us to unveil new research gaps that, we argue, future\nresearch in FOLTR should consider.

The wide-spread adoption also raises the concern of their\ndependability and reliability. Similar to traditional decision-making programs,\nneural networks can have defects that need to be repaired. The defects may\ncause unsafe behaviors, raise security concerns or unjust societal impacts. In\nthis work, we address the problem of repairing a neural network for desirable\nproperties such as fairness and the absence of backdoor. The goal is to\nconstruct a neural network that satisfies the property by (minimally) adjusting\nthe given neural network's parameters (i.e., weights). Specifically, we propose\nCARE (\\textbf{CA}usality-based \\textbf{RE}pair), a causality-based neural\nnetwork repair technique that 1) performs causality-based fault localization to\nidentify the `guilty' neurons and 2) optimizes the parameters of the identified\nneurons to reduce the misbehavior. We have empirically evaluated CARE on\nvarious tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and\nsafety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all\nneural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE\nsuccessfully improves fairness by $61.91\\%$ on average. For backdoor removal\ntasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over $98\\%$ to less than\n$1\\%$. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation\nrate to less than $1\\%$. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based\nfault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the\naccuracy of the neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 07:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 04:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Proposals presented in this work are subject to study and\ndevelopment as part of the EuroHPC eFlows4HPC project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 08:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 12:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

The aim of image enhancement is to\nreconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image\nacquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized\nimage becomes inferior to the original image. Image degradation can be due to\nthe addition of different types of noise in the original image. Image noise can\nbe modelled of many types and impulse noise is one of them. Impulse noise\ngenerates pixels with gray value not consistent with their local neighbourhood.\nIt appears as a sprinkle of both light and dark or only light spots in the\nimage. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the\nfiltering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of\nneighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of\nsmoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is\nthe one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small\nneighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high\nnoise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Mean (CWM)\nfilter has got a better average performance over the median filter. However the\noriginal pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise\ncondition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To\nillustrate the superiority of the proposed approach, the proposed new scheme\nhas been simulated along with the standard ones and various restored\nperformance measures have been compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 08:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

However, the current research on video attention generally focuses on\nadopting a specific aspect of contexts (e.g., channel, spatial/temporal, or\nglobal context) to refine the features and neglects their underlying\ncorrelation when computing attentions. This leads to incomplete context\nutilization and hence bears the weakness of limited performance improvement. To\ntackle the problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-in-attention\n(AIA) method for element-wise feature refinement, which investigates the\nfeasibility of inserting the channel context into the spatio-temporal attention\nlearning module, referred to as CinST, and also its reverse variant, referred\nto as STinC. Specifically, we instantiate the video feature contexts as\ndynamics aggregated along a specific axis with global average and max pooling\noperations. The workflow of an AIA module is that the first attention block\nuses one kind of context information to guide the gating weights calculation of\nthe second attention that targets at the other context. Moreover, all the\ncomputational operations in attention units act on the pooled dimension, which\nresults in quite few computational cost increase ($<$0.02\\%).

The strategy\nis based on requiring residential customers to limit their demand for a certain\namount of time in exchange for economic benefits.\n  The main novelty of the method consists of combining a thorough\nrepresentation of the network physics with advanced constraints that ensure the\ncomfort of residential users, in a scalable manner that suits real systems. The\nmitigation strategy is presented from a DSO perspective, and takes the form of\ncontracts between users and system operator. The focus on user comfort aims to\nmake the contracts appealing, encouraging users to voluntarily enroll in the\nproposed mitigation scheme.\n  The presented solution is implemented as a mixed-integer multi-period optimal\npower flow problem which relies on a linearized three-phase power flow\nformulation. Calculations on 100 real-life distribution feeders are performed,\nto analyze the congestion-relieving potential of several possible system\noperator-user contracts. From a planning perspective, the results can help the\nsystem operator define contractual terms that make a specific congestion\nmitigation scheme effective and viable.

Different ablation strategies\nwith the aim to terminate atrial fibrillation and prevent its recurrence exist\nbut their impact on the hemodynamic performance of the heart has not been\ninvestigated thoroughly. In this work, we present a simulation study analyzing\nfive commonly used ablation scar patterns and their combinations in the left\natrium regarding their impact on the pumping function of the heart using an\nelectromechanical whole-heart model. We analyzed how the altered atrial\nactivation and increased stiffness due to the ablation scar affect atrial as\nwell as ventricular contraction and relaxation. We found that systolic and\ndiastolic function of the left atrium is impaired by ablation scars and that\nthe reduction of atrial stroke volume of up to 11.43% depends linearly on the\namount of inactivated tissue. Consequently, the end-diastolic volume of the\nleft ventricle, and thus stroke volume, was reduced by up to 1.4% and 1.8%,\nrespectively. During ventricular systole, left atrial pressure was increased by\nup to 20% due to changes in the atrial activation sequence and the stiffening\nof scar tissue.

The first model requires minimal assumptions and\nprovides a template-free reconstruction as a reference. It makes use of spatial\nand spectral correlations to distinguish between the different components. The\nsecond model is physics-informed and further differentiates between diffuse\nemission of hadronic and leptonic origin. For this, we assume parametric, but\nspatially varying energy spectra to distinguish between the processes and use\nthermal Galactic dust observations to indicate the preferred sites of hadronic\ninteractions.

In this paper, we first formulate the task of identifying and\nsynthesizing bug reports from community live chats, and propose a novel\napproach, named BugListener, to address the challenges. Specifically,\nBugListener automates three sub-tasks: 1) Disentangle the dialogs from massive\nchat logs by using a Feed-Forward neural network; 2) Identify the bug-report\ndialogs from separated dialogs by modeling the original dialog to the\ngraph-structured dialog and leveraging the graph neural network to learn the\ncontextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug reports by utilizing the TextCNN\nmodel and Transfer Learning network to classify the sentences into three\ngroups: observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), and steps to\nreproduce the bug (SR). BugListener is evaluated on six open source projects.\nThe results show that: for bug report identification, BugListener achieves the\naverage F1 of 74.21%, improving the best baseline by 10.37%; and for bug report\nsynthesis task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences with\nthe F1 of 67.37%, 87.14%, and 65.03%, improving the best baselines by 7.21%,\n7.38%, 5.30%, respectively.

Despite the improvement achieved in the existing work, three\nissues are yet to be solved. First, users' historical behaviors contain rich\npreference information, such as users' long and short-term interests, but are\nnot fully exploited in reranking. Previous work typically treats items in\nhistory equally important, neglecting the dynamic interaction between the\nhistory and candidate items. Second, existing reranking models focus on\nlearning interactions at the item level while ignoring the fine-grained\nfeature-level interactions. Lastly, estimating the reranking score on the\nordered initial list before reranking may lead to the early scoring problem,\nthereby yielding suboptimal reranking performance. To address the above issues,\nwe propose a framework named Multi-level Interaction Reranking (MIR). MIR\ncombines low-level cross-item interaction and high-level set-to-list\ninteraction, where we view the candidate items to be reranked as a set and the\nusers' behavior history in chronological order as a list. We design a novel\nSLAttention structure for modeling the set-to-list interactions with\npersonalized long-short term interests. Moreover, feature-level interactions\nare incorporated to capture the fine-grained influence among items. We design\nMIR in such a way that any permutation of the input items would not change the\noutput ranking, and we theoretically prove it. Extensive experiments on three\npublic and proprietary datasets show that MIR significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models using various ranking and utility metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 10:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

By solving an online convex quadratic programming\nproblem, an optimal safe controller can be synthesized implicitly in\nstate-space. Since the solution is unique, the mapping from state-space to\ncontrol inputs is injective, thus enabling us to evaluate the underlying\nrelationship. In this paper we aim at explicitly synthesizing a safe control\nlaw as a function of the state for nonlinear control-affine systems with\nlimited control ability. We propose to transform the online quadratic\nprogramming problem into an offline parameterized optimisation problem which\nconsiders states as parameters. The obtained explicit safe controller is shown\nto be a piece-wise Lipschitz continuous function over the partitioned state\nspace if the program is feasible. We address the infeasible cases by solving a\nparameterized adaptive control Barrier function-based quadratic programming\nproblem. Extensive simulation results show the state-space partition and the\ncontroller properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 10:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 08:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

However, NNs are extremely vulnerable\nto adversarial examples (AEs). To defend AEs, adversarial training (AT) is\nbelieved to be the most effective method while due to the intensive\ncomputation, AT is limited to be applied in most applications. In this paper,\nto resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement\nscheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the\nintuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples\ncan contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most\ninformative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT\nsignificantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves\ntwo breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of\nadversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich\nthe information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight\nestimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the\ndiversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is\nfaster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 11:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

The existing works\nunrealistically assume the users to exchange energy with any of the users and\nat every such opportunity. However, due to the users' mobility, the inter-node\nmeetings in such opportunistic mobile networks vary, and P2P energy exchange in\nsuch scenarios remains uncertain. Additionally, the social interests and\ninteractions of the users influence their mobility as well as the energy\nexchange between them. The existing P2P-WPT methods did not consider the joint\nproblem for energy exchange due to user's inevitable mobility, and the\ninfluence of sociality on the latter. As a result of computing with imprecise\ninformation, the energy balance achieved by these works at a slower rate as\nwell as impaired by energy loss for the crowd. Motivated by this problem\nscenario, in this work, we present a wireless crowd charging method, namely\nMoSaBa, which leverages mobility prediction and social information for improved\nenergy balancing. MoSaBa incorporates two dimensions of social information,\nnamely social context and social relationships, as additional features for\npredicting contact opportunities. In this method, we explore the different\npairs of peers such that the energy balancing is achieved at a faster rate as\nwell as the energy balance quality improves in terms of maintaining low energy\nloss for the crowd. We justify the peer selection method in MoSaBa by detailed\nperformance evaluation. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art, the proposed\nmethod achieves better performance trade-offs between energy-efficiency, energy\nbalance quality and convergence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 11:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

The high conversion efficiency of pulsar rotational power to\nrelativistic electrons, combined with the short cooling timescales, allow\ngamma-ray luminosities up to the level of $L_\\gamma \\sim 0.1 \\dot{E}$.

The latter are parametrized by a single length-scale\n$\\ell$, which has a dual interpretation as an effective \"quantum hair\" and as\nthe length-scale resolving the classical singularity. Depending on the value of\n$\\ell$, these solutions can have two horizons, be extremal (when the two\nhorizons merge) or be horizonless exotic stars.

They therefore are prone to noise with a variety of\nstatistical and architectural properties, and effective strategies leveraging\nnetwork-inherent assets to mitigate noise in an hardware-efficient manner are\nimportant in the pursuit of next generation neural network hardware. Based on\nanalytical derivations, we here introduce and analyse a variety of different\nnoise-mitigation approaches. We analytically show that intra-layer connections\nin which the connection matrix's squared mean exceeds the mean of its square\nfully suppresses uncorrelated noise. We go beyond and develop two synergistic\nstrategies for noise that is uncorrelated and correlated across populations of\nneurons. First, we introduce the concept of ghost neurons, where each group of\nneurons perturbed by correlated noise has a negative connection to a single\nneuron, yet without receiving any input information. Secondly, we show that\npooling of neuron populations is an efficient approach to suppress uncorrelated\nnoise. As such, we developed a general noise mitigation strategy leveraging the\nstatistical properties of the different noise terms most relevant in analogue\nhardware. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined approach\nfor trained neural network classifying the MNIST handwritten digits, for which\nwe achieve a 4-fold improvement of the output signal-to-noise ratio and\nincrease the classification accuracy almost to the level of the noise-free\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 13:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 12:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Here, we\nstudy this issue in detail in the particular case of the entanglement entropy\nof the Maxwell theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions for rotationally symmetric regions.\nIn this setup, the problem can be dimensionally reduced to a half-line. We find\nthat the only difference between the reduced problem for the Maxwell field and\nthe reduced scalar free field stems from the Fourier angular $n=0$ mode. This\nsimplification allows us to check explicitly the many issues that characterize\nmodels with broken global symmetries. Namely, we manifestly show that the\nadditive algebras break Haag duality, and single out the non-local operators\nwhich are responsible for the failure of this property. More interestingly, we\npresent concrete lattice realizations that confirm that the logarithmic\n\"universal\" term of the Maxwell entanglement entropy for disks depends on the\ndetails of the algebra assignation. This ambiguity hinders the identification\nof possible topological contributions characteristic of models with generalized\nsymmetries and tarnishes its universal character. We further calculate the\nMaxwell mutual information for two nearly complementary concentric disks.

Accordingly, this supports mutual\ninformation as the appropriate probe to sense additivity-duality breaking and\nthe consequent universal topological contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 13:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 13:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

Modeling Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra, we computed line\nfull-width half-maxima (FWHMs) and constructed Fe Ka line and 2-10 keV\ncontinuum light curves. The FWHM provides one estimate of the Fe Ka emitting\nregion size, RFeKa, assuming virial motion. A second estimate comes from\ncomparing the degree of correlation between the variability of the continuum\nand line-only light curves, compared to simulated light curves. Finally, we\nextracted Chandra radial profiles to place upper limits on RFeKa. We found that\nfor 90% (21/24) of AGN with FWHM measurements, RFeKa is smaller than the\nfiducial dust sublimation radius, Rsub. Despite a wide range of variability\nproperties, the constraints on the Fe Ka photon reprocessor size independently\nconfirm that RFeKa is smaller than Rsub in 83% of AGN.

It is possible that\ndark matter may be composed of either axions or dark photons, both of which can\nbe detected using an ultra-sensitive microwave cavity known as a haloscope. The\nhaloscope employed by ADMX consists of a cylindrical cavity operating at the\nTM$_{010}$ mode and is sensitive to the QCD axion with masses of few $\\mu$eV.\nHowever, this haloscope design becomes challenging to implement for higher\nmasses.

Transport systems typically rely on traditional data sources providing\noutdated mode-of-travel data due to their data latency, infrequent data\ncollection and high cost. To address this issue, we propose a method that\nleverages mobile phone data as a cost-effective and rich source of geospatial\ninformation to capture current human mobility patterns at unprecedented\nspatiotemporal resolution. Our approach employs mobile phone application usage\ntraces to infer modes of transportation that are challenging to identify (bikes\nand ride-hailing/taxi services) based on mobile phone location data. Using data\nfusion and matrix factorization techniques, we integrate official data sources\n(household surveys and census data) with mobile phone application usage data.\nThis integration enables us to reconstruct the official data and create an\nupdated dataset that incorporates insights from digital footprint data from\napplication usage. We illustrate our method using a case study focused on\nSantiago, Chile successfully inferring four modes of transportation:\nmass-transit, motorised, active, and taxi. Our analysis revealed significant\nchanges in transportation patterns between 2012 and 2020. We quantify a\nreduction in mass-transit usage across municipalities in Santiago, except where\nmetro/rail lines have been more recently introduced, highlighting added\nresilience to the public transport network of these infrastructure\nenhancements. Additionally, we evidence an overall increase in motorised\ntransport throughout Santiago, revealing persistent challenges in promoting\nurban sustainable transportation.

Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past\nnews and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made,\nexisting fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in\nthe real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability\nto future data. For example, 97\\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the\nentity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to\nmerely 33\\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to\nhardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about\n`Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an\nentity debiasing framework (\\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news\ndetection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a\ncause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news\ncontents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause\n(entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the\ndirect effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline\nexperiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and\nonline tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake\nnews detection models to the future data.

Their advantages,\ncompared to SRAM memory, are higher density and lower static power, but write\noperations wear out the bitcells to the point of eventually losing their\nstorage capacity. In this context, this paper presents a novel LLC organization\ndesigned to extend the lifetime of the NV data array and a procedure to\nforecast in detail the capacity and performance of such an NV-LLC over its\nlifetime. From a methodological point of view, although different approaches\nare used in the literature to analyze the degradation of an NV-LLC, none of\nthem allows to study in detail its temporal evolution. In this sense, this work\nproposes a forecast procedure that combines detailed simulation and prediction,\nallowing an accurate analysis of the impact of different cache control policies\nand mechanisms (replacement, wear-leveling, compression, etc.) on the temporal\nevolution of the indices of interest, such as the effective capacity of the\nNV-LLC or the system IPC.

Compression\nis not used to store more blocks and increase the hit rate, but to reduce the\nwrite rate and increase the lifetime during which the cache supports near-peak\nperformance. It has affordable hardware overheads compared to that of a\nbaseline NV-LLC without compression in terms of area, latency and energy\nconsumption, and increases up to 6-37 times the time in which 50\\% of the\neffective capacity is degraded, depending on the variability in the\nmanufacturing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 15:22:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 14:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

Many reviewer recommendation approaches\n(recommenders) have been developed to support this task which apply a similar\nstrategy, i.e. modeling the review history first then followed by\npredicting/recommending a reviewer based on the model. Apparently, the better\nthe model reflects the reality in review history, the higher recommender's\nperformance we may expect. However, one typical scenario in a pull-request\ndevelopment paradigm, i.e. one Pull-Request (PR) (such as a revision or\naddition submitted by a contributor) may have multiple reviewers and they may\nimpact each other through publicly posted comments, has not been modeled well\nin existing recommenders. We adopted the hypergraph technique to model this\nhigh-order relationship (i.e. one PR with multiple reviewers herein) and\ndeveloped a new recommender, namely HGRec, which is evaluated by 12 OSS\nprojects with more than 87K PRs, 680K comments in terms of accuracy and\nrecommendation distribution. The results indicate that HGRec outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art recommenders on recommendation accuracy. Besides, among the\ntop three accurate recommenders, HGRec is more likely to recommend a diversity\nof reviewers, which can help to relieve the core reviewers' workload congestion\nissue. Moreover, since HGRec is based on hypergraph, which is a natural and\ninterpretable representation to model review history, it is easy to accommodate\nmore types of entities and realistic relationships in modern code review\nscenarios. As the first attempt, this study reveals the potentials of\nhypergraph on advancing the pragmatic solutions for code reviewer\nrecommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 15:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 08:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

Focusing on granular flow associated with the rotary drilling\nprocess, we investigate the performance of auger drilling in terms of sampling\nefficiency, defined as the mass ratio of the soil sample collected in the\ncoring tube to its total volume at a given penetration depth, by means of\nexperiments, numerical simulations, as well as theoretical analysis. The ratio\nof rotation to penetration speed is found to play a crucial role in the\nsampling process. A continuum model for the coupled granular flow in both\ncoring and discharging channels is proposed to elucidate the physical mechanism\nbehind the sampling process. Supported by a comparison to experimental results,\nthe continuum model provides a practical way to predict the performance of\nauger drilling. Further analysis reveals that the drilling process approaches a\nsteady state with constant granular flow speeds in both channels. In the steady\nstate, sampling efficiency decreases linearly with the growth of the rotation\nto penetration speed ratio, which can be well captured by the analytical\nsolution of the model. The analytical solution also suggests that the sampling\nefficiency is independent of gravity in the steady state, which has profound\nimplications for extraterrestrial sample collection in future space missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 15:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

Despite the\nencouraging progress of existing computational approaches in protein function\nprediction, it remains challenging to annotate proteins to a novel function\nthat is not collected in the Gene Ontology and does not have any annotated\nproteins. This limitation, a side effect from the widely-used multi-label\nclassification problem setting of protein function prediction, hampers the\nprogress of studying new pathways and biological processes, and further slows\ndown research in various biomedical areas. Here, we tackle this problem by\nannotating proteins to a function only based on its textual description so that\nwe do not need to know any associated proteins for this function. The key idea\nof our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a\nmachine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of\na function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer\nannotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a\nnovel function. We observed substantial improvement in annotating novel\nfunctions and sparsely annotated functions on CAFA3, SwissProt and GOA\ndatasets. We further demonstrated how our method accurately predicted gene\nmembers for a given pathway in Reactome, KEGG and MSigDB only based on the\npathway description. Finally, we showed how ProTranslator enabled us to\ngenerate the textual description instead of the function label for a set of\nproteins, providing a new scheme for protein function prediction. We envision\nProTranslator will give rise to a protein function \"search engine\" that returns\na list of proteins based on the free text queried by the user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 03:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

The paper concludes with a discussion of\nbroader implications of prompt engineering from the perspective of Human-AI\nInteraction (HAI) in future applications beyond the use case of text-to-image\ngeneration and AI generated art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 06:15:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 07:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Numerous works have been done to\nstudy how to regulate the Li growth in electrochemical cycling by using\nexternal stacking forces. While it is widely agreed that stack pressure\npositively affects the lithium plating/stripping process, the optimized\npressure range provided by different works varies greatly because of the\ndifference in the pressure control setup. In this work, a pressure control\napparatus is designed for Li metal batteries with liquid and solid-state\nelectrolytes (SSE). With considerations of minimizing cell to cell variation, a\nreusable split cell and pressure load cell are made for testing electrochemical\ncells with high precision pressure control. The capability of the designed\nsetup is demonstrated by studying the pressure effect on the Li\nplating/stripping process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 16:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Therefore, many SMILES-based molecular\nproperty prediction models have been developed. In particular,\ntransformer-based models show promising performance because the model utilizes\na massive chemical dataset for self-supervised learning. However, there is no\ntransformer-based model to overcome the inherent limitations of SMILES, which\nresult from the generation process of SMILES. In this study, we grammatically\nparsed SMILES to obtain connectivity between substructures and their type,\nwhich is called the grammatical knowledge of SMILES. First, we pretrained the\ntransformers with substructural tokens, which were parsed from SMILES. Then, we\nused the training strategy 'same compound model' to better understand SMILES\ngrammar. In addition, we injected knowledge of connectivity and type into the\ntransformer with knowledge adapters. As a result, our representation model\noutperformed previous compound representations for the prediction of molecular\nproperties. Finally, we analyzed the attention of the transformer model and\nadapters, demonstrating that the proposed model understands the grammar of\nSMILES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 01:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

We propose that there is an opportunity to improve the\nextent to which interventions are understood to be effective in their\ncontribution to the change required for Responsible AI.

In this paper we\nargue that insights from using this perspective demonstrate that the majority\nof current initiatives taken by various actors in the field, focus on low-order\ninterventions, such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating\nparameters, absent from higher-order interventions, such as redefining the\nsystem's foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging\nthe underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in\nthe first place(high-leverage).

Numerous applications demand effective image\nrestoration, e.g., computational photography, surveillance, autonomous\nvehicles, and remote sensing. Significant advances in image restoration have\nbeen made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nThe widely-used CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution\nor on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatial\ndetails are preserved but the contextual information cannot be precisely\nencoded. In the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but\nspatially less accurate. This paper presents a new architecture with a holistic\ngoal of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through\nthe entire network, and receiving complementary contextual information from the\nlow-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale\nresidual block containing the following key elements: (a) parallel\nmulti-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b)\ninformation exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local\nattention mechanism for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention\nbased multi-scale feature aggregation. Our approach learns an enriched set of\nfeatures that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while\nsimultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive\nexperiments on six real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method,\nnamed as MIRNet-v2 , achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety of image\nprocessing tasks, including defocus deblurring, image denoising,\nsuper-resolution, and image enhancement.

The annihilation of an electric current in normal metal with\nthe generation of Joule heat because of a non-zero resistance is well-known\nexample of irreversible process. The persistent current, an undamped electric\ncurrent observed in a superconductor, annihilates after the transition into the\nnormal state. Therefore this transition was considered as irreversible\nthermodynamic process before 1933. But if this transition is irreversible then\nthe Meissner effect discovered in 1933 is experimental evidence of a process\nreverse to the irreversible process. Belief in the law of entropy increase\nforced physicists to change their understanding of the superconducting\ntransition, which is considered a phase transition after 1933. This change has\nresulted to the internal inconsistency of the conventional theory of\nsuperconductivity, which is created within the framework of reversible\nthermodynamics but predicts Joule heating. The persistent current annihilates\nafter the transition into the normal state with the generation of Joule heat\nand reappears during the return to the superconducting state according to this\ntheory and contrary to the law of entropy increase. The success of the\nconventional theory of superconductivity forces to consider the validity of\nbelief in the law of entropy increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 15:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-11"}

The proposed system detects a person based on its\nhead, then utilizes the low-cost, high-speed regression network-based tracker\nto track the person of interest in real-time. The visual servoing of the mobile\nrobot has been designed using a PID controller which utilizes tracker output\nand depth estimation of the person in subsequent frames, hence providing smooth\nand adaptive movement of the robot based on target movement.
