Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally\nadapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses\nsome serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming\nconvolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified\ntraining and can impact the resulting audio quality.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal\nstreaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with\nreal-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training\nreconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models\ntrained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our\nmethod can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To\nevaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides\nhigh-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music\nand speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while\nhaving no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two\nopen-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and\nas a VST audio plugin.

This work\nintroduces a novel concept for generating high-Q quasi-BICs, which strongly\nrelaxes this requirement by incorporating a relatively large perturbative\nelement close to high-symmetry points of an undistorted BIC metasurface, acting\nas a coupler to the radiation continuum.

We present\nthree experiment precision measures and three related experiment precision\ncomparison methods. We systematically analyse the performance of the measures\nand methods proposed. We do so both through a simulation study (varying user\nrating variance and bias) and by using data from four real-world Quality of\nExperience (QoE) subjective experiments. In the simulation study we focus on\ncrowdsourcing QoE experiments, since they are known to generate ratings with\nhigher variance and bias, when compared to traditional subjective experiment\nmethodologies. We conclude that our proposed measures and related comparison\nmethods properly capture experiment precision (both when tested on simulated\nand real-world data). One of the measures also proves capable of dealing with\neven significantly biased responses. We believe our experiment precision\nassessment framework will help compare different subjective experiment\nmethodologies. For example, it may help decide which methodology results in\nmore precise user ratings.

Even so, the incorporation of\ntactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is\ndifficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be\nmodified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile\nsensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant\nproperties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is\ndifficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid\nand function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only\nfrom tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic\nfinger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its\ntactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a\nGelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any\nobject it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile\nreconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear\nand torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots\nto perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the\nfinger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass\nreorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision\nsensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing\ntechnology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers,\nincreasing their viability in many different fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 17:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

We focus on algorithms\nwhich use incoherent measurements, i.e. which only measure one copy of $\\rho$\nat a time. Unlike those that use entangled, multi-copy measurements, these can\nbe implemented without persistent quantum memory and thus represent a large\nclass of protocols that can be run on current or near-term devices.\n  For mixedness testing, there is a folklore algorithm which uses incoherent\nmeasurements and only needs $O(d^{3/2} / \\varepsilon^2)$ copies. The algorithm\nis non-adaptive, that is, its measurements are fixed ahead of time, and is\nknown to be optimal for non-adaptive algorithms. However, when the algorithm\ncan make arbitrary incoherent measurements, the best known lower bound is only\n$\\Omega (d^{4/3} / \\varepsilon^2)$ [Bubeck-Chen-Li '20], and it has been an\noutstanding open problem to close this polynomial gap.

However, the existing\ndecomposition methods still are quite sensitive to the various shapes of\nfrontiers of many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). On the one hand, the\ncone decomposition methods such as the penalty-based boundary intersection\n(PBI) are incapable of acquiring uniform frontiers for MaOPs with very convex\nfrontiers. On the other hand, the parallel reference lines of the parallel\ndecomposition methods including the normal boundary intersection (NBI) might\nresult in poor diversity because of under-sampling near the boundaries for\nMaOPs with concave frontiers. In this paper, a collaborative decomposition\nmethod is first proposed to integrate the advantages of parallel decomposition\nand cone decomposition to overcome their respective disadvantages. This method\ninherits the NBI-style Tchebycheff function as a convergence measure to\nheighten the convergence and uniformity of distribution of the PBI method.\nMoreover, this method also adaptively tunes the extent of rotating an NBI\nreference line towards a PBI reference line for every subproblem to enhance the\ndiversity of distribution of the NBI method.

Equivariances can be embedded in architectures through\nweight-sharing and place symmetry constraints on the functions a neural network\ncan represent. The type of symmetry is typically fixed and has to be chosen in\nadvance. Although some tasks are inherently equivariant, many tasks do not\nstrictly follow such symmetries. In such cases, equivariance constraints can be\noverly restrictive. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient relaxation\nof equivariance that can effectively interpolate between a (i) non-equivariant\nlinear product, (ii) a strict-equivariant convolution, and (iii) a\nstrictly-invariant mapping. The proposed parameterisation can be thought of as\na building block to allow adjustable symmetry structure in neural networks. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the amount of equivariance can be learned from\nthe training data using backpropagation.

Few works have attempted to obtain 3D segmentation masks using\nhuman interactions. Existing methods rely on user feedback in the 2D image\ndomain. As a consequence, users are required to constantly switch between 2D\nimages and 3D representations, and custom architectures are employed to combine\nmultiple input modalities. Therefore, integration with existing standard 3D\nmodels is not straightforward. The core idea of this work is to enable users to\ninteract directly with 3D point clouds by clicking on desired 3D objects of\ninterest~(or their background) to interactively segment the scene in an\nopen-world setting. Specifically, our method does not require training data\nfrom any target domain, and can adapt to new environments where no appropriate\ntraining sets are available. Our system continuously adjusts the object\nsegmentation based on the user feedback and achieves accurate dense 3D\nsegmentation masks with minimal human effort (few clicks per object).

While many algorithms have been proposed to\ncompute the CPD, alternating least squares (ALS) remains one of the most widely\nused algorithm for computing the decomposition. Recent works have introduced\nthe notion of eigenvalues and singular values of a tensor and explored\napplications of eigenvectors and singular vectors in areas like signal\nprocessing, data analytics and in various other fields. We introduce a new\nformulation for deriving singular values and vectors of a tensor by considering\nthe critical points of a function different from what is used in the previous\nwork. Computing these critical points in an alternating manner motivates an\nalternating optimization algorithm which corresponds to alternating least\nsquares algorithm in the matrix case. However, for tensors with order greater\nthan equal to $3$, it minimizes an objective function which is different from\nthe commonly used least squares loss. Alternating optimization of this new\nobjective leads to simple updates to the factor matrices with the same\nasymptotic computational cost as ALS. We show that a subsweep of this algorithm\ncan achieve a superlinear convergence rate for exact CPD with known rank and\nverify it experimentally. We then view the algorithm as optimizing a\nMahalanobis distance with respect to each factor with ground metric dependent\non the other factors. This perspective allows us to generalize our approach to\ninterpolate between updates corresponding to the ALS and the new algorithm to\nmanage the tradeoff between stability and fitness of the decomposition. Our\nexperimental results show that for approximating synthetic and real-world\ntensors, this algorithm and its variants converge to a better conditioned\ndecomposition with comparable and sometimes better fitness as compared to the\nALS algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 19:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2022 21:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

A contentious architectural decision in microservices is to\ncompose them using choreography or orchestration. In choreography, every\nservice works independently, whereas, in orchestration, there is a controller\nthat coordinates service interactions. This paper makes a case for\norchestration. The promise of microservices is that each microservice can be\nindependently developed, deployed, tested, upgraded, and scaled. This makes\nthem suitable for systems running on cloud infrastructures. However,\nmicroservice-based systems become complicated due to the complex interactions\nof various services, concurrent events, failing components, developers' lack of\nglobal view, and configurations of the environment. This makes maintaining and\ndebugging such systems very challenging. We hypothesize that orchestrated\nservices are easier to debug and to test this we ported the largest publicly\navailable microservices' benchmark TrainTicket, which is implemented using\nchoreography, to a fault-oblivious stateful workflow framework Temporal.

In practice, these representations are highly entangled\nas they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's\ninterests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user\nconformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations\nfor inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when\nthe recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with\nthe user's interests).\n  Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a\ncausal perspective.

The critical\nchallenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These\nconfounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them.

It is a resource\nallocation problem that entails assigning $m$ tasks to $n$ machines for\nexecution. Machines are regarded as strategic agents who may lie about their\nexecution costs so as to minimize their allocated workload. To address the\nsituation when monetary payment is not an option to compensate the machines'\ncosts, \\citeauthor{DBLP:journals/mst/Koutsoupias14} [2014] devised two\n\\textit{truthful} mechanisms, K and P respectively, that achieve an\napproximation ratio of $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ and $n$, for social cost minimization.\nIn addition, no truthful mechanism can achieve an approximation ratio better\nthan $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Hence, mechanism K is optimal. While approximation ratio\nprovides a strong worst-case guarantee, it also limits us to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of mechanism performance on various inputs. This paper\ninvestigates these two scheduling mechanisms beyond the worst case. We first\nshow that mechanism K achieves a smaller social cost than mechanism P on every\ninput. That is, mechanism K is pointwise better than mechanism P. Next, for\neach task $j$, when machines' execution costs $t_i^j$ are independent and\nidentically drawn from a task-specific distribution $F^j(t)$, we show that the\naverage-case approximation ratio of mechanism K converges to a constant. This\nbound is tight for mechanism K. For a better understanding of this distribution\ndependent constant, on the one hand, we estimate its value by plugging in a few\ncommon distributions; on the other, we show that this converging bound improves\na known bound \\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Zhang18} which only captures the single-task\nsetting.

In this work, we perform\na systematic study of this accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off on two widely used\nlong-sequence models - Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) and Big Bird - during\nfine-tuning and inference on four datasets from the SCROLLS benchmark. To study\nhow this trade-off differs across hyperparameter settings, we compare the\nmodels across four sequence lengths (1024, 2048, 3072, 4096) and two model\nsizes (base and large) under a fixed resource budget.

However, this comes at the cost\nof a large drop in inference speed.

We find that the\nproperties of the winds depend on both black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and accretion\ndisk luminosity.

The\nincentives are offered after solving a large-scale optimization problem in\norder to minimize the total travel time (or minimize any cost function of the\nnetwork such as total Carbon emission). Since this massive size optimization\nproblem needs to be solved continually in the network, we developed a\ndistributed computational approach. The proposed distributed algorithm is\nguaranteed to converge under a mild set of assumptions that are verified with\nreal data. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm using traffic data\nfrom the Los Angeles area.

However,\nhuman-robot interface signals are usually user-dependent, which causes that the\nclassifier trained on source subjects performs poorly on new subjects. To\naddress this issue, this paper designs the ensemble diverse hypotheses and\nknowledge distillation (EDHKD) method to realize unsupervised cross-subject\nadaptation. EDH mitigates the divergence between labeled data of source\nsubjects and unlabeled data of target subjects to accurately classify the\nlocomotion modes of target subjects without labeling data. Compared to previous\ndomain adaptation methods based on the single learner, which may only learn a\nsubset of features from input signals, EDH can learn diverse features by\nincorporating multiple diverse feature generators and thus increases the\naccuracy and decreases the variance of classifying target data, but it\nsacrifices the efficiency. To solve this problem, EDHKD (student) distills the\nknowledge from the EDH (teacher) to a single network to remain efficient and\naccurate. The performance of the EDHKD is theoretically proved and\nexperimentally validated on a 2D moon dataset and two public human locomotion\ndatasets. Experimental results show that the EDHKD outperforms all other\nmethods. The EDHKD can classify target data with 96.9%, 94.4%, and 97.4%\naverage accuracy on the above three datasets with a short computing time (1\nms). Compared to a benchmark (BM) method, the EDHKD increases 1.3% and 7.1%\naverage accuracy for classifying the locomotion modes of target subjects. The\nEDHKD also stabilizes the learning curves. Therefore, the EDHKD is significant\nfor increasing the generalization ability and efficiency of the human intent\nprediction and human activity recognition system, which will improve\nhuman-robot interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 03:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

An effective\nmechanism can significantly improve performance and efficiency of social\ndecisions under desired objectives, such as to maximize social welfare or to\nmaximize revenue for agents. However, mechanism design is challenging for many\ncommon models including the public project problem model which we study in this\nthesis. A typical public project problem is a group of agents crowdfunding a\npublic project (e.g., building a bridge). The mechanism will decide the payment\nand allocation for each agent (e.g., how much the agent pays, and whether the\nagent can use it) according to their valuations. The mechanism can be applied\nto various economic scenarios, including those related to cyber security. There\nare different constraints and optimized objectives for different public project\nscenarios (sub-problems), making it unrealistic to design a universal mechanism\nthat fits all scenarios, and designing mechanisms for different settings\nmanually is a taxing job. Therefore, we explore automated mechanism design\n(AMD) of public project problems under different constraints.\n  In this thesis, we focus on the public project problem, which includes many\nsub-problems (excludable/non-excludable, divisible/indivisible,\nbinary/non-binary).

The presented method considers\nthe minimum size of parts, the minimum size of cavities, the inability of\nprinting overhanging parts without the use of sacrificial supporting\nstructures, and the printing directions. These constraints are geometrically\naddressed and implemented. The minimum size on solid and void zones is imposed\nthrough a well-known filtering technique. The sacrificial support material is\nreduced using a constraint that limits the maximum overhang angle of parts by\ncomparing the structural gradient with a critical reference slope. Due to the\nlocal nature of the gradient, the chosen restriction is prone to introduce\nparts that meet the structural slope but that may not be self-supporting. The\nrestriction limits the maximum overhang angle for a user-defined printing\ndirection, which could reduce structural performance if the orientation is not\nproperly selected. To ease these challenges, a new approach to reduce the\nintroduction of such non-self-supporting parts and a novel method that includes\ndifferent printing directions in the maximum overhang angle constraint are\npresented. The proposed strategy for considering the minimum size of solid and\nvoid phases, maximum overhang angle, and printing direction, is illustrated by\nsolving a set of 2D benchmark design problems including stiff structures and\ncompliant mechanisms.

Earlier works follow a top-down roadmap to regress predefined\nanchors into various shapes of lane lines, which lacks enough flexibility to\nfit complex shapes of lanes due to the fixed anchor shapes. Lately, some works\npropose to formulate lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem to\ndescribe the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and gradually group adjacent\nkeypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which is\ninefficient and time-consuming during postprocessing. In this paper, we propose\na Global Association Network (GANet) to formulate the lane detection problem\nfrom a new perspective, where each keypoint is directly regressed to the\nstarting point of the lane line instead of point-by-point extension.\nConcretely, the association of keypoints to their belonged lane line is\nconducted by predicting their offsets to the corresponding starting points of\nlanes globally without dependence on each other, which could be done in\nparallel to greatly improve efficiency. In addition, we further propose a\nLane-aware Feature Aggregator (LFA), which adaptively captures the local\ncorrelations between adjacent keypoints to supplement local information to the\nglobal association.

These instabilities originate in geometric incompatibility between the\npreferred extrinsic and intrinsic curvature of the shell, which may be modified\nby active deformations through the thickness and in plane respectively. Here,\nwe solve the simplest possible model of such instabilities, which assumes the\nshells are shallow, thin enough to bend but not stretch, and subject to\nhomogeneous preferred curvatures. We consider separately the cases of zero,\npositive and negative Gaussian curvature. We identify two types of\nsuper-critical symmetry breaking instability, in which the shell's principal\ncurvature spontaneously breaks discrete up-down symmetry and continuous planar\nisotropy respectively. These are then augmented by inversion instabilities, in\nwhich the shell jumps sub-critically between up/down broken symmetry states,\nand rotation instabilities, in which the curvatures rotate by 90 degrees\nbetween states of broken isotropy without release of energy. Each instability\nhas a thickness independent threshold value for the preferred extrinsic\ncurvature proportional to the square-root of Gauss curvature. Finally, we show\nthat the threshold for the isotropy-breaking instability is the same for deep\nspherical caps, in good agreement with recently published data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 06:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

Our preliminary analysis showed\nthat high global similarity of medical images in terms of anatomy hampers\ninstance discrimination methods for capturing a set of distinct features,\nnegatively impacting their performance on medical downstream tasks. To\nalleviate this limitation, we have developed a simple yet effective\nself-supervised framework, called Context-Aware instance Discrimination (CAiD).\nCAiD aims to improve instance discrimination learning by providing finer and\nmore discriminative information encoded from a diverse local context of\nunlabeled medical images.

Therefore, we\npresent MVSTER, which leverages the proposed epipolar Transformer to learn both\n2D semantics and 3D spatial associations efficiently.

To address the problem, we propose a novel\nend-to-end model called Crowd Attention Convolutional Neural Network (CAT-CNN).\nOur CAT-CNN can adaptively assess the importance of a human head at each pixel\nlocation by automatically encoding a confidence map.

During\ninference, the editing at each iteration is realized by two-step span\nreplacement. At the first step, the distributed representation of the text\noptimizes on the fly towards an attribute function. At the second step, a text\nspan is masked and another new one is proposed conditioned on the optimized\nrepresentation.

From information theory, surprisal is a measurement of how\nunexpected an event is.

The issues and pull requests of\nsoftware repository issue trackers give insight into the development process\nand likely contain the surprising events of this process.\n  Objective. Prior works have identified that unusual events in software\nrepositories are of interest to developers, and use simple code metrics-based\nmethods for detecting them. In this study we will propose a new method for\nunusual event detection in software repositories using surprisal. With the\nability to find surprising issues and pull requests, we intend to further\nanalyse them to determine if they actually hold importance in a repository, or\nif they pose a significant challenge to address.

At every round, a player (called Builder) is\npresented with a vertex $v$ chosen uniformly at random and constructs an edge\nof his choice that is incident to $v$. Inspired by recent advances, we define a\nfamily of generalised online semi-random models. Then, we analyse a particular\ninstance that shares similar features with the original semi-random graph\nprocess and study the hitting times of classical graph properties.\n  More formally, in our model the process also starts with the empty graph on\n$n$ vertices. At the beginning of each round, Builder is offered a spanning\ntree $T$ of $K_n$ chosen uniformly at random and independently from the\nprevious rounds. He then chooses an edge from $T$ and adds it (if not yet\npresent) to the already constructed graph.

Each modal field is\nthen taken as the desired focal field, the band-limited waves of which are\nbackward propagated to the pupil plane via a reversal of the Richards--Wolf\nvector diffraction formula. The pupil fields can be designed to be genuinely\nparaxial by associating the longitudinal electric/magnetic field component with\nthe radial one on the reference sphere. The inversely designed pupil field in\nturn is propagated forwardly into the focal region to generate the designed\nfocal field, whose distribution over the nanostructure's surface is used to\nevaluate the overlap between the designed focal field and the modal fields,\ni.e., the modal expansion coefficients.

So far, it is unclear how\nsilicification affects the internal structure of the DNA origami and whether\nthe whole DNA framework is embedded or if silica just forms an outer shell. By\nusing in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that the\nnet-cationic silica precursor TMAPS induces substantial condensation of the DNA\norigami, which is further enhanced by the addition of TEOS at early reaction\ntimes to an almost 10 % size reduction. We identify the SAXS Porod invariant as\na reliable, model-free parameter for the evaluation of the amount of silica\nformation at a given time. Contrast matching of the DNA double helix Lorentzian\npeak reveals that silica growth also occurs on the inner surfaces of the\norigami.

Each of these fluxes is essential for human and ecosystem\nwell-being. However, predicting how the water cycle responds to changes in\nvegetation cover, remains a challenge (Lawrence and Vandecar, 2015; Ellison et\nal., 2017; te Wierik et al., 2021). Recently, rainfall was shown to decrease\ndisproportionally with reduced forest transpiration following deforestation\n(Baudena et al., 2021). Here, combining these findings with the law of matter\nconservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere forest\ntranspiration can control atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased\ntranspiration enhances atmospheric moisture import. Conversely, in a drier\natmosphere increased transpiration reduces atmospheric moisture convergence and\nrunoff. This previously unrecognized dichotomy can explain the seemingly random\nobservations of runoff and soil moisture sometimes increasing and sometimes\nreducing in response to re-greening (e.g., Zheng et al., 2021). Evaluating the\ntransition between the two regimes is crucial both for characterizing the risk\nposed by deforestation as well as for motivating and guiding global ecosystem\nrestoration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 10:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

Additionally, recent work has highlighted the importance of the\ninitialisation method on GE's performance. While recent work has shed light on\nthe matters of initialisation and grammar design with respect to GE, their\nimpact on other methods, such as random search and context-free grammar genetic\nprogramming (CFG-GP), is largely unknown. This paper examines GE, random search\nand CFG-GP under a range of benchmark problems using several different\ninitialisation routines and grammar designs. The results suggest that CFG-GP is\nless sensitive to initialisation and grammar design than both GE and random\nsearch: we also demonstrate that observed cases of poor performance by CFG-GP\nare managed through simple adjustment of tuning parameters. We conclude that\nCFG-GP is a strong base from which to conduct grammar-guided evolutionary\nsearch, and that future work should focus on understanding the parameter space\nof CFG-GP for better application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 10:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

We defined as\ncluster members a spectroscopic redshift sample of 359 galaxies within 4sigma_v\nof the mean cluster velocity, and a photometric redshift sample covering the\n[0.48,0.61] range. We searched for RPS galaxies and tested the error on their\nclassification with a Zooniverse collaboration, and computed the phase space\ndiagram for the spectroscopic sample. We ran the LePhare stellar population\nsynthesis code to analyze and compare the properties of RPS and non-RPS\ngalaxies. We find 56 and 273 RPS candidates in the spectroscopic and\nphotometric redshift samples, respectively, distributed throughout the cluster\nand tending to avoid high density regions. The phase space diagram gives the\npercentages of virialized, backsplash, and infall galaxies. RPS galaxy\ncandidates typically show rather high star formation rates, young ages, and\nrelatively low masses. This study confirms that RPS galaxies host, on average,\nyounger stellar populations and strongly form stars when compared with non-RPS\ncounterparts. The fact that RPS candidates with spectroscopic and with\nphotometric redshifts have comparable properties shows that large samples of\nsuch objects could be gathered based on multi-band photometry only, a promising\nresult in view of future very large imaging surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 12:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

MoEBQA\nautomatically learns the routing strategy in an end-to-end manner so that each\nexpert tends to deal with the question types it is expert in. We evaluate\nMoEBQA on three BQA datasets constructed based on real examinations. The\nresults show that our MoE extension significantly boosts the performance of\nquestion answering models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. In\naddition, we elaborately analyze our MoE modules to reveal how MoEBQA works and\nfind that it can automatically group the questions into human-readable\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

Further interesting phenomena such as,\ne.g., non-vanishing resistance and shot noise of the voltage in current-biased\nsuperconducting nanowires, are caused by non-Gaussian fluctuations of the order\nparameter -- quantum phase slips (QPS). Such phenomena may be interpreted in\nterms of tunneling of fluxons playing the role of effective quantum \"particles\"\ndual to Cooper pairs and obeying complicated full counting statistics which\nreduces to Poissonian one in the low frequency limit.

From the analytic point of view, solution of these equations\nsatisfy under certain conditions maximum principles, which represent physical\nbounds of the solution. That the same bounds are respected by numerical\napproximations of the solution is often of utmost importance in practice. The\nmathematical formulation of this property, which contributes to the physical\nconsistency of a method, is called Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP). In many\napplications, convection dominates diffusion by several orders of magnitude. It\nis well known that standard discretizations typically do not satisfy the DMP in\nthis convection-dominated regime. In fact, in this case, it turns out to be a\nchallenging problem to construct discretizations that, on the one hand, respect\nthe DMP and, on the other hand, compute accurate solutions. This paper presents\na survey on finite element methods, with a main focus on the\nconvection-dominated regime, that satisfy a local or a global DMP. The concepts\nof the underlying numerical analysis are discussed. The survey reveals that for\nthe steady-state problem there are only a few discretizations, all of them\nnonlinear, that at the same time satisfy the DMP and compute reasonably\naccurate solutions, e.g., algebraically stabilized schemes. Moreover, most of\nthese discretizations have been developed in recent years, showing the enormous\nprogress that has been achieved lately.

To properly\ncharacterize the physics of these sources, and better understand their emission\nand impact on the environment, careful modelling of the outflow interactions,\nspanning a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, is needed. Full\n3-dimensional approaches are very computationally expensive, but simpler\napproximate approaches, while still realistic at the semi-quantitative level,\nare available. We present here the results of calculations done with a quasi\n3-dimensional scheme to compute the evolution of the interacting flows in a\nregion spanning in size up to a thousand times the size of the binary. In\nparticular, we analyze for the first time the role of different eccentricities\nin the large scale evolution of the shocked flows. We find that the higher the\neccentricity, the closer the flows behave like a one-side outflow, which\nbecomes rather collimated for eccentricity values $\\gtrsim 0.75$. The\nsimulations also unveil that the pulsar and the stellar winds become fully\nmixed within the grid for low eccentricity systems, presenting a more\nstochastic behavior at large scales than in the highly eccentric systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-18"}

Our fiducial model, where ices are inherited from the interstellar\nmedium, can account for the observed mixing ratio ranges of each molecule\nconsidered, but no single location or time reproduces the abundances of all\nmolecules simultaneously.
