In principle, modular robots\ncan be disassembled and reassembled in different robots, and possibly perform\nnew tasks. Nevertheless, actually exploiting modularity is yet an unsolved\nproblem: controllers usually rely on inter-module communication, a practical\nrequirement that makes modules not perfectly interchangeable and thus limits\ntheir flexibility. Here, we focus on Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs),\naggregations of mechanically identical elastic blocks. We use the same neural\ncontroller inside each voxel, but without any inter-voxel communication, hence\nenabling ideal conditions for modularity: modules are all equal and\ninterchangeable. We optimize the parameters of the neural controller-shared\namong the voxels-by evolutionary computation. Crucially, we use a local\nself-attention mechanism inside the controller to overcome the absence of\ninter-module communication channels, thus enabling our robots to truly be\ndriven by the collective intelligence of their modules. We show experimentally\nthat the evolved robots are effective in the task of locomotion: thanks to\nself-attention, instances of the same controller embodied in the same robot can\nfocus on different inputs. We also find that the evolved controllers generalize\nto unseen morphologies, after a short fine-tuning, suggesting that an inductive\nbias related to the task arises from true modularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 16:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

One of the\nmost effective approaches to adapt to a new language is \\textit{language\nadaptive fine-tuning} (LAFT) -- fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual\ntexts of a language using the pre-training objective. However, adapting to a\ntarget language individually takes a large disk space and limits the\ncross-lingual transfer abilities of the resulting models because they have been\nspecialized for a single language. In this paper, we perform\n\\textit{multilingual adaptive fine-tuning} on 17 most-resourced African\nlanguages and three other high-resource languages widely spoken on the African\ncontinent to encourage cross-lingual transfer learning. To further specialize\nthe multilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer\nthat corresponds to non-African writing scripts before MAFT, thus reducing the\nmodel size by around 50%. Our evaluation on two multilingual PLMs (AfriBERTa\nand XLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classification, and sentiment\nclassification) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on\nindividual languages while requiring significantly less disk space.\nAdditionally, we show that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot\ncross-lingual transfer abilities of parameter efficient fine-tuning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 16:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2022 08:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 13:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion\nin clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may\nexperience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need\nto be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on\nethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method\nfor trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a\ncrucial and urgent goal.

Using principles of fairness in machine\nlearning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked\nlist of potential trial sites.

Telescopes such as\nJWST and ARIEL will improve the quality and availability of these measurements.\nThis motivates an improved understanding of the processes that determine\natmospheric temperature structure, particularly atmospheric circulation. The\ncirculation is important in determining atmospheric temperatures, not only\nthrough its ability to transport heat, but also because any circulation pattern\nneeds to be balanced by horizontal pressure contrasts, therefore implying a\nparticular temperature structure. In this work, we show how the global\ntemperature field on a tidally locked planet can be decomposed into\ncontributions that are balanced by different components of the atmospheric\ncirculation. These are the superrotating jet, stationary Rossby waves, and the\ndivergent circulation. To achieve this, we partition the geopotential field\ninto components balanced by the divergent circulation and the rotational\ncirculation, with the latter comprising the jet and Rossby waves. The\npartitioned geopotential then implies a corresponding partitioning of the\ntemperature via the hydrostatic relation. We apply these diagnostics to\nidealised general circulation model simulations, to show how the separate\nrotational and divergent circulations together make up the total\nthree-dimensional atmospheric temperature structure. We also show how each\ncomponent contributes distinct signatures to the thermal phase curve of a\ntidally locked planet. We conclude that this decomposition is a physically\nmeaningful separation of the temperature field that explains its global\nstructure, and can be used to fit observations of thermal emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 16:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-28"}

Ultracold atomic gases in multiply connected traps also\nexhibit long-lived supercurrents, and have attracted much interest both for\nfundamental studies of superfluid dynamics and as prototypes for atomtronic\ncircuits. Here, we report on the realization of supercurrents in homogeneous,\ntunable fermionic rings. We gain exquisite, rapid control over quantized\npersistent currents in all regimes of the BCS-BEC crossover through a universal\nphase-imprinting technique, attaining on-demand circulations $w$ as high as 9.\nHigh-fidelity read-out of the superfluid circulation state is achieved by\nexploiting an interferometric protocol, which also yields local information\nabout the superfluid phase around the ring. In the absence of externally\nintroduced perturbations, we find the induced metastable supercurrents to be as\nlong-lived as the atomic sample. Conversely, we trigger and inspect the\nsupercurrent decay by inserting a single small obstacle within the ring.

To mitigate wildfire ignition risks,\nelectric power system operators proactively de-energize high-risk power lines\nduring \"public safety power shut-off\" (PSPS) events. Line de-energizations can\ncause communities to lose power, which may result in negative economic, health,\nand safety impacts. Furthermore, the same communities may repeatedly experience\npower shutoffs over the course of a wildfire season, which compounds these\nnegative impacts. However, there may be many combinations of power lines whose\nde-energization will result in about the same reduction of system-wide wildfire\nrisk, but the associated power outages affect different communities. Therefore,\none may raise concerns regarding the fairness of de-energization decisions.\nAccordingly, this paper proposes a framework to select lines to de-energize in\norder to balance wildfire risk reduction, total load shedding, and fairness\nconsiderations. The goal of the framework is to prevent a small fraction of\ncommunities from disproportionally being impacted by PSPS events, and to\ninstead more equally share the burden of power outages. For a geolocated test\ncase in the southwestern United States, we use actual California demand data as\nwell as real wildfire risk forecasts to simulate PSPS events during the 2021\nwildfire season and compare the performance of various methods for promoting\nfairness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed formulation can provide\nsignificantly more fair outcomes with limited impacts on system-wide\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 17:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2022 16:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-03"}

As a step towards these important\ndirections, we here propose and extensively apply a multifaceted and\nengineering-friendly methodological framework for the thorough characterization\nof seasonal hydroclimatic dependence, variability and change at the global\nscale. We apply this framework using over 13 000 quarterly temperature,\nprecipitation and river flow time series. In these time series, the seasonal\nhydroclimatic behaviour is represented by 3-month means of earth-observed\nvariables. In our analyses, we also adopt the well-established Koppen-Geiger\nclimate classification system and define continental-scale regions with large\nor medium density of observational stations. In this context, we provide in\nparallel seasonal hydroclimatic feature summaries and comparisons in terms of\nautocorrelation, seasonality, temporal variation, entropy, long-range\ndependence and trends. We find notable differences to characterize the\nmagnitudes of most of these features across the various Koppen-Geiger climate\nclasses, as well as between several continental-scale geographical regions. We,\ntherefore, deem that the consideration of the comparative summaries could be\nmore beneficial in water resources engineering contexts than the also provided\nglobal summaries.

Especially under the consideration of multi-energy systems,\nwhich connect energy domains such as heat and electricity supply, expansion and\noperational planning of so-called decentral multi-energy systems (DMES) holds a\nmultiplicity of complexities. This motivates the use of optimization problems,\nwhich reach their limitations with regard to computational feasibility in\ncombination with the required level of detail. With an increased focus on DMES\nimplementation, this problem is aggravated since, moving away from the\ntraditional system perspective, a user-centered, market-integrated perspective\nis assumed. Besides technical concepts it requires the consideration of market\nregimes, e.g. self-consumption and the broader energy sharing. This highlights\nthe need for DMES optimization models which cover a microeconomic perspective\nunder consideration of detailed technical options and energy regulation, in\norder to understand mutual technical and socio-economic and -ecologic\ninteractions of energy policies. In this context we present a\nstakeholder-oriented multi-criteria optimization model for DMES, which\naddresses technical aspects, as well as market and services coverage towards a\nreal-world implementation. The current work bridges a gap between the required\nmodelling level of detail and computational feasibility of DMES expansion and\noperation optimization. Model detail is achieved by the application of a hybrid\ncombination of mathematical methods in a nested multi-level decomposition\napproach, including a Genetic Algorithm, Benders Decomposition and Lagrange\nRelaxation.

Patients face risks due to the possible loss in\nprivacy or livelihood that can occur when medical data is stolen or used in\nnon-permitted ways, whereas health care providers face risks due to the\nassociated liability. For medical data, these risks persist even after\nanonymizing/deidentifying, according to the standards defined in existing\nlegislation, the data sets prior to sharing, because shared medical data can\noften be deanonymized/reidentified using advanced artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning methodologies. As a result, health care providers are hesitant\nto share medical data. One possible solution to encourage health care providers\nto responsibly share data is through the use of cybersecurity insurance\ncontracts. This paper studies the problem of designing optimal cybersecurity\ninsurance contracts, with the goal of encouraging the sharing of the medical\ndata. We use a principal-agent model with moral hazard to model various\nscenarios, derive the optimal contract, discuss its implications, and perform\nnumerical case studies.

For odd $D$ we introduce the multipartite mutual information,\nand show that it exhibits a $\\log^D L$ divergence as a function of system size\n$L$ with a universal coefficient that is proportional to the Euler\ncharacteristic $\\chi_F$ of the Fermi sea. This provides a generalization, for a\nFermi gas, of the well-known result for $D=1$ that expresses the $\\log L$\ndivergence of the bipartite entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge\n$c$ characterizing a conformal field theory. For even $D$ we introduce a\ncharge-weighted entanglement entropy that is manifestly odd under a\nparticle-hole transformation. We show that the corresponding charge-weighted\nmutual information exhibits a similar $\\log^D L$ divergence proportional to\n$\\chi_F$. Our analysis relates the universal behavior of the multipartite\nmutual information in the absence of interactions to the $D+1$'th order\nequal-time density correlation function, which we show exhibits a universal\nbehavior in the long wavelength limit proportional to $\\chi_F$. Our analytic\nresults are based on the replica method. In addition we perform a numerical\nstudy of the charge-weighted mutual information for $D=2$ that confirms several\naspects of the analytic theory.

The effective charge of the apex leads to defect absorption and\nemission at the cone apex as the deficit angle of the cone is varied.\n  For total topological defect charge 1, e.g. imposed by tangential boundary\nconditions at the edge, we find that for a disk the ground state configuration\nconsists of $p$ defects each of charge $+1/p$ lying equally spaced on a\nconcentric ring of radius $d = (\\frac{p-1}{3p-1})^{\\frac{1}{2p}} R$, where $R$\nis the radius of the disk. In the case of a cone with tangential boundary\nconditions at the base, we find three types of ground state configurations as a\nfunction of cone angle: (1) for sharp cones, all of the $+1/p$ defects are\nabsorbed by the apex; (2) at intermediate cone angles, some of the $+1/p$\ndefects are absorbed by the apex and the rest lie equally spaced along a\nconcentric ring on the flank; and (3) for nearly flat cones, all of the $+1/p$\ndefects lie equally spaced along a concentric ring on the flank. Here the\ndefect positions and the absorption transitions depend intricately on $p$ and\nthe deficit angle which we analytically compute. We check these results with\nnumerical simulations for a set of commensurate cone angles and find excellent\nagreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 18:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Purpose: A least-squares iterative algorithm for pCT image\nreconstruction converges toward a unique solution that optimally fits the\nprotons. We present a stopping criterion that delivers solutions with the\nproperty that correlations of RSP noise between voxels are relatively low. This\nprovides a method to produce pCT images with consistent noise properties useful\nfor proton therapy treatment planning, which relies on summing RSP along\ncolumns of voxels. Consistent noise properties will also be useful for future\nstudies of image quality using metrics such as contrast to noise ratio, and to\ncompare RSP noise and dose of pCT with other modalities such as dual-energy CT.\nWith simulated and real images with varying heterogeneity from a prototype\nclinical proton imaging system, we calculate average RSP correlations between\nvoxel pairs in uniform regions-of-interest versus distance between voxels. We\ndefine a parameter r, the remaining distance to the unique solution relative to\nestimated RSP noise, and our stopping criterion is based on r falling below a\nchosen value. Results: We find large correlations between voxels for larger\nvalues of r, and anticorrelations for smaller values. For r in the range of 0.5\nto 1, voxels are relatively uncorrelated, and compared to smaller values of r\nhave lower noise with only slight loss of spatial resolution. Conclusions: A\nleast-squares iterative algorithm with an r-based stopping criterion defines a\npCT image reconstruction method with consistent statistical properties optimal\nfor clinical use, including for treatment planning with pCT images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 18:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Most of\nthese applications rely on a metrically correct prediction of the shape,\nespecially, when the reconstructed subject is put into a metrical context\n(i.e., when there is a reference object of known size). A metrical\nreconstruction is also needed for any application that measures distances and\ndimensions of the subject (e.g., to virtually fit a glasses frame).\nState-of-the-art methods for face reconstruction from a single image are\ntrained on large 2D image datasets in a self-supervised fashion. However, due\nto the nature of a perspective projection they are not able to reconstruct the\nactual face dimensions, and even predicting the average human face outperforms\nsome of these methods in a metrical sense. To learn the actual shape of a face,\nwe argue for a supervised training scheme.

The inner planet transits its host star. The planets travel on\neccentric orbits and are near the 4:1 mean-motion resonance, which implies\nsignificant mutual gravitational interactions. In particular, this causes\ntransit-timing variations of a few minutes, which were detected based on\nground-based photometry. This made WASP-148 one of the few cases where such a\nphenomenon was detected without space-based photometry. Here, we present a\nself-consistent model of WASP-148 that takes into account the gravitational\ninteractions between all known bodies in the system. Our analysis\nsimultaneously fits the available radial velocities and transit light curves.\nIn particular, we used the photometry secured by the TESS space telescope and\nmade public after the WASP-148 discovery announcement. The TESS data confirm\nthe transit-timing variations, but only in combination with previously measured\ntransit times. The system parameters we derived agree with those previously\nreported and have a significantly improved precision, including the mass of the\nnon-transiting planet. We found a significant mutual inclination between the\norbital planes of the two planets: I=41.0 +6.2 -7.6 deg based on the modelling\nof the observations, although we found I=20.8 +/- 4.6 deg when we imposed a\nconstraint on the model enforcing long-term dynamical stability. When a third\nplanet was added to the model - based on a candidate signal in the radial\nvelocity - the mutual inclination between planets b and c changed significantly\nallowing solutions closer to coplanar. We conclude that more data are needed to\nestablish the true architecture of the system. If the significant mutual\ninclination is confirmed, WASP-148 would become one of the only few candidate\nnon-coplanar planetary systems.

Since the\nSpMV operation is a memory-bound algorithm, the efficiency of data movements\nheavily influenced the performance of the SpMV on GPU. In recent years, many\nresearch is conducted in accelerating the performance of SpMV on the graphic\nprocessing units (GPU). The performance optimization methods used in existing\nstudies focus on the following areas: improve the load balancing between GPU\nprocessors, and reduce the execution divergence between GPU threads. Although\nsome studies have made preliminary optimization on the input vector fetching,\nthe effect of explicitly caching the input vector on GPU base SpMV has not been\nstudied in depth yet. In this study, we are trying to minimize the data\nmovements cost for GPU-based SpMV using a new framework named \"explicit caching\nHybrid (EHYB)\". The EHYB framework achieved significant performance improvement\nby using the following methods: 1. Improve the speed of data movements by\npartitioning and explicitly caching the input vector to the shared memory of\nthe CUDA kernel. 2. Reduce the volume of data movements by storing the major\npart of the column index with a compact format. We tested our implementation\nwith sparse matrices derived from FEM applications in different areas.

This schemaless feature\noffers flexibility to evolve data-intensive applications when data frequently\nchange. However, freeing from declaring schemas does not mean their absence,\nbut rather that they are implicit in data and code. Therefore, diagramming\ntools similar to those available for relational systems are also needed to help\ndevelopers and administrators understanding NoSQL schemas.\n  Visualizing diagrams is not practical if schemas contain hundreds of database\nentities, and exploration or query facilities are then needed. In schemaless\nNoSQL stores, data of the same entity can be stored with different structure\nwhich can increase the difficulty of having readable diagrams.\n  NoSQL schema management tools should therefore have three main components:\nschema extraction, schema visualization, and schema query. Since that there\nexist four main NoSQL data models, it is convenient that such tools can be\nbuilt on a generic data model that provide platform-independence to query and\nvisualize schemas. With the aim of favoring the creation of generic database\ntools, the authors of this paper defined the U-Schema unified data model that\nintegrates the four main NoSQL data models and the relational model.\n  This paper is focused on querying NoSQL and relational schemas which are\nrepresented as U-Schema models.

With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO\nhas gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures\nat various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate,\ngraded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or\nmore pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are\nused to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in\ncomputation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO.\n  A successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling\nnumerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch\nbetween these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the\npartition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at\ntermination.\n  In this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique\nclassification capacity of neural networks. Specifically, we propose a graded\nmultiscale topology optimization using neural-network (GM-TOuNN) framework with\nthe following features: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly\ndependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees\npartition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, and (3) it\nsupports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity\nanalysis.

Non-additive metrics, such\nas ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires\npreceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the\nmetric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input\nfeatures and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along\nelements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It\nrules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a\nfunction of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)\nsegmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that\nare supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of\nthe metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)\ntransformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,\n(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling\nof the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the\naggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation\nhas been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level\nunivariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps\nallows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum\nof time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic\nexample that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail\ncredit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived\ninput features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process\nControl has been introduced for the residual time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 01:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

In this paper, we propose a hybrid NAS\nframework for ultrasound (US) image classification and segmentation. The hybrid\nframework consists of a pre-trained backbone and several searched cells (i.e.,\nnetwork building blocks), which takes advantage of the strengths of both NAS\nand the expert knowledge from existing convolutional neural networks.\nSpecifically, two effective and lightweight operations, a mixed depth-wise\nconvolution operator and a squeeze-and-excitation block, are introduced into\nthe candidate operations to enhance the variety and capacity of the searched\ncells. These two operations not only decrease model parameters but also boost\nnetwork performance. Moreover, we propose a re-aggregation strategy for the\nsearched cells, aiming to further improve the performance for different vision\ntasks. We tested our method on two large US image datasets, including a 9-class\nechinococcosis dataset containing 9566 images for classification and an ovary\ndataset containing 3204 images for segmentation. Ablation experiments and\ncomparison with other handcrafted or automatically searched architectures\ndemonstrate that our method can generate more powerful and lightweight models\nfor the above US image classification and segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 01:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 08:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

A common way to learn multiple tasks is\nthrough the hard parameter sharing approach, in which a single architecture is\nused to share the same subset of parameters, creating an inductive bias between\nthem during the training process. Due to its simplicity, potential to improve\ngeneralization, and reduce computational cost, it has gained the attention of\nthe scientific and industrial communities. However, tasks often conflict with\neach other, which makes it challenging to define how the gradients of multiple\ntasks should be combined to allow simultaneous learning. To address this\nproblem, we use the idea of multi-objective optimization to propose a method\nthat takes into account temporal behaviour of the gradients to create a dynamic\nbias that adjust the importance of each task during the backpropagation. The\nresult of this method is to give more attention to the tasks that are diverging\nor that are not being benefited during the last iterations, allowing to ensure\nthat the simultaneous learning is heading to the performance maximization of\nall tasks. As a result, we empirically show that the proposed method\noutperforms the state-of-art approaches on learning conflicting tasks.

However, a major\ndrawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (i.e., k-best)\noutputs with approaches such as beam search. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel NAR semantic parser that introduces intent conditioning on the\ndecoder. Inspired by the traditional intent and slot tagging parsers, we\ndecouple the top-level intent prediction from the rest of a parse. As the\ntop-level intent largely governs the syntax and semantics of a parse, the\nintent conditioning allows the model to better control beam search and improves\nthe quality and diversity of top-k outputs.

These results\nhighlight the intolerance of ADAS to safety-critical attacks and the importance\nof timely interventions by human drivers or automated recovery mechanisms to\nprevent accidents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 05:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 02:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

However, our analysis of existing results\nshows that omission faults pose a significant challenge to these techniques.\nFor template based approaches, omission faults provide no location to apply\ntemplates to; for learning based approaches that formulate repair as Neural\nMachine Translation (NMT), omission faults similarly do not provide the faulty\ncode to translate. To address these issues, we propose GLAD, a novel\nlearning-based repair technique that specifically targets if-clause synthesis.\nGLAD does not require a faulty line as it is based on generative Language\nModels (LMs) instead of machine translation; consequently, it can repair\nomission faults. GLAD intelligently constrains the language model using a\ntype-based grammar. Further, it efficiently reduces the validation cost by\nperforming dynamic ranking of candidate patches using a debugger. Thanks to the\nshift from translation to synthesis, GLAD is highly orthogonal to existing\ntechniques: GLAD can correctly fix 16 Defects4J v1.2 faults that previous\nNMT-based techniques could not, while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost,\nunderscoring its utility as an APR tool and potential to complement existing\ntools in practice.

The novel activity choice and\nscheduling model for restaurants, presented in this paper, is a key part of a\nlarger model which combines pedestrian dynamics modelling and epidemiological\nmodels to achieve exactly this. This novel activity model can produce activity\nschedules for both customers and staff at a restaurant for a variety of\nrestaurant settings.

The tests also\nshow that different restaurant settings lead to distinctly different contact\npatterns between people in a restaurant. As such, the model can provide\nvaluable insights into how a restaurant setting relates to the risk of virus\ntransmission. This is especially the case when it is combined with data about\nthe virus.

CNN backbones have met bottleneck due to lack of long-range\ndependencies and global context modeling power. Recent works proposed to\ncombine vision transformer with CNN, due to its strong global capture ability\nand learning capability. However, most works are limited to simply applying\npure transformer with several fatal flaws (i.e., lack of inductive bias, heavy\ncomputation and little consideration for 3D data). Therefore, designing an\nelegant and efficient vision transformer learner for dense prediction in\nmedical volume is promising and challenging.

Existing heatmap based two-stage approaches are\nsub-optimal as they are not end-to-end trainable and training relies on a\nsurrogate L1 loss that is not equivalent to maximizing the evaluation metric,\ni.e. Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS). Our framework allows us to train the\nmodel end-to-end and optimize the OKS metric itself. The proposed model learns\nto jointly detect bounding boxes for multiple persons and their corresponding\n2D poses in a single forward pass and thus bringing in the best of both\ntop-down and bottom-up approaches. Proposed approach doesn't require the\npostprocessing of bottom-up approaches to group detected keypoints into a\nskeleton as each bounding box has an associated pose, resulting in an inherent\ngrouping of the keypoints. Unlike top-down approaches, multiple forward passes\nare done away with since all persons are localized along with their pose in a\nsingle inference. YOLO-pose achieves new state-of-the-art results on COCO\nvalidation (90.2% AP50) and test-dev set (90.3% AP50), surpassing all existing\nbottom-up approaches in a single forward pass without flip test, multi-scale\ntesting, or any other test time augmentation.

This effect is described by the random\nphase approximation (RPA) which is therefore a promising method for the\ncalculation of weak interactions. The success of the RPA relies on the\ncancellation of errors, which can be traced back to the violation of the\ncrossing symmetry of the 4-point vertex, leading to strongly overestimated\ntotal correlation energies. By addition of second-order screened exchange\n(SOSEX) to the correlation energy, this issue is substantially reduced. In the\nadiabatic connection (AC) SOSEX formalism, one of the two electron-electron\ninteraction lines in the second-order exchange term is dynamically screened\n(SOSEX($W$,$v_c$)). A related SOSEX expression in which both electron-electron\ninteraction lines are statically screened (SOSEX($W(0)$,$W(0)$)) is obtained\nfrom the $G3W2$ contribution to the electronic self-energy. In contrast to\nSOSEX($W$,$v_c$), the evaluation of this correlation energy expression does not\nrequire an expensive numerical frequency integration and is therefore\nadvantageous from a computational perspective. We compare the accuracy of the\nstatically screened variant to RPA and RPA+SOSEX($W$,$v_c$) for a wide range of\nchemical reactions. While both methods fail for barrier heights,\nSOSEX($W(0)$,$W(0)$) agrees very well with SOSEX($W$,$v_c$) for charged\nexcitations and non-covalent interactions where they lead to major improvements\nover RPA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 08:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 17:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Multiple X-ray\nobscuration events have been reported in the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3227\nfrom 2000 to 2016. In late 2019, another X-ray obscuration event was identified\nwith Swift. Two coordinated target-of-opportunity observations with XMM-Newton,\nNuSTAR, and HST/COS were triggered in Nov. and Dec. 2019 to study this\nobscuration event. For each observation, we analyze the time-averaged X-ray\nspectra. We perform photoionization modeling with the SPEX code, which allows\nus to constrain the intrinsic continuum simultaneously with various\nphotoionized absorption and emission components. Similar to previous transient\nX-ray obscuration events in NGC 3227, the one caught in late 2019 is\nshort-lived (less than five months). If the obscurer has only one photoionized\ncomponent, the two X-ray observations in late 2019 cannot be explained by the\nsame obscurer that responds to the varying ionizing continuum. Due to the\nunknown geometry of the obscurer, its number density and distance to the black\nhole cannot be well constrained. The inferred distance covers at least two\norders of magnitude, from the BLR to the dusty torus. Unlike some other X-ray\nobscuration events in Seyfert galaxies like NGC 5548 and NGC 3783, no prominent\nblueshifted broad absorption troughs were found in the 2019 HST/COS spectra of\nNGC 3227 when compared with archival UV spectra. This might be explained if the\nX-ray obscurer does not intercept our line of sight to (a significant portion\nof) the UV emitting region. It is not straightforward to understand the variety\nof the observational differences in the X-ray obscuration events observed so\nfar. Future observations with high-quality data are needed to unveil the nature\nof the X-ray obscuration events.

Stream-based Active Learning (AL) approaches\naddress this problem by interactively querying a human expert to provide new\ndata labels for the most recent samples, within a limited budget. Existing AL\nstrategies assume that labels are immediately available, while in a real-world\nscenario the expert requires time to provide a queried label (verification\nlatency), and by the time the requested labels arrive they may not be relevant\nanymore. In this article, we investigate the influence of finite,\ntime-variable, and unknown verification delay, in the presence of concept drift\non AL approaches. We propose PRopagate (PR), a latency independent utility\nestimator which also predicts the requested, but not yet known, labels.\nFurthermore, we propose a drift-dependent dynamic budget strategy, which uses a\nvariable distribution of the labelling budget over time, after a detected\ndrift. Thorough experimental evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world\nnon-stationary datasets, and different settings of verification latency and\nbudget are conducted and analyzed. We empirically show that the proposed method\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat with variable budget allocation in time, it is possible to boost the\nperformance of AL strategies, without increasing the overall labeling budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 08:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 11:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Generally speaking, observed interactions are\nconsidered as positive samples, while unobserved interactions are considered as\nnegative ones. However, implicit feedback is inherently noisy because of the\nubiquitous presence of noisy-positive and noisy-negative interactions.\nRecently, some studies have noticed the importance of denoising implicit\nfeedback for recommendations, and enhanced the robustness of recommendation\nmodels to some extent. Nonetheless, they typically fail to (1) capture the hard\nyet clean interactions for learning comprehensive user preference, and (2)\nprovide a universal denoising solution that can be applied to various kinds of\nrecommendation models.\n  In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the memorization effect of\nrecommendation models, and propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Self-Guided\nDenoising Learning (SGDL), which is able to collect memorized interactions at\nthe early stage of the training (i.e., \"noise-resistant\" period), and leverage\nthose data as denoising signals to guide the following training (i.e.,\n\"noise-sensitive\" period) of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, our\nmethod can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point\nfrom memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative\nmemorized data via a novel adaptive denoising scheduler to improve the\nrobustness. We incorporate SGDL with four representative recommendation models\n(i.e., NeuMF, CDAE, NGCF and LightGCN) and different loss functions (i.e.,\nbinary cross-entropy and BPR loss).

In this\npaper, we establish a novel formulation of concurrent material and structure\noptimization for multiphase hierarchical systems with elastoplastic\nconstituents at the material scales.

The\nmethod predicts bounding boxes of multiple persons directly in omnidirectional\nimages without perspective transformation, which reduces overhead of pre- and\npost-processing and enables real-time performance. The basic idea is to utilize\ntransfer learning to fine-tune CNNs trained on perspective images with data\naugmentation techniques for detection in omnidirectional images.

It is known that very high multiplexing gains could be\nachieved by spatial multiplexing (SMX) in exchange for exhaustive detection\ncomplexity. Alternatively, in spatial modulation (SM), a single light emitting\ndiode (LED) is activated per time instance where information is carried by both\nthe signal and the LED index. Since only an LED is active, both transmitter\n(TX) and receiver (RX) complexity reduces significantly while retaining the\ninformation transmission in the spatial domain. However, significant spectral\nefficiency losses occur in SM compared to SMX. In this paper, we propose a\ntechnique which adopts the advantages of both systems. Accordingly, the\nproposed flexible LED index modulation (FLIM) technique harnesses the inactive\nstate of the LEDs as a transmit symbol. Therefore, the number of active LEDs\nchanges in each transmission, unlike conventional techniques. Moreover, the\nsystem complexity is reduced by employing a linear minimum mean squared error\n(MMSE) equalizer and an angle perturbed receiver at the RX.

Its key operation is to aggregate all\nlocal state information (LSI) at devices to update their states. The required\nextensive message exchange and many iterations cause a communication bottleneck\nwhen the LSI is high dimensional or at high mobility. To overcome the\nbottleneck, we propose in this work the framework of distributed over-the-air\ncomputing (AirComp) to realize a one-step aggregation for distributed\noptimization by exploiting simultaneous multicast beamforming of all devices\nand the property of analog waveform superposition of a multi-access channel. We\nconsider two design criteria. The first one is to minimize the sum AirComp\nerror (i.e., sum mean-squared error (MSE)) with respect to the desired\naverage-functional values. An efficient solution approach is proposed by\ntransforming the non-convex beamforming problem into an equivalent\nconcave-convex fractional program and solving it by nesting convex programming\ninto a bisection search. The second criterion, called zero-forcing (ZF)\nmulticast beamforming, is to force the received over-the-air aggregated signals\nat devices to be equal to the desired functional values. In this case, the\noptimal beamforming admits closed form. Both the MMSE and ZF beamforming\nexhibit a centroid structure resulting from averaging columns of conventional\nMMSE/ZF precoding. Last, the convergence of a classic distributed optimization\nalgorithm is analyzed. The distributed AirComp is found to accelerate\nconvergence by dramatically reducing communication latency. Another key finding\nis that the ZF beamforming outperforms the MMSE design as the latter is shown\nto cause bias in subgradient estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 11:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Unfortunately,\nclustering sometimes mixes different true identities together or splits the\nsame identity into two or more sub clusters. Training on these noisy clusters\nsubstantially hampers the Re-ID accuracy. Due to the limited samples in each\nidentity, we suppose there may lack some underlying information to well reveal\nthe accurate clusters. To discover these information, we propose an Implicit\nSample Extension (\\OurWholeMethod) method to generate what we call support\nsamples around the cluster boundaries. Specifically, we generate support\nsamples from actual samples and their neighbouring clusters in the embedding\nspace through a progressive linear interpolation (PLI) strategy. PLI controls\nthe generation with two critical factors, i.e., 1) the direction from the\nactual sample towards its K-nearest clusters and 2) the degree for mixing up\nthe context information from the K-nearest clusters.

We compare empirically the measurement costs\nof these strategies, and compare them both to the lower bounds as well as a\nnaive measurement scheme. We find that our algorithm significantly outperforms\nthe naive scheme (by a factor $2-8$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 12:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2022 10:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Whereas in\nthe past, advice has often been received from human experts, friends, or\nfamily, advisors based on artificial intelligence (AI) have become more and\nmore present nowadays. Typically, the advice generated by AI is judged by a\nhuman and either deemed reliable or rejected. However, recent work has shown\nthat AI advice is not always beneficial, as humans have shown to be unable to\nignore incorrect AI advice, essentially representing an over-reliance on AI.\nTherefore, the aspired goal should be to enable humans not to rely on AI advice\nblindly but rather to distinguish its quality and act upon it to make better\ndecisions. Specifically, that means that humans should rely on the AI in the\npresence of correct advice and self-rely when confronted with incorrect advice,\ni.e., establish appropriate reliance (AR) on AI advice on a case-by-case basis.\nCurrent research lacks a metric for AR. This prevents a rigorous evaluation of\nfactors impacting AR and hinders further development of human-AI\ndecision-making. Therefore, based on the literature, we derive a measurement\nconcept of AR. We propose to view AR as a two-dimensional construct that\nmeasures the ability to discriminate advice quality and behave accordingly. In\nthis article, we derive the measurement concept, illustrate its application and\noutline potential future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 12:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Here we show that the resolution of this apparent key paradox\nrests in the form of the orientationally averaged, effective forces acting on\nthe spinning birefringent particle. In particular, the effective azimuthal\ncomponent is heavily suppressed and highly non-linear. As a consequence,\nnon-conservative effects are strongly, if imperfectly, inhibited. Their\ninfluence is apparent only at very low pressures where we observe the formation\nof noisy, nano-scale limit cycles or orbits.

This\nallows the preparation of highly coherent, self-sustained oscillations with\neffective temperatures on the order of a milliKelvin. The tailoring of\nazimuthal spin forces through the material structure of a spinning,\nnon-spherical particle opens up new opportunities for the design of ultra\nstable optical rotors.

Our main\ncontributions include: 1) we present the first work that can synthesize\nrealistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing\nfeatures; 2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to\nintroduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the\nedge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network\ninput; 3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive\ntraining strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from\nlow-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the\ndifference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which\nfurther improves the quality of generated images; 4) the proposed US image\nsynthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US\nimages of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our\nstudy (lung, hip joint, and ovary); 5) extensive experiments on three large US\nimage datasets are conducted to validate our method. Ablation studies,\ncustomized texture editing, user studies, and segmentation tests demonstrate\npromising results of our method in synthesizing realistic US images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 12:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 09:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D\nwith Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep\nlearning to identify major neural and connective tissues. Each ONH was then\nrepresented as a 3D point cloud. We used PointNet and dynamic graph\nconvolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH\npoint clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for\nglaucoma diagnosis.\n  Results: Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC:\n0.95$\\pm$0.02) were able to accurately detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point\nclouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most of them\nlocated in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH.\n  Discussion: The diagnostic accuracy of both geometric deep learning\napproaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the critical 3D\nstructural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously\nimproved the transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our\napproach may have strong potential to be used in clinical applications for the\ndiagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 12:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 04:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-21"}

In particular, we consider the scenario where a\nunified ISAC waveform is emitted from a dual-functional ISAC Tx, which\nsimultaneously performs S&C tasks with a communication Rx and a sensing Rx.

In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end\nmodels are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal\ntransformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior\ninformation from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However,\nalthough several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the\nliterature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental\ntasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite\nfavoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be\nthe high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to\ncapture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end\ndeep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to\nvisualise the network learned patterns.

Background: Previous research\nin laparoscopy and robotic teleoperation found that complex perceptual-motor\nadaptations associated with misaligned viewpoints corresponded to degraded\nperformance in manipulation. Because optimal camera positioning is often\nunavailable in restricted environments, alternative viewpoints that might\nmitigate performance effects are not obvious. Methods: A virtual\nkeyboard-controlled targeting task was remotely distributed to workers of\nAmazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment was performed by 192 subjects for a\nstatic viewpoint with independent parameters of target direction, Fitts' law\nindex of difficulty, viewpoint azimuthal angle (AA), and viewpoint polar angle\n(PA). A dynamic viewpoint experiment was also performed by 112 subjects in\nwhich the viewpoint AA changed after every trial. Results: AA and target\ndirection had significant effects on performance for the static viewpoint\nexperiment. Movement time and travel distance increased while AA increased\nuntil there was a discrete improvement in performance for 180{\\deg}. Increasing\nAA from 225{\\deg} to 315{\\deg} linearly decreased movement time and distance.\nThere were significant main effects of current AA and magnitude of transition\nfor the dynamic viewpoint experiment. Orthogonal direction and no-change\nviewpoint transitions least affected performance. Conclusions: Viewpoint\nselection should aim to minimize associated rotations within the manipulation\nplane when performing targeting tasks whether implementing a static or dynamic\nviewing solution.

We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor\ninto a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves\nnormally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the\nclassification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,\nwithout the appropriate \"backdoor key\", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be\ndetected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks\nfor planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.\n  First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature\nschemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the\noriginal model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to\nfind even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the\nbackdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.\nSecond, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained\nusing the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU\nnetworks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful\nwhite-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the\ntraining data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is\n\"clean\" or contains a backdoor.\n  Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related\nissue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction\ncan produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an \"adversarially\nrobust\" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In\nsummary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant\ntheoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 13:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

In previous studies, heat\ndissipation from 2D material devices was presumed to be dominated by phonon\ntransport across the interfaces. In this study, we find that in addition to\nphonon transport, thermal resistance between non-equilibrium phonons in the 2D\nmaterials could play a critical role too when the 2D material devices are\ninternally self-heated, either optically or electrically. We accurately measure\nR of oxide/MoS2/oxide and oxide/graphene/oxide interfaces for three oxides\n(SiO2, HfO2, Al2O3) by differential time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). Our\nmeasurements of R across these interfaces with external heating are 2-to-4\ntimes lower than previously reported R of the similar interfaces measured by\nRaman thermometry with internal self-heating. Using a simple model, we show\nthat the observed discrepancy can be explained by an additional internal\nthermal resistance (Rint) between non-equilibrium phonons present during Raman\nmeasurements. We subsequently estimate that for MoS2 and graphene, Rint is\nabout 31 and 22 m2 K/GW, respectively. The values are comparable to the thermal\nresistance due to finite phonon transmission across interfaces of 2D materials\nand thus cannot be ignored in the design of 2D material devices. Moreover, the\nnon-equilibrium phonons also lead to a different temperature dependence than\nthat by phonon transport. As such, our work provides important insights into\nphysical understanding of heat dissipation in 2D material devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 13:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

However, accounting for\nmedium effects requires modification of the on-shell part of propagators and,\nconsequently, the $CP$ violating rates. In the literature, the correct form of\nthe statistical factors in the asymmetry source term has been obtained\nemploying the real-time-formalism of non-equilibrium field theory in a certain\napproximation. We demonstrate that the same results can be obtained by summing\nan infinite sequence of zero-temperature asymmetries.

Prior\nresearch showed that most sleep disorders belong to eight categories. To study\nthe performance of machine learning models in classifying polysomnography\nrecordings into the eight categories of sleep pathologies, we selected the\nCyclic Alternating Pattern Sleep Database. We developed a multi-channel Deep\nLearning model where a set of Convolutional Neural Networks were applied to six\nchannels of raw signals of different modalities, including three channels of\nEEG signals and one channel each of EMG, ECG , and EOG signals. To compare the\nperformance of the DL model with other models, we designed a model that took\nspectral features, instead of raw signals, as its inputs. We first studied the\n\"importance\" issue of signal modalities using the RF algorithm. We found that\nECG contributed most to the important features and EMG second, among the four\nsignal modalities. We then studied the accuracy performance of the proposed\nmachine learning models. We verified that the multi-channel DL-R model, which\ntook raw signals as its inputs, outperformed all other models, with its\nsensitivity and specificity scores both being above 95 %. This accuracy\nperformance is on a par with those published results which dealt with fewer\ntypes of sleep disorders.

Depending on which path is favorable under given conditions,\nthis leads to different identification of up- and down-polarized states. Since\nthe sign of piezoelectric response depends on the assignment of up- or\ndown-polarized state for a specific structure, this means that the material can\nexhibit different signs of the piezoelectric response under different\nconditions. We focus on HfO$_2$ as a key example. Our first-principles\ncalculations show that there are two competing paths in HfO$_2$, resulting from\ndifferent displacements of the atoms from the initial to the final structures,\nand the change in polarization along these two paths is of opposite sign.

This task aims to recognize online posts (e.g.,\ntweets) that contain hateful information. The peculiarities of languages in\nsocial media, such as short and poorly written content, lead to the difficulty\nof learning semantics and capturing discriminative features of hate speech.\nPrevious studies have utilized additional useful resources, such as sentiment\nhashtags, to improve the performance of hate speech detection. Hashtags are\nadded as input features serving either as sentiment-lexicons or extra context\ninformation.

DNA synthesis, which refers to the task of writing the data into\nDNA, is perhaps the most costly part of existing storage systems. Accordingly,\nthis high cost and low throughput limits the practical use in available DNA\nsynthesis technologies. It has been found that the homopolymer run (i.e., the\nrepetition of the same nucleotide) is a major factor affecting the synthesis\nand sequencing errors. Quite recently, [26] studied the role of batch\noptimization in reducing the cost of large scale DNA synthesis, for a given\npool $\\mathcal{S}$ of random quaternary strings of fixed length. Among other\nthings, it was shown that the asymptotic cost savings of batch optimization are\nsignificantly greater when the strings in $\\mathcal{S}$ contain repeats of the\nsame character (homopolymer run of length one), as compared to the case where\nstrings are unconstrained.\n  Following the lead of [26], in this paper, we take a step forward towards the\ntheoretical understanding of DNA synthesis, and study the homopolymer run of\nlength $k\\geq1$. Specifically, we are given a set of DNA strands $\\mathcal{S}$,\nrandomly drawn from a natural Markovian distribution modeling a general\nhomopolymer run length constraint, that we wish to synthesize. For this\nproblem, we prove that for any $k\\geq 1$, the optimal reference strand,\nminimizing the cost of DNA synthesis is, perhaps surprisingly, the periodic\nsequence $\\overline{\\mathsf{ACGT}}$. It turns out that tackling the homopolymer\nconstraint of length $k\\geq2$ is a challenging problem; our main technical\ncontribution is the representation of the DNA synthesis process as a certain\nconstrained system, for which string techniques can be applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 15:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

The traditional VoS\nformulation (VoS-psi) uses a diffuse interface localization function psi to\nensure stability and limit diffusion of the reactive surface. The main\nlimitation of this formulation is that accuracy is strongly dependent on the\nchoice of the localization function. Our first novel improved formulation\n(iVoS) uses the divergence of a reactive flux to localize the reaction at the\nfluid-solid interface, so no localization function is required. Our second\nnovel formulation (VoS-psi') uses a localization function with a parameter that\nis fitted to ensure that the reactive surface area is conserved globally. Both\nnovel methods are validated by comparison with experiments, numerical\nsimulations using an interface tracking method based on the Arbitrary Eulerian\nLagrangian (ALE) framework, and numerical simulations using the VoS-psi. All\nnumerical methods are implemented in GeoChemFoam, our reactive transport\ntoolbox and three benchmark test cases in both synthetic and real pore\ngeometries are considered: (1) dissolution of a calcite post by acid injection\nin a microchannel and experimental comparison, (2) dissolution in a 2D\npolydisperse disc micromodel at different dissolution regimes and (3)\ndissolution in a Ketton carbonate rock sample and comparison to\n\\textit{in-situ} micro-CT experiments. We find that the iVoS results match\naccurately experimental results and simulation results obtained with the ALE\nmethod, while the VoS-psi method leads to inaccuracies that are mostly\ncorrected by the VoS-psi' formulation. In addition, the VoS methods are\nsignificantly faster than the ALE method, with a speed-up factor of between 2\nand 12.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 15:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-15"}

Using archival and new spectra, and a~rich\ncollection of ground-based and space photometric observations, we carried out a\ndetailed study of this object. We provide a much improved description of both\nshort orbits and a good estimate of the mutual period of both binaries of about\n14500~d (i.e. 40 years). For the first time, we detected weak lines of the\nfainter component of the 6.0~d eclipsing binary in the optical region of the\nspectrum, measured their radial velocities, and derived a mass ratio of $M_{\\rm\nAc2}/M_{\\rm Ac1}=1.29$, which is the opposite of what was estimated from the\nInternational Ultraviolet explorer (IUE) spectra. We confirm that the eclipsing\nsubsystem Ac is semi-detached and is therefore in a phase of large-scale mass\ntransfer between its components. The Roche-lobe filling and spectroscopically\nbrighter component Ac1 is the less massive of the two and is eclipsed in the\nsecondary minimum. We show that the bulk of the \\ha emission, so far believed\nto be associated with the eclipsing system, moves with the primary O9.7I\ncomponent Aa1 of the 20.73~d spectroscopic binary. However, the weak emission\nin the higher Balmer lines seems to be associated with the accretion disc\naround component Ac2. We demonstrate that accurate masses and other basic\nphysical properties including the distance of this unique system can be\nobtained but require a more sophisticated modelling. A~first step in this\ndirection is presented in the accompanying Paper~II (Bro\\v{z} et al.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 15:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

The desorption of ASW is only visible for the >10\nmicrometre films and is separated from the ice I desorption by 10-15 K and has\nan associated desorption energy of 64 kJ mol-1. The desorption energy of the 53\nnanometre film was found to be near 50 kJ mol-1 as also noted in the\nliterature, but with increasing film thickness the desorption energy of ice I\nrises until reaching a plateau around 65-70 kJ mol-1.

To improve reference quality while\nretaining all data, we propose a new approach: to selectively re-write\nunsupported reference sentences to better reflect source data. We automatically\ngenerate a synthetic dataset of positive and negative revisions by corrupting\nsupported sentences and learn to revise reference sentences with contrastive\nlearning.

The author showed recently that one real\nfunction is also enough to describe matter in the Dirac equation in an\narbitrary electromagnetic or Yang--Mills field. This suggests some \"symmetry\"\nbetween positive and negative frequencies and, therefore, particles and\nantiparticles, so the author previously considered a description of\none-particle wave functions as plasma-like collections of a large number of\nparticles and antiparticles. The description has some similarities with Bohmian\nmechanics. This work offers a criterion for approximation of continuous charge\ndensity distributions by discrete ones with quantized charge based on the\nequality of partial Fourier sums, and an example of such approximation is\ncomputed using the homotopy continuation method. An example mathematical model\nof the description is proposed. The description is also extended to composite\nparticles, such as nucleons or large molecules, regarded as collections\nincluding a composite particle and a large number of pairs of elementary\nparticles and antiparticles.

But student diversity can be\nchallenging too as it adds variability in the way in which students learn and\nprogress over time. A single teaching approach is likely to be ineffective and\nresult in students not meeting their potential. Automated support could address\nlimitations of traditional teaching by continuously assessing student learning\nand implementing needed interventions. This paper discusses a novel methodology\nbased on data analytics and Machine Learning to measure and causally diagnose\nthe progress and shortcomings of student learning, and then utilizes the\ninsight gained on individuals to optimize learning. Diagnosis pertains to\ndynamic diagnostic formative assessment, which aims to uncover the causes of\nlearning shortcomings. The methodology groups learning difficulties into four\ncategories: recall from memory, concept adjustment, concept modification, and\nproblem decomposition into sub-goals (sub-problems) and concept combination.\nData models are predicting the occurrence of each of the four challenge types,\nas well as a student's learning trajectory. The models can be used to\nautomatically create real-time, student-specific interventions (e.g., learning\ncues) to address less understood concepts.

Our general framework for\nlearning Brainish involves designing (1) unimodal encoders to segment and\nrepresent unimodal data, (2) a coordinated representation space that relates\nand composes unimodal features to derive holistic meaning across multimodal\ninputs, and (3) decoders to map multimodal representations into predictions\n(for fusion) or raw data (for translation or generation).
