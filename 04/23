Instead of relying on one single sensor, multimodal fusion\nhas been one promising approach to provide redundant detection information\nbased on multiple sensors. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches\nare ineffective in adjusting the focus of different sensors under varying\ndetection environments in dynamic adverse weather conditions. Moreover, it is\ncritical to simultaneously observe local and global information under complex\nweather conditions, which has been neglected in most early or late-stage\nmultimodal fusion works. In view of these, this paper proposes a Global-Local\nAttention (GLA) framework to adaptively fuse the multi-modality sensing\nstreams, i.e., camera, gated camera, and lidar data, at two fusion stages.\nSpecifically, GLA integrates an early-stage fusion via a local attention\nnetwork and a late-stage fusion via a global attention network to deal with\nboth local and global information, which automatically allocates higher weights\nto the modality with better detection features at the late-stage fusion to cope\nwith the specific weather condition adaptively.

Here we address it using QCD in\n$(1+1)$ spacetime dimensions, which is exactly solvable at large number of\ncolors $N$. It is found that the distribution of chirality inside a baryon is\ndrastically different from a chirality distribution inside states with zero\nbaryon number, ``mesons\". This difference is shown to arise from the\ntopological structure of the baryon -- at large $N$, all of the baryon's\nchirality is concentrated near $x=0$, whereas in a meson state it vanishes in\nthe small $x$ limit. Our results illustrate how the constituent features of the\nbaryon reemerge and are tied to the topological features of the bosonized\nsolitonic solution.

The resulting\nposterior distribution characterizes the operators defining the reduced-order\nmodel, hence the predictions subsequently issued by the reduced-order model are\nendowed with uncertainty. The statistical moments of these predictions are\nestimated via a Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. Since the\nreduced models are fast to solve, this sampling is computationally efficient.\nFurthermore, the proposed Bayesian framework provides a statistical\ninterpretation of the regularization term that is present in the deterministic\noperator inference problem, and the empirical Bayes approach of maximum\nmarginal likelihood suggests a selection algorithm for the regularization\nhyperparameters.

Previous research identified this\nleading/trailing asymmetry on the four largest classical Uranian satellites but\ndid not find a clear leading/trailing asymmetry on Miranda, the smallest and\ninnermost classical moon. We undertook an extensive observational campaign to\ninvestigate variations of the NIR spectral signature of H$_2$O ice with\nlongitude on Miranda's northern hemisphere.

It is not only the major\nstellar flare events that contribute to this disequilibrium, but the smaller\nflares might also affect the atmospheres in an accumulating manner. In this\nstudy, we aim to investigate the effects of time-dependent stellar activity on\nthe atmospheres of known exoplanets. We simulate the chemistry of GJ876c,\nGJ581c, and GJ832c that go from H$_2$-dominated to N$_2$-dominated atmospheres\nusing observed stellar spectra from the MUSCLES-collaboration.

We investigate the effect of recurring\nflares for a total of 11 days covering 515 flares. Results show a significant\nchange in abundance for some relevant species such as H, OH, and CH$_4$, with\nfactors going up to 3 orders of magnitude difference with respect to the\npreflare abundances. We find a maximum change of $\\sim$12 ppm for CH$_4$ in\ntransmission spectra on GJ876c. These changes in the spectra remain too small\nto observe. We also find that the change in abundance and spectra of the\nplanets accumulate throughout time, causing permanent changes in the chemistry.\nWe conclude this small but gradual change in chemistry arises due to the\nrecurring flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 17:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Distinct from previous self-supervised VOS methods, our\napproach is based on a discriminative learning loss formulation that takes into\naccount both object and background information to ensure object-background\ndiscriminability, rather than using only object appearance. The discriminative\nlearning loss comprises cutout-based reconstruction (cutout region represents\npart of a frame, whose pixels are replaced with some constant values) and tag\nprediction loss terms. The cutout-based reconstruction term utilizes a simple\ncutout scheme to learn the pixel-wise correspondence between the current and\nprevious frames in order to reconstruct the original current frame with added\ncutout region in it. The introduced cutout patch guides the model to focus as\nmuch on the significant features of the object of interest as the less\nsignificant ones, thereby implicitly equipping the model to address\nocclusion-based scenarios. Next, the tag prediction term encourages\nobject-background separability by grouping tags of all pixels in the cutout\nregion that are similar, while separating them from the tags of the rest of the\nreconstructed frame pixels. Additionally, we introduce a zoom-in scheme that\naddresses the problem of small object segmentation by capturing fine structural\ninformation at multiple scales. Our proposed approach, termed CT-VOS, achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks: DAVIS-2017 and\nYoutube-VOS. A detailed ablation showcases the importance of the proposed loss\nformulation to effectively capture object-background discriminability and the\nimpact of our zoom-in scheme to accurately segment small-sized objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 17:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

Since these models\nare scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such\nas shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. Hence, editing and\ncombining NeRF-based scenes has not been demonstrated. With the aim of\nobtaining interpretable and controllable scene representations, our model\ncouples learnt scene-specific feature volumes with a scene agnostic neural\nrendering network. With this hybrid representation, we decouple neural\nrendering from scene-specific geometry and appearance. We can generalize to\nnovel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature representation,\nwhile keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. The rendering\nfunction learnt during the initial training stage can thus be easily applied to\nnew scenes, making our approach more flexible. More importantly, since the\nfeature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and\ncombine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes.

While performing spatial clustering analysis on\npoint process data is common, applications to areal data are frequently of\ninterest. For example, researchers might wish to know if census tracts with a\ncase of a rare medical condition or an outbreak of an infectious disease tend\nto cluster together spatially. Since few spatial clustering methods are\ndesigned for areal data, researchers often reduce the areal data to point\nprocess data (e.g., using the centroid of each areal unit) and apply methods\ndesigned for point process data, such as Ripley's K function or the average\nnearest neighbor method.

The time\nvariation in the number of PFe has been shown to correlate with the strength of\nthe polar magnetic field and to be a predictor of the subsequent solar cycle.\nDue to the small size and transient nature of these features, combined with\ndifferent techniques and observational factors, previous counts of PFe differ\nin magnitude. Further, there were no scalable techniques to measure the\nstatistical properties of faculae. Using data from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present\ntwo new methods for tracking faculae and measuring their properties. In the\nfirst, we calculate the standard deviation of the HMI images over one day,\nvisualizing the faculae as streaks. The facular lifetime is found by dividing\nthe angular streak length by the latitude-dependent rotation rate. We apply\nthis method to 134 days of data over 11 years. The distribution of facular\nlifetimes has a mean of 6.0 hours, a FWHM of 5.4 hours, and a skew towards\nlonger lifetimes, with some lasting up to 1 day. In the second method, we\noverlay images of the progressive standard deviation with the HMI magnetogram\nto show the close relationship between facular candidates and the magnetic\nfield. The results allow us to distinguish between motion due to the Sun's\nrotation and \"proper motion\" due to faculae moving across the Sun's surface,\nconfirming that PFe participate in convective motions at the poles. Counts of\nPFe using both methods agree with previous counts in their variation with the\nsolar cycle and the polar magnetic field. These methods can be extended to\nautomate the identification and measurement of other properties of of PFe,\nwhich would allow for daily measurements of all faculae since SDO began\noperation in 2010.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

For this purpose, we report a measurement of the Hubble constant from\n35 extragalactic Cepheid hosts measured by the SH0ES team, using their\ndistances and redshifts at cz < 3300 km /s , instead of any, more distant Type\nIa supernovae, to measure the Hubble flow. The Cepheid distances are calibrated\ngeometrically in the Milky Way, NGC 4258, and the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nPeculiar velocities are a significant source of systematic uncertainty at z\n$\\sim$ 0.01, and we present a formalism for both mitigating and quantifying\ntheir effects, making use of external reconstructions of the density and\nvelocity fields in the nearby universe. We identify a significant source of\nuncertainty originating from different assumptions about the selection criteria\nof this sample, whether distance or redshift limited, as it was assembled over\nthree decades. Modeling these assumptions yields central values ranging from H0\n= 71.8 to 77.0 km/s/Mpc. Combining the four best fitting selection models\nyields H0 = 73.1 (+2.6/-2.3) km/s/Mpc as a fiducial result, at $2.6\\sigma$\ntension with Planck. While Type Ia supernovae are essential for a precise\nmeasurement of H0, unknown systematics in these supernovae are unlikely to be\nthe source of the Hubble tension\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Applied on top of a given tractogram, GESTA is\nshown to be effective in improving the white matter volume coverage in poorly\npopulated bundles, both on synthetic and human brain in vivo data. Our\nstreamline evaluation framework ensures that the streamlines produced by GESTA\nare anatomically plausible and fit well to the local diffusion signal. The\nstreamline evaluation criteria assess anatomy (white matter coverage), local\norientation alignment (direction), and geometry features of streamlines, and\noptionally, gray matter connectivity. GESTA is thus a novel deep generative\nbundle tractography method that can be used to improve the tractography\nreconstruction of the white matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 18:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 21:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Leveraging the expressive power of deep\nneural networks, especially in high dimensions, such methods learn the mapping\nbetween functional state variables. While proposed methods have assumed noise\nonly in the dependent variables, experimental and numerical data for operator\nlearning typically exhibit noise in the independent variables as well, since\nboth variables represent signals that are subject to measurement error. In\nregression on scalar data, failure to account for noisy independent variables\ncan lead to biased parameter estimates. With noisy independent variables,\nlinear models fitted via ordinary least squares (OLS) will show attenuation\nbias, wherein the slope will be underestimated. In this work, we derive an\nanalogue of attenuation bias for linear operator regression with white noise in\nboth the independent and dependent variables. In the nonlinear setting, we\ncomputationally demonstrate underprediction of the action of the Burgers\noperator in the presence of noise in the independent variable. We propose\nerror-in-variables (EiV) models for two operator regression methods,\nMOR-Physics and DeepONet, and demonstrate that these new models reduce bias in\nthe presence of noisy independent variables for a variety of operator learning\nproblems. Considering the Burgers operator in 1D and 2D, we demonstrate that\nEiV operator learning robustly recovers operators in high-noise regimes that\ndefeat OLS operator learning. We also introduce an EiV model for time-evolving\nPDE discovery and show that OLS and EiV perform similarly in learning the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky evolution operator from corrupted data, suggesting that\nthe effect of bias in OLS operator learning depends on the regularity of the\ntarget operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 19:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 22:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

So, a natural question is\nwhether there is a way of satisfying the specification \"better\" if the\nenvironment is indeed not antagonistic. We address this question by developing\ntwo new notions of strategies. The first notion is that of adaptive strategies,\nwhich, in response to the opponent's non-antagonistic moves, maximize the\ndegree of satisfaction. The idea is to monitor non-optimal moves of the\nopponent at runtime using multiple parity automata and adaptively change the\nsystem strategy to ensure optimality. The second notion is that of strongly\nadaptive strategies, which is a further refinement of the first notion. These\nstrategies also maximize the opportunities for the opponent to make non-optimal\nmoves. We show that computing such strategies for rLTL specifications is not\nharder than the standard synthesis problem, e.g., computing strategies with LTL\nspecifications, and takes doubly-exponential time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 20:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 09:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}

EVs have many advantages\ncompared to traditional transportation, especially the environmental aspect.\nHowever, despite many EVs' benefits, operating EVs has limitations in their\nusage. One of the significant issues is the uncertainty in their driving range.\nThe driving range of EVs is closely related to their energy consumption, which\nis highly affected by exogenous and endogenous factors. Since those factors are\nunpredictable, uncertainty in EVs' energy consumption should be considered for\nefficient operation. This paper proposes an adaptive robust optimization\nframework for the electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to\nminimize the worst-case energy consumption while guaranteeing that services are\ndelivered at the appointed time windows without battery level deficiency. We\npostulate that EVs can be recharged en route, and the charging amount can be\nadjusted depending on the circumstance. The proposed problem is formulated as a\ntwo-stage adaptive robust problem. A column-and-constraint generation based\nheuristic algorithm, which is cooperated with variable neighborhood search and\nalternating direction algorithm, is proposed to solve the proposed model.

We define \"Venus-like\" as\ngreenhouse-gas-dominated atmosphere occurring when incoming solar radiation\nexceeds infrared radiation emitted from the planet at the top of the\natmosphere, resulting in a runaway greenhouse.

This\nresults in the formation of a microscopic electric dipole that affects the\nresistivity of the medium. Here, we show that an equivalent entity forms in\nspin polarized electron transport through the surface of a disordered\ntopological insulator (TI). When electrons reflect from a scatterer on the TI\nsurface, a spin imbalance forms around the scatterer, resulting in a spin\ncurrent that flows either in the same or the opposite direction as the injected\nspin current and hence either increases or decreases the spin resistivity. It\nalso destroys spin-momentum locking and produces a magnetic field around the\nscatterer. The latter will cause transiting spins to precess as they pass the\nscatterer, thereby radiating electromagnetic waves and implementing an\noscillator. If an alternating current is passed through the TI instead of a\nstatic current, the magnetic field will oscillate with the frequency of the\ncurrent and radiate electromagnetic waves of the same frequency, thus making\nthe scatterer act as a miniature antenna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 20:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

Training such models on\nmassive amounts of data typically requires scaling to many compute nodes and\nrelies heavily on collective communication algorithms, such as all-reduce, to\nexchange the weight gradients between different nodes. The overhead of these\ncollective communication operations in a distributed AI training system can\nbottleneck its performance, with more pronounced effects as the number of nodes\nincreases. In this paper, we first characterize the all-reduce operation\noverhead by profiling distributed AI training. Then, we propose a new smart\nnetwork interface card (NIC) for distributed AI training systems using\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate all-reduce operations and\noptimize network bandwidth utilization via data compression. The AI smart NIC\nfrees up the system's compute resources to perform the more compute-intensive\ntensor operations and increases the overall node-to-node communication\nefficiency. We perform real measurements on a prototype distributed AI training\nsystem comprised of 6 compute nodes to evaluate the performance gains of our\nproposed FPGA-based AI smart NIC compared to a baseline system with regular\nNICs. We also use these measurements to validate an analytical model that we\nformulate to predict performance when scaling to larger systems.

Even though\nmounting observational evidence points towards a magnetospheric origin of FRB\nemission, the question of the location for FRB generation continues to be\ndebated. One argument suggested against the magnetospheric origin of bright\nFRBs is that the radio waves associated with an FRB may lose most of their\nenergy before escaping the magnetosphere because the cross-section for $e^\\pm$\nto scatter large-amplitude EM waves in the presence of a strong magnetic field\nis much larger than the Thompson cross-section. We have investigated this\nsuggestion and find that FRB radiation traveling through the open field line\nregion of a magnetar's magnetosphere does not suffer much loss due to two\npreviously ignored factors. First, the plasma in the outer magnetosphere ($r\n\\gta 10^9 \\ $cm), where the losses are potentially most severe, is likely to be\nflowing outward at a high Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p \\geq 10^3$. Second, the\nangle between the wave vector and the magnetic field vector, $\\theta_B$, in the\nouter magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian or smaller due in part\nto the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that they get\naligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the\ninteraction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially. We find that a\nbright FRB with an isotropic luminosity $L_{\\rm frb} \\gta 10^{42} \\ {\\rm erg \\\ns^{-1}}$ can escape the magnetosphere unscathed for a large section of the\n$\\gamma_p-\\theta_B$ parameter space, and therefore conclude that the generation\nof FRBs in magnetar magnetosphere passes this test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 22:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 05:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 22:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

The phase diagram of the attractive\nand self-bound repulsive magnetic polaron, repulsive non-magnetic (Fr{\\\"\no}hlich-type) polaron and impurity-medium phase-separation regimes is explored\nwith respect to the Rabi-coupling between the spin components, spin-spin\ninteractions and impurity-medium coupling. The residue of such magnetic\npolarons decreases substantially in both strong attractive and repulsive\nbranches with strong impurity-spin interactions, illustrating significant\ndressing of the impurity. The impurity can be used to probe and maneuver the\nspin polarization of the magnetic medium while suppressing ferromagnetic\nspin-spin correlations. It is shown that mean-field theory fails as the spinor\ngas approaches immiscibility since the generated spin-wave excitations are\nprominent.

This data must be collected from surveys\nor travel diaries, which may be labor intensive, costly and limited to a small\ntime period. To address these limitations, this study extends classical\nbi-level formulations to estimate travelers' utility functions with multiple\nattributes using system-level data. We formulate a methodology grounded on\nnon-linear least squares to statistically infer travelers' utility function in\nthe network context using traffic counts, traffic speeds, traffic incidents and\nsociodemographic information, among other attributes.

Recently, various\ndoubly robust methods have been proposed for average treatment effect\nestimation by combining the treatment model and the outcome model via different\nvehicles, such as matching, weighting, and regression. The key advantage of\ndoubly robust estimators is that they require either the treatment model or the\noutcome model to be correctly specified to obtain a consistent estimator of\naverage treatment effects, and therefore lead to a more accurate and often more\nprecise inference.

However, in medical imaging analysis, each site may only have a\nlimited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated\nlearning (FL) can help in this regard by learning a shared model while keeping\ntraining data local for privacy. Traditional FL requires fully-labeled data for\ntraining, which is inconvenient or sometimes infeasible to obtain due to high\nlabeling cost and the requirement of expertise. Contrastive learning (CL), as a\nself-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn from unlabeled data to\npre-train a neural network encoder, followed by fine-tuning for downstream\ntasks with limited annotations. However, when adopting CL in FL, the limited\ndata diversity on each client makes federated contrastive learning (FCL)\nineffective. In this work, we propose an FCL framework for volumetric medical\nimage segmentation with limited annotations. More specifically, we exchange the\nfeatures in the FCL pre-training process such that diverse contrastive data are\nprovided to each site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private.\nBased on the exchanged features, global structural matching further leverages\nthe structural similarity to align local features to the remote ones such that\na unified feature space can be learned among different sites.

As a result, in this theory, photons do not behave as\npredicted by general relativity (GR). To evaluate the EMSG theory by the solar\nsystem tests, we study light deflection and Shapiro time delay.

To reconstruct a\nsurface at a specific query location at inference time, these methods then\nmatch the local reconstruction target by searching for the best match in the\nlocal prior space (by optimizing the parameters encoding the local context) at\nthe given query location. However, this requires the local context prior to\ngeneralize to a wide variety of unseen target regions, which is hard to\nachieve. To resolve this issue, we introduce Predictive Context Priors by\nlearning Predictive Queries for each specific point cloud at inference time.\nSpecifically, we first train a local context prior using a large point cloud\ndataset similar to previous techniques. For surface reconstruction at inference\ntime, however, we specialize the local context prior into our Predictive\nContext Prior by learning Predictive Queries, which predict adjusted spatial\nquery locations as displacements of the original locations. This leads to a\nglobal SDF that fits the specific point cloud the best. Intuitively, the query\nprediction enables us to flexibly search the learned local context prior over\nthe entire prior space, rather than being restricted to the fixed query\nlocations, and this improves the generalizability. Our method does not require\nground truth signed distances, normals, or any additional procedure of signed\ndistance fusion across overlapping regions. Our experimental results in surface\nreconstruction for single shapes or complex scenes show significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art under widely used benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 08:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

Feature\nattribution is a prevalent technique of highlighting the explanatory subgraph\nin the input graph, which plausibly leads the GNN model to make its prediction.\nVarious attribution methods exploit gradient-like or attention scores as the\nattributions of edges, then select the salient edges with top attribution\nscores as the explanation. However, most of these works make an untenable\nassumption - the selected edges are linearly independent - thus leaving the\ndependencies among edges largely unexplored, especially their coalition effect.\nWe demonstrate unambiguous drawbacks of this assumption - making the\nexplanatory subgraph unfaithful and verbose. To address this challenge, we\npropose a reinforcement learning agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer\n(RC-Explainer). It frames the explanation task as a sequential decision process\n- an explanatory subgraph is successively constructed by adding a salient edge\nto connect the previously selected subgraph. Technically, its policy network\npredicts the action of edge addition, and gets a reward that quantifies the\naction's causal effect on the prediction. Such reward accounts for the\ndependency of the newly-added edge and the previously-added edges, thus\nreflecting whether they collaborate together and form a coalition to pursue\nbetter explanations. As such, RC-Explainer is able to generate faithful and\nconcise explanations, and has a better generalization power to unseen graphs.\nWhen explaining different GNNs on three graph classification datasets,\nRC-Explainer achieves better or comparable performance to SOTA approaches\nw.r.t. predictive accuracy and contrastivity, and safely passes sanity checks\nand visual inspections.

This\nground-truth reliance is problematic, because the ground-truth signals are\nusually unavailable in real conditions. Moreover, in many industry scenarios,\nthe real acoustic characteristics deviate far from the ones in simulated\ndatasets. Therefore, the performance usually degrades significantly when\napplying the supervised speech separation models to real applications. To\naddress these problems, in this study, we propose a novel separation\nconsistency training, termed SCT, to exploit the real-world unlabeled mixtures\nfor improving cross-domain unsupervised speech separation in an iterative\nmanner, by leveraging upon the complementary information obtained from\nheterogeneous (structurally distinct but behaviorally complementary) models.\nSCT follows a framework using two heterogeneous neural networks (HNNs) to\nproduce high confidence pseudo labels of unlabeled real speech mixtures. These\nlabels are then updated, and used to refine the HNNs to produce more reliable\nconsistent separation results for real mixture pseudo-labeling. To maximally\nutilize the large complementary information between different separation\nnetworks, a cross-knowledge adaptation is further proposed. Together with\nsimulated dataset, those real mixtures with high confidence pseudo labels are\nthen used to update the HNN separation models iteratively. In addition, we find\nthat combing the heterogeneous separation outputs by a simple linear fusion can\nfurther slightly improve the final system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 09:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 06:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2022 08:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-09"}

The temperature and strain\ndependences on the core diameter, numerical aperture (NA), and the length of\nthe MMF section in the single-mode--multimode--single-mode (SMS) fiber\nstructure are investigated experimentally. The results indicate that the larger\ncore diameter of the MMF leads to higher temperature sensitivity but lower\nstrain sensitivity (absolute values); the higher NA does not influence the\ntemperature sensitivity but results in higher absolute value of strain\nsensitivity; the longer MMF section brings lower temperature sensitivity but\ndoes not have an impact on strain sensitivity.

To solve a given task, a network requires a certain\nset of abilities reflected in its structure. The required abilities depend on\neach task. There is so far no systematic study of the real capacities of the\nproposed neural structures. The question of what each structure can and cannot\nachieve is only partially answered by its performance on common benchmarks.\nIndeed, natural data contain complex unknown statistical cues.

In this work, we sketch a methodology to measure the effect of each\nstructure on a network's ability, by designing ad hoc synthetic datasets. Each\ndataset is tailored to assess a given ability and is reduced to its simplest\nform: each input contains exactly the amount of information needed to solve the\ntask. We illustrate our methodology by building three datasets to evaluate each\nof the three following network properties: a) the ability to link local cues to\ndistant inferences, b) the translation covariance and c) the ability to group\npixels with the same characteristics and share information among them. Using a\nfirst simplified depth estimation dataset, we pinpoint a serious nonlocal\ndeficit of the U-Net.

Using a second dataset, we compare\ndifferent positional encoding methods and use the results to further improve\nthe U-Net on the depth estimation task.

Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention\nnetworks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item\nembedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However,\nour analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings\nlimits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and\nconstrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations\namong the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra\ndisturbance to attention calculation.

In contrast to previous approaches, $\\pi$BO is conceptually simple\nand can easily be integrated with existing libraries and many acquisition\nfunctions. We provide regret bounds when $\\pi$BO is applied to the common\nExpected Improvement acquisition function and prove convergence at regular\nrates independently of the prior. Further, our experiments show that $\\pi$BO\noutperforms competing approaches across a wide suite of benchmarks and prior\ncharacteristics. We also demonstrate that $\\pi$BO improves on the\nstate-of-the-art performance for a popular deep learning task, with a 12.5\n$\\times$ time-to-accuracy speedup over prominent BO approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 11:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

MathPartner contains software\nimplementation of the Risch algorithm and provides users with the ability to\ncompute antiderivatives for elementary functions. Certain integrals, including\nimproper integrals, can be calculated using numerical algorithms. In this case,\nevery user has the ability to indicate the required accuracy with which he\nneeds to know the numerical value of the integral. We highlight special\nfunctions allowing us to calculate complete elliptic integrals. These include\nfunctions for calculating the arithmetic-geometric mean and the\ngeometric-harmonic mean, which allow us to calculate the complete elliptic\nintegrals of the first kind. The set also includes the modified\narithmetic-geometric mean, proposed by Semjon Adlaj, which allows us to\ncalculate the complete elliptic integrals of the second kind as well as the\ncircumference of an ellipse.

However, there is a conflict between diversity and stability,\nand how to make the trade-off between the two is challenging. The key here is\nhow to evaluate the quality of the base partitions and clusters.

The body of literature\naround the collective charge transitions (excitons) that are responsible for\nthe color in these and other strongly correlated systems, often fail to\ndisentangle two important factors: what makes them form and what makes them\noptically bright. An adequate answer requires a theoretical approach able to\ncompute such excitations in periodic crystals, reliably and without free\nparameters -- a formidable challenge. We employ two kinds of advanced \\emph{ab\ninitio} many body Green's function theories to investigate both optical and\nspin susceptibilities. The first, a perturbative theory based on low-order\nextensions of the $GW$ approximation, is able to explain the color in NiO, and\nindeed well describe the dielectric response over the entire frequency\nspectrum, while the same theory is unable to explain why MnF\\textsubscript{2}\nis pink. We show its color originates from higher order spin-flip transitions\nthat modify the optical response. This phenomenon is not captured by low-order\nperturbation theory, but it is contained in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT),\nwhich has a dynamical spin-flip vertex that contributes to the charge\nsusceptibility. We show that symmetry lowering mechanisms, such as spin-orbit\ncoupling, odd-parity phonons and Jan-Teller distortions, determine how `bright'\nthese excitons are, but are not fundamental to their existence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 14:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 12:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

On-device recommender systems circumvent these\ntwo issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference.

Then we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the\nsynaptic strength matrix among place cells. This matrix is interpreted as the\ntransition rate matrix of a continuous time Markov chain to generate the\nsequential replay of place cells. During replay, the synaptic strengths from\nplace cells to medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a temporal-difference\nlike rule to store place-reward associations. After replay, the activation of\nMSN will ramp up when an animal approaches the rewarding place, so the animal\ncan move along the direction where the MSN activation is increasing to find the\nrewarding place. We implement our theory into a high-fidelity virtual rat in\nthe MuJoCo physics simulator. In a complex maze, the rat shows significantly\nbetter learning efficiency and behavioral flexibility than a rat that\nimplements a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning algorithm, deep\nQ-network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 16:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2022 05:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

Several approaches have been recently proposed for the automatic\nidentification of microservices, which, even though following the same basic\nsteps, diverge on how data of the monolith system is collected and analysed. In\nthis paper, we compare the decompositions generated for two monolith systems\ninto a set of candidate microservices, when static and dynamic analysis data\ncollection techniques are used. The decompositions are generated using a\ncombination of similarity measures and are evaluated according to a complexity\nmetric to answer the following research question: which collection of monolith\ndata, static or dynamic analysis, allows to generate better decompositions?

In real industrial\nsystems, the main challenges for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings\npertain to the accuracy and real-time requirements. Most existing methods focus\non ensuring the accuracy, and the real-time requirement is often neglected. In\nthis paper, considering both requirements, we propose a novel fast fault\ndiagnosis method for rolling bearings, based on extreme learning machine (ELM)\nand logistic mapping, named logistic-ELM. First, we identify 14 kinds of\ntime-domain features from the original vibration signals according to\nmechanical vibration principles and adopt the sequential forward selection\n(SFS) strategy to select optimal features from them to ensure the basic\npredictive accuracy and efficiency. Next, we propose the logistic-ELM for fast\nfault classification, where the biases in ELM are omitted and the random input\nweights are replaced by the chaotic logistic mapping sequence which involves a\nhigher uncorrelation to obtain more accurate results with fewer hidden neurons.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the rolling bearing vibration signal\ndataset of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Centre. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing SOTA\ncomparison methods in terms of the predictive accuracy, and the highest\naccuracy is 100% in seven separate sub data environments.

This observation raises the\nquestion: what aspects of the training regime lead to this emergent behavior?\nHere, we show that this behavior is driven by the distributions of the training\ndata itself. In-context learning emerges when the training data exhibits\nparticular distributional properties such as burstiness (items appear in\nclusters rather than being uniformly distributed over time) and having large\nnumbers of rarely occurring classes. In-context learning also emerges more\nstrongly when item meanings or interpretations are dynamic rather than fixed.\nThese properties are exemplified by natural language, but are also inherent to\nnaturalistic data in a wide range of other domains. They also depart\nsignificantly from the uniform, i.i.d. training distributions typically used\nfor standard supervised learning. In our initial experiments, we found that\nin-context learning traded off against more conventional weight-based learning,\nand models were unable to achieve both simultaneously. However, our later\nexperiments uncovered that the two modes of learning could co-exist in a single\nmodel when it was trained on data following a skewed Zipfian distribution --\nanother common property of naturalistic data, including language. In further\nexperiments, we found that naturalistic data distributions were only able to\nelicit in-context learning in transformers, and not in recurrent models. In\nsum, our findings indicate how the transformer architecture works together with\nparticular properties of the training data to drive the intriguing emergent\nin-context learning behaviour of large language models, and how future work\nmight encourage both in-context and in-weights learning in domains beyond\nlanguage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 16:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 08:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 May 2022 09:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 May 2022 11:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 18:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 18:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-18"}
