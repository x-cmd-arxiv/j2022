Inks or dispersions of 2D materials can be deposited on flexible\nsubstrates by large-scale coating techniques, such as inkjet printing and spray\ncoating. One of the main issues in coating processes is nonuniform deposition\nof inks, which may lead to large variations of properties across the\nsubstrates. Here, we investigate the role of surface morphology on the\nperformance of graphene ink deposited on different paper substrates with\nspecific top coatings. Substrates with good wetting properties result in\nreproducible thin films and electrical properties with low sheet resistance.\nThe correct choice of surface morphology enables high-performance films without\npostdeposition annealing or treatment. Scanning terahertz time-domain\nspectroscopy (THz-TDS) is introduced to evaluate both the uniformity and the\nlocal conductivity of graphene inks on paper. A paper-based strain gauge is\ndemonstrated and a variable resistor acts as an on-off switch for operating an\nLED.

The difficulty lies in two aspects. One is\nthe lack of large-scale conversational summary data. Another is that applying\nthe existing pre-trained models to this task is tricky because of the\nstructural dependence within the conversation and its informal expression, etc.\nIn this work, we first build a large-scale (11M) pretraining dataset called\nRCS, based on the multi-person discussions in the Reddit community. We then\npresent TANet, a thread-aware Transformer-based network. Unlike the existing\npre-trained models that treat a conversation as a sequence of sentences, we\nargue that the inherent contextual dependency among the utterances plays an\nessential role in understanding the entire conversation and thus propose two\nnew techniques to incorporate the structural information into our model. The\nfirst is thread-aware attention which is computed by taking into account the\ncontextual dependency within utterances. Second, we apply thread prediction\nloss to predict the relations between utterances.

We\nstudy the properties of this family of models as the relative weight of the two\nkinds of variables in the patterns varies. We quantitatively determine how the\nretrieval phase squeezes towards zero as the memory patterns contain a larger\nfraction of mismatched variables. As the memory is purely Gaussian retrieval is\nlost for any positive storage capacity. It is shown that this comes about\nbecause of the spherical symmetry of the free energy in the Gaussian case.\nIntroducing two different memory pattern overlaps between spin configurations\nand each contribution to the pattern from the two kinds of variables one can\nobserve that the Gaussian parts of the patterns act as a noise, making\nretrieval more difficult. The basins of attraction of the states, the accuracy\nof the retrieval and the storage capacity are studied by means of Monte Carlo\nnumerical simulations. We uncover that even in the limit where the network\ncapacity shrinks to zero, the (few) retrieval states maintain a large basin of\nattraction and large overlaps with the mismatched patterns. So the network can\nbe used for retrieval, but with a very small capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 17:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 09:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 08:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 10:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 08:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

This exchange of health information on social media has\nbeen regarded as an attempt to enhance public health surveillance (PHS).\nDespite its potential, the technology is still in its early stages and is not\nready for widespread application. Advancements in pretrained language models\n(PLMs) have facilitated the development of several domain-specific PLMs and a\nvariety of downstream applications. However, there are no PLMs for social media\ntasks involving PHS. We present and release PHS-BERT, a transformer-based PLM,\nto identify tasks related to public health surveillance on social media. We\ncompared and benchmarked the performance of PHS-BERT on 25 datasets from\ndifferent social medial platforms related to 7 different PHS tasks. Compared\nwith existing PLMs that are mainly evaluated on limited tasks, PHS-BERT\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on all 25 tested datasets, showing that\nour PLM is robust and generalizable in the common PHS tasks. By making PHS-BERT\navailable, we aim to facilitate the community to reduce the computational cost\nand introduce new baselines for future works across various PHS-related tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 18:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Regarding image\nclassification neural networks, current watermarking schemes uniformly resort\nto backdoor triggers. However, injecting a backdoor into a neural network\nrequires knowledge of the training dataset, which is usually unavailable in the\nreal-world commercialization. Meanwhile, established watermarking schemes\noversight the potential damage of exposed evidence during ownership\nverification and the watermarking algorithms themselves. Those concerns decline\ncurrent watermarking schemes from industrial applications. To confront these\nchallenges, we propose a knowledge-free black-box watermarking scheme for image\nclassification neural networks. The image generator obtained from a data-free\ndistillation process is leveraged to stabilize the network's performance during\nthe backdoor injection. A delicate encoding and verification protocol is\ndesigned to ensure the scheme's security against knowledgable adversaries. We\nalso give a pioneering analysis of the capacity of the watermarking scheme.\nExperiment results proved the functionality-preserving capability and security\nof the proposed watermarking scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 18:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

An important issue\npreventing the more widespread use of these materials is that they undergo\nstructural transformations (of up to ~10% lattice strains) during\nintercalation, which expand the material, nucleate microcracks, and,\nultimately, lead to material failure. Besides the structural transformation of\nlattices, the crystallographic texture of the intercalation material plays a\nkey role in governing ion-transport properties, generating phase separation\nmicrostructures, and elastically interacting with crystal defects. In this\nreview, I provide an overview of how the structural transformation of lattices,\nphase transformation microstructures, and crystallographic defects affect the\nchemo-mechanical properties of intercalation materials. In each section, I\nidentify the key challenges and opportunities to crystallographically design\nintercalation compounds to improve their properties and lifespans.

However, ULM relies on low\nconcentrations of microbubbles in the blood vessels, ultimately resulting in\nlong acquisition times. Here, we present an alternative super-resolution\napproach, based on direct deconvolution of single-channel ultrasound\nradio-frequency (RF) signals with a one-dimensional dilated convolutional\nneural network (CNN). This work focuses on low-frequency ultrasound (1.7 MHz)\nfor deep imaging (10 cm) of a dense cloud of monodisperse microbubbles (up to\n1000 microbubbles in the measurement volume, corresponding to an average echo\noverlap of 94%). Data are generated with a simulator that uses a large range of\nacoustic pressures (5-250 kPa) and captures the full, nonlinear response of\nresonant, lipid-coated microbubbles. The network is trained with a novel\ndual-loss function, which features elements of both a classification loss and a\nregression loss and improves the detection-localization characteristics of the\noutput. Whereas imposing a localization tolerance of 0 yields poor detection\nmetrics, imposing a localization tolerance corresponding to 4% of the\nwavelength yields a precision and recall of both 0.90. Furthermore, the\ndetection improves with increasing acoustic pressure and deteriorates with\nincreasing microbubble density. The potential of the presented approach to\nsuper-resolution ultrasound imaging is demonstrated with a delay-and-sum\nreconstruction with deconvolved element data. The resulting image shows an\norder-of-magnitude gain in axial resolution compared to a delay-and-sum\nreconstruction with unprocessed element data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 19:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

Identifying high-quality and\nwell-maintained packages from a large pool of packages to depend on is a basic\nand important problem, as it is beneficial for various applications, such as\npackage recommendation and package search. However, no systematic and\ncomprehensive work focuses on addressing this problem except in online\ndiscussions or informal literature and interviews. To fill this gap, in this\npaper, we conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis to understand\nhow developers identify and select relevant open source packages. In\nparticular, we started by surveying 118 JavaScript developers from the npm\necosystem to qualitatively understand the factors that make a package to be\nhighly-selected within the npm ecosystem. The survey results showed that\nJavaScript developers believe that highly-selected packages are\nwell-documented, receive a high number of stars on GitHub, have a large number\nof downloads, and do not suffer from vulnerabilities. Then, we conducted an\nexperiment to quantitatively validate the developers' perception of the factors\nthat make a highly-selected package. In this analysis, we collected and mined\nhistorical data from 2,527 packages divided into highly-selected and not\nhighly-selected packages. For each package in the dataset, we collected\nquantitative data to present the factors studied in the developers' survey.\nNext, we used regression analysis to quantitatively investigate which of the\nstudied factors are the most important. Our regression analysis complements our\nsurvey results about highly-selected packages. In particular, the results\nshowed that highly-selected packages tend to be correlated by the number of\ndownloads, stars, and how large the package's readme file is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 22:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

One of the effective research lines to\naddress this challenge focuses on learning deep representations driven by a\nsimilarity measure between a query image and few support images of some class.\nStatistically, this amounts to measure the dependency of image features, viewed\nas random vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space. Previous methods\neither only use marginal distributions without considering joint distributions,\nsuffering from limited representation capability, or are computationally\nexpensive though harnessing joint distributions.

We also study various phases of AgNi$_x$Co$_{1-x}$O$_2$ and\nestimate their formation energies and gap openings under Co substitutional\ndoping in order to investigate the electronic properties and phase stability of\nthe intermetallics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 01:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

The analysis shows that\nthe directions of the most probable dipole axes are consistent in datasets that\nhave similar average redshift, but different between datasets that have\ndifferent average redshift. The analysis also shows that the location of the\nmost probable axis correlates with the average redshift of the galaxies in the\ndatasets. That is, the location of the most probable axis shifts when the\nredshift gets higher, and the correlation is statistically significant.

Changes in the pitch involve many\narticulatory and acoustic covariates; pitch perception often deviates from what\nF0 analysis predicts; and in fact, quasi-periodic signals from a single voice\nsource are often incompletely characterized by an attempt to define a single\ntime-varying F0. In this paper, we find strong support for the existence of\ncovariates for pitch in aspects of relatively coarse spectra, in which an\novertone series is not available. Thus linear regression can predict the pitch\nof simple vocalizations, produced by an articulatory synthesizer or by human,\nfrom single frames of such coarse spectra.

A skyrmion must become a quantum-mechanical object when its radius\nis of the order of nanometer. We construct a qubit based on the two-fold\ndegeneracy of the Bloch-type nanoscale skyrmions in frustrated magnets. It is\nshown that the universal quantum computation is possible based on nanoscale\nskyrmions in a multilayered system. We explicitly show how to construct the\n$\\pi /4$ phase-shift gate, the Hadamard gate, and the CNOT gate. The one-qubit\nquantum gates are materialized by temporally controlling the electric field and\nthe spin current. The two-qubit gate is materialized with the use of the\nIsing-type exchange coupling by controlling the distance between the skyrmion\ncenters in two adjacent layers. The merit of the present mechanism is that an\nexternal magnetic field is not necessary.

Continuous prompt tuning which prepends a few trainable vectors\nto the embeddings of input is one of these methods and has drawn much attention\ndue to its effectiveness and efficiency. This family of methods can be\nillustrated as exerting nonlinear transformations of hidden states inside PLMs.\nHowever, a natural question is ignored: can the hidden states be directly used\nfor classification without changing them? In this paper, we aim to answer this\nquestion by proposing a simple tuning method which only introduces three\ntrainable vectors. Firstly, we integrate all layers hidden states using the\nintroduced vectors. And then, we input the integrated hidden state(s) to a\ntask-specific linear classifier to predict categories. This scheme is similar\nto the way ELMo utilises hidden states except that they feed the hidden states\nto LSTM-based models.

In this work, we depart from these\nassumptions and ask: a) How can we get disentanglement when the auxiliary\ninformation does not provide conditional independence over the factors of\nvariation? b) Can we reduce the amount of auxiliary information required for\ndisentanglement? For a class of models where auxiliary information does not\nensure conditional independence, we show theoretically and experimentally that\ndisentanglement (to a large extent) is possible even when the auxiliary\ninformation dimension is much less than the dimension of the true latent\nrepresentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 05:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

To this end, we propose to\nlearn pixel-level distinctions to improve the video highlight detection. This\npixel-level distinction indicates whether or not each pixel in one video\nbelongs to an interesting section. The advantages of modeling such fine-level\ndistinctions are two-fold. First, it allows us to exploit the temporal and\nspatial relations of the content in one video, since the distinction of a pixel\nin one frame is highly dependent on both the content before this frame and the\ncontent around this pixel in this frame. Second, learning the pixel-level\ndistinction also gives a good explanation to the video highlight task regarding\nwhat contents in a highlight segment will be attractive to people. We design an\nencoder-decoder network to estimate the pixel-level distinction, in which we\nleverage the 3D convolutional neural networks to exploit the temporal context\ninformation, and further take advantage of the visual saliency to model the\nspatial distinction.

As users become continuously connected to\nthe internet, they become less patient and less tolerant to obsolete\nrecommendations made by an RS, e.g., movie recommendations on Netflix or books\nto read on Amazon. This, in turn, requires continuous training of the RS to\ncope with both the online fashion of data and the changing nature of user\ntastes and interests, known as concept drift. Streaming (online) RS has to\naddress three requirements: continuous training and recommendation, handling\nconcept drifts, and ability to scale. Streaming recommender systems proposed in\nthe literature mostly, address the first two requirements and do not consider\nscalability. That is because they run the training process on a single machine.\nSuch a machine, no matter how powerful it is, will eventually fail to cope with\nthe volume of the data, a lesson learned from big data processing. To tackle\nthe third challenge, we propose a Splitting and Replication mechanism for\nbuilding distributed streaming recommender systems. Our mechanism is inspired\nby the successful shared-nothing architecture that underpins contemporary big\ndata processing systems. We have applied our mechanism to two well-known\napproaches for online recommender systems, namely, matrix factorization and\nitem-based collaborative filtering.

In this case, the spectrum\nof a given pixel recorded by the sensor can be a combination of multiple\nspectra each belonging to a unique material in that pixel.

State-of-the-art approaches\nto analyzing the AoI rely on queueing models that are composed of one or many\nqueuing systems endowed with service order, e.g., FIFO, LIFO, or\nlast-generated-first-out order. A major difficulty arising in these analysis\nmethods is capturing the AoI under message reordering when the delivery is\nnon-preemptive and non-FIFO, i.e., when messages can overtake each other and\nthe reception of informative messages may obsolete some messages that are\nunderway. In this paper, we derive an exact formulation for the distribution of\nAoI in non-preemptive, non-FIFO systems where the main ingredients of our\nanalysis are Palm calculus and time inversion. Owing to the rationality of the\nLaplace-Stieltjes transforms that are used in our approach, we obtain\ncomputable exact expressions for the distribution of AoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 10:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

This paper presents a low-complexity model, called LoRAM for\nLow-Rank Additive Model, which combines low-rank matrix factorization with a\nsparsification mechanism for the continuous optimization of DAGs. The main\ncontribution of the approach lies in an efficient gradient approximation method\nleveraging the low-rank property of the model, and its straightforward\napplication to the computation of projections from graph matrices onto the DAG\nmatrix space. The proposed method achieves a reduction from a cubic complexity\nto quadratic complexity while handling the same DAG characteristic function as\nNoTears, and scales easily up to thousands of nodes for the projection problem.\nThe experiments show that the LoRAM achieves efficiency gains of orders of\nmagnitude compared to the state-of-the-art at the expense of a very moderate\naccuracy loss in the considered range of sparse matrices, and with a low\nsensitivity to the rank choice of the model's low-rank component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 10:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

The Under\nGraduate and Post Graduate Students have gone through the regular sessions of\nDevOps. For the participation purpose, both groups of students communicated on\none platform. The students who succeeded faster during the GitHub Pull Request\nsubmission shared their experiences with other participants. The PG students\nparticipated 68.75% higher than UG students. The active participation of the\nsmall number of UG students became a motivational factor for the PG students.\nThe Gaussian distribution on the marks obtained by the experimental group shows\nthe absence of outliers. The research shows that the effectiveness of indirect\nGamification depends on the age group, level, course content, and learning\nenvironment. The participation of a faculty member in the Competition during\nthe learning activity boosts the desire of the Student to complete the task.\nThe experimental group of 15 Students has outperformed in terms of the marks\nobtained compared to the control group of 52 students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 11:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

To alleviate the extensive human labors and boost the restoration\nefficiency, UAV is promising for its fully automatic capability yet still waits\nto be exploited. This paper progresses this emerging technology by explicitly\nconsidering the realistic constraints of the UAV and the grassland degradation\nwhile planning the grassland restoration. To this end, the UAV-enabled\nrestoration process is first mathematically modeled as the maximization of\nrestoration areas of the UAV under the limited battery energy of UAV, the grass\nseeds weight, the number of restored areas, and the corresponding sizes. Then\nwe analyze that, by considering these constraints, this original problem\nemerges two conflict objectives, namely the shortest flight path and the\noptimal areas allocation. As a result, the maximization of restoration areas\nturns out to be a composite of a trajectory design problem and an areas\nallocation problem that are highly coupled. From the perspective of\noptimization, this requires solving two NP-hard problems of both the traveling\nsalesman problem (TSP) and the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) at the\nsame time. To tackle this complex problem, we propose a cooperative\noptimization algorithm, called CHAPBILM, to solve those two problems\ninterlacedly by utilizing the interdependencies between them. Multiple\nsimulations verify the conflicts between the trajectory design and areas\nallocation. The effectiveness of the cooperative optimization algorithm is also\nsupported by the comparisons with traditional optimization methods which do not\nutilize the interdependencies between the two problems.

In real-world FL\nimplementations, client data could have label noise, and different clients\ncould have vastly different label noise levels. Although there exist methods in\ncentralized learning for tackling label noise, such methods do not perform well\non heterogeneous label noise in FL settings, due to the typically smaller sizes\nof client datasets and data privacy requirements in FL. In this paper, we\npropose $\\texttt{FedCorr}$, a general multi-stage framework to tackle\nheterogeneous label noise in FL, without making any assumptions on the noise\nmodels of local clients, while still maintaining client data privacy. In\nparticular, (1) $\\texttt{FedCorr}$ dynamically identifies noisy clients by\nexploiting the dimensionalities of the model prediction subspaces independently\nmeasured on all clients, and then identifies incorrect labels on noisy clients\nbased on per-sample losses. To deal with data heterogeneity and to increase\ntraining stability, we propose an adaptive local proximal regularization term\nthat is based on estimated local noise levels. (2) We further finetune the\nglobal model on identified clean clients and correct the noisy labels for the\nremaining noisy clients after finetuning. (3) Finally, we apply the usual\ntraining on all clients to make full use of all local data.

With the proposed scheme, users who have cached (a portion of) the\nfiles that they request are offloaded and, hence, (partially) inactive during\ndownlink transmission. The other users either benefit from the cache-enabled\noffloading for mitigating pilot contamination or exploit the cached but\nunrequested files to cancel interference during uplink channel estimation and\ndownlink file reception. Moreover, by redesigning the transmit precoders based\non the cache status of the users and channel state information, we gain\nadditional degrees of freedom for massive MIMO transmission. For a given cache\nstatus, we analyze the equivalent content delivery rates (ECDRs), i.e., the\naverage rates of delivering a requested file via both caching and massive MIMO\ntransmission to the requesting user, for cache-aided massive MIMO employing\nre-designed maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and\nregularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. Based on the derived results, the\nimpact of (random) uncoded caching and coded caching on the performance of the\nre-designed precoding schemes is investigated. Simulation results validate our\nderivations and show that caching is beneficial for precoded downlink\ntransmission as it enhances the transmit power allocation, mitigates intra- and\ninter-cell interference, and reduces the impairment caused by pilot\ncontamination. Compared with conventional massive MIMO without caching and with\ncache-oblivious precoding, the proposed cache-aided massive MIMO scheme\nachieves a significantly higher ECDR even when the number of users approaches\nthe number of transmit antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 15:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

This provides detailed insights into time averaged profiles, particle\nfluxes, and fluctuations behavior in different divertor regimes. The presence\nof the baffles is shown to substantially increase the divertor neutral pressure\nfor a given upstream density and to facilitate the access to detachment, an\neffect that increases with plasma current. The detailed, 2D probe measurements\nallow for a divertor particle balance, including ion flux contributions from\nparallel flows and ExB drifts. The poloidal flux contribution from the latter\nis often comparable or even larger than the former, such that the divertor\nparallel flow direction reverses in some conditions, pointing away from the\ntarget. In most conditions, the integrated particle flux at the outer target\ncan be predominantly ascribed to ionization along the outer divertor leg,\nconsistent with a closed-box approximation of the divertor. The exception is a\nstrongly detached divertor, achieved here only with baffles, where the total\npoloidal ion flux even decreases towards the outer target, indicative of\nsignificant plasma recombination. The most striking observation from relative\ndensity fluctuation measurements along the outer divertor leg is the transition\nfrom poloidally uniform fluctuation levels in attached conditions to\nfluctuations strongly peaking near the X-point when approaching detachment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2022 18:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2022 20:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}
