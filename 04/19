This\ntask is mostly regarded as an image retrieval problem. The key underpinning\nthis task is to design a series of deep neural networks to learn discriminative\nimage descriptors. However, existing methods meet large performance drops under\nrealistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain\nshift between the training data and multiple test environments into\nconsideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment\nSelf-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused\nby environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural\nnetwork containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one\nself-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the\nmultiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the\nenvironment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature\nextraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically\nminimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on two\nwidely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and CVUSA, demonstrate that the\nproposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in\nmultiple environments. Furthermore, we observe that the proposed method also\nshows great potential to the unseen extreme weather, such as mixing the fog,\nrain and snow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 16:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

This paper proposes a new NMF method by introducing adaptive weights\nto identify key features in the original space so that only a subspace involves\ngenerating the new representation. Two strategies are proposed to achieve this:\nthe fuzzier weighted technique and entropy regularized weighted technique, both\nof which result in an iterative solution with a simple form.

This description provides a concrete link\nbetween $3$-Sasaki structures and several other geometries and constructions\nvia a single unifying picture.

For the converse,\nwhere one begins with a general parallel hyperk\\\"ahler structure on the\nprojective tractor bundle, the genericity condition is not automatic. Indeed we\nprove that generically such a reduction decomposes the underlying manifold into\na disjoint union of strata including open manifolds with (indefinite)\n$3$-Sasaki structures and a closed separating hypersurface at infinity with\nrespect to the $3$-Sasaki metrics. Moreover, it is shown that the latter\nhypersurface inherits a Biquard-Fefferman conformal structure, which thus\n(locally) fibres over a quaternionic contact structure, and which in turn\ncompactifies the natural quaternionic K\\\"ahler quotients of the $3$-Sasaki\nstructures on the open manifolds.

We use some\ninformation-theoretic measures to study the anisotropy in a set of Milky\nWay-sized stellar halos from the Bullock & Johnston suite of simulations that\nuses a hybrid approach coupling semi-analytic and N-body techniques. Our\nanalysis shows that the whole-sky anisotropy in each stellar halo increases\nwith the distance from its centre and eventually plateaus out beyond a certain\nradius. All the stellar halos have a very smooth structure within a radius of\n$\\sim 50$ kpc and a highly anisotropic structure in the outskirts. At a given\nradius, the anisotropies at a fixed polar or azimuthal angle have two distinct\ncomponents: (i) an approximately isotropic component and (ii) a component with\nlarge density fluctuations on small spatial scales. We remove the contributions\nof the substructures and any non-spherical shape of the halo by randomizing the\npolar and azimuthal coordinates of the stellar particles while keeping their\nradial distances fixed. We observe that the fluctuating part of the anisotropy\nis completely eliminated, and the approximately uniform component of the\nanisotropy is significantly reduced after the sphericalization. A comparison\nbetween the original halos and their sphericalized versions reveals that the\napproximately uniform part of the anisotropy originates from the discreteness\nnoise and the non-spherical shape of the halo whereas the substructures\ncontribute to the fluctuating part.

Since\nenergetic coherence is fragile, it is essential to understand the limits in\ndistillation and dilution to restore damage. The resource theory of asymmetry\n(RTA) provides a rigorous framework to investigate energetic coherence as a\nresource to break time-translation symmetry. Recently, in the i.i.d. regime\nwhere identical copies of a state are converted into identical copies of\nanother state, it has been shown that the convertibility of energetic coherence\nis governed by a standard measure of energetic coherence, called the quantum\nFisher information (QFI). This fact means that QFI in the theory of energetic\ncoherence takes the place of entropy in thermodynamics and entanglement entropy\nin entanglement theory. However, distillation and dilution in realistic\nsituations take place in regimes beyond i.i.d., where quantum states often have\ncomplex correlations. Unlike entanglement theory, the conversion theory of\nenergetic coherence in pure states in the non-i.i.d. regime has been an open\nproblem. In this Letter, we solve this problem by introducing a new technique:\nan information-spectrum method for QFI. Two fundamental quantities, coherence\ncost and distillable coherence, are shown to be equal to the spectral QFI rates\nfor arbitrary sequences of pure states.

However, these RNNs\nimpose large computation and memory overheads, and are not directly trained to\nmodel such stable estimation. They can converge poorly and thereby suffer from\nperformance degradation. To combat these drawbacks, we propose deep equilibrium\n(DEQ) flow estimators, an approach that directly solves for the flow as the\ninfinite-level fixed point of an implicit layer (using any black-box solver),\nand differentiates through this fixed point analytically (thus requiring $O(1)$\ntraining memory). This implicit-depth approach is not predicated on any\nspecific model, and thus can be applied to a wide range of SOTA flow estimation\nmodel designs. The use of these DEQ flow estimators allows us to compute the\nflow faster using, e.g., fixed-point reuse and inexact gradients, consumes\n$4\\sim6\\times$ times less training memory than the recurrent counterpart, and\nachieves better results with the same computation budget. In addition, we\npropose a novel, sparse fixed-point correction scheme to stabilize our DEQ flow\nestimators, which addresses a longstanding challenge for DEQ models in general.\nWe test our approach in various realistic settings and show that it improves\nSOTA methods on Sintel and KITTI datasets with substantially better\ncomputational and memory efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 17:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

To address this drawback, we propose\n\\textbf{V}aried-\\textbf{S}ize Window \\textbf{A}ttention (VSA) to learn adaptive\nwindow configurations from data. Specifically, based on the tokens within each\ndefault window, VSA employs a window regression module to predict the size and\nlocation of the target window, i.e., the attention area where the key and value\ntokens are sampled. By adopting VSA independently for each attention head, it\ncan model long-term dependencies, capture rich context from diverse windows,\nand promote information exchange among overlapped windows. VSA is an\neasy-to-implement module that can replace the window attention in\nstate-of-the-art representative models with minor modifications and negligible\nextra computational cost while improving their performance by a large margin,\ne.g., 1.1\\% for Swin-T on ImageNet classification. In addition, the performance\ngain increases when using larger images for training and test.

The\nassumption behind using these jets is that they are bent under ram pressure\nfrom a dense, gaseous medium through which the host galaxy moves. However,\nthere are many AGN in groups and clusters with jets that are not bent, which\nleads us to ask: why are some AGN jets affected so much by their environment\nwhile others are seemingly not? We present the results of an environmental\nstudy on a sample of 185 AGN with bent jets and 191 AGN with unbent jets in\nwhich we characterize their environments by searching for neighboring galaxies\nusing a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. We find that AGN with bent jets are\nindeed more likely to reside in groups and clusters, while unbent AGN are more\nlikely to exist in singles or pairs. When considering only AGN in groups of 3\nor more galaxies, we find that bent AGN are more likely to exist in halos with\nmore galaxies than unbent AGN. We also find that unbent AGN are more likely\nthan bent AGN to be the brightest group galaxy. Additionally, groups hosting\nAGN with bent jets have a higher density of galaxies than groups hosting unbent\nAGN. Curiously, there is a population of AGN with bent jets that are in\nseemingly less dense regions of space, indicating they may be embedded in a\ncosmic web filament.

FWI is a data fitting method aimed at inverting for subsurface\nmechanical parameters. Despite the large adoption of FWI by the academic and\nindustrial communities, and many successful results, FWI still suffers from\nsevere limitations. From a mathematical standpoint, FWI is a large scale\nPDE-constrained optimization problem. The misfit function that is used, which\nmeasures the discrepancy between observed seismic data and data calculated\nthrough the solution of a wave propagation problem, is non-convex. After\ndiscretization, the size of the FWI problem requires the use of local\noptimization solvers, which are prone to converge towards local minima. Thus\nthe success of FWI strongly depends on the choice of the initial model to\nensure the convergence towards the global minimum of the misfit function.\n  This limitation has been the motivation for a large variety of strategies.\nAmong the different methods that have been investigated, the use of optimal\ntransport (OT) distances-based misfit functions has been recently promoted. The\nleading idea is to benefit from the inherent convexity of OT distances with\nrespect to dilation and translation to render the FWI problem more convex.\nHowever, the application of OT distances in the framework of FWI is not\nstraightforward, as seismic data is signed, while OT has been developed for the\ncomparison of probability measures.\n  The purpose of this study is to review two methods that were developed to\novercome this difficulty. Both have been successfully applied to field data in\nan industrial framework. Both make it possible to better exploit the seismic\ndata, alleviating the sensitivity to the initial model and to various\nconventional workflow steps, and reducing the uncertainty attached to the\nsubsurface mechanical parameters inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 18:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Usually, their presence is only apparent when data is abundant, and\naccurately determining their exponents often requires even larger amounts of\ndata. As the scale of recordings in neuroscience becomes larger, an increasing\nnumber of studies attempt to characterise potential power-law relationships in\nneural data. In this paper, we aim to discuss the potential pitfalls that one\nfaces in such efforts and to promote a Bayesian interpolation framework for\nthis purpose. We apply this framework to synthetic data and to data from a\nrecent study of large-scale recordings in mouse primary visual cortex (V1),\nwhere the exponent of a power-law scaling in the data played an important role:\nits value was argued to determine whether the population's stimulus-response\nrelationship is smooth, and experimental data was provided to confirm that this\nis indeed so. Our analysis shows that with such data types and sizes as we\nconsider here, the best-fit values found for the parameters of the power law\nand the uncertainty for these estimates are heavily dependent on the noise\nmodel assumed for the estimation, the range of the data chosen, and (with all\nother things being equal) the particular recordings. It is thus challenging to\noffer a reliable statement about the exponents of the power law. Our analysis,\nhowever, shows that this does not affect the conclusions regarding the\nsmoothness of the population response to low-dimensional stimuli but casts\ndoubt on those to natural images. We discuss the implications of this result\nfor the neural code in the V1 and offer the approach discussed here as a\nframework that future studies, perhaps exploring larger ranges of data, can\nemploy as their starting point to examine power-law scalings in neural data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 19:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

A\nconsiderable effort has been devoted to examining the impact of hypoxia on\nhypofractionated RT; however, much less attention has been paid to cyclic\nhypoxia specifically and the role its kinetics may play in determining the\nefficacy of these treatments. Here, a simple mathematical model of cyclic\nhypoxia and fractionation effects was worked out to quantify this.

We explore these various inter-related mechanisms which shaped the\nevolution of the atmosphere, starting with the volatile sources and sinks.\nGoing from the deep interior to the top of the atmosphere, we describe volcanic\noutgassing, surface atmosphere interactions, and atmosphere escape.\nFurthermore, we address more complex aspects of the history of Venus, including\nthe role of Late Accretion impacts, how magnetic field generation is tied into\nlong-term evolution, and the implications of geochemical and geodynamical\nfeedback cycles for atmospheric evolution. We highlight plausible end-member\nevolutionary pathways that Venus could have followed, from accretion to its\npresent-day state, based on modeling and observations.

To compensate against the induced variability due to both types\nof noises, state regulation is subject to two risk constraints. The latter\nrenders the resulting controller cautious of stochastic disturbances, by\nrestricting the statistical variability, namely, a simplified version of the\ncumulative expected predictive variance of both the state and the output. Our\nproposed formulation results in an optimal risk-averse policy that preserves\nfavorable characteristics of the classical Linear Quadratic (LQ) control. In\nparticular, the optimal policy has an affine structure with respect to the\nminimum mean square error (mmse) estimates. The linear component of the policy\nregulates the state more strictly in riskier directions, where the process and\noutput noise covariance, cross-covariance, and the corresponding penalties are\nsimultaneously large. This is achieved by \"inflating\" the state penalty in a\nsystematic way.

With\nthese pairs, a Siamese network is trained with the contrastive loss and the\nsimilarity function is realized in the network's latent space.

We conducted experiments on MovieLens1M,\nAmazon product review, Ichiba purchase dataset and confirmed CCSR outperformed\nthe existing matrix factorization-based methods. On the Movielens1M dataset,\nthe absolute performance improvements are up to 15.69% in NDCG and 4.29% in\nRecall. In addition, we extensively studied three binarization modules: $sign$,\nscaled tanh, and sign-scaled tanh. The result demonstrated that although\ndifferentiable scaled tanh is popular in recent discrete feature learning\nliterature, a huge performance drop occurs when outputs of scaled $tanh$ are\nforced to be binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 21:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Development of effective countermeasures against\nhardware Trojan attacks requires: (1) fast and reliable exploration of the\nviable Trojan attack space for a given design and (2) a suite of high-quality\nTrojan-inserted benchmarks that meet specific standards. The latter has become\nessential for the development and evaluation of design/verification solutions\nto achieve quantifiable assurance against Trojan attacks. While existing static\nbenchmarks provide a baseline for comparing different countermeasures, they\nonly enumerate a limited number of handcrafted Trojans from the complete Trojan\ndesign space.

While there exist tools to\nautomatically insert Trojan instances using fixed Trojan templates, they cannot\nanalyze known Trojan attacks for creating new instances that accurately capture\nthe threat model.

Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised\nlearning, this work proposes a Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Self-Supervised\nLearning framework (ST-HSL) to tackle the label scarcity issue in crime\nprediction. Specifically, we propose the cross-region hypergraph structure\nlearning to encode region-wise crime dependency under the entire urban space.\nFurthermore, we design the dual-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, to not\nonly jointly capture local- and global-level spatial-temporal crime patterns,\nbut also supplement the sparse crime representation by augmenting region\nself-discrimination. We perform extensive experiments on two real-life crime\ndatasets. Evaluation results show that our ST-HSL significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis provides insights into the\nsuperiority of our ST-HSL method in the representation of spatial-temporal\ncrime patterns. The implementation code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LZH-YS1998/STHSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 23:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 05:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

Although various claims of merit have been made, two\ninterconnected issues put these claims into question, and this paper brings\nsome attention to the matter. The first is that the relationship between the\nstructural parameters and the modal features previously considered has been\nlinear and to ensure that the premise was closely realized, only very small\ndamage severities have been considered. The second issue, intimately related to\nthe first, is the fact that the noise, which has been typically taken as small\nrelative to the \"change in the features\", is then unrealistically small. In\nproblems where the damage is sufficiently large, the nonlinear dependence of\nthe features on the parameters cannot be generally discarded. It is found that\nthe attainable performance is much less \"impressive\" that what has been often\nclaimed. The paper also examines the potential merit of using Lp-norm (0<p<1)\nminimization, instead of L1-norm minimization which, to the knowledge of the\nwriters, has not been previously examined in damage characterization research.\nIn this case we also find that, contrary to claims made in other areas, this\nnorm does not lead to any general improvement over the performance attained by\nminimizing the L1-norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 23:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

Subcarrier sharing allows antennas to\nmodulate data symbols onto the same subcarriers and enables high communication\nrate, while the use of private subcarriers trades-off communication rate for\nsensing performance by enabling the formulation of a virtual array with larger\naperture than the physical receive array.

Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution\n(CTDE) in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a promising method for\nmulti-UAV collision avoidance, in which the key challenge is to effectively\nlearn decentralized policies that can maximize a global reward cooperatively.\nWe propose a new multi-agent critic-actor learning scheme called MACA for UAV\nswarm collision avoidance.

To solve\nthe credit assignment problem in CTDE, we design a counterfactual baseline that\nmarginalizes both an agent's state and action, enabling to evaluate the\nimportance of an agent in the joint observation-action space. To train and\nevaluate MACA, we design our own simulation environment MACAEnv to closely\nmimic the realistic behaviors of a UAV swarm. Simulation results show that MACA\nachieves more than 16% higher average reward than two state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms and reduces failure rate by 90% and response time by over 99%\ncompared to a conventional UAV swarm collision avoidance algorithm in all test\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Typical applications range from quantum chemistry\nto optimization problems and also include simulations for high energy physics.\nThe recent maturing of quantum hardware has triggered preliminary explorations\nby several institutions (including Fermilab) of quantum hardware capable of\ndemonstrating quantum advantage in multiple domains, from quantum computing to\ncommunications, to sensing. The Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems\n(SQMS) Center, led by Fermilab, is dedicated to providing breakthroughs in\nquantum computing and sensing, mediating quantum engineering and HEP based\nmaterial science. The main goal of the Center is to deploy quantum systems with\nsuperior performance tailored to the algorithms used in high energy physics. In\nthis Snowmass paper, we discuss the two most promising superconducting quantum\narchitectures for HEP algorithms, i.e. three-level systems (qutrits) supported\nby transmon devices coupled to planar devices and multi-level systems (qudits\nwith arbitrary N energy levels) supported by superconducting 3D cavities. For\neach architecture, we demonstrate exemplary HEP algorithms and identify the\ncurrent challenges, ongoing work and future opportunities. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the prospects and complexities of interconnecting the different\narchitectures and individual computational nodes. Finally, we review several\ndifferent strategies of error protection and correction and discuss their\npotential to improve the performance of the two architectures. This whitepaper\nseeks to reach out to the HEP community and drive progress in both HEP research\nand QIS hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 01:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 16:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 13:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

A major concern is that\nresidents do not report problems at the same rates, with reporting\nheterogeneity directly translating to downstream disparities in how quickly\nincidents can be addressed. Measuring such under-reporting is a difficult\nstatistical task, as, by definition, we do not observe incidents that are not\nreported or when reported incidents first occurred. Thus, low reporting rates\nand low ground-truth incident rates cannot be naively distinguished. We develop\na method to identify (heterogeneous) reporting rates, without using external\nground truth data. Our insight is that rates on $\\textit{duplicate}$ reports\nabout the same incident can be leveraged to disambiguate whether an incident\nhas occurred with its reporting rate once it has occurred. Using this idea, we\nreduce the question to a standard Poisson rate estimation task -- even though\nthe full incident reporting interval is also unobserved.\n  We apply our method to over 100,000 resident reports made to the New York\nCity Department of Parks and Recreation and to over 900,000 reports made to the\nChicago Department of Transportation and Department of Water Management,\nfinding that there are substantial spatial disparities in reporting rates even\nafter controlling for incident characteristics -- some neighborhoods report\nthree times as quickly as do others. These spatial disparities correspond to\nsocio-economic characteristics: in NYC, higher population density, fraction of\npeople with college degrees, income, and fraction of population that is White\nall positively correlate with reporting rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 02:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Previous works used waypoint-based methods (e.g.\nProportional-Differential control and pure pursuit) which simplify the path\ntracking problem to local point-goal navigation.

Random finite set (RFS)-based filters are one of the\nemerging techniques for tracking multiple objects.

But in many real-world applications, target objects interact with\none another and the environment. Such interactions, when considered for\ntracking, are usually modeled by an interactive motion model which is\napplication specific. In this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate\ntarget interactions within the prediction step of an RFS-based multi-target\nfilter, i.e. labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. The method has been\ndeveloped for two practical applications of tracking a coordinated swarm and\nvehicles.

SMR improves fault\ntolerance by replicating a service to multiple replicas. When a replica is\nnewly added or recovered from a failure, the other replicas transfer the\ncurrent state of the service to it. However, in geographic SMR, the\ncommunication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.\nTherefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available\nbandwidth, and their state transfer time increases. To overcome this problem,\nour method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to replicas\nbased on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's bandwidth is,\nthe more chunks it transfers. The proposed method also updates the chunk\nassignment of each replica dynamically based on the currently estimated\nbandwidth. The performance evaluation on Amazon EC2 shows that the proposed\nmethod reduces the state transfer time by up to 47% compared to the existing\none. In addition, we apply the proposed method to dynamic replacement of\nreplicas, which can mitigate latency degradation caused by network trouble, and\nevaluate how fast the method can relocate a replica.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 04:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Based on video sequences, the goal is to recognize actions\nperformed by humans. While HAR has received much attention in the visible\nspectrum, action recognition in infrared videos is little studied. Accurate\nrecognition of human actions in the infrared domain is a highly challenging\ntask because of the redundant and indistinguishable texture features present in\nthe sequence. Furthermore, in some cases, challenges arise from the irrelevant\ninformation induced by the presence of multiple active persons not contributing\nto the actual action of interest. Therefore, most existing methods consider a\nstandard paradigm that does not take into account these challenges, which is in\nsome part due to the ambiguous definition of the recognition task in some\ncases. In this paper, we propose a new method that simultaneously learns to\nrecognize efficiently human actions in the infrared spectrum, while\nautomatically identifying the key-actors performing the action without using\nany prior knowledge or explicit annotations. Our method is composed of three\nstages. In the first stage, optical flow-based key-actor identification is\nperformed.

Recently deep learning models\nbecome a popular way to accelerate MD. Notwithstanding, existing models depend\non intermediate variables such as the potential energy or force fields to\nupdate atomic positions, which requires additional computations to perform\nback-propagation. To waive this requirement, we propose a novel model called\nDiffMD by directly estimating the gradient of the log density of molecular\nconformations. DiffMD relies on a score-based denoising diffusion generative\nmodel that perturbs the molecular structure with a conditional noise depending\non atomic accelerations and treats conformations at previous timeframes as the\nprior distribution for sampling. Another challenge of modeling such a\nconformation generation process is that a molecule is kinetic instead of\nstatic, which no prior works have strictly studied. To solve this challenge, we\npropose an equivariant geometric Transformer as the score function in the\ndiffusion process to calculate corresponding gradients. It incorporates the\ndirections and velocities of atomic motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel\nrepresentations. With multiple architectural improvements, we outperform\nstate-of-the-art baselines on MD17 and isomers of C7O2H10 datasets.

We show analytically that\nover a broad range of the squeezing parameter the sensitivity reaches the\nHeisenberg limit (HL) within a factor of root-2. For a large number of\nparticles, N, this plateau interval is almost the whole range from zero to\npi/2, and the sensitivity is independent of the parity of N. Therefore, it is\npossible to operate a sensor over a wide interval of the squeezing parameter\nwithout changing the sensitivity. This is to be contrasted with the\nconventional echo squeezing protocol (CESP) which only works for a very small\ninterval. In contrast to the CESP, the sensitivity of the GESP is close to the\nquantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound over the whole range of the squeezing parameter. The\nenhancement in sensitivity for the GESP is due to a combination of two\nparameters: the phase magnification factor (PMF) and the noise amplification\nfactor (NAF). As the value of the squeezing parameter increases, both PMF and\nNAF increase, keeping the ratio of PMF/NAF constant, yielding an enhancement of\nsensitivity at the HL within a factor of root-2. Thus, the robustness of the\nGESP against excess noise easily exceeds that of the CESP for a broad range of\nvalues of the squeezing parameter. As such, in the context of an experimental\nstudy, it should be possible to achieve a net enhancement in sensitivity higher\nthan that for the CESP, under typical conditions where the excess noise exceeds\nthe unsqueezed quantum projection noise. Finally, we consider the fragility of\nthe GESP against collisions with background particles, and show how a balance\nbetween the fragility and the robustness against excess noise would in practice\ndetermine the optimal choice of parameters for the GESP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 05:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2022 23:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 04:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 05:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 01:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 01:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

To obtain a causal state feedback representation for the\nopen-loop optimal control, a path-dependent Riccati equation for an\noperator-valued function is introduced, via which the optimality system can be\ndecoupled.

In this paper,\nwe focus our attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from\none modality (e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g.,\nimage). Most of the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems in RS\nrequire a high number of labeled training samples and also do not allow fast\nand memory-efficient retrieval. These issues limit the applicability of the\nexisting cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale applications in RS. To\naddress this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel unsupervised\ncross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for text-image retrieval in RS.\nTo this end, the proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1) feature\nextraction module, which extracts deep representations of two modalities; 2)\nhashing module that learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the\nextracted representations. We introduce a novel multi-objective loss function\nincluding: i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in\nintra- and inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is\nenforced across two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; and\niii) binarization objectives for generating hash codes.

As a result, the VED can be used to understand\nconvective processes and delineate modes of convection through the exploration\nof its latent dimensions. A close investigation of the latent space enables the\nidentification of different convective regimes: a) stable conditions are\nclearly distinguished from deep convection with low outgoing longwave radiation\nand strong precipitation; b) high optically thin cirrus-like clouds are\nseparated from low optically thick cumulus clouds; and c) shallow convective\nprocesses are associated with large-scale moisture content and surface diabatic\nheating.

Using a multi-particle\ncontinuous-time quantum walk with two internal states, which has been\nformulated in the first paper (arXiv:2112.08119), we physically implement a\nquantum random access memory (qRAM). Data with address information are\ndual-rail encoded into quantum walkers. The walkers pass through perfect binary\ntrees to access the designated memory cells and copy the data stored in the\ncells. A roundabout gate allocated at each node serves as a router to move the\nwalker from the parent node to one of two child nodes, depending on the\ninternal state of the walker. In this process, the address information is\nsequentially encoded into the internal states so that the walkers are\nadequately delivered to the target cells. The present qRAM, which processes\n$2^n$ $m$-qubit data, is implemented in a quantum circuit of depth\n$O(n\\log(n+m))$ and requires $O(n+m)$ qubit resources. This is more efficient\nthan the conventional bucket-brigade qRAM that requires $O(n^2+nm)$ steps and\n$O(2^{n}+m)$ qubit resources for processing. Moreover, since the walkers are\nnot entangled with any device on the binary trees, the cost of maintaining\ncoherence can be reduced.

In other words, any time-dependent control is not required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 07:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 11:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

We combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nand Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data of galaxies at 0.25<z<1.5 to\nprobe the impact of environment on the size-mass relation, the Main Sequence\n(MS) and the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR).\n  We perform a morpho-kinematic modelling of 593 [Oii] emitters in various\nenvironments in the COSMOS area from the MUSE-gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos (MAGIC)\nsurvey. The HST F814W images are modelled with a bulge-disk decomposition to\nestimate their bulge-disk ratio, effective radius and disk inclination. We use\nthe [Oii]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}3727, 3729 doublet to extract the ionised gas\nkinematic maps from the MUSE cubes, and we model them for a sample of 146 [Oii]\nemitters, with bulge and disk components constrained from morphology and a dark\nmatter halo.\n  We find an offset of 0.03 dex on the size-mass relation zero point between\nthe field and the large structure subsamples, with a richness threshold of N=10\nto separate between small and large structures, and of 0.06 dex with N=20.\nSimilarly, we find a 0.1 dex difference on the MS with N=10 and 0.15 dex with\nN=20. These results suggest that galaxies in massive structures are smaller by\n14% and have star formation rates reduced by a factor of 1.3-1.5 with respect\nto field galaxies at z=0.7. Finally, we do not find any impact of the\nenvironment on the TFR, except when using N=20 with an offset of 0.04 dex. We\ndiscard the effect of quenching for the largest structures that would lead to\nan offset in the opposite direction. We find that, at z=0.7, if quenching\nimpacts the mass budget of galaxies in structures, these galaxies would have\nbeen affected quite recently, for roughly 0.7-1.5 Gyr. This result holds when\nincluding the gas mass, but vanishes once we include the asymmetric drift\ncorrection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 07:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 14:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

There are two important factors for the mitigation\nof laser imprint besides the thermal smoothing of the conduction region\n(between the ablation front and the critical density surface) and the mass\nablation of the ablation front. First, radiation ablation dynamically modulates\ndensity distribution not only to increase the frequency of the perturbed\nablation front oscillation but also to decrease the amplitude of oscillation.\nSecond, a larger length of the shocked compression region reduces the amplitude\nof the perturbed shock front oscillation. The smaller the perturbation of both\nablation front and shock front, the smaller the areal density perturbation.\nBased on the above physical mechanisms, the optimal way of mitigating laser\nimprint with foam is that the dynamically modulated density distribution\nfurther reduces the amplitude of perturbation reaching the solid CH when the\nareal density perturbation of foam oscillates to the first minimum value. The\noptimal ranges of foam parameters to mitigate laser imprint are proposed with\nthe aid of dimensional analysis: the foam thickness is about 2~3 times the\nperturbation wavelength, and the foam density is about 1/2~3/2 times the mass\ndensity corresponding to the critical density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

However, their integration into many systems also brings with it\nthe vulnerability to test time attacks in the form of Universal Adversarial\nPerturbations (UAPs). UAPs are a class of perturbations that when applied to\nany input causes model misclassification. Although there is an ongoing effort\nto defend models against these adversarial attacks, it is often difficult to\nreconcile the trade-offs in model accuracy and robustness to adversarial\nattacks. Jacobian regularization has been shown to improve the robustness of\nmodels against UAPs, whilst model ensembles have been widely adopted to improve\nboth predictive performance and model robustness. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach, Jacobian Ensembles-a combination of Jacobian regularization and\nmodel ensembles to significantly increase the robustness against UAPs whilst\nmaintaining or improving model accuracy. Our results show that Jacobian\nEnsembles achieves previously unseen levels of accuracy and robustness, greatly\nimproving over previous methods that tend to skew towards only either accuracy\nor robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

They are predicted to exist in low-metallicity\nenvironments. Because overall metallicity becomes lower at higher redshifts,\ndeep near-infrared transient surveys probing high-redshift supernovae are\nsuitable to discover pair-instability supernovae. The Euclid satellite, which\nis planned to be launched in 2023, has a near-infrared wide-field instrument\nthat is suitable for a high-redshift supernova survey. The Euclid Deep Survey\nis planned to make regular observations of three Euclid Deep Fields (40 deg2 in\ntotal) spanning the Euclid's 6 year primary mission period. While the\nobservations of the Euclid Deep Fields are not frequent, we show that the\npredicted long duration of pair-instability supernovae would allow us to search\nfor high-redshift pair-instability supernovae with the Euclid Deep Survey.\nBased on the current observational plan of the Euclid mission, we conduct\nsurvey simulations in order to estimate the expected numbers of\npair-instability supernova discoveries. We find that up to several hundred\npair-instability supernovae at z < ~ 3.5 can be discovered within the Euclid\nDeep Survey. We also show that pair-instability supernova candidates can be\nefficiently identified by their duration and color that can be determined with\nthe current Euclid Deep Survey plan. We conclude that the Euclid mission can\nlead to the first confirmation of pair-instability supernovae if their event\nrates are as high as those predicted by recent theoretical studies. We also\nupdate the expected numbers of superluminous supernova discoveries in the\nEuclid Deep Survey based on the latest observational plan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 08:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 19:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

One application may be in the multi-messenger domain:\nlocalisation of strongly lensed black hole mergers inside their associated lens\nsystems in gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) bands. This is\nintriguing because combining the observations of electromagnetically detected\nlens systems (via optical or infrared imaging) with their associated\nstrongly-lensed gravitational waves could yield a wide array of valuable,\notherwise inaccessible information. One might, for instance, independently\nverify strong lensing candidates, localise black holes to sub-arcsecond\nprecision, study the binary-galaxy connection, and more accurately test\ngravitational-wave polarisation and propagation.\n  Thus, here we perform a comprehensive simulation of the projected\ncapabilities of LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, combined with Euclid, to find strongly lensed\ngravitational-wave events and then pinpoint the location of the black-hole\nmerger. We find that for 20-50% of the detected events, the lens is detectable\nwith Euclid-like imaging. For a 1-5 deg^2 sky localisation, with Euclid-like\nimages of host candidates, we expect to identify the EM-counterpart for\n34.6-21.9% of lensed GWs when four events are detected.

Although many efforts have\nbeen made for static point cloud denoising, dynamic point cloud denoising\nremains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-field-based\ndynamic point cloud denoising method, exploiting the temporal correspondence\nvia the estimation of gradient fields -- a fundamental problem in dynamic point\ncloud processing and analysis. The gradient field is the gradient of the\nlog-probability function of the noisy point cloud, based on which we perform\ngradient ascent so as to converge each point to the underlying clean surface.\nWe estimate the gradient of each surface patch and exploit the temporal\ncorrespondence, where the temporally corresponding patches are searched\nleveraging on rigid motion in classical mechanics. In particular, we treat each\npatch as a rigid object, which moves in the gradient field of an adjacent frame\nvia force until reaching a balanced state, i.e., when the sum of gradients over\nthe patch reaches 0. Since the gradient would be smaller when the point is\ncloser to the underlying surface, the balanced patch would fit the underlying\nsurface well, thus leading to the temporal correspondence. Finally, the\nposition of each point in the patch is updated along the direction of the\ngradient averaged from corresponding patches in adjacent frames.

Recently, several methods tried to learn vector-level weights for\nfeature representations to address the fixed representation issue.

To\nincrease TPS without compromising security, we propose a bodyless block\npropagation (BBP) scheme for which the block body is not validated and\ntransmitted during the block propagation process. Rather, the nodes in the\nblockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next\nupcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated\nbefore the birth of the block. It is critical, however, all nodes have a\nconsensus on the transaction content of the next block.\n  This paper puts forth a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization\nalgorithm to drive the nodes to reach such a consensus. Yet, the coinbase\naddress of the miner of the next block cannot be anticipated, and therefore\ntransactions that depend on the coinbase address cannot be pre-executed and\npre-validated. This paper further puts forth an algorithm to deal with such\nunresolvable transactions for an overall consistent and TPS-efficient scheme.\nWith our scheme, most transactions do not need to be validated and transmitted\nduring block propagation, ridding the dependence of propagation time on the\nnumber of transactions in the block, and making the system fully TPS scalable.\nExperimental results show that our protocol can reduce propagation time by 4x\nwith respect to the current Ethereum blockchain, and its TPS performance is\nlimited by the node hardware performance rather than block propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 09:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

However, LSRTM needs an\naccurate velocity model similar to other migration methods. Otherwise, it\nsuffers from depth estimation errors and out of focus images. Moreover, LSRTM\nis computationally expensive and it can suffer from multiple reflections.\nRecently, a target-oriented approach to LSRTM has been proposed, which focuses\nthe wavefield above the target of interest. Remarkably, this approach can be\nhelpful for imaging below complex overburdens and subsalt domains. Moreover,\nthis approach can significantly reduce the computational burden of the problem\nby limiting the computational domain to a smaller area. Nevertheless,\ntarget-oriented LSRTM still needs an accurate velocity model of the overburden\nto focus the wavefield accurately and predict internal multiple reflections\ncorrectly. In recent years, Marchenko redatuming has emerged as a novel\ndata-driven method that can predict Green's functions at any arbitrary depth,\nincluding all orders of multiples. The only requirement for this method is a\nsmooth background velocity model of the overburden. Moreover, with Marchenko\ndouble-focusing, one can make virtual sources and receivers at a boundary above\nthe target and bypass the overburden. This paper proposes a new algorithm for\ntarget-oriented LSRTM, which fits the double-focused data with modeled data at\na boundary above the target of interest. Consequently, our target-oriented\nLSRTM algorithm correctly accounts for all orders of overburden-related\nmultiples, resulting in a significant reduction of the artifacts caused by\noverburden internal multiple reflections in the target image compared to\nconventional LSRTM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 09:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 20:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Understanding what features are\ninherently non-classical is crucial for reaching better-than-classical\nperformance. This thesis focuses on two nonclassical behaviours: quantum\ncontextuality and Wigner negativity. The former is a notion superseding\nnonlocality that can be exhibited by quantum systems. To date, it has mostly\nbeen studied in discrete-variable scenarios. In those scenarios, contextuality\nhas been shown to be necessary and sufficient for advantages in some cases. On\nthe other hand, negativity of the Wigner function is another unsettling\nnon-classical feature of quantum states that originates from phase-space\nformulation in continuous-variable quantum optics. Continuous-variable\nscenarios offer promising candidates for implementing quantum computations.\nWigner negativity is known to be a necessary resource for quantum speedup with\ncontinuous variables. However contextuality has been little understood and\nstudied in continuous-variable scenarios.\n  We first set out a robust framework for properly treating contextuality in\ncontinuous variables. We also quantify contextuality in such scenarios by using\ntools from infinite-dimensional optimisation theory. Building upon this, we\nshow that Wigner negativity is equivalent to contextuality in continuous\nvariables with respect to Pauli measurements thus establishing a\ncontinuous-variable analogue of a celebrated result by Howard et al. We then\nintroduce experimentally-friendly witnesses for Wigner negativity of single\nmode and multimode quantum states, based on fidelities with Fock states, using\nagain tools from infinite-dimensional optimisation theory. We further extend\nthe range of previously known discrete-variable results linking contextuality\nand advantage into a new territory of information retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 10:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The state-of-the-art deep\nlearning-based methods often simply concatenate the raw geometric attributes\n(i.e., coordinates and normal vectors) of mesh cells to train a single-stream\nnetwork for automatic intra-oral scanner image segmentation. However, since\ndifferent raw attributes reveal completely different geometric information, the\nnaive concatenation of different raw attributes at the (low-level) input stage\nmay bring unnecessary confusion in describing and differentiating between mesh\ncells, thus hampering the learning of high-level geometric representations for\nthe segmentation task. To address this issue, we design a two-stream graph\nconvolutional network (i.e., TSGCN), which can effectively handle inter-view\nconfusion between different raw attributes to more effectively fuse their\ncomplementary information and learn discriminative multi-view geometric\nrepresentations. Specifically, our TSGCN adopts two input-specific\ngraph-learning streams to extract complementary high-level geometric\nrepresentations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. Then, these\nsingle-view representations are further fused by a self-attention module to\nadaptively balance the contributions of different views in learning more\ndiscriminative multi-view representations for accurate and fully automatic\ntooth segmentation.

These winds in Quasars have an essential role in controlling galaxy\nformation across cosmic time, but there is no consensus on how these are\nphysically launched. A single unique observation of a stellar-mass black hole\nGRO J1655-40 was used to argue that magnetic driving was the only viable\nmechanism and motivated unified models of magnetic winds in both binaries and\nQuasars. The alternative, X-ray heating (thermal-radiative wind), was ruled out\nfor the low observed luminosity by the high wind density estimated from an\nabsorption line of a metastable level of Fe xxii. Here we reanalyse these data\nusing a photoionisation code that includes cascades from radiative excitation\nas well as collisions in populating the metastable level. The cascade reduces\nthe inferred wind density by more than an order of magnitude. The derived\ncolumn is also optically thick, so the source is intrinsically more luminous\nthan observed.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) based model has gradually\nbecome the theme of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR). However, there is a\nnatural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised\nsignal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent.\nInspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised\nsignals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive\nlearning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view\ncontrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional\ncontrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data\naugmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively\nconsider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including\nglobal-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views.\nSpecifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the\nitem-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a\nstructural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views\non both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and\nstructure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a\nk-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) item-item semantic graph construction module is\nproposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually\nignored by previous work.

To answer this question, we use Stochastic\nConvex Optimization as a case study.\n  In this model, algorithms are considered as analysts who query an estimate of\nthe gradient of a noisy function at each iteration and move towards its\nminimizer. It is known that $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ examples can be used to minimize\nthe objective function, but none of the existing methods depend on the accuracy\nof the estimated gradients along the trajectory.

When adapting these models for changed environments, such\nas different weather conditions, they are prone to forgetting previously\nlearned information.

At the core is to model the rumor characteristics inherent in rich\ninformation, such as propagation patterns in social network and semantic\npatterns in post content, and differentiate them from the truth. However,\nexisting works on rumor detection fall short in modeling heterogeneous\ninformation, either using one single information source only (e.g. social\nnetwork, or post content) or ignoring the relations among multiple sources\n(e.g. fusing social and content features via simple concatenation). Therefore,\nthey possibly have drawbacks in comprehensively understanding the rumors, and\ndetecting them accurately. In this work, we explore contrastive self-supervised\nlearning on heterogeneous information sources, so as to reveal their relations\nand characterize rumors better. Technically, we supplement the main supervised\ntask of detection with an auxiliary self-supervised task, which enriches post\nrepresentations via post self-discrimination. Specifically, given two\nheterogeneous views of a post (i.e. representations encoding social patterns\nand semantic patterns), the discrimination is done by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between different views of the same post compared to that of other\nposts. We devise cluster-wise and instance-wise approaches to generate the\nviews and conduct the discrimination, considering different relations of\ninformation sources.

While numerical resolution fundamentally limits their\ninclusion in MHD simulations, real observations at the same nominal resolution\nshould still contain imprints of sub-resolution effects. This means that the\nsynthetic observables from a simulation of given resolution might not be\ndirectly comparable to real observables at the same resolution. It is thus of\ninterest to investigate how inferences based on synthetic spectra from\nsimulations with different numerical resolutions compare, and whether these\ndifferences persist after the spectra have been spatially degraded to a common\nresolution. We aim to compare synthetic spectra obtained from realistic 3D\nradiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulations run at three different\nnumerical resolutions from the same initial atmosphere, using very simple\nmethods for inferring line-of-sight velocities and magnetic fields.\nAdditionally we examine how the differing spatial resolution impacts the\nresults retrieved from the STiC inversion code. We find that while the simple\ninferences for all three simulations reveal the same large-scale tendencies,\nthe higher resolutions yield more fine-grained structures and more extreme\nline-of-sight velocities/magnetic fields in concentrated spots even after\nspatial smearing. We also see indications that the imprints of sub-resolution\neffects on the degraded spectra result in systematic errors in the inversions,\nand that these errors increase with the amount of sub-resolution effects\nincluded. Fortunately, however, we find that including successively more\nsub-resolution yields smaller additional effects; i.e. there is a clear trend\nof diminishing importance for progressively finer sub-resolution effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 12:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

Such performance losses are frequently\nmitigated by manipulating the hydrodynamic conditions at the membrane-fluid\ninterface using, e.g., mesh spacers acting as static mixers. This additional\nelement increases manufacturing complexity while improving mass transport in\ngeneral, yet accepting their known disadvantages such as less transport in dead\nzones. However, the shape of such spacers is limited to the design of\ncommercially available spacer geometries. Here, we present a methodology to\ndesign an industrially relevant mini-module with an optimized built-in 3D\nspacer structure in a flat-sheet ultrafiltration membrane module to eliminate\nthe spacer as a separate part. Therefore, the built-in structures have been\nconceptually implemented through an in-silico design in compliance with the\nspecifications for an injection molding process. Ten built-in structures were\ninvestigated in a digital twin of the mini-module by 3D-CFD simulations to\nselect two options, which were then compared to the empty feed channel\nregarding mass transfer. Subsequently, the simulated flux increase was\nexperimentally verified during bovine serum albumin (BSA) filtration. The new\nbuilt-in sinusoidal corrugation outperforms conventional mesh spacer inlays by\nup to 30% higher permeation rates. The origin of these improvements is\ncorrelated to the flow characteristics inside the mini-module as visualized\nonline and in-situ by low-field and high-field magnetic resonance imaging\nvelocimetry (flow-MRI) during pure water permeation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 13:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

In this paper, a deep learning-based\ntask-oriented communication architecture is proposed where the user extracts,\ncompresses and transmits semantics in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. Furthermore,\nan approach is proposed to compress the semantics according to their importance\nrelevant to the task, namely, adaptable semantic compression (ASC). Assuming a\ndelay-intolerant system, supporting multiple users indicates a problem that\nexecuting with the higher compression ratio requires fewer channel resources\nbut leads to the distortion of semantics, while executing with the lower\ncompression ratio requires more channel resources and thus may lead to a\ntransmission failure due to delay constraint. To solve the problem, both\ncompression ratio and resource allocation are optimized for the task-oriented\ncommunication system to maximize the success probability of tasks.\nSpecifically, due to the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a compression\nratio and resource allocation (CRRA) algorithm by separating the problem into\ntwo subproblems and solving iteratively to obtain the convergent solution.\nFurthermore, considering the scenarios where users have various service levels,\na compression ratio, resource allocation, and user selection (CRRAUS) algorithm\nis proposed to deal with the problem. In CRRAUS, users are adaptively selected\nto complete the corresponding intelligent tasks based on branch and bound\nmethod at the expense of higher algorithm complexity compared with CRRA.\nSimulation results show that the proposed CRRA and CRRAUS algorithms can obtain\nat least 15% and 10% success gains over baseline algorithms, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 14:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

These properties may induce the excitation of\nelectromagnetic perturbations through the whistler heat-flux instability\n(WHFI), that may contribute to a non-collisional regulation of the electron\nheat-flux values observed in the solar wind via wave-particle interactions.\nRecently, a new way to model the solar wind eVDF has been proposed: the\ncore-strahlo model. This representation consist in a bi-Maxwellian core plus a\nSkew-Kappa distribution, representing the halo and strahl electrons as a single\nskewed distribution. The core-strahlo model is able to reproduce the main\nfeatures of the eVDF in the solar wind (thermal core, enhanced tails, and\nskewness), with the advantage that the asymmetry is controlled by only one\nparameter. In this work we use linear kinetic theory to analyze the effect of\nsolar wind electrons described by the core-strahlo model, over the excitation\nof the parallel propagating WHFI. We use parameters relevant to the solar wind\nand focus our attention on the effect on the linear stability introduced by\ndifferent values of the core-to-strahlo density and temperature ratios, which\nare known to vary throughout the Heliosphere. We also obtain the stability\nthreshold for this instability as a function of the electron beta and the\nskewness parameter, which is a better indicator of instability than the\nheat-flux macroscopic moment, and present a threshold conditions for the\ninstability that can be compared with observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 14:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Although maintaining a\nhandful of samples (called `exemplars`) of each task could alleviate forgetting\nto some extent, existing methods are still limited by the small number of\nexemplars since these exemplars are too few to carry enough task-specific\nknowledge, and therefore the forgetting remains. To overcome this problem, we\npropose to `imagine` diverse counterparts of given exemplars referring to the\nabundant semantic-irrelevant information from unlabeled data.

Our\naim in this review article is to describe a recent investigation of the\ninfluence of the Yang-Mills vacuum polarisation and of the chromomagnetic\ncondensation on the evolution of Friedmann cosmology, on inflation and on\nprimordial gravitational waves. We derive the quantum energy-momentum tensor\nand the corresponding quantum equation of state for gauge field theory using\nthe effective Lagrangian approach.

This allows to investigate\nthe influence of the gauge field theory vacuum polarisation on the evolution of\nFriedmann cosmology, inflation and primordial gravitational waves. The Type\nI-IV solutions of the Friedmann equations induced by the gauge field theory\nvacuum polarisation provide an alternative inflationary mechanism and a\npossibility for late-time acceleration. The Type II solution of the Friedmann\nequations generates the initial exponential expansion of the universe of finite\nduration and the Type IV solution demonstrates late-time acceleration.

The addition of dispersed\nparticulate matter to a clean flow can either stabilize or destabilize the\nflow, depending on the particles' relaxation time-scale relative to the carrier\nflow time scales and the particle loading. To study the effects of\npolydispersity and particle interactions on the hydrodynamic stability of shear\nflows, we propose a new mathematical framework by combining a linear stability\nanalysis and a discrete Eulerian sectional formulation to describe the flow and\nthe dispersed particulate matter. In this formulation, multiple momentum and\ntransport equations are written for each size-section of the dispersed phase,\nwhere interphase and inter-particle mass and momentum transfer are modelled as\nsource terms in the governing equations. A new modal linear stability framework\nis derived by linearizing the coupled equations. Using this approach,\nparticle-flow interactions, such as polydispersity, droplet vaporization,\ncondensation, and coalescence, may be modelled. The method is validated with\nlinear stability analyses of clean and monodisperse particle-laden flows. We\nshow that the stability characteristics of a channel flow laden with particles\ndrastically change due to polydispersity. While relatively large monodisperse\nparticles tend to stabilize the flow, adding a second size section of a very\nsmall mass fraction of low-to-moderate Stokes number particles may\nsignificantly increase the growth rates, and for high-Reynolds numbers may\ndestabilize flows that might have been regarded as linearly stable in the\nmonodisperse case.

We also highlight the effect of\nobstacles on individual access and utilization of the models. To this end, we\nformulate an Equity Framework that considers equal access to the model, equal\noutcomes from the model, and equal utilization of the model, and\nconsequentially achieves equity and higher social welfare than current fairness\nnotions that aim for equality. We show how the three main aspects of the\nframework are connected and provide an equity scoring algorithm and questions\nto guide decision-makers towards equitable decision-making. We show how failure\nto consider access, outcome, and utilization would exacerbate proxy gaps\nleading to an infinite inequity loop that reinforces structural inequities\nthrough inaccurate and incomplete ground truth curation. We, therefore,\nrecommend a more critical look at the model design and its effect on equity and\na shift towards equity achieving predictive decision-making models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 20:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Recently,\nmodern embedded platforms started being equipped with such accelerators,\nresulting in a compelling choice for emerging, highly computational intensive\nworkloads, like those required by next-generation autonomous driving systems.\nAlongside the need for computational efficiency, such workloads are commonly\ncharacterized by real-time requirements, which need to be satisfied to\nguarantee the safe and correct behavior of the system. To this end, this paper\nproposes a holistic framework to help designers partition real-time\napplications on heterogeneous platforms with hardware accelerators. The\nproposed model is inspired by a realistic setup of an advanced driving\nassistance system presented in the WATERS 2019 Challenge by Bosch, further\ngeneralized to encompass a broader range of heterogeneous architectures. The\nresulting analysis is linearized and used to encode an optimization problem\nthat jointly (i) guarantees timing constraints, (ii) finds a suitable\ntask-to-core mapping, (iii) assigns a priority to each task, and (iv) selects\nwhich computations to accelerate, seeking for the most convenient trade-off\nbetween the smaller worst-case execution time provided by accelerators and\nsynchronization and queuing delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 15:26:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

A fundamental\nchallenge of this problem is that very few to zero prior knowledge is available\non both the state and the nonlinear system model. To cope with this challenge,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of deep learning in the modeling of dynamic\nsystems with nonlinear behavior by advocating an approach which relies on three\nmain ingredients: (i) we show that under some structural conditions on the\nto-be-identified model, the state can be expressed in function of a sequence of\nthe past inputs and outputs; (ii) this relation which we call the state map can\nbe modelled by resorting to the well-documented approximation power of deep\nneural networks; (iii) taking then advantage of existing learning schemes, a\nstate-space model can be finally identified. After the formulation and analysis\nof the approach, we show its ability to identify three different nonlinear\nsystems. The performances are evaluated in terms of open-loop prediction on\ntest data generated in simulation as well as a real world data-set of unmanned\naerial vehicle flight measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 06:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}
