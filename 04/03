Given an instruction such as \"Rinse off\na mug and place it in the coffee maker,\" the robot is required to locate the\nmug, wash it, and put it in the coffee maker. This is challenging because the\nrobot needs to break down the instruction sentences into subgoals and execute\nthem in the correct order. On the ALFRED benchmark, the performance of\nstate-of-the-art methods is still far lower than that of humans. This is\npartially because existing methods sometimes fail to infer subgoals that are\nnot explicitly specified in the instruction sentences. We propose Moment-based\nAdversarial Training (MAT), which uses two types of moments for perturbation\nupdates in adversarial training. We introduce MAT to the embedding spaces of\nthe instruction, subgoals, and state representations to handle their varieties.\nWe validated our method on the ALFRED benchmark, and the results demonstrated\nthat our method outperformed the baseline method for all the metrics on the\nbenchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 16:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In this paper, we propose to tackle this\nproblem by learning re-ID models from automatically generated person tracklets\nby multiple objects tracking (MOT) algorithm. To this end, we design a\ntracklet-based multi-level clustering (TMC) framework to effectively learn the\nre-ID model from the noisy person tracklets. First, intra-tracklet isolation to\nreduce ID switch noise within tracklets; second, alternates between using\ninter-tracklet association to eliminate ID fragmentation noise and network\ntraining using the pseudo label.

To relieve the challenges, we propose an\nend-to-end Point Cloud Circle Algebraic Fitting Network (Circle-Net) based on a\nsynergy of deep circle-boundary point feature learning and weighted algebraic\nfitting.

There usually exists a group of core users who visit the platform\nregularly and consume a large body of content upon each visit, while others are\ncasual users who tend to visit the platform occasionally and consume less each\ntime. As a result, consumption activities from core users often dominate the\ntraining data used for learning. As core users can exhibit different activity\npatterns from casual users, recommender systems trained on historical user\nactivity data usually achieve much worse performance on casual users than core\nusers. To bridge the gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework L2Aug to\nimprove recommendations for casual users through data augmentation, without\nsacrificing core user experience. L2Aug is powered by a data augmentor that\nlearns to generate augmented interaction sequences, in order to fine-tune and\noptimize the performance of the recommendation system for casual users. On four\nreal-world public datasets, L2Aug outperforms other treatment methods and\nachieves the best sequential recommendation performance for both casual and\ncore users. We also test L2Aug in an online simulation environment with\nreal-time feedback to further validate its efficacy, and showcase its\nflexibility in supporting different augmentation actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 19:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Regardless of the presence\nof T1 transitions, individual vertices will displace outwards and subsequently\nreturn back to their approximate original radial position; this radial\ndisplacement follows an inverse law.

We believe\nthat intelligent systems designed by leveraging the psychological anticipation\nmodels will do a more nuanced job at the task of human action prediction.\nFurthermore, we introduce cyclic transformation in the temporal dimension in\nfeature and semantic label space to instill the human ability of reasoning of\npast actions based on the predicted future. Experiments on Epic-Kitchen,\nBreakfast, and 50Salads dataset demonstrate that the action anticipation model\nlearned using a combination of the two systems along with the cycle\ntransformation performs favorably against various state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 21:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Current research has optimized\ntransmit waveform, adaptive to channel state information (CSI), to maximize the\nharvested power in WPT while accounting for energy harvester (EH)'s\nnon-linearity. However, the existing transmit waveform design disregards the\nnon-linear high power amplifiers (HPA) at the transmitter. Driven by this, this\npaper optimizes the multi-carrier waveform at the input of HPA to maximize the\nharvested DC power considering both HPA's and EH's non-linearities. Two\noptimization models are formulated based on whether the frequencies of the\nmulti-carrier waveform are concentrated within the transmit pass band or not.\nAnalysis and simulations show that, while EH's non-linearity boosts the power\nharvesting performance, HPA's non-linearity degrades the harvested power.\nHence, the optimal waveform shifts from multi-carrier that exploits EH's\nnon-linearity to single-carrier that reduces HPA's detrimental non-linear\ndistortion as the operational regime of WPT becomes more sensitive to HPA's\nnon-linearity and less sensitive to EH's non-linearity (and inversely).\nSimultaneously, operating towards HPA's non-linear regime by increasing the\ninput signal power benefits the harvested power since HPA's DC power supply is\nbetter exploited, whereas the end-to-end power transfer efficiency (PTE) might\ndecrease because of the increasing non-linear degradation. Throughout the\nsimulations, the proposed waveforms show significant gain over those not\naccounting for HPA's non-linearity, especially in frequency-flat channels. We\nalso compare the two proposed waveforms and show that the severity of HPA's\nnon-linearity dictates which of the two proposed waveforms is more beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 23:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 17:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 02:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Many of these mHealth\ninformation services provide limited fitness guidance owing to the dynamics of\nthe user's health conditions.

However, with an average of 10K phishing links reported per\nhour to platforms such as PhishTank and VirusTotal (VT), the deficiencies of\nsuch ML-based solutions are laid bare. We first explore how phishing sites\nbypass ML-based detection with a deep dive into 13K phishing pages targeting\nmajor brands such as Facebook. Results show successful evasion is caused by:\n(1) use of benign services to obscure phishing URLs; (2) high similarity\nbetween the HTML structures of phishing and benign pages; (3) hiding the\nultimate phishing content within Javascript and running such scripts only on\nthe client; (4) looking beyond typical credentials and credit cards for new\ncontent such as IDs and documents; (5) hiding phishing content until after\nhuman interaction. We attribute the root cause to the dependency of ML-based\nmodels on the vertical feature space (webpage content). These solutions rely\nonly on what phishers present within the page itself. Thus, we propose\nAnti-SubtlePhish, a more resilient model based on logistic regression.

Recently, some methods reformulate it as a\nclassification-regression task to boost the model performance, where continuous\ndepth is estimated via a linear combination of predicted probability\ndistributions and discrete bins. In this paper, we present a novel framework\ncalled BinsFormer, tailored for the classification-regression-based depth\nestimation. It mainly focuses on two crucial components in the specific task:\n1) proper generation of adaptive bins and 2) sufficient interaction between\nprobability distribution and bins predictions. To specify, we employ the\nTransformer decoder to generate bins, novelly viewing it as a direct set-to-set\nprediction problem.

Moreover, an extra scene\nunderstanding query is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, which turns\nout that models can implicitly learn useful information from an auxiliary\nenvironment classification task.

Inspired by BERT\nand MoCo, we propose POS-BERT, a one-stage BERT pre-training method for point\nclouds. Specifically, we use the mask patch modeling (MPM) task to perform\npoint cloud pre-training, which aims to recover masked patches information\nunder the supervision of the corresponding tokenizer output. Unlike Point-BERT,\nits tokenizer is extra-trained and frozen. We propose to use the dynamically\nupdated momentum encoder as the tokenizer, which is updated and outputs the\ndynamic supervision signal along with the training process.

It works on the principle of superposition. But due to the\ndecoherence effect, the superposition of a quantum state gets destroyed by the\ninteraction with the environment. It is a real challenge to completely isolate\na quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be\ncircumvented by the use of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases\nhave quasiparticles excitations called anyons. The anyons are charge-flux\ncomposites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the order of exchange\nmatters, then the anyons are called non-Abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in\ntopological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are\nnon-Abelian anyons. Such topological phases of matter have a ground state\ndegeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-Abelian anyons can result in a\nsuperposition of several anyons. The topological quantum gates are implemented\nby braiding and fusion of the non-Abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is\nachieved through the topological degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of\nfreedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local perturbations. In this\npaper, the Hilbert space for a topological qubit is discussed. The Ising and\nFibonacci anyonic models for binary gates are briefly given. Ternary logic\ngates are more compact than their binary counterparts and naturally arise in a\ntype of anyonic model called the metaplectic anyons. The mathematical model,\nfor the fusion and braiding matrices of metaplectic anyons, is the quantum\ndeformation of the recoupling theory. We proposed that the existing quantum\nternary arithmetic gates can be realized by braiding and topological charge\nmeasurement of the metaplectic anyons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 05:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 15:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 14:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

MSCCD\ncan detect Type-3 clones at various granularities. We evaluated MSCCD's\nlanguage extensibility by applying MSCCD to 20 modern languages. Sixteen\nlanguages were perfectly supported, and the remaining four were provided with\nthe same detection capabilities at the expense of execution time. We evaluated\nMSCCD's recall by using BigCloneEval and conducted a manual experiment to\nevaluate precision. MSCCD achieved equivalent detection performance equivalent\nto state-of-the-art tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 08:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 06:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

The focal point of the enrichment\ntheory shifts, in the oplax case, from the notion of $V$-category (given by\ncollections of objects and hom-objects together with composition and unit maps)\nto the one of categories enriched over $V$ (genuine categories equipped with\nadditional structures). One of the merits of the notion of categories enriched\nover $V$ is that it becomes straightforward to define enriched functors and\nnatural transformations. We show moreover that the resulting 2-category\n$\\mathsf{Cat}_V$ can be put in correspondence (via the theory of distributors)\nwith the 2-category of modules over $V$. We give an example of such an enriched\ncategory in the framework of operads: every cocomplete symmetric monoidal\ncategory $C$ is enriched over the category of sequences in $C$ endowed with an\noplax monoidal structure stemming from the usual operadic composition product,\nwhose monoids are still the operads.

A linear connection on\nthe base manifold is called compatible with the Finsler metric if the induced\nparallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors. Finsler\nmanifolds admitting compatible linear connections are called generalized\nBerwald manifolds. Compatible linear connections are the solutions of the\nso-called compatibility equations containing the torsion components as\nunknowns. Although there are some theoretical results for the solvability of\nthe compatibility equations (monochromatic Finsler metrics \\cite{BM}, extremal\ncompatible linear connections, algorithmic solutions \\cite{V14}), it is very\nhard to solve in general because compatible linear connections may or may not\nexist on a Finsler manifold and may or may not be unique. Therefore special\ncases are of special interest. One of them is the case of the so-called\nsemi-symmetric compatible linear connection with decomposable torsion tensor.\nIt is proved \\cite{V10} (see also \\cite{V11}) that such a compatible linear\nconnection must be uniquely determined. The original proof is based on\naveraging in the sense that the 1-form in the decomposition of the torsion\ntensor can be expressed by integrating differential forms on the tangent\nmanifold over the Finslerian indicatrices. The integral formulas are very\ndifficult to compute in practice. We present a new proof for the unicity result\nby using linear algebra and some basic facts about convex bodies and an\nexplicit formula for the solution without integration.

To achieve this, a key step is garment warping which spatially\naligns the target garment with the corresponding body parts in the person\nimage. Prior methods typically adopt a local appearance flow estimation model.\nThey are thus intrinsically susceptible to difficult body poses/occlusions and\nlarge mis-alignments between person and garment images (see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:fig1}). To overcome this limitation, a novel global appearance\nflow estimation model is proposed in this work. For the first time, a StyleGAN\nbased architecture is adopted for appearance flow estimation. This enables us\nto take advantage of a global style vector to encode a whole-image context to\ncope with the aforementioned challenges. To guide the StyleGAN flow generator\nto pay more attention to local garment deformation, a flow refinement module is\nintroduced to add local context.

Existing DP practice falls into three\ncategories - objective perturbation, gradient perturbation and output\nperturbation. They suffer from three main problems. First, conditions on\nobjective functions limit objective perturbation in general deep learning\ntasks. Second, gradient perturbation does not achieve a satisfactory\nprivacy-utility trade-off due to over-injected noise in each epoch. Third, high\nutility of the output perturbation method is not guaranteed because of the\nloose upper bound on the global sensitivity of the trained model parameters as\nthe noise scale parameter. To address these problems, we analyse a tighter\nupper bound on the global sensitivity of the model parameters. Under a\nblack-box setting, based on this global sensitivity, to control the overall\nnoise injection, we propose a novel output perturbation framework by injecting\nDP noise into a randomly sampled neuron (via the exponential mechanism) at the\noutput layer of a baseline non-private neural network trained with a\nconvexified loss function. We empirically compare the privacy-utility\ntrade-off, measured by accuracy loss to baseline non-private models and the\nprivacy leakage against black-box membership inference (MI) attacks, between\nour framework and the open-source differentially private stochastic gradient\ndescent (DP-SGD) approaches on six commonly used real-world datasets.

For polynomially bounded non-linearities we give sharp\nestimates in powers of $1/n$ for the joint cumulants of the network output and\nits derivatives. Moreover, we show that network cumulants form a perturbatively\nsolvable hierarchy in powers of $1/n$ in that $k$-th order cumulants in one\nlayer have recursions that depend to leading order in $1/n$ only on $j$-th\norder cumulants at the previous layer with $j\\leq k$.

The\nNeumann boundary condition is considered since it becomes the essential\nboundary condition in this case. It is well-known that the discrepancy between\nthe curved physical domain and the polygonal approximation domain leads to a\nloss of accuracy for discretization with polynomial order $\\alpha>1$. The\npurpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a detailed error analysis\nof the original WG-MFEM for solving problems on curved domains, which exhibits\nan $O(h^{1/2})$ convergence for all $\\alpha\\ge 1$. It is a little surprising to\nsee that even the lowest-order WG-MFEM ($\\alpha=1$) experiences a loss of\naccuracy. This is different from known results for the finite element method\n(FEM) or the mixed FEM, and appears to be a combined effect of the WG-MFEM\ndesign and the fact that the outward normal vector on the polygonal\napproximation domain is different from the one on the curved domain. Second, we\npropose a remedy to bring the approximation rate back to optimal by employing\ntwo techniques. One is a specially designed boundary correction technique. The\nother is to take full advantage of the nice feature that weak Galerkin\ndiscretization can be defined on polygonal meshes, which allows the curved\nboundary to be better approximated by multiple short edges without increasing\nthe total number of mesh elements. Rigorous analysis shows that a combination\nof the above two techniques renders optimal convergence for all $\\alpha$.\nNumerical results further confirm this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 12:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

More precisely, we\nconsider selecting the minimum cost of inputs from a prior set of inputs, and\nselecting the inputs of the smallest possible cost with a bound on their\ncardinality, all to ensure system structural controllability. Those problems\nhave attracted much attention recently; unfortunately, they are NP-hard in\ngeneral. In this paper, it is found that, if the input structure satisfies\ncertain `regularizations', which are characterized by the proposed restricted\ntotal unimodulairty notion, those problems can be solvable in polynomial time\nvia linear programming (LP) relaxations. Particularly, the obtained\ncharacterizations depend only on the incidence matrix relating the inputs and\nthe source strongly connected components (SCC) of the system structure,\nirrespective of how the inputs actuate states within the same SCC. They cover\nall the currently known polynomially solvable cases (such as the dedicated\ninput case), and contain many new cases unexploited in the past, among which\nthe source-SCC separated input (SSSI) constraint is highlighted. Further, for\nswitched systems, the obtained polynomially solvable condition (namely the\njoint SSSI constraint) does not require each of the subsystems to satisfy the\nSSSI constraint. We achieve these by first formulating those problems as\nequivalent integer linear programmings (ILPs), and then proving total\nunimodularity of the corresponding constraint matrices. This property allows us\nto solve those ILPs efficiently via LP-relaxation. We also discuss solutions\nobtained via LP-relaxation and LP-rounding in the general case.

This innovative learning task is particularly suitable\nfor medical image segmentation, where all categories of organs can be presented\nin one single image and annotated all at once. To address this challenging EL\ntask, we propose an Exemplar Learning-based Synthesis Net (ELSNet) framework\nfor medical image segmentation that enables innovative exemplar-based data\nsynthesis, pixel-prototype based contrastive embedding learning, and\npseudo-label based exploitation of the unlabeled data. Specifically, ELSNet\nintroduces two new modules for image segmentation: an exemplar-guided synthesis\nmodule, which enriches and diversifies the training set by synthesizing\nannotated samples from the given exemplar, and a pixel-prototype based\ncontrastive embedding module, which enhances the discriminative capacity of the\nbase segmentation model via contrastive representation learning. Moreover, we\ndeploy a two-stage process for segmentation model training, which exploits the\nunlabeled data with predicted pseudo segmentation labels. To evaluate this new\nlearning framework, we conduct extensive experiments on several organ\nsegmentation datasets and present an in-depth analysis.

However, weather corruptions can hinder the\nobject detectability and pose a serious threat to their navigation and\nreliability. Thus, there is a need for efficient denoising, deraining, and\nrestoration techniques. Generative adversarial networks and transformers have\nbeen widely adopted for image restoration. However, the training of these\nmethods is often unstable and time-consuming. Furthermore, when used for object\ndetection (OD), the output images generated by these methods may provide\nunsatisfactory results despite image clarity. In this work, we propose a\ncontrastive approach towards mitigating this problem, by evaluating images\ngenerated by restoration models during and post training. This approach\nleverages OD scores combined with attention maps for predicting the usefulness\nof restored images for the OD task.

Notice that, e-commerce platforms usually have multiple\nentrances for different categories and some entrances have few visits. Data\nfrom these entrances has low coverage, which makes it difficult for the agent\nto learn. To address this challenge, we propose Similarity-based Hybrid\nTransfer for Ads Allocation (SHTAA), which effectively transfers samples as\nwell as knowledge from data-rich entrance to data-poor entrance. Specifically,\nwe define an uncertainty-aware similarity for MDP to estimate the similarity of\nMDP for different entrances. Based on this similarity, we design a hybrid\ntransfer method, including instance transfer and strategy transfer, to\nefficiently transfer samples and knowledge from one entrance to another. Both\noffline and online experiments on Meituan food delivery platform demonstrate\nthat the proposed method could achieve better performance for data-poor\nentrance and increase the revenue for the platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 16:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 07:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 10:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

To resolve the\nsample efficiency issue in learning the high-dimensional and complex control of\ndexterous grasping, we propose an effective representation of grasping state\ncharacterizing the spatial interaction between the gripper and the target\nobject. To represent gripper-object interaction, we adopt Interaction Bisector\nSurface (IBS) which is the Voronoi diagram between two close by 3D geometric\nobjects and has been successfully applied in characterizing spatial relations\nbetween 3D objects. We found that IBS is surprisingly effective as a state\nrepresentation since it well informs the fine-grained control of each finger\nwith spatial relation against the target object. This novel grasp\nrepresentation, together with several technical contributions including a fast\nIBS approximation, a novel vector-based reward and an effective training\nstrategy, facilitate learning a strong control model of high-DOF grasping with\ngood sample efficiency, dynamic adaptability, and cross-category generality.\nExperiments show that it generates high-quality dexterous grasp for complex\nshapes with smooth grasping motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 07:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Possible applications include heavy-duty vehicles\nfor civil engineering tasks like earthmoving or mining excavation. Safe vehicle\noperation in complex terrain geometry requires lateral vehicle stability to\nprevent vehicle rollover. Good lateral stability is a particular requirement\nfor excavation and piling operations where the margins of safety define the\nterrain geometry that can be worked in, and it is a major constraint in\noperational planning. An earthmoving vehicle that can operate at a high roll\nangle reduces the need to maintain ramps in pits and on piles and can shorten\nand simplify the paths for individual maneuvers. Here we report on several\nfield trials on the lateral stability of an earthmoving vehicle that uses the\ninterlock drive systems.

The system promises high tractive performance in low\ngravity environments where tires have little traction for lack of weight. At\nEarth and Space 2021 we reported the performance of such spikes on a silty clay\nloam, a cohesive soil. We found that in such soil, traction below a critical\ndepth is provided by a zone of lateral soil failure. We also found that the\narticulation translates a horizontal draft force into a vertical penetration\nforce strong enough to penetrate a narrow spike to a depth where the soil can\nsustain the draft force, in a self-regulating way. It is conceivable that a\ngranular material like regolith or sand with little to no cohesive strength\nprovides less vertical penetration resistance and less resistance to a\nhorizontal draft force than a cohesive soil, which leads to the question of\nwhether and how much tractive force an interlocking spike can generate on a\ngranular material. Here we report on field trials that study different spike\ndesigns in dry and unsaturated moist sand. The results demonstrate that a loose\ngranular material requires larger spikes than a cohesive soil, that these\nlarger spikes penetrate dry and moist sand reliably, and that they promise good\ntractive efficiency. The trials indicate that on sand, a larger spike diameter\ncan improve the pull/weight ratio without a loss of tractive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 22:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 19:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}
