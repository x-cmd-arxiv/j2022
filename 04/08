While recent work on abstraction in the situation\ncalculus has focused on non-probabilistic domains, we describe an approach to\nabstraction of probabilistic and dynamic systems. Based on a variant of the\nsituation calculus with probabilistic belief, we define a notion of\nbisimulation that allows to abstract a detailed probabilistic basic action\ntheory with noisy actuators and sensors by a possibly non-stochastic basic\naction theory. By doing so, we obtain abstract Golog programs that omit\nunnecessary details and which can be translated back to a detailed program for\nactual execution. This simplifies the implementation of noisy robot programs,\nopens up the possibility of using non-stochastic reasoning methods (e.g.,\nplanning) on probabilistic problems, and provides domain descriptions that are\nmore easily understandable and explainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 16:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 14:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

In this paper, we shall first perform an analysis of\nfour popular but different modern industrial robot arms. By seeing the common\ntrends we will try to extrapolate and expand these trends for the future. Here,\nparticular focus will be on interaction based on augmented reality (AR) through\nhead-mounted displays (HMD), but also through smartphones. Long-term\nhuman-robot interaction and personalization of said interaction will also be\nconsidered. The use of AR in human-robot interaction has proven to enhance\ncommunication and information exchange. A basic addition to industrial arm\ndesign would be the integration of QR markers on the robot, both for accessing\ninformation and adding tracking capabilities to more easily display AR\noverlays. In a recent example of information access, Mercedes Benz added QR\nmarkers on their cars to help rescue workers estimate the best places to cut\nand evacuate people after car crashes. One has also to deal with safety in an\nenvironment that will be more and more about collaboration. The QR markers can\ntherefore be combined with RF-based ranging modules, developed in the\nEU-project SafeLog, that can be used both for safety as well as for tracking of\nhuman positions while in close proximity interactions with the industrial arms.\nThe industrial arms of the future should also be intuitive to program and\ninteract with. This would be achieved through AR and head mounted displays as\nwell as the already mentioned RF-based person tracking. Finally, a more\npersonalized interaction between the robots and humans can be achieved through\nlife-long learning AI and disembodied, personalized agents. We propose a design\nthat not only exists in the physical world, but also partly in the digital\nworld of mixed reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 16:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 15:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Quasi-static approximation\nfor electric field calculations is generally applied to reduce the\ncomputational cost. Here, we aimed to analyze and quantify the validity of the\napproximation over a broad frequency range. Approach: We performed\nelectromagnetic modeling studies using an anatomical head models and considered\napproximations assuming either a purely ohmic medium (i.e., static formulation)\nor a lossy dielectric medium (quasi-static formulation). The results were\ncompared with the solution of Maxwell's equations in the cases of harmonic and\npulsed signals. Finally, we analyzed the effect of electrode positioning on\nthese errors. Main Results: Our findings demonstrate that the quasi-static\napproximation is valid and produces a relative error below 1% up to 1.43 MHz.\nThe largest error is introduced in the static case, where the error is over 1%\nacross the entire considered spectrum and as high as 20% in the brain at 10 Hz.\nWe also highlight the special importance of considering the capacitive effect\nof tissues for pulsed waveforms, which prevents signal distortion induced by\nthe purely ohmic approximation. At the neuron level, the results point a\ndifference of sense electric field as high as 22% at focusing point, impacting\npyramidal cells firing times. Significance: Quasi-static approximation remains\nvalid in the frequency range currently used for tACS. However, neglecting\npermittivity (static formulation) introduces significant error for both\nharmonic and non-harmonic signals.

In response, Apple introduced two significant\nchanges with iOS 14: App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a mandatory opt-in system\nfor enabling tracking on iOS, and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which disclose what\nkinds of data each app processes. So far, the impact of these changes on\nindividual privacy and control has not been well understood. This paper\naddresses this gap by analysing two versions of 1,759 iOS apps from the UK App\nStore: one version from before iOS 14 and one that has been updated to comply\nwith the new rules.\n  We find that Apple's new policies, as promised, prevent the collection of the\nIdentifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier for cross-app tracking.\nSmaller data brokers that engage in invasive data practices will now face\nhigher challenges in tracking users - a positive development for privacy.\nHowever, the number of tracking libraries has roughly stayed the same in the\nstudied apps. Many apps still collect device information that can be used to\ntrack users at a group level (cohort tracking) or identify individuals\nprobabilistically (fingerprinting). We find real-world evidence of apps\ncomputing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through the use\nof server-side code, thereby violating Apple's policies. We find that Apple\nitself engages in some forms of tracking and exempts invasive data practices\nlike first-party tracking and credit scoring. We also find that the new Privacy\nNutrition Labels are sometimes inaccurate and misleading.\n  Overall, our findings suggest that, while tracking individual users is more\ndifficult now, the changes reinforce existing market power of gatekeeper\ncompanies with access to large troves of first-party data and motivate a\ncountermovement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 16:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 07:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 19:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 May 2022 09:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

In the past two decades, various\nconstructions of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) have been developed,\nleading to many good code families. However, the majority of these codes are\nnot suitable for near-term quantum devices. Here we present VarQEC, a\nnoise-resilient variational quantum algorithm to search for quantum codes with\na hardware-efficient encoding circuit. The cost functions are inspired by the\nmost general and fundamental requirements of a QECC, the Knill-Laflamme\nconditions. Given the target noise channel (or the target code parameters) and\nthe hardware connectivity graph, we optimize a shallow variational quantum\ncircuit to prepare the basis states of an eligible code. In principle, VarQEC\ncan find quantum codes for any error model, whether additive or non-additive,\ndegenerate or non-degenerate, pure or impure. We have verified its\neffectiveness by (re)discovering some symmetric and asymmetric codes, e.g.,\n$((n,2^{n-6},3))_2$ for $n$ from 7 to 14. We also found new $((6,2,3))_2$ and\n$((7,2,3))_2$ codes that are not equivalent to any stabilizer code, and\nextensive numerical evidence with VarQEC suggests that a $((7,3,3))_2$ code\ndoes not exist.

Given an initial vorticity\ndistribution $\\omega_0$, predicting the long time behavior which can persist is\nan issue of fundamental importance.

Since kinetic energy $\\mathsf{E}$\nis conserved, not all the mixed states are relevant and it is natural to\nconsider only the ones with energy $\\mathsf{E}_0$ corresponding to $\\omega_0$.\nThe set of said vorticity fields, denoted by\n$\\overline{\\mathcal{O}_{\\omega_0}}^*\\cap \\{ {\\mathsf E}= {\\mathsf E}_0\\}$,\ncontains all the possible end states of the fluid motion.

In other words, high-level actions usually pose implicit temporal\nconstraints on the low-level platform, which are typically independent of the\nconcrete program to be executed. In this paper, we propose to make these\nconstraints explicit by modeling them as MTL formulas, which enforce the\nexecution of certain low-level platform operations in addition to the main\nprogram. Based on results from timed automata controller synthesis, we describe\na method to synthesize a controller that executes both the high-level program\nand the low-level platform operations concurrently in order to satisfy the MTL\nspecification.

These corrections arise when the\nsubsystem size is appreciable compared to the total system size and lead to a\ndeviation from the usual logarithmic scaling characteristic of one-dimensional\nquantum-critical systems. Using matrix product states with open and infinite\nboundary conditions, we numerically demonstrate the disappearance of the zero\nmode contribution for finite subsystem sizes in the thermodynamic limit. Our\nresults provide further support to the recent free fermion computations, but\nclearly contradict earlier analytical field theory calculations based on\ntwisted torus partition functions. Subsequently, we compute the logarithm of\nthe EN (log-EN) between two disjoint subsystems separated by a defect. We show\nthat the log-EN scales logarithmically with the separation of the subsystems.\nHowever, the coefficient of this logarithmic scaling yields a\ncontinuously-varying effective central charge that is different from that\nobtained from analogous computations of the EE. The defects leave their\nfingerprints in the subleading term of the scaling of the log-EN. Furthermore,\nthe log-EN receives similar `finite size corrections' like the EE which leads\nto deviations from its characteristic logarithmic scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 17:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 01:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 16:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

Using parametric models is an\nefficient way when real data set shows trimodality. In this paper we propose a\nnew class of trimodal probability distributions, that is, probability\ndistributions that have up to three modes. Trimodality itself is achieved by\napplying a proper transformation to density function of certain continuous\nprobability distributions. At first, we obtain preliminary results for an\narbitratry density function $g(x)$ and, next, we focus on the Gaussian case,\nstudying trimodal Gaussian model more deeply. The Gaussian distribution is\napplied to produce the trimodal form of Gaussian known as normal distribution.\nThe tractability of analytical expression of normal distribution, and\nproperties of the trimodal normal distribution are important reasons why we\nchoose normal distribution. Furthermore, the existing distributions should be\nimproved to be capable of modelling efficiently when there exists a trimodal\nform in a data set. After new density function is proposed, estimating its\nparameters is important. Since Mathematica 12.0 software has optimization tools\nand important modelling techniques, computational steps are performed by using\nthis software.

We\nargue that such a system of a parallel DW-aDW pair could have been created at a\nvery early epoch of the cosmological evolution when the Universe was still of\nmicroscopic size because its creation is topologically possible as compared to\na single DW creation when the perpendicular extra dimension is compact.

However, it remains unclear how this energy is\nthermalised so that it can effectively prevent global thermal instability. One\npossible option is that a fraction of the AGN energy is converted into cosmic\nrays (CRs), which provide non-thermal pressure support, and can retain energy\neven as thermal energy is radiated away. By means of magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we investigate how CR injected by the AGN jet influence cooling\nflows of a massive galaxy cluster. We conclude that converting a fraction of\nthe AGN luminosity as low as 10\\% into CR energy prevents cooling flows on\ntimescales of billion years, without significant changes in the structure of\nthe multi-phase intra-cluster medium. CR-dominated jets, by contrast, lead to\nthe formation of an extended, warm central nebula that is supported by CR\npressure. We report that the presence of CRs is not able to suppress the onset\nof thermal instability in massive galaxy clusters, but CR-dominated jets do\nsignificantly change the continued evolution of gas as it continues to cool\nfrom isobaric to isochoric. The CR redistribution in the cluster is dominated\nby advection rather than diffusion or streaming, but the heating by CR\nstreaming helps maintain gas in the hot and warm phase.

We apply cross-view self-attention to efficiently enable the\nglobal interactions between multi-camera feature maps. Different from\nself-supervised monocular depth estimation, we are able to predict real-world\nscales given multi-camera extrinsic matrices. To achieve this goal, we adopt\nthe two-frame structure-from-motion to extract scale-aware pseudo depths to\npretrain the models. Further, instead of predicting the ego-motion of each\nindividual camera, we estimate a universal ego-motion of the vehicle and\ntransfer it to each view to achieve multi-view ego-motion consistency. In\nexperiments, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the\nchallenging multi-camera depth estimation datasets DDAD and nuScenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 17:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 06:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 13:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

We propose\napproaching the problem from an orthogonal angle: exploiting self-attention\nmechanisms with both \"spatial tokens\" and \"channel tokens\". With spatial\ntokens, the spatial dimension defines the token scope, and the channel\ndimension defines the token feature dimension. With channel tokens, we have the\ninverse: the channel dimension defines the token scope, and the spatial\ndimension defines the token feature dimension. We further group tokens along\nthe sequence direction for both spatial and channel tokens to maintain the\nlinear complexity of the entire model. We show that these two self-attentions\ncomplement each other: (i) since each channel token contains an abstract\nrepresentation of the entire image, the channel attention naturally captures\nglobal interactions and representations by taking all spatial positions into\naccount when computing attention scores between channels; (ii) the spatial\nattention refines the local representations by performing fine-grained\ninteractions across spatial locations, which in turn helps the global\ninformation modeling in channel attention.

The aim of this work is to constrain the gas temperature and\nsurface density in two transition disks: LkCa15 and HD 169142. We use new ALMA\nobservations of the $^{13}$CO $J=6-5$ transition together with archival $J=2-1$\ndata of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O to observationally constrain the gas\ntemperature and surface density. Furthermore, we use the thermochemical code\nDALI to model the temperature and density structure of a typical transition\ndisk. The $6-5/2-1$ line ratio in LkCa15 constrains the gas temperature in the\nemitting layers inside the dust cavity to be up to 65 K, warmer than in the\nouter disk at 20-30 K. For the HD 169142, the peak brightness temperature\nconstrains the gas in the dust cavity of HD 169142 to be 170 K, whereas that in\nthe outer disk is only 100 K. Models also show that a more luminous central\nstar, a lower abundance of PAHs and the absence of a dusty inner disk increase\nthe temperature of the emitting layers and hence the line ratio in the gas\ncavity. The gas column density in the LkCa15 dust cavity drops by a factor >2\ncompared to the outer disk, with an additional drop of an order of magnitude\ninside the gas cavity at 10 AU. In the case of HD 169142, the gas column\ndensity drops by a factor of 200$-$500 inside the gas cavity, which could be\ndue to a massive companion of several M$_{\\mathrm{J}}$. The broad dust-depleted\ngas region from 10-68 AU for LkCa15 may imply several lower mass planets.

Despite the\nsuccess of large language models on text revision tasks, they are limited to\nnon-iterative, one-shot revisions. Examining and evaluating the capability of\nlarge language models for making continuous revisions and collaborating with\nhuman writers is a critical step towards building effective writing assistants.\nIn this work, we present a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system,\nRead, Revise, Repeat (R3), which aims at achieving high quality text revisions\nwith minimal human efforts by reading model-generated revisions and user\nfeedbacks, revising documents, and repeating human-machine interactions. In R3,\na text revision model provides text editing suggestions for human writers, who\ncan accept or reject the suggested edits. The accepted edits are then\nincorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision.\nWriters can therefore revise documents iteratively by interacting with the\nsystem and simply accepting/rejecting its suggested edits until the text\nrevision model stops making further revisions or reaches a predefined maximum\nnumber of revisions. Empirical experiments show that R3 can generate revisions\nwith comparable acceptance rate to human writers at early revision depths, and\nthe human-machine interaction can get higher quality revisions with fewer\niterations and edits.

We first developed a\nnew shape descriptor based on spherical harmonics, incorporating key\npolarisation information of the uropod. We found that the shape space of T\ncells is low-dimensional. At the behavioural level, run-and-stop migration\nmodes emerge at ~150 s, and we mapped the morphodynamic composition of each\nmode using multiscale wavelet analysis, finding 'stereotyped' motifs. Focusing\non the run mode, we found morphodynamics oscillating periodically (every ~100\ns) that can be broken down into a biphasic process: front-widening with\nretraction of the uropod, followed by a rearward surface motion and forward\nextension, where intercalation with the ECM in both of these steps likely\nfacilitates forward motion. Further application of these methods may enable the\ncomparison of T cell migration across different conditions (e.g.\ndifferentiation, activation, tissues, and drug treatments), and improve the\nprecision of immunotherapeutic development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 18:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

We conceptualize the model\nparameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its\ncentroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of\nfeatures around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster\nto derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes\naway from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective\nfunction that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their\ncorresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This\nmethodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces\nthe spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are\npushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to,\neffectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an\nadversarial example.

However, TI systems can have a limited number of qubits in a\nsingle trap. Execution of meaningful quantum algorithms requires a multiple\ntrap system. In such systems, the computation may frequently involve ions from\ntwo different traps for which the qubits must be co-located in the same trap,\nhence one of the ions needs to be shuttled (moved) between traps, increasing\nthe vibrational energy, degrading fidelity, and increasing the program\nexecution time. The choice of initial mapping influences the number of\nshuttles. The existing Greedy policy counts the number of gates occurring\nbetween each pair of qubits and assigns edge weight. The qubits with high edge\nweights are placed close to each other. However, it neglects the stage of the\nprogram at which the gate is occurring. Intuitively, the contribution of the\nlate-occurring gates to the initial mapping reduces since the ions might have\nalready shuttled to a different trap to satisfy other gate operations. In this\npaper, we target this gap and propose a new policy especially for programs with\nconsiderable depth and high number of qubits (valid for practical-scale quantum\nprograms).

Their\nphysical effects are often reflected in the first-passage times arising from\nthese energy landscapes. However, their calculation is notoriously challenging\nand it is often difficult to identify the most relevant features of a given\nenergy landscape. Here we show how this can be achieved by coarse-graining the\nFokker-Planck equation to a master equation and decomposing its first-passage\ntimes in an iterative process. We apply this method to the electrostatic\ninteraction between two rods of nonmuscle myosin II (NM2), which is the main\nmolecular motor for force generation in nonmuscle cells. Energy landscapes are\ncomputed directly from the amino acid sequences of the three different\nisoforms. Our approach allows us to identify the most relevant energy barriers\nfor their self-assembly into nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments and how they\nchange under force. In particular, we find that antiparallel configurations are\nmore stable than parallel ones, but also show more changes under mechanical\nloading.

Many algorithms recently proposed in the literature tackle this\nproblem using a variety of data-level, algorithm-level, and ensemble\napproaches.

This work presents a taxonomy of\nalgorithms for imbalanced data streams and proposes a standardized, exhaustive,\nand informative experimental testbed to evaluate algorithms in a collection of\ndiverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental\nstudy evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced\ndata streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios,\ninstance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic\ndatasets in binary and multi-class scenarios.

We\ndiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art classifiers in\neach of these scenarios and we provide general recommendations to end-users for\nselecting the best algorithms for imbalanced data streams. Additionally, we\nformulate open challenges and future directions for this domain.

Recently, Transformer Neural Networks\nhave gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

The lowest $\\delta V^2$ curves\nthat can be found from NFW are linear on the normalized radius (i.e., $\\delta\nV^2_{NFW} = r_n$), while for Burkert $\\delta V^2_{Bur} = r_n^2$ (this result is\nindependent of the halo density parameter, i.e., $\\rho_{c}$ or $\\rho_{s}$).\nMOND only covers the very central region of the observed distribution, hence it\nalso lacks the necessary diversity, which in turn is related to larger $\\chi^2$\nvalues.

These growth\nrates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect\nto an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature,\ncoexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive.\nIntuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from\nbeing rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach,\nwe prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the\ninvasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient,\nwhich invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic\nmodels and equate coexistence with permanence, i.e., a global attractor bounded\naway from extinction. For models satisfying certain technical assumptions, we\nintroduce invasion graphs where vertices correspond to proper subsets of\nspecies (communities) supporting an ergodic measure and directed edges\ncorrespond to potential transitions between communities due to invasions by\nmissing species. These directed edges are determined by the signs of invasion\ngrowth rates. When the invasion graph is acyclic (i.e. there is no sequence of\ninvasions starting and ending at the same community), we show that permanence\nis determined by the signs of the invasion growth rates. In this case,\npermanence is characterized by the invasibility of all -i communities, i.e.,\ncommunities without species i where all other missing species having negative\ninvasion growth rates. We show that dissipative Lotka-Volterra models satisfy\nour technical assumptions and computing their invasion graphs reduces to\nsolving systems of linear equations. We provide additional applications of the\nresults and discuss open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 23:08:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2022 19:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

Labeling these datasets for identifying intrusion attacks is very\nlaborious and error-prone. Furthermore, network traffic data have complex\ntime-varying non-linear relationships. The existing state-of-the-art intrusion\ndetection solutions use a combination of various supervised approaches along\nwith fused features subsets based on correlations in traffic data. These\nsolutions often require high computational cost, manual support in fine-tuning\nintrusion detection models, and labeling of data that limit real-time\nprocessing of network traffic. Unsupervised solutions do reduce computational\ncomplexities and manual support for labeling data but current unsupervised\nsolutions do not consider spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data. To\naddress this, we propose a unified Autoencoder based on combining multi-scale\nconvolutional neural network and long short-term memory (MSCNN-LSTM-AE) for\nanomaly detection in network traffic. The model first employs Multiscale\nConvolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (MSCNN-AE) to analyze the spatial\nfeatures of the dataset, and then latent space features learned from MSCNN-AE\nemploys Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder Network to process the\ntemporal features.

In applications one often needs to quickly\ntell if an input matrix is PSD, and a small distance from the PSD cone may be\ntolerable. We consider two well-studied query models for measuring efficiency,\nnamely, the matrix-vector and vector-matrix-vector query models. We first\nconsider one-sided testers, which are testers that correctly classify any PSD\ninput, but may fail on a non-PSD input with a tiny failure probability. Up to\nlogarithmic factors, in the matrix-vector query model we show a tight\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(1/\\epsilon^{p/(2p+1)})$ bound, while in the\nvector-matrix-vector query model we show a tight\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(d^{1-1/p}/\\epsilon)$ bound, for every $p \\geq 1$. We also\nshow a strong separation between one-sided and two-sided testers in the\nvector-matrix-vector model, where a two-sided tester can fail on both PSD and\nnon-PSD inputs with a tiny failure probability.

In particular, once\n$d\\geq\\log n$, there are no known non-trivial streaming algorithms for problems\nsuch as maintaining convex hulls and L\\\"owner-John ellipsoids of $n$ points,\ndespite a long line of work in streaming computational geometry since [AHV04].\n  We simultaneously improve these results to $\\mathrm{poly}(d,\\log n)$ bits of\nspace by trading off with a $\\mathrm{poly}(d,\\log n)$ factor distortion. We\nachieve these results in a unified manner, by designing the first streaming\nalgorithm for maintaining a coreset for $\\ell_\\infty$ subspace embeddings with\n$\\mathrm{poly}(d,\\log n)$ space and $\\mathrm{poly}(d,\\log n)$ distortion. Our\nalgorithm also gives similar guarantees in the \\emph{online coreset} model.\nAlong the way, we sharpen results for online numerical linear algebra by\nreplacing a log condition number dependence with a $\\log n$ dependence,\nanswering a question of [BDM+20]. Our techniques provide a novel connection\nbetween leverage scores, a fundamental object in numerical linear algebra, and\ncomputational geometry.\n  For $\\ell_p$ subspace embeddings, we give nearly optimal trade-offs between\nspace and distortion for one-pass streaming algorithms. For instance, we give a\ndeterministic coreset using $O(d^2\\log n)$ space and $O((d\\log n)^{1/2-1/p})$\ndistortion for $p>2$, whereas previous deterministic algorithms incurred a\n$\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ factor in the space or the distortion [CDW18].\n  Our techniques have implications in the offline setting, where we give\noptimal trade-offs between the space complexity and distortion of subspace\nsketch data structures. To do this, we give an elementary proof of a \"change of\ndensity\" theorem of [LT80] and make it algorithmic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 00:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 14:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

In shallow water, cloaking an object from surface waves\nby varying the seabed topography is possible, however, as the water depth\nincreases, cloaking becomes a challenge since there is no physical parameter to\nbe engineered and subsequently affects the wave propagation. In order to create\nan omnidirectional cylindrical cloaking device for finite-depth/deep-water\nwaves, we propose a multi-layered elastic plate that floats on the surface\naround a to-be-cloaked cylinder.

But the strict form of support set makes its\nconstruction actually difficult in practical application. Motivated by ANIL, we\nrethink the role of adaption in the feature extractor of CNAPs, which is a\nstate-of-the-art representative few-shot method. To investigate the role,\nAlmost Zero-Shot (AZS) task is designed by fixing the support set to replace\nthe common scheme, which provides corresponding support sets for the different\nconditional prior of different tasks. The AZS experiment results infer that the\nadaptation works little in the feature extractor. However, CNAPs cannot be\nrobust to randomly selected support sets and perform poorly on some datasets of\nMeta-Dataset because of its scattered mean embeddings responded by the simple\nmean operator. To enhance the robustness of CNAPs, Canonical Mean Filter (CMF)\nmodule is proposed to make the mean embeddings intensive and stable in feature\nspace by mapping the support sets into a canonical form.

In this paper we turn our\nattention to matrix groups, whose usefulness within this framework was\nrelatively unexplored.\n  We first show that groups of Lie type cannot prove $\\omega=2$ within the\ngroup-theoretic approach.

It is a common\npractice to learn informative user and item representations by performing\nembedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the\nusers with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite\neffectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features\nbetween user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's\npreference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same\nway, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood.\nSuch a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item\nrepresentations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent.\n  In this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive\nguidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN\n(short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user\nrepresentation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to\nthose neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the\nitem representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the\ntarget user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively\ndistilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional\noperation. Our model is built on top of LightGCN, a state-of-the-art GCN model\nfor CF, and can be combined with various GCN-based CF architectures in an\nend-to-end fashion.

Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect\nlabels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and\nmodel the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However,\nthese approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact\nthat the generation process of the candidate labels is always\ninstance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In\nthis paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation\nprocess of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts,\nwhere the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the\nincorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct\nlabel as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this\nconsideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A Posterior\n(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate labels via\ndecomposed probability distribution models.

In order to generalize the universal property of the Hopf\nalgebra of quasisymmetric functions QSym (a particular case of quasishuffle\nHopf algebra) as exposed by Aguiar, Bergeron and Sottile, we introduce the\nnotion of double bialgebra over V. A bialgebra over V is a bialgebra in the\ncategory of right V-comodules and an extra condition is required on the second\ncoproduct for double bialgebras over V. We prove that the quasishuffle\nbialgebra QSh(V) is a double bialgebra over V , and that it satisfies a\nuniversal property: for any bialgebra B over V and for any character $\\lambda$\nof B, under a connectedness condition, there exists a unique morphism $\\phi$ of\nbialgebras over V from B to QSh(V) such that $\\epsilon_\\delta \\circ\n\\phi=\\lambda$.

State-of-the-art strategies address the\nproblem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict\nsubgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice,\ntraining data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations\ntransformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these\nstrategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called $\\textit{a\npriori}$ criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to\nobtain good performance in terms of $\\textit{a posteriori}$ metrics which imply\ncomputing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the\nrepresentation of energy backscatter in two dimensional quasi-geostrophic\nturbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning\nstrategies at fixed computational complexity.

However, quantifying their safety and\nrobustness properties has proven challenging due to the non-linearities of the\nactivation functions inside the neural network. A key robustness indicator is\ncertifying the stability properties of the feedback system and providing a\nregion of attraction, which has been addressed in previous literature. However,\nthese works only address linear systems or require one to abstract the plant\nnon-linearities and bound them using slope and sector constraints. In this\npaper we use a Sum of Squares programming framework to compute the stability of\nnon-linear systems with neural network controllers directly. Within this\nframework, we can propose higher order candidate Lyapunov functions with richer\nstructures that are able to better capture the dynamics of the non-linear\nsystem and the nonlinearities in the neural network. We are also able to\nanalyse these systems in continuous time, whereas other methods rely on\ndiscretising the system.

Moreover, implementing a\nshuffler in a reliable way is not trivial due to known security issues and/or\nrequirements of advanced hardware or secure computation technology.\n  Motivated by these practical considerations, we rethink the shuffle model to\nrelax the assumption of requiring a centralized, trusted shuffler. We introduce\nnetwork shuffling, a decentralized mechanism where users exchange data in a\nrandom-walk fashion on a network/graph, as an alternative of achieving privacy\namplification via anonymity. We analyze the threat model under such a setting,\nand propose distributed protocols of network shuffling that is straightforward\nto implement in practice. Furthermore, we show that the privacy amplification\nrate is similar to other privacy amplification techniques such as uniform\nshuffling. To our best knowledge, among the recently studied intermediate trust\nmodels that leverage privacy amplification techniques, our work is the first\nthat is not relying on any centralized entity to achieve privacy amplification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 08:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

In this\npaper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions via comparing\nand reweighting with a set of similar images. First, we propose a\ndistinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the\ndistinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our\nmetric reveals that the human annotations of each image in the MSCOCO dataset\nare not equivalent based on distinctiveness; however, previous works normally\ntreat the human annotations equally during training, which could be a reason\nfor generating less distinctive captions. In contrast, we reweight each\nground-truth caption according to its distinctiveness during training. We\nfurther integrate a long-tailed weight strategy to highlight the rare words\nthat contain more information, and captions from the similar image set are\nsampled as negative examples to encourage the generated sentence to be unique.\nFinally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed\napproach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw\nand retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide\nvariety of image captioning baselines.

Recent years have seen a number of beautiful\nexperiments in radiation optics, but these experiments usually give no\ninformation about the Abraham term as this term simply fluctuates out. So one\nis left with somewhat indirect verifications of this force, as in the radiation\npressure of Jones {et al.} in the 1950's, testing the radiation pressure on a\nmirror immersed in a dielectric liquid. Now, there is a different way to test\nthe existence of ${\\bf f}^{ \\rm Aterm}$, namely to work with low\n(quasi-stationary) frequencies enabling one to observe the sinusoidal variation\nof the force directly. These kind of experiments were actually done by Walker\n{\\it et al.} in 1he 1970's, using BaTiO$_3$ as a high-frequency dielectric\n(permittivity $\\varepsilon \\sim 3600$). Now, in recent years there have\nappeared dielectric materials with giant permittivities, of order $10^5$ or\neven higher. It is therefore natural to consider the idea of Walker {\\it et\nal.} anew, in order to test if this demanding experiment can be facilitated and\ngive better accuracy. That is the main topic of the present paper. The positive\noutcome of these kinds of experiments clearly supports the Abraham\nenergy-momentum tensor at low frequencies. The Minkowski tensor is unable to\npredict a torque at all.

Here, we examine the provenances of 'leftover' planetesimals\npresent in the inner disk in the late stages of accretion simulations.\nDynamically excited planet formation produces planets and embryos with similar\nprovenances, suggesting that the Moon-forming impactor may have had a stable\nisotope composition very similar to the proto-Earth. Commonly, some\nplanetesimal-sized bodies with similar provenances to the Earth-like planets\nare left at the end of the main stage of growth. The most chemically-similar\nplanetesimals are typically fragments of proto-planets ejected millions of\nyears earlier. If these similar-provenance bodies are later accreted by the\nplanet, they will represent late-accreted mass that naturally matches Earth's\ncomposition. The planetesimal-sized bodies that exist during the giant impact\nphase can have large core mass fractions, with core provenances similar to the\nproto-Earth. These bodies are an important potential source for highly\nsiderophile elements.

Since most recordings\nof singing voice are not annotated with voice level we propose a means to\nestimate the voice level from the signal's timbre using a neural voice level\nestimator. We introduce the recording factor that relates the voice level to\nthe recorded signal power as a proportionality constant. This unknown constant\ndepends on the recording conditions and the post-processing and may thus be\ndifferent for each recording (but is constant across each recording). We\nprovide two approaches to estimate the voice level without knowing the\nrecording factor. The unknown recording factor can either be learned alongside\nthe weights of the voice level estimator, or a special loss function based on\nthe scalar product can be used to only match the contour of the recorded\nsignal's power. The voice level models are used to condition a previously\nintroduced bottleneck auto-encoder that disentangles its input, the\nmel-spectrogram, from the voice level. We evaluate the voice level models on\nrecordings annotated with musical dynamic and by their ability to provide\nuseful information to the auto-encoder. A perceptive test is carried out that\nevaluates the perceived change in voice level in transformed recordings and the\nsynthesis quality. The perceptive test confirms that changing the conditional\ninput changes the perceived voice level accordingly thus suggesting that the\nproposed voice level models encode information about the true voice level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 11:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 14:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Many works have noticed that MLNs, like\nmany other relational models, do not admit consistent marginal inference over\nvarying domain sizes. Furthermore, MLNs learnt on a certain domain do not\ngeneralize to new domains of varied sizes. In recent works, connections have\nemerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and learning from\nsub-sampled domains. The central idea to these works is the notion of\nprojectivity. The probability distributions ascribed by projective models\nrender the marginal probabilities of sub-structures independent of the domain\ncardinality. Hence, projective models admit efficient marginal inference,\nremoving any dependence on the domain size. Furthermore, projective models\npotentially allow efficient and consistent parameter learning from sub-sampled\ndomains. In this paper, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a two-variable MLN to be projective. We then isolate a special model in\nthis class of MLNs, namely Relational Block Model (RBM).

Accurate detections of frequent small-scale extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV) brightenings are essential to the investigation of the physical processes\nheating the corona. Aims.

We applied\na method based on Zernike moments and a support vector machine classifier to\nautomatically identify and track campfires observed by Solar Orbiter/Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager (EUI) and SDO/AIA. Results. This method detected 8678\ncampfires (with length scales between 400 km and 4000 km) from a sequence of 50\nHigh Resolution EUV telescope (HRIEUV) 174{\\AA} images. From 21 near\nco-temporal AIA images covering the same field of view as EUI, we found 1131\ncampfires, 58% of which were also detected in HRIEUV images.

Here, we investigate how different CDR options - AR, BECCS,\nand DACCS - might be deployed to meet the Paris Agreement's CDR objectives. We\nfind that international cooperation in climate mitigation policy is key for\ndeploying the most cost-efficient CDR pathway - comprised of BECCS, mainly\n(74%), and AR (26%) -, allowing to take the most advantage of regional\nbio-geophysical resources and socio-economic factors, and time variations, and\ntherefore minimising costs. Importantly, with international cooperation, the\nspatio-temporal evolution of the CDR pathway differs greatly from the\nsocio-economically fair regional allocation of the Paris Agreement's CDR\nobjectives. With limited, or no international cooperation, we find that the\nlikelihood of delivering these CDR objectives decreases, as deploying CDR\npathways becomes significantly more challenging and costly - particularly when\nleading to the deployment of DACCS. Moreover, we show that developing\ninternational cooperation policy instruments - such as an international market\nfor negative emissions trading - can deliver, simultaneously, cost-efficient\nand equitable CDR at the Paris Agreement's scale, by incentivising\nparticipating nations to meet their share of the Paris Agreement's CDR\nobjectives, whilst making up for the uneven distribution of CDR potentials\nacross the world. Crucially, we conclude that international cooperation is\nimperative, as soon as possible, to preserve the feasibility and sustainability\nof future CDR pathways, and ensure that future generations do not bear the\nburden, increasingly costlier, of climate mitigation inaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 12:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Generally, it has been\nclaimed that change is so pervasive in systems that it almost defeats\ndescription and analysis. In this article, we analyze change using the\nconceptual modeling technique called a thinging machine (TM), which reflects\nchange in terms of the actions of creating, processing, releasing,\ntransferring, and receiving things. We illustrated change in TM modeling with\nan example of a system s reconfiguration of business product handling designed\nusing business process modeling notation (BPMN). Then we analyze the notion of\nchange and compare its various definitions in philosophy. Specifically, we\nexamine Zeno s paradox that involves how to account for change and continuity\ntogether in moving things. The problem is that we cannot assert that an arrow\nis actually moving when it has been shot from a bow because the arrow needs to\nbe at a certain place at each point in time, which by definition cannot contain\nany duration at all. In our analysis of this problem, we convert the arrow\ntrajectory into space units called thimacs. In the TM generic actions, two\ntypes of change are identified: state and progression (PROCESS) changes.\nTherefore, when an arrow flows to a TM machine that represents a trajectory\nspace unit, it is rejected, causing it to bounce away to the outside. That is,\nthe arrow is transferred, arrives, and is transferred back; therefore, the\narrow is never accepted into a thimac in the trajectory at any moment. The\nresult of such analysis seems to introduce a logical explanation for the notion\nof movement discussed in Zeno s puzzles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 12:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Unfortunately, PT energy barriers are difficult to\naccurately predict using density functional theory (DFT); in particular, the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) tends to underestimate PT barriers.\nMoreover, PT typically occurs in environments where dispersion forces\ncontribute to the cohesion of the system; thus, a suitable exchange-correlation\nfunctional should accurately describe both dispersion forces and PT barriers.\nThis paper provides benchmark results for the PT barriers of several density\nfunctionals including several variants of the van der Waals density functional\n(vdWDF). The benchmark set comprises small organic molecules with inter- and\nintra-molecular PT. The results show that replacing GGA correlation with a\nfully non-local vdW-DF correlation increases the PT barriers, making it closer\nto the quantum chemical reference values. In contrast, including nonlocal\ncorrelations with the Vydrov-Voorhis (VV) method or dispersion-corrections at\nthe DFT-D3 or the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) level has barely any impact on the\nPT barriers. Hybrid functionals also increase and improve the energies and the\nbest performance is provided by a hybrid version of the consistent-exchange van\nder Waals density functional vdW-DF-cx. For the formic acid dimer PT system, we\nanalyzed the GGA exchange and non-local correlation contributions. The analysis\nshows that the repulsive part of the non-local correlation kernel plays a key\nrole in the PT energy barriers predicted with vdW-DF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 12:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Many tracking and reidentification methods have been proposed in the\ncontext of video surveillance. They show very convincing results when tested on\npublic datasets such as the MOT challenge. However, the performance of these\nmethods are not as satisfactory when applied to player tracking. Indeed, in\naddition to moving very quickly and often being occluded, the players wear the\nsame jersey, which makes the task of reidentification very complex. Some recent\ntracking methods have been developed more specifically for the team sport\ncontext. Due to the lack of public data, these methods use private datasets\nthat make impossible a comparison with them. In this paper, we propose a new\ngeneric method to track team sport players during a full game thanks to few\nhuman annotations collected via a semi-interactive system. Non-ambiguous\ntracklets and their appearance features are automatically generated with a\ndetection and a reidentification network both pre-trained on public datasets.\nThen an incremental learning mechanism trains a Transformer to classify\nidentities using few game-specific human annotations. Finally, tracklets are\nlinked by an association algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our\napproach on a challenging rugby sevens dataset. To overcome the lack of public\nsports tracking dataset, we publicly release this dataset at\nhttps://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/free-resources/.

This scheme is simple because the gate implementation\nrequires only \\textit{one step} of operation. In addition, this scheme is quite\ngeneral because the two logic states of each photonic qubit can be encoded with\na vacuum state and an arbitrary non-vacuum state (e.g., a Fock state, a\nsuperposition of Fock states, a cat state, or a coherent state, etc.) which is\northogonal or quasi-orthogonal to the vacuum state.

Since energy management is hardly to\nbe implemented offline without knowing statistical information of random\nvariables, this paper presents a systematic online energy cost minimization\nframework to fulfill the complementary utilization of multi-energy with\ntime-varying generation, demand and price. Specifically to achieve\ncharging/discharging constraints due to storage and short-term energy\nbalancing, a fast distributed algorithm based on stochastic gradient with\ntwo-timescale implementation is proposed to ensure online implementation. To\nreduce the peak loads, an incentive mechanism is implemented by estimating\nusers' willingness to shift.

The standard\napproach of particle tracking consists of two steps: first reconstructing\nstatically the source locations in each time step, and second applying tracking\ntechniques to obtain the trajectories and velocities. In contrast, the dynamic\nreconstruction seeks to simultaneously recover the source locations and\nvelocities from all frames, which enjoys certain advantages. In this paper, we\nprovide a rigorous mathematical analysis for the resolution limit of\nreconstructing source number, locations, and velocities by general dynamical\nreconstruction in particle tracking problems, by which we demonstrate the\npossibility of achieving super-resolution for the dynamic reconstruction. We\nshow that when the location-velocity pairs of the particles are separated\nbeyond certain distances (the resolution limits), the number of particles and\nthe location-velocity pair can be stably recovered. The resolution limits are\nrelated to the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, signal-to-noise ratio,\nand the sparsity of the source. By these estimates, we also derive a stability\nresult for a sparsity-promoting dynamic reconstruction. In addition, we further\nshow that the reconstruction of velocities has a better resolution limit which\nimproves constantly as the particles moving. This result is derived by an\nobservation that the inherent cut-off frequency for the velocity recovery can\nbe viewed as the total observation time multiplies the cut-off frequency of the\nimaging system, which may lead to a better resolution limit as compared to the\none for each diffraction-limited frame. It is anticipated that this observation\ncan inspire new reconstruction algorithms that improve the resolution of\nparticle tracking in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 14:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

The paper introduces an extension to the well-known\nLSHADE algorithm in the form of a pre-screening mechanism (psLSHADE). The\nproposed pre-screening relies on the three following components: a specific\ninitial sampling procedure, an archive of samples, and a global linear\nmeta-model of a fitness function that consists of 6 independent transformations\nof variables. The pre-screening mechanism preliminary assesses the trial\nvectors and designates the best one of them for further evaluation with the\nfitness function. The performance of psLSHADE is evaluated using the CEC2021\nbenchmark in an expensive scenario with an optimization budget of 10^2-10^4\nFFEs per dimension. We compare psLSHADE with the baseline LSHADE method and the\nMadDE algorithm. The results indicate that with restricted optimization budgets\npsLSHADE visibly outperforms both competitive algorithms.

The\nsecond one, known as 4-dimensional-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, can be seen as\na compactification of higher-dimensional Lovelock theories and admits an exact\nblack hole solution. We study both axial and polar perturbations about these\nsolutions and write their equations of motion as a first-order (radial) system\nof differential equations, which enables us to study the asymptotic behaviours\nof the perturbations at infinity and at the horizon following an algorithm we\ndeveloped recently. For the axial perturbations, we also obtain effective\nSchr\\\"odinger-like equations with explicit expressions for the potentials and\nthe propagation speeds. We see that while the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet\nsolution has well-behaved perturbations, the solution of the\n4-dimensional-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory exhibits unusual asymptotic\nbehaviour of its perturbations near its horizon and at infinity, which makes\nthe definition of ingoing and outgoing modes impossible.

Due to the lack of anomalous samples in training,\nvideo anomaly detection becomes a very challenging task. Existing methods\nalmost follow a reconstruction or future frame prediction mode.

Anomalies only occur\nin the moving foreground of surveillance videos, so the semantics expressed by\nvideo frame sequences and optical flow without background information in\nanomaly detection should be highly consistent and significant for anomaly\ndetection.

It is worth noting that both\nself-supervised learning and multi-source domain adaptation share a similar\ngoal: they both aim to leverage unlabeled data to learn more expressive\nrepresentations. Unfortunately, traditional multi-task self-supervised learning\nfaces two challenges: (1) the pretext task may not strongly relate to the\ndownstream task, thus it could be difficult to learn useful knowledge being\nshared from the pretext task to the target task; (2) when the same feature\nextractor is shared between the pretext task and the downstream one and only\ndifferent prediction heads are used, it is ineffective to enable inter-task\ninformation exchange and knowledge sharing.

This chapter systematically reviews the related\napplications of smart cities that use mobile crowdsourcing for data\nacquisition. For this purpose, the applications are classified as\nenvironmental, urban life, and transportation categories and then investigated\nin detail. This survey helps in understanding the current situation of smart\ncities from the viewpoint of crowdsourcing and discusses the future research\ndirections in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 19:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Here we consider a specific discretisation of the\ncontinuum complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics - a discretisation where\nsquared amplitudes and complex phases are rational numbers. The fineness of\nthis discretisation is determined by a finite (prime-number) parameter $p$. As\n$p \\rightarrow \\infty$, unlike standard discretised representations in\ncomputational physics, this model does not tend smoothly to the continuum\nlimit. Instead, the state space of quantum mechanics is a singular limit of the\ndiscretised model at $p=\\infty$. Using number theoretic properties of\ntrigonometric functions, it is shown that for large enough values of $p$,\ndiscretised Hilbert space accurately describes ensemble representations of\nquantum systems within an inherently superdeterministic framework, one where\nthe Statistical Independence assumption in Bell's theorem is formally violated.\nIn this sense, the discretised model can explain the violation of Bell\ninequalities without appealing to nonlocality or indefinite reality. It is\nshown that this discretised framework is not fine tuned (and hence not\nconspiratorial) with respect to its natural state-space $p$-adic metric. As\ndescribed by Michael Berry, old theories of physics are typically the singular\nlimits of new theories as a parameter of the new theory is set equal to zero or\ninfinity. Using this, we can answer the challenge posed by Scott Aaronson,\ncritic of superderminism: to explain when a great theory in physics (here\nquantum mechanics) has ever been `grudgingly accommodated' rather than\n`gloriously explained' by its candidate successor theory (here a\nsuperdeterministic theory of quantum physics based on discretised Hilbert\nspace).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 07:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

One of the most common approach to student assessment is\nKnowledge Tracing (KT), which evaluates a student's knowledge state by\npredicting whether the student will answer a given question correctly or not.\nHowever, in the context of multiple choice (polytomous) questions, conventional\nKT approaches are limited in that they only consider the binary (dichotomous)\ncorrectness label (i.e., correct or incorrect), and disregard the specific\noption chosen by the student. Meanwhile, Option Tracing (OT) attempts to model\na student by predicting which option they will choose for a given question, but\noverlooks the correctness information. In this paper, we propose\nDichotomous-Polytomous Multi-Task Learning (DP-MTL), a multi-task learning\nframework that combines KT and OT for more precise student assessment. In\nparticular, we show that the KT objective acts as a regularization term for OT\nin the DP-MTL framework, and propose an appropriate architecture for applying\nour method on top of existing deep learning-based KT models. We experimentally\nconfirm that DP-MTL significantly improves both KT and OT performances, and\nalso benefits downstream tasks such as Score Prediction (SP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 06:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}
