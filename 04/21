Using density functional\ntheory we investigate electronic and optical properties of those structures.\nTheir moderate band gap and an good absorption coefficient makes them excellent\nfor absorbers in wide spectrum, covering all from part of IR to far UV\nspectrum, with particularly good absorption of UV light. The hBN layer which\ncan be beneficial for protection of sensitive GaTe and InTe does not only\npreserve their optical properties but also enhances it. Moreover, we confirm\nthat type of stacking does not affect any relevant properties, as all three\nstacking types are very similar in total energy and bandstructure is almost the\nsame for every one. This is especially important for easier experimental\nrealization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 17:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-13"}

However, GDRO\nrequires group labels for every example during training and can be prone to\noverfitting, often requiring careful model capacity control via regularization\nor early stopping. When only a limited amount of group labels is available,\nJust Train Twice (Liu et al., 2021, JTT) is a popular approach which infers a\npseudo-group-label for every unlabeled example. The process of inferring pseudo\nlabels can be highly sensitive during model selection. To alleviate overfitting\nfor GDRO and the pseudo labeling process for JTT, we propose a new method via\nclassifier retraining on independent splits (of the training data). We find\nthat using a novel sample splitting procedure achieves robust worst-group\nperformance in the fine-tuning step. When evaluated on benchmark image and text\nclassification tasks, our approach consistently reduces the requirement of\ngroup labels and hyperparameter search during training. Experimental results\nconfirm that our approach performs favorably compared with existing methods\n(including GDRO and JTT) when either group labels are available during training\nor are only available during validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 16:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 04:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-03"}

One of these methodologies is the quantum theory of AIM\n(QTAIM), which retrieves AIM by an exhaustive partitioning of the one-electron\ndensity into atomic basins in real space. The molecular properties are then\npartitioned into the basin and inter-basin contributions as the incarnation of\nthe AIM properties and their interaction modes. The inputs of the QTAIM\npartitioning scheme are the electronic WF computed from the electronic\nSchrodinger equation (SE), which is basically a single-component equation\ntreating electrons as quantum particles and the nuclei as clamped point charges\n(CPC). A recently extended form of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM\n(MC-QTAIM), removes this restriction and enables AIM partitioning to be applied\nto the MC quantum systems. This is done using MC-WF as inputs that are derived\nfrom the MC-SE in which there are two or more types of quantum particles. This\nopens the possibility for the AIM partitioning of molecular systems where\ncertain nuclei, e.g. because of their non-adiabatic coupling to electrons, must\nbe treated as quantum particles instead of CPC. The same formalism allows the\npartitioning of exotic molecular systems in which there are other elementary\nparticles like muons or positrons, in addition to electrons and nuclei. The\napplication of the MC-QTAIM partitioning to such systems reveals that the\npositively charged muon may shape its own atomic basin, i.e. an example of\nexotic AIM, while positron may act as an agent of bonding, i.e. an example of\nexotic bonds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 16:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 05:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 09:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

The Nusselt number is defined on the basis of a heat\ntransfer coefficient which represents the spatially constant macro-scale\ntemperature difference between the fluid and solid during conjugate heat\ntransfer. Its values are determined numerically on a single unit cell of the\narray for Reynolds numbers between 1 and 600. Two combinations of the Prandtl\nnumber and the thermal conductivity ratio are selected, corresponding to air\nand water. It is shown that the Nusselt number correlations from the literature\nmainly apply to air in the transitional flow regime in larger conventional\nchannels if the wall temperature remains uniform. As a result, they do not\ncorrectly capture the observed trends for the Nusselt number in micro- and\nmini-channels subject to a constant heat flux. Therefore, new Nusselt number\ncorrelations, obtained through a least-squares fitting of 2282 numerical\nsimulations, are presented for air and water. The suitability of these\ncorrelations is assessed via the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and\nmodel validation. The correlations respect the observed asymptotic trends and\nlimits of the Nusselt number for all the geometrical parameters of the offset\nstrip fins. In addition, they predict a linear dependence of the Nusselt number\non the Reynolds number, in good agreement with the data from this work.\nNevertheless, a detailed analysis reveals a more complex scaling of the Nusselt\nnumber with the Reynolds number, closely related to the underlying flow\nregimes, particularly the weak and strong inertia regimes. Finally, through 62\nadditional simulations, the influence of the material properties on the Nusselt\nnumber is illustrated and compared to the available literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 16:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 09:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The method is\ninspired by the recent development in the mathematical treatment of distributed\ndelays and predictor controllers, which are critical for the derivation of the\nsolution. An important conceptual innovation is the use of a parameterized\ndynamical state feedback controller (DSFC), where the dimension of the\ncontroller equals the dimension of the control input. A sufficient condition\nfor the existence of a dissipative DSFC is obtained via the Krasovskii\nfunctional approach, where the condition includes a bilinear matrix inequality\n(BMI). To solve the BMI, we apply an inner convex approximation algorithm which\ncan be initialized based on an explicit construction of a predictor controller\ngain.

With this in mind, policy-makers in cities worldwide seek to\nimprove the bicycle mode-share. However, they often struggle against the fear\nand the perceived riskiness of cycling. Efforts to increase the bicycle's\nmode-share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling\nsafety. This requires the analysis of the factors surrounding accidents and the\noutcome. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate\nbicycle flow data that is generally sparse or not even available at a segment\nlevel. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or\ncalibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic\ncaused by external factors. This paper fills this gap by presenting a Deep\nLearning based approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network\n(LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on\nweather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. This method\naddresses the shortcomings in the calibration factor method and results in\n66-77\\% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates.

Two major open research questions in the field of\nIML are: \"How should we design systems that can learn to make better decisions\nover time with human interaction?\" and \"How should we evaluate the design and\ndeployment of such systems?\" A lack of appropriate consideration for the humans\ninvolved can lead to problematic system behaviour, and issues of fairness,\naccountability, and transparency.

Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor for technical problems that are\nnot visible to users and customers but hinder developers in their work, making\nfuture changes more difficult. TD is often incurred due to tight project\ndeadlines and can make future changes more costly or impossible. Project\nManagement usually focuses on customer benefits and pays less attention to\ntheir IT systems' internal quality. TD prevention should be preferred over TD\nrepayment because subsequent refactoring and re-engineering are expensive.\nObjective. This paper evaluates a framework focusing on both TD prevention and\nTD repayment in the context of agile-managed projects. The framework was\ndeveloped and applied in an IT unit of a publishing house. The unique\ncontribution of this framework is the integration of TD management into project\nmanagement. Method. The evaluation was performed as a comparative case study\nbased on ticket statistics and two structured surveys. The surveys were\nconducted in the observed IT unit using the framework and a comparison unit not\nusing the framework. The first survey targeted team members, the second one IT\nmanagers. Results. The evaluation shows that in this IT unit, the TAP framework\nled to a raised awareness for the incurrence of TD. Decisions to incur TD are\nintentional, and TD is repaid timelier. Unintentional TD incurred by\nunconscious decisions is prevented. Furthermore, better communication and\nbetter planning of the project pipeline can be observed. Conclusions. We\nprovide an insight into practitioners' ways to identify, monitor, prevent and\nrepay TD. The presented framework includes a feasible method for TD prevention\ndespite tight timelines by making TD repayment part of project management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 17:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

This is even more pertinent in the field of\nlevitated optomechanics, where optical trapping fully determines the mechanical\nmodes and their frequencies. Here, using the coherent-scattering (CS) set-up\nthat allowed quantum ground state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle, we show\nthat -- when trapping away from a node of the cavity standing wave -- the CS\nfield opposes optical spring shifts and mechanical mode hybridisation.

The theoretical results are\nconsistent with the strongly non-linear behavior exhibited in the Raman spectra\nof molecular monolayers placed in more than a thousand nanoparticle-on-a-mirror\nconstructs illuminated by microwatt ultrafast laser pulses. Driving this\ncollective phonon in the nanocavity paves the way to control reversible bond\nsoftening, as well as irreversible chemistry.

Some of the\nleading scenarios involve a double detonation in double white dwarf (WD)\nsystems. In these scenarios, helium shell detonation occurs on top of a\ncarbon-oxygen (CO) WD, which then drives the detonation of the CO-core,\nproducing a SN Ia. Extensive studies have been done on the possibility of a\ndouble helium detonation, following a dynamical helium mass-transfer phase onto\na CO-WD. However, 3D self-consistent modeling of the double-WD system, the mass\ntransfer, and the helium shell detonation have been little studied. Here we use\n3D hydrodynamical simulations to explore this case in which a helium detonation\noccurs near the point of Roche lobe overflow of the donor WD and may lead to an\nSN Ia through the dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6)\nmechanism. We find that the helium layer of the accreting primary WD does\nundergo a detonation, while the underlying carbon-oxygen core does not, leading\nto an extremely rapid and faint nova-like transient instead of a luminous SN Ia\nevent. This failed core detonation suggests that D6 SNe Ia may be restricted to\nthe most massive carbon-oxygen primary WDs.

We demonstrate this idea (which does not involve any Wick rotations)\nwith explicit constructions in four and five dimensions. The geometries of\nexpanding bubbles in these dimensions arise as a limit of, respectively, static\nblack hole binaries and black rings. The limit is such that the separation\nbetween the two black holes, or the inner hole of the black ring, becomes very\nsmall, and the horizons of the black holes correspond to acceleration horizons\nof the bubbles. We also explain how a five-dimensional black hole binary gives\nrise to a different type of expanding bubble. We then show that bubble\nspacetimes can host black hole binaries and black rings in static equilibrium,\nwith their gravitational attraction being balanced against the background\nspacetime expansion. Similar constructions are expected in six or more\ndimensions, but most of these solutions can be obtained only numerically.\nFinally, we argue that the Nariai solution can be regarded as containing an\nexpanding circular bubble of nothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 16:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2022 16:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

This has been attributed to a variety of\nmethodological differences between studies, including their approach to\nradiative transfer and thermal balance, the choice of irradiating spectrum\nemployed, and the processes available to cool the gas. We use the\n\\textsc{mocassin} radiative transfer code to simulate wind heating for a\nvariety of spectra on a static density grid taken from simulations of an\nEUV-driven wind. We explore the impact of choosing a single representative\nX-ray frequency on their ability to drive a wind by measuring the maximum\nheated column as a function of photon energy. We demonstrate that for\nreasonable luminosities and spectra, the most effective energies are at a few\n$100~\\mathrm{eV}$, firmly in the softer regions of the X-ray spectrum, while\nX-rays with energies $\\sim1000~\\mathrm{eV}$ interact too weakly with disc gas\nto provide sufficient heating to drive a wind. We develop a simple model to\nexplain these findings. We argue that further increases in the cooling above\nour models - for example due to molecular rovibrational lines - may further\nrestrict the heating to the softer energies but are unlikely to prevent X-ray\nheated winds from launching entirely; increasing the X-ray luminosity has the\nopposite effect.

For generations, this question has\noccupied a central place in the philosophy of science, stimulating heated\ndebates, but yielding no clear consensus. Many proposed explanations can be\nunderstood in terms of whether and how they view the expansion of knowledge as\nproceeding through the accretion of scientific concepts into larger conceptual\nstructures. Here, we examine these views empirically, performing a large-scale\nanalysis of the physical and social sciences, spanning five decades. Using\ntechniques from natural language processing, we create semantic networks of\nconcepts, wherein single- and multi-word noun phrases become linked when they\nare used in the same paper abstract. For both the physical and social sciences,\nwe observe increasingly rigid conceptual cores (i.e., densely connected sets of\nhighly central nodes) accompanied by the proliferation of periphery concepts\n(i.e., sparsely connected nodes that are highly connected to the core). In the\nphysical sciences, these changes coincide with an increasing number of cores,\nwhile in the social sciences, the number of cores is decreasing. In subsequent\nanalyses, we examine the relationship between conceptual structure and the\ngrowth of scientific knowledge, finding that scientific works are more\ninnovative in fields with cores that have higher conceptual churn, with larger\ncores, and an overall smaller number of cores, the latter of which is also\nassociated with more scientific consensus. Overall, our findings suggest that\nwhile the organization of scientific concepts is important for the growth of\nknowledge, the mechanisms vary across fields and time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 19:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 16:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}

While simple\ndomain-specific graphical languages and libraries can empower a variety of\nusers to create application behaviors and logic, using these languages to\nproduce and maintain a set of heterogeneous client applications is a challenge.\nPrimarily because each client typically requires the developers to both\nunderstand and embed the domain-specific logic.

Van der Waals\nheterostructures composed of atomically thin layers of transition-metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) give an opportunity to realize excitons with high\nbinding energies and provide a materials platform for the realization of both\nexcitonic quantum phenomena and excitonic devices. Propagation of IXs in TMD\nheterostructures is intensively studied.

The sum\nof the spin Hall angles for both the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin\nanomalous Hall effect (SAHE) symmetries are: $\\theta_{DL}^{SAHE} +\n\\theta_{DL}^{SHE}=-0.15 \\pm 0.05$ and $\\theta_{FL}^{SAHE} +\n\\theta_{FL}^{SHE}=0.026 \\pm 0.005$. From the symmetry of ST-FMR signals we find\nthat $\\theta_{DL}^{SHE}$ is positive and dominated by the negative\n$\\theta_{DL}^{SAHE}$.

Then, Energy of Gradient\n(EOG) and Standard Deviation functions are used as the focus measurement on the\ngradient images to form a fused image.

However, this work is interested in achieving\nthe registration without building any explicit correspondence between both\npoint sets, following a probabilistic framework.\n  The most critical task in point set registration is how to elaborate the cost\nfunction, which measures the distance between both point sets. The\nprobabilistic framework includes two possible ways to build the cost function:\nThe summing and the likelihood.

Most\nroadside LiDAR object detection methods filter out foreground points by\ncomparing new data points to pre-trained background references based on\ndescriptive statistics over many frames (e.g., voxel density, number of\nneighbors, maximum distance). However, these solutions are inefficient under\nheavy traffic, and parameter values are hard to transfer from one scenario to\nanother.

In these graphene\nmultilayers, the acoustic phonons can realize, through electron-phonon\ncoupling, both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings, and the intra-sublattice\npairings ($s$-wave spin-singlet and $f$-wave spin-triplet) are the dominant\nchannels. Our theory naturally explains the distinct recent experimental\nfindings in Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral trilayer graphene, and we\nfurther predict existence of superconductivity in ABCA tetralayer graphene\narising from electron-phonon interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that\nthe acoustic-phonon-mediated superconductivity prevails over a wide range of\ndoping in rhombohedral trilayer graphene and ABCA tetralayer graphene while\nsuperconductivity exists only in a narrow range of doping near the Van Hove\nsingularity in Bernal bilayer graphene. Key features of our theory are the\ninclusion of realistic band structures with the appropriate Van Hove\nsingularities and Coulomb repulsion effects (the so-called \"$\\mu^*$ effect\")\nopposing the phonon-induced superconducting pairing. We also discuss how\nintervalley scatterings can suppress the spin-triplet spin-polarized\nsuperconductivity. Our work provides detailed prediction based on\nelectron-acoustic-phonon-interaction-induced graphene superconductivity, which\nshould be investigated in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 23:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2022 14:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

In response, Maccarone et al. 2022 (TM22\nhereafter) argued, primarily on the claim that neutron star low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (NS-LMXBs) often do not have short outburst recurrence times (<~ 10\nyr), that they cannot be excluded as a designation for the 12 quiescent X-ray\nbinary sources.

Thus TCAM included in\nmodern chips is limited and can support moderately large datasets in data\ncenters and enterprises, but fails to scale to backbone WAN databases of\nmillions of prefixes. IPv6 deployment also makes it harder to deploy TCAMs\nbecause of the larger prefixes used in the 128-bit address space. While the\ncombination of algorithmic techniques and TCAM has been proposed before for\nreducing power consumption or update costs(e.g., CoolCAM [32] and TreeCAM\n[28]), we focus on reducing TCAM bits using a scheme we call MashUp that can\neasily be implemented in modern reconfigurable pipeline chips such as Tofino-3.\nMashUp uses a new technique, tiling trees, which takes into account TCAM grain\n(tile) sizes. When applied to a publicly available IPv6 dataset using Tofino-3\nTCAM grain sizes (44 by 512), there was a 2X reduction in TCAM required.\nFurther, if we mix TCAM and SRAM using a new technique we call node\nhybridization, MashUp decreases TCAM bits by 4.5X for IPv6, and by 7.5X for\nIPv4, allowing wide area databases of 900,000 prefixes to be supported by\nTofino-3 and similar chips\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 23:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

The primary contribution of this paper is a new PaLS\nformulation which requires only a single level set function to recover a scene\nwith piecewise constant objects possessing multiple unknown contrasts. Our\nmodel offers distinct advantages over current approaches to the multi-contrast,\nmulti-object problem, all of which require multiple level sets and explicit\nestimation of the contrast magnitudes. Given upper and lower bounds on the\ncontrast, our approach is able to recover objects with any distribution of\ncontrasts and eliminates the need to know either the number of contrasts in a\ngiven scene or their values. We provide an iterative process for finding these\nspace-varying contrast limits. Relative to most PaLS methods which employ\nradial basis functions (RBFs), our model makes use of non-isotropic basis\nfunctions, thereby expanding the class of shapes that a PaLS model of a given\ncomplexity can approximate. Finally, PaLEnTIR improves the conditioning of the\nJacobian matrix required as part of the parameter identification process and\nconsequently accelerates the optimization methods by controlling the magnitude\nof the PaLS expansion coefficients, fixing the centers of the basis functions,\nand the uniqueness of parametric to image mappings provided by the new\nparameterization.

This fact, along\nwith growing dataset volumes of the modern era, make the issue of\ncomputationally-efficient analysis with missing data of crucial practical\nimportance. A general computationally-efficient estimation framework for\ndealing with missing data is the pseudo-expected estimating equations (PEEE)\napproach. The method is applicable with any parametric model for which\nestimation involves the solution of a set of estimating equations, such as\nlikelihood score equations. A key limitation of the PEEE approach is that there\nis currently no closed-form variance estimator, and variance estimation\nrequires the computationally burdensome bootstrap method. In this work, we\naddress the gap and provide a closed-form variance estimator whose computation\ncan be significantly faster than a bootstrap approach. Our variance estimator\nis shown to be consistent even with auxiliary variables and under misspecified\nmodels for the incomplete variables. Simulation studies show that our variance\nestimator performs well and that its computation can be over 50 times faster\nthan the bootstrap. The computational efficiency gain from our proposed\nvariance estimator is crucial with large datasets or when the main analysis\nmethod is computationally intensive.

Specifically, to fully exploit\nskeleton features within each skeleton sequence, we first devise a masked\nprototype contrastive learning (MPC) scheme to cluster the most typical\nskeleton features (skeleton prototypes) from different subsequences randomly\nmasked from raw sequences, and contrast the inherent similarity between\nskeleton features and different prototypes to learn discriminative skeleton\nrepresentations without using any label.

In this problem, the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ \"experts\"\nwho make predictions on each day. The goal on each day is to process these\npredictions, and make a prediction with the minimum cost. After making a\nprediction, the algorithm sees the actual outcome on that day, updates its\nstate, and then moves on to the next day. An algorithm is judged by how well it\ndoes compared to the best expert in the set.\n  The classical algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights\nalgorithm. However, every application, to our knowledge, relies on storing\nweights for every expert, and uses $\\Omega(n)$ memory. There is little work on\nunderstanding the memory required to solve the online learning with expert\nadvice problem, or run standard sequential prediction algorithms, in natural\nstreaming models, which is especially important when the number of experts, as\nwell as the number of days on which the experts make predictions, is large.\n  We initiate the study of the learning with expert advice problem in the\nstreaming setting, and show lower and upper bounds. Our lower bound for i.i.d.,\nrandom order, and adversarial order streams uses a reduction to a custom-built\nproblem using a novel masking technique, to show a smooth trade-off for regret\nversus memory. Our upper bounds show novel ways to run standard sequential\nprediction algorithms in rounds on small \"pools\" of experts, thus reducing the\nnecessary memory. For random-order streams, we show that our upper bound is\ntight up to low order terms. We hope that these results and techniques will\nhave broad applications in online learning, and can inspire algorithms based on\nstandard sequential prediction techniques, like multiplicative weights, for a\nwide range of other problems in the memory-constrained setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 01:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

In principle, the\nstrong SOT in heavy metal-based magnetic heterostructure is attributed to the\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced spin Hall effect (SHE) and/or the spin\nRashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Recently, SOC-free mechanisms such as the\norbital angular momentum (OAM)-induced orbital Hall effect (OHE) and/or the\norbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) have been proposed to generate sizable\ntorques comparable to those from the conventional spin Hall mechanism. In this\nwork, we show that the orbital current can be effectively generated by the\nnitrided light metal Cu. The overall damping-like SOT efficiency, which\nconsists of both the spin and the orbital current contributions, can be\ntailored from ~ 0.06 to 0.4 in a Pt/Co/CuNx magnetic heterostructure by tuning\nthe nitrogen doping concentration. Current-induced magnetization switching\nfurther verifies the efficacy of such orbital current with a critical switching\ncurrent density as low as Jc ~ 5 x 10^10 A/m2. Most importantly, the\norbital-current-mediated memristive switching behavior can be observed in such\nheterostructures, which reveals that the gigantic SOT and efficient\nmagnetization switching are the tradeoffs for the applicable window of\nmemristive switching.

There is a clear need for companies and regulators to\nmanage the risk from proposed ML systems before they harm people. To achieve\nthis, private and public sector actors first need to identify the risks posed\nby a proposed ML system. A system's overall risk is influenced by its direct\nand indirect effects. However, existing frameworks for ML risk/impact\nassessment often address an abstract notion of risk or do not concretize this\ndependence.\n  We propose to address this gap with a context-sensitive framework for\nidentifying ML system risks comprising two components: a taxonomy of the first-\nand second-order risks posed by ML systems, and their contributing factors.\nFirst-order risks stem from aspects of the ML system, while second-order risks\nstem from the consequences of first-order risks. These consequences are system\nfailures that result from design and development choices. We explore how\ndifferent risks may manifest in various types of ML systems, the factors that\naffect each risk, and how first-order risks may lead to second-order effects\nwhen the system interacts with the real world.\n  Throughout the paper, we show how real events and prior research fit into our\nMachine Learning System Risk framework (MLSR).

In doing so, it\nunifies the risks that are commonly discussed in the ethical AI community\n(e.g., ethical/human rights risks) with system-level risks (e.g., application,\ndesign, control risks), paving the way for holistic risk assessments of ML\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 02:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

As a result, the treatments' efficacy is reduced. The recently\nproposed hybrid MR-linac scanner holds the promise to efficiently deal with\nsuch respiratory motion through real-time adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy\n(MRgRT). For MRgRT, motion-fields should be estimated from MR-data and the\nradiotherapy plan should be adapted in real-time according to the estimated\nmotion-fields. All of this should be performed with a total latency of\nmaximally 200 ms, including data acquisition and reconstruction. A measure of\nconfidence in such estimated motion-fields is highly desirable, for instance to\nensure the patient's safety in case of unexpected and undesirable motion.

For the first time, Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO,\nproviding multiple views of CMEs in the heliosphere, observed the vast and\ncrucial observational gap between the Sun and the Earth. Using J-maps\nconstructed from coronagraphs (CORs) and HIs observations, we continuously\ntracked different density enhanced features of CMEs. We implemented several\nreconstruction methods to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of\nCMEs during their evolution from the Sun to Earth. Our study provides evidence\nthat the 3D speeds of CMEs near the Sun are not reasonably sufficient for\nunderstanding the propagation and accurate forecasting of the arrival time at\nthe Earth of a majority of CMEs. This finding can be due to many factors that\nsignificantly change the CME kinematics beyond the COR field of view, such as\nthe interaction/collision of two or more CMEs or the interaction of CMEs with\nthe ambient solar wind medium. We attempted to understand the evolution and\nconsequences of the interacting/colliding CMEs in the heliosphere using\nSTEREO/HI, WIND, and ACE observations. The study found a significant change in\nthe dynamics of the CMEs after their collision and interaction.

This paper presents a self-supervised\napproach to video frame interpolation that requires only a single video. We\npose the video as a set of layers. Each layer is parameterized by two implicit\nneural networks -- one for learning a static frame and the other for a\ntime-varying motion field corresponding to video dynamics. Together they\nrepresent an occlusion-free subset of the scene with a pseudo-depth channel. To\nmodel inter-layer occlusions, all layers are lifted to the 2.5D space so that\nthe frontal layer occludes distant layers. This is done by assigning each layer\na depth channel, which we call `pseudo-depth', whose partial order defines the\nocclusion between layers. The pseudo-depths are converted to visibility values\nthrough a fully differentiable SoftMin function so that closer layers are more\nvisible than layers in a distance. On the other hand, we parameterize the video\nmotions by solving an ordinary differentiable equation (ODE) defined on a\ntime-varying neural velocity field that guarantees valid motions. This implicit\nneural representation learns the video as a space-time continuum, allowing\nframe interpolation at any temporal resolution. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on real-world datasets, where our method achieves\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-arts that require ground truth labels\nfor training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 06:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

To achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off,\nwe propose Cascade Point-Grid Fusion Network (CPGNet), which ensures both\neffectiveness and efficiency mainly by the following two techniques: 1) the\nnovel Point-Grid (PG) fusion block extracts semantic features mainly on the 2D\nprojected grid for efficiency, while summarizes both 2D and 3D features on 3D\npoint for minimal information loss; 2) the proposed transformation consistency\nloss narrows the gap between the single-time model inference and TTA. The\nexperiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the\nCPGNet without ensemble models or TTA is comparable with the state-of-the-art\nRPVNet, while it runs 4.7 times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 06:56:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 03:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2022 07:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

In the\npresent study, we accurately evaluate the orbital, spin-Zeeman, and OZ cross\nterm of the Kane-Mele model using a recently developed formulation. This\nformula is written in terms of the explicit Bloch wave functions, and enables\nus to evaluate each contribution taking account of the integration over the\nwhole Brillouin zone and the summation over all the bands. As a result,\nadditional contributions such as core-electron diamagnetism are found.\nFurthermore, our evaluation confirms the quantization of the OZ cross term and\nreveals its behavior including the metallic case.

This\npaper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality\nspeech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable\nconvolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term\ntime dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also\nadopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation\nquality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer,\nFastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any\nintermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech\nsamples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time\non a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech\nsynthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff\ngeneralized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and\nFastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech\nsynthesis.

This result is known as the first Korovkin theorem. This outstanding\nresult led to a new theory called Korovkin-type Approximation Theory. In 1968,\nO. Shisha and B.

This estimation theorem gives the convergence of a sequence of\npositive linear operators to the identity operator in terms of the convergence\nof the test functions and a quantity called modulus of continuity.

Reduced phases in the impactor (e.g., metallic iron) can reduce\nthe planet's H$_2$O inventory to produce massive atmospheres rich in H$_2$.\nWhilst previous studies have focused on the interactions between the impactor\nand atmosphere in such scenarios, we investigate two further effects, 1) the\ndistribution of the impactor's iron inventory during impact between the target\ninterior, target atmosphere, and escaping the target, and 2) interactions\nbetween the post-impact atmosphere and the impact-generated melt phase. We find\nthat these two effects can potentially counterbalance each other, with the\nmelt-atmosphere interactions acting to restore reducing power to the atmosphere\nthat was initially accreted by the melt phase. For a $\\sim10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\nimpactor, when the iron accreted by the melt phase is fully available to reduce\nthis melt, we find an equilibrium atmosphere with H$_2$ column density\n$\\sim10^4\\,\\mathrm{moles\\,cm^{-2}}$\n($p\\mathrm{H2}\\sim120\\,\\mathrm{bars}\\mathrm{,}~X_\\mathrm{H2}\\sim0.77$),\nconsistent with previous estimates.

For two dimensional input curves that are $c$-packed, we bound\nthe expected running time by $\\widetilde{O}(k^2 c^2 n)$ and the space by $\n\\widetilde{O}(kn + c^2 n)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^d$ the dependency on $n$ instead is\nquadratic. In addition, we present a variant of the algorithm that uses\nimplicit weight updates on the candidate set and thereby achieves near-linear\nrunning time in $n$ without any assumptions on the input curve, while keeping\nthe same approximation bounds. This comes at the expense of a small\n(polylogarithmic) dependency on the relative arclength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 08:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Motifs capture higher order organizational structure of $G$ beyond\nedge relationships, and, therefore, have found wide applications such as in\ngraph clustering, community detection, and analysis of biological and physical\nnetworks to name a few. In these applications, the cut structure of motifs\nplays a crucial role as vertices are partitioned into clusters by cuts whose\nconductance is based on the number of instances of a particular motif, as\nopposed to just the number of edges, crossing the cuts.\n  In this paper, we introduce the concept of a motif cut sparsifier. We show\nthat one can compute in polynomial time a sparse weighted subgraph $G'$ with\nonly $\\widetilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^2)$ edges such that for every cut, the weighted\nnumber of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G'$ is within a $1+\\epsilon$\nfactor of the number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G$, for every\nconstant size motif $M$.\n  Our work carefully combines the viewpoints of both graph sparsification and\nhypergraph sparsification. We sample edges which requires us to extend and\nstrengthen the concept of cut sparsifiers introduced in the seminal work of to\nthe motif setting. We adapt the importance sampling framework through the\nviewpoint of hypergraph sparsification by deriving the edge sampling\nprobabilities from the strong connectivity values of a hypergraph whose\nhyperedges represent motif instances. Finally, an iterative sparsification\nprimitive inspired by both viewpoints is used to reduce the number of edges in\n$G$ to nearly linear.\n  In addition, we present a strong lower bound ruling out a similar result for\nsparsification with respect to induced occurrences of motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 08:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 12:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

To\nresolve this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Domain Invariant\nModel with Graph Convolutional Network (DIM-GCN), which only exploits invariant\ndisease-related features from multiple domains. Specifically, we first propose\na Bayesian network, which explicitly decomposes the latent variables into\ndisease-related and other disease-irrelevant parts that are provable to be\ndisentangled from each other.

To better capture\nthe macroscopic features, we leverage the observed clinical attributes as a\ngoal for reconstruction, via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).

Predicting realistic children's faces may help settle\nmany social problems, such as age-invariant face recognition, kinship\nverification, and missing child identification. It can be regarded as an\nimage-to-image translation task. Existing approaches usually assume domain\ninformation in the image-to-image translation can be interpreted by \"style\",\ni.e., the separation of image content and style. However, such separation is\nimproper for the child face prediction, because the facial contours between\nchildren and parents are not the same. To address this issue, we propose a new\ndisentangled learning strategy for children's face prediction. We assume that\nchildren's faces are determined by genetic factors (compact family features,\ne.g., face contour), external factors (facial attributes irrelevant to\nprediction, such as moustaches and glasses), and variety factors (individual\nproperties for each child). On this basis, we formulate predictions as a\nmapping from parents' genetic factors to children's genetic factors, and\ndisentangle them from external and variety factors. In order to obtain accurate\ngenetic factors and perform the mapping, we propose a ChildPredictor framework.\nIt transfers human faces to genetic factors by encoders and back by generators.\nThen, it learns the relationship between the genetic factors of parents and\nchildren through a mapping function. To ensure the generated faces are\nrealistic, we collect a large Family Face Database to train ChildPredictor and\nevaluate it on the FF-Database validation set.

The conventional QBM model\ncorresponds to the spacial case $W_k = V_k$. The generalized QBM is more\ncomplicated but the generalization is necessary. This is because the particle\ntransition and the pair production between the system and the environment\nrepresent two very different physical processes, and usually cannot have the\nsame coupling strengths. Thus, the conventional QBM model, which is\nwell-defined at classical level, is hardly realized in real quantum physical\nworld. We discuss the physical realizations of the generalized QBM in different\nphysical systems, and derive its exact master equation for both the initial\ndecoupled states and initial correlated states. The Hu-Paz-Zhang master\nequation of the conventional QBM model is reproduced as a special case.

In this work,\nwe propose a novel Transformer-guided convolutional neural network (TransGCNN)\narchitecture, which couples CNN-based local features with Transformer-based\nglobal representations for enhanced representation learning. Specifically, our\nTransGCNN consists of a CNN backbone extracting feature map from an input image\nand a Transformer head modeling global context from the CNN map. In particular,\nour Transformer head acts as a spatial-aware importance generator to select\nsalient CNN features as the final feature representation. Such a coupling\nprocedure allows us to leverage a lightweight Transformer network to greatly\nenhance the discriminative capability of the embedded features. Furthermore, we\ndesign a dual-branch Transformer head network to combine image features from\nmulti-scale windows in order to improve details of the global feature\nrepresentation.

Probably the\nmost impressive example is bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are\nelectromagnetic modes with a dispersion inside the light cone but infinite\nlifetime, i.e., modes that cannot leak to the continuum. Symmetry-protected\nBICs appear at highly symmetric points in the dispersion of periodic systems.\nAlthough the addition of nonequivalent lattice points in a unit cell is an easy\nand straightforward way of tuning the symmetry, BICs in such particle lattice,\ni.e., non-Bravais lattice, are less explored among periodic systems. Starting\nfrom a periodic square lattice of Si nanodisks, we have prepared three\nnon-Bravais lattices by detuning size and position of the second disk in the\nunit cell. Diffraction-induced coupling excites magnetic/electric dipoles in\neach nanodisk, producing two surface lattice resonances at the $\\Gamma$ point\nwith a band gap in between. %of $\\sim$ 41 meV.\n  The high/low energy branch becomes a BIC for the size/position-detuned array,\nrespectively, while both branches are bright (or leaky) when both size and\nposition are detuned simultaneously. The role of magnetic and electric\nresonances in dielectric nanoparticles and the change of BIC to bright\ncharacter of the modes is explained by the two different origins of BICs in the\ndetuned arrays, which is further discussed with the aid of a coupled electric\nand magnetic dipole model. This study gives a simple way of tuning BICs at\ntelecom wavelengths in non-Bravais lattices, including both plasmonic and\ndielectric systems, thus scalable to a wide range of frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

We propose to feed different data samples\nwith varying quantization schemes to achieve a data-dependent dynamic\ninference, at a fine-grained layer level. However, enabling this adaptive\ninference with changeable layer-wise quantization schemes is challenging\nbecause the combination of bit-widths and layers is growing exponentially,\nmaking it extremely difficult to train a single model in such a vast searching\nspace and use it in practice. To solve this problem, we present the Arbitrary\nBit-width Network (ABN), where the bit-widths of a single deep network can\nchange at runtime for different data samples, with a layer-wise granularity.\nSpecifically, first we build a weight-shared layer-wise quantizable\n\"super-network\" in which each layer can be allocated with multiple bit-widths\nand thus quantized differently on demand. The super-network provides a\nconsiderably large number of combinations of bit-widths and layers, each of\nwhich can be used during inference without retraining or storing myriad models.\nSecond, based on the well-trained super-network, each layer's runtime bit-width\nselection decision is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by\nan adaptive inference strategy accordingly. Experiments show that the\nsuper-network can be built without accuracy degradation, and the bit-widths\nallocation of each layer can be adjusted to deal with various inputs on the\nfly.

This gives rise to the\nappealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of\nfunctionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading\ntechniques for leveraging a \"frozen\" LM -- i.e., leaving its weights untouched\n-- still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights\nin a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness and compromise\nversatility, suggesting a tradeoff between performance and versatility. The\nmain message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as\nprompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for\nleveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains\nwithout sacrificing the underlying model's versatility. To demonstrate this, we\nintroduce three novel methods for leveraging frozen models: input-dependent\nprompt tuning, frozen readers, and recursive LMs, each of which vastly improves\non current frozen-model approaches. Indeed, some of our methods even outperform\nfine-tuning approaches in domains currently dominated by the latter. The\ncomputational cost of each method is higher than that of existing frozen model\nmethods, but still negligible relative to a single pass through a huge frozen\nLM. Each of these methods constitutes a meaningful contribution in its own\nright, but by presenting these contributions together we aim to convince the\nreader of a broader message that goes beyond the details of any given method:\nthat frozen models have untapped potential and that fine-tuning is often\nunnecessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 11:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

It can be shown that given an\narbitrary perfect matching of $G$, it is not always possible to extend it to a\nlist of three or six perfect matchings satisfying the statements of the\nFan--Raspaud and the Berge--Fulkerson conjectures, respectively. In this paper,\nwe show that given any $1^+$-factor $F$ (a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that\nits vertices have degree at least 1) and an arbitrary edge $e$ of $G$, there\nalways exists a perfect matching $M$ of $G$ containing $e$ such that\n$G\\setminus (F\\cup M)$ is bipartite. Our result implies Mazzuoccolo's\nconjecture, but not only. It also implies that given any collection of disjoint\nodd circuits in $G$, there exists a perfect matching of $G$ containing at least\none edge of each circuit in this collection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 11:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 13:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

A density\noperator can be associated with each of them. We here address a third type of\nstates, that we previously introduced in a more restricted framework. These\nstates generalize pure ones by replacing each of their deterministic ket\ncoefficients by a random variable. We therefore call them Random-Coefficient\nPure States, or RCPS. We analyze their properties and their relationships with\nboth types of usual states. We show that RCPS contain much richer information\nthan the density operator and mean of observables that we associate with them.\nThis occurs because the latter operator only exploits the second-order\nstatistics of the random state coefficients, whereas their higher-order\nstatistics contain additional information. That information can be accessed in\npractice with the multiple-preparation procedure that we propose for RCPS, by\nusing second-order and higher-order statistics of associated random\nprobabilities of measurement outcomes.

Third, there is no theoretical analysis on the\neffectiveness of random dropping methods on GNNs. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel random dropping method called DropMessage, which performs dropping\noperations directly on the propagated messages during the message-passing\nprocess. More importantly, we find that DropMessage provides a unified\nframework for most existing random dropping methods, based on which we give\ntheoretical analysis of their effectiveness. Furthermore, we elaborate the\nsuperiority of DropMessage: it stabilizes the training process by reducing\nsample variance; it keeps information diversity from the perspective of\ninformation theory, enabling it become a theoretical upper bound of other\nmethods. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments that aims for\nmultiple tasks on five public datasets and two industrial datasets with various\nbackbone models. The experimental results show that DropMessage has the\nadvantages of both effectiveness and generalization, and can significantly\nalleviate the problems mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 11:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 09:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 15:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In contrast to this, we show that the same problem\nfor forbidden pairs is NP-hard. However, our polynomial-time algorithm for the\ncase of only forced pairs can be extended to a fixed-parameter tractable\nalgorithm with respect to the number of forbidden pairs when both forced and\nforbidden pairs are present.

The purpose of this work is to observationally\ncharacterize the level of ionization of the circumstellar gas at small envelope\nradii and investigate its relation to the efficiency of the coupling between\nthe star-forming gas and the magnetic field in the Class 0 protostar B335. We\nhave obtained molecular line emission maps of B335 with ALMA, which we use to\nmeasure the deuteration fraction of the gas, its ionization fraction, and the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate, at envelope radii $\\lesssim$1000 au.

In this work, we argue that this\nmassive performance difference is caused by a distribution shift, i.e., a\nfundamental mismatch between the real bug distribution and the synthetic bug\ndistribution used to train and evaluate the detectors. To address this key\nchallenge, we propose to train a bug detector in two phases, first on a\nsynthetic bug distribution to adapt the model to the bug detection domain, and\nthen on a real bug distribution to drive the model towards the real\ndistribution. During these two phases, we leverage a multi-task hierarchy,\nfocal loss, and contrastive learning to further boost performance. We evaluate\nour approach extensively on three widely studied bug types, for which we\nconstruct new datasets carefully designed to capture the real bug distribution.\nThe results demonstrate that our approach is practically effective and\nsuccessfully mitigates the distribution shift: our learned detectors are highly\nperformant on both our test set and the latest version of open source\nrepositories.

In this work, we focus on passively collected trajectories, which\nare sequences of time-stamped locations that mobile entities visit. To analyse\nsuch trajectories, a crucial part is a measure of similarity between two\ntrajectories. We propose the time-window Frechet distance, which enforces the\nmaximum temporal separation between points of two trajectories that can be\npaired in the calculation of the Frechet distance, and the metric-based edit\ndistance which incorporates the underlying metric in the computation of the\ninsertion and deletion costs. Using these measures, we can cluster trajectories\nto infer group motion patterns. We look at the $k$-gather problem which\nrequires each cluster to have at least $k$ trajectories. We prove that k-gather\nremains NP-hard under edit distance, metric-based edit distance and Jaccard\ndistance. Finally, we improve over previous results on discrete Frechet\ndistance and show that there is no strongly sub-quadratic time with\napproximation factor less than $1.61$ in two dimensional setting unless SETH\nfails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 12:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

We aim to model\nluminosity changes for objects with black hole mass of 10, 10$^5$, and 10$^7$\nsolar masses, using the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disk unstable\ndue to the dominant radiation pressure. We use a 1-dimensional, vertically\nintegrated time-dependent numerical scheme which models simultaneous evolution\nof the disk and corona, coupled by the vertical mass exchange. We also discuss\nthe possibility of presence of an inner optically thin flow, namely the\nAdvection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). We found that the outburst character\nstrongly depends on the magnetic field and the outer radius of the disk if this\nradius is smaller (due to TDE phenomenon) than the size of the instability zone\nin a stationary disk with infinite radius. For microquasars, the dependence on\nthe magnetic field is monotonic, and the period decreases with the field\nstrength. For larger black hole masses, the dependence is non-monotonic, and\ninitial rise of the period is later replaced with the relatively rapid decrease\nas the magnetic field continues to rise.

Furthermore, problems such as\nthe asymmetry of the distribution of estimates and the possibility of Shannon's\ndiversity index estimator bias can lead to incorrect recommendations to the\nresearch community. Thus, we propose two methods and compare them with seven\nothers using their performances to face these problems. The first idea uses the\ncredible interval (CI) method to build a bootstrap confidence interval.

Organic-inorganic layered perovskites are\ncurrently some of the most promising 2D van der Waals materials, due to their\nexceptional optical brightness and enhanced excitonic effects. However, low\ncrystal quality and spectral diffusion usually broaden the exciton linewidth,\nobscuring the fine structure of the exciton in conventional photoluminescence\nexperiments. Here, we propose a mechanical approach for reducing the effect of\nspectral diffusion by means of hBN-capping on layered perovskites with\ndifferent thicknesses, revealing the exciton fine structure. We used a\nstochastic model to link the reduction of the spectral linewidth with the\npopulation of active charge fluctuation centres present in the organic spacer\ntaking part in the dynamical Stark shift. Active fluctuation centres are\nreduced by a factor of 3.7 to 7.1 when we include hBN-capping according to our\ndirect spectral measurements. This rate is in good agreement with the analysis\nof the overlap between the squared perovskite lattice and the hexagonal hBN\nlattice. Van der Waals forces between both lattices cause the partial clamping\nof the perovskite organic spacer molecules, and hence, the amplitude of the\ndynamical Stark shift characteristic of the spectral diffusion effect is\nreduced. Our work provides an easy and low-cost solution to the problem of\naccessing important fine-structure excitonic state information, along with an\nexplanation of the important carrier dynamics present in the organic spacer\nthat affect the quality of the optical emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Different machine learning formulations can be used to\nsolve the predictive maintenance problem. However, many of the approaches\nstudied in the literature are not directly applicable to real-life scenarios.\nIndeed, many of those approaches usually either rely on labelled machine\nmalfunctions in the case of classification and fault detection, or rely on\nfinding a monotonic health indicator on which a prediction can be made in the\ncase of regression and remaining useful life estimation, which is not always\nfeasible. Moreover, the decision-making part of the problem is not always\nstudied in conjunction with the prediction phase. This paper aims to design and\ncompare different formulations for predictive maintenance in a two-level\nframework and design metrics that quantify both the failure detection\nperformance as well as the timing of the maintenance decision. The first level\nis responsible for building a health indicator by aggregating features using a\nlearning algorithm. The second level consists of a decision-making system that\ncan trigger an alarm based on this health indicator. Three degrees of\nrefinements are compared in the first level of the framework, from simple\nthreshold-based univariate predictive technique to supervised learning methods\nbased on the remaining time before failure. We choose to use the Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) and its variations as the common algorithm used in all the\nformulations. We apply and compare the different strategies on a real-world\nrotating machine case study and observe that while a simple model can already\nperform well, more sophisticated refinements enhance the predictions for\nwell-chosen parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Even though this is the\nbiggest remaining source of uncertainty when daily IGRT or adaptation is used,\nit has not been accounted for quantitatively in treatment planning. Using\nprobabilistic planning allows to directly account for contouring uncertainties\nin plan optimisation. The first step is to create an algorithm that can\ngenerate many realistic contours with variation matching actual inter-observer\nvariation.\n  We propose a methodology to generate random contours, based on measured\nspatial inter-observer variation, IOV, and a single parameter that controls its\ngeometrical dependency: alpha, the width of the 3D Gaussian used as point\nspread function (PSF). We used a level set formulation of the median shape,\nwith the level set function defined as the signed distance transform. To create\na new contour, we added the median level set and a noise map which was weighted\nwith the IOV map and then convolved with the PSF. Thresholding the level set\nfunction reconstructs the newly generated contour.\n  We used data from 18 patients from the golden atlas, consisting of five\nprostate delineations on T2-w MRI scans. To evaluate the similarity between the\ncontours, we calculated the maximum distance to agreement to the median shape\n(maxDTA), and the minimum dose of the contours using an ideal dose\ndistribution.

In this paper, we aim to enhance the reliability\nof MobCCN by exploring different retransmissions mechanisms, such as\nretransmissions based on number of duplicate Interests that are received for\nthe same requested content, periodic retransmissions, single path versus\ndisjoint multi-path forwarding, hysteresis mechanism and combinations of them.\nExtensive simulation results show that, among the analysed MobCCN variants, the\none that implements both periodic retransmissions and a hysteresis-based\nretransmission process ensures the highest delivery rates (up to 95\\%) and the\nshortest network path, with a very limited traffic overhead due to\nretransmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 15:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-25"}

This study aims to provide a reference\nto different CME orientation determination methods in the near-Sun environment.\nAlso, it aims to investigate the non-radial flow in the sheath region of the\ninterplanetary CME (ICME) in order to provide the first proxy to relate the\nICME orientation with its propagation. We investigated 22 isolated CME-ICME\nevents in the period 2008-2015.

The ability of GCS and ellipse fitting to\ndetermine the CME orientation is found to be limited to reliably distinguish\nonly between the high or low inclination of the events. Most of the CME-ICME\npairs under investigation were found to be characterized by a low inclination.\nFor the majority of CME-ICME pairs, we obtain consistent estimations of the\ntilt from remote and in situ data.

This has many applications in medicine and\nbiomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed\nbut do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and\ngraphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned\nfrom data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated\nagainst ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining\nSkeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D\nbody surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male\nand 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit\na parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel\npart-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside\ntraining pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA\nin a pose-normalized space. We then train a regressor from body shape\nparameters to skeleton shape parameters and refine the skeleton to satisfy\nconstraints on physical plausibility. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and\npose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work,\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held-out DXA\nscans, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction\nfrom varied and challenging 3D bodies.

As applied to\nthe Kohn-Sham DFT ground state, linear-response theory affords an\neigenvalue-type problem for the excitation energies in a basis of\nsingly-excited Slater determinants, and is widely known simply as \"TDDFT\"\ndespite its frequency-domain formulation. This form of TDDFT is the mostly\nwidely-used quantum-chemical method for excited states, due to a favorable\ncombination of low cost and reasonable accuracy. The chapter surveys the\naccuracy of linear-response TDDFT, which is generally more sensitive to the\ndetails of the exchange-correlation functional as compared to ground-state DFT,\nand also describes some known systemic problems exhibited by this approach.\nSome of those problems can be corrected on a case-by-case basis using\norbital-optimized, excited-state self-consistent field (SCF) calculations, in\nwhat is known as excited-state Kohn-Sham theory or a \"Delta-SCF\" procedure, a\nclass of methods that includes restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham theory. Recent\nsuccesses of these approaches are highlighted, including double excitations and\ncore-level excitations. Finally, explicitly time-dependent (or \"real-time\")\nTDDFT involves propagation of the molecular orbitals in time following an\nexternal perturbation, according to the Kohn-Sham analogue of the\ntime-dependent Schroedinger equation. The time-dependent approach has been used\nto model strong-field electron dynamics, and in the weak-field limit it\nprovides a route to broadband spectra based on the time evolution of the dipole\nmoment function. This is useful for describing high-energy excitations (as in\nx-ray spectroscopy) and in systems where the density of states is high, as\ndemonstrated by a few examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 14:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Physical probabilities are arguably in some sense\n'objective' and possess all the standard properties of the concept of\nprobability. On the other hand, an analogical probability is defined by making\nan analogy between the uncertainty surrounding an event of interest and the\nuncertainty surrounding an event that has a physical probability.

These methods\nutilize data collected from traffic recording stations at different timestamps\nto predict the future status of traffic. Hence, data collection, transmission,\nstorage, and extraction techniques can have a significant impact on the\nperformance of the traffic flow model. On the other hand, a comprehensive\ndatabase can provide the opportunity for using complex, yet reliable predictive\nmodels such as deep learning methods. However, most of these methods have\ndifficulties in handling missing values and outliers. This study focuses on\nhybrid deep neural networks to predict traffic flow in the California Freeway\nPerformance Measurement System (PeMS) with missing values. The proposed\nnetworks are based on a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to\nconsider the temporal dependencies in the data recorded in each station and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) to take the spatial correlations in the\nadjacent stations into account. Various architecture configurations with series\nand parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several\nprevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the\nhybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two\ndifferent datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid\nnetwork with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in\npredicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21%\nmissing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when\napplied to an incomplete test data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 15:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools\nand their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this\nsystematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research\nquestions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools\naddress, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are\nthe different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in\ncomparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital\nlibraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The\nresults show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD\nare increasingly gaining attention among researchers.

Further,\nour analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without\nconsidering the role of other stakeholders.

The friction arises\nnot only from the field fluctuations but also from the dipole fluctuations\nintrinsic to the particle. As a result, the dissipative particle can be out of\nthe nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), where it loses or gains internal\nenergy. Only if the temperature of the particle equals a special NESS\ntemperature will the particle be in NESS. We first derive the NESS conditions\nwhich give the NESS temperature of the particle as a function of the radiation\ntemperature and the velocity of the particle. Imposing the NESS conditions, we\nthen obtain an expression for the quantum vacuum friction in NESS. The NESS\nquantum vacuum friction is shown to be always negative definite, therefore a\ntrue drag. The NESS temperature and quantum vacuum friction are calculated\nnumerically for various models. Out of NESS, even though the quantum vacuum\nfrictional force no longer has a definite sign in the rest frame of the\nradiation, we find the external force needed to keep the particle moving must\nbe in the same direction as the motion of the particle. This then excludes the\npossibility of making a perpetual motion machine, which could convert the\nvacuum energy into useful mechanical work. In addition, we find that the\ndeviation of the temperature of the particle from its NESS temperature causes\nthe particle to lose or gain internal energy in such a way that the particle\nwould return to NESS after deviating from it. This enables experimental\nmeasurements of the NESS temperature of the particle to serve as a feasible\nsignature for these quantum vacuum frictional effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 09:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Large-scale CO2 injections into\nthe subsurface require understanding of the potential for fluid flow through\nfaults to mitigate risk of leakage. Here, we study how to obtain effective\npermeability of deformation bands in the damage zone of faults. Deformation\nbands are relatively small, low permeability features that can have a\nsignificant effect on flow dynamics, however, the discrepancy of scales is a\nchallenge for field-scale simulation. A new analytical upscaling model is\nproposed in order to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional\nupscaling approaches for heterogeneous porous media. The new model captures the\nfine-scale impact of deformation bands on fluid flow in the near-fault region,\nand can be derived from knowledge of large-scale fault properties. To test the\naccuracy of the model it is compared to fine-scale numerical simulations that\nexplicitly include individual deformation bands. For a wide range of different\nstochastically generated deformation bands networks, the upscaling model shows\nimproved estimate of effective permeability compared to conventional upscaling\napproaches. By applying the upscaling model to a full-field simulation of the\nSmeaheia storage site in the North Sea, we show that deformation bands with a\npermeability contrast higher than three orders of magnitude may act as an extra\nlayer of protection from fluid flow through faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 13:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Real-time scenarios demand decision-making\nfrom rare events wherein the data are typically imbalanced. These situations\ncommonly arise in medical applications, cybersecurity, catastrophic predictions\netc. This motivates the development of learning algorithms capable of learning\nfrom imbalanced data. Human brain effortlessly learns from imbalanced data.\nInspired by the chaotic neuronal firing in the human brain, a novel learning\nalgorithm namely Neurochaos Learning (NL) was recently proposed. NL is\ncategorized in three blocks: Feature Transformation, Neurochaos Feature\nExtraction (CFX), and Classification. In this work, the efficacy of neurochaos\nfeature transformation and extraction for classification in imbalanced learning\nis studied. We propose a unique combination of neurochaos based feature\ntransformation and extraction with traditional ML algorithms. The explored\ndatasets in this study revolve around medical diagnosis, banknote fraud\ndetection, environmental applications and spoken-digit classification. In this\nstudy, experiments are performed in both high and low training sample regime.\nIn the former, five out of nine datasets have shown a performance boost in\nterms of macro F1-score after using CFX features. The highest performance boost\nobtained is 25.97% for Statlog (Heart) dataset using CFX+Decision Tree. In the\nlow training sample regime (from just one to nine training samples per class),\nthe highest performance boost of 144.38% is obtained for Haberman's Survival\ndataset using CFX+Random Forest.
