However, most existing news recommendation methods only aim to\noptimize recommendation accuracy while ignoring diversity. Reranking is a\nwidely used post-processing technique to promote the diversity of top\nrecommendation results. However, the recommendation model is not perfect and\nerrors may be propagated and amplified in a cascaded recommendation algorithm.\nIn addition, the recommendation model itself is not diversity-aware, making it\ndifficult to achieve a good tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and\ndiversity. In this paper, we propose a news recommendation approach named\nLeaDivRec, which is a fully learnable model that can generate diversity-aware\nnews recommendations in an end-to-end manner. Different from existing news\nrecommendation methods that are usually based on point- or pair-wise ranking,\nin LeaDivRec we propose a more effective list-wise news recommendation model.\nMore specifically, we propose a permutation Transformer to consider the\nrelatedness between candidate news and meanwhile can learn different\nrepresentations for similar candidate news to help improve recommendation\ndiversity. We also propose an effective list-wise training method to learn\naccurate ranking models. In addition, we propose a diversity-aware\nregularization method to further encourage the model to make controllable\ndiversity-aware recommendations.

In this paper, we propose FairRank, which is a fairness-aware\nsingle-tower ranking framework for news recommendation. Since candidate news\nselection can be biased, we propose to use a shared candidate-aware user model\nto match user interest with a real displayed candidate news and a random news,\nrespectively, to learn a candidate-aware user embedding that reflects user\ninterest in candidate news and a candidate-invariant user embedding that\nindicates intrinsic user interest.

And while many school systems increasingly\nundercut curiosity by teaching to the test, teachers are increasingly\ninterested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare them for a\nworld in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more\nimportant. One aspect of curiosity that has received little attention, however,\nis the role of peers in eliciting curiosity. We present what we believe to be\nthe first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive\naccount of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying\ncuriosity states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and\ninterpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors\nthat fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging\na longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a positive\npredictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and\ninterpersonal functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions\nexercising a comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral\nrealizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven manner. We\ninstantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and\ntactics that can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke,\nand scaffold curiosity. This work is a step towards designing learning\ntechnologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment curiosity during\nlearning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning\nanalytics. The underlying rationale is applicable more generally for developing\ncomputer support for other metacognitive and socio-emotional skills.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 16:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Although many auxiliary tasks have been empirically\nshown to be effective for accelerating learning on the main task, it is not yet\nclear what makes useful auxiliary tasks. Some of the most promising results are\non the pixel control, reward prediction, and the next state prediction\nauxiliary tasks; however, the empirical results are mixed, showing substantial\nimprovements in some cases and marginal improvements in others. Careful\ninvestigations of how auxiliary tasks help the learning of the main task is\nnecessary. In this paper, we take a step studying the effect of the target\npolicies on the usefulness of the auxiliary tasks formulated as general value\nfunctions. General value functions consist of three core elements: 1) policy 2)\ncumulant 3) continuation function. Our focus on the role of the target policy\nof the auxiliary tasks is motivated by the fact that the target policy\ndetermines the behavior about which the agent wants to make a prediction and\nthe state-action distribution that the agent is trained on, which further\naffects the main task learning. Our study provides insights about questions\nsuch as: Does a greedy policy result in bigger improvement gains compared to\nother policies? Is it best to set the auxiliary task policy to be the same as\nthe main task policy? Does the choice of the target policy have a substantial\neffect on the achieved performance gain or simple strategies for setting the\npolicy, such as using a uniformly random policy, work as well? Our empirical\nresults suggest that: 1) Auxiliary tasks with the greedy policy tend to be\nuseful. 2) Most policies, including a uniformly random policy, tend to improve\nover the baseline. 3) Surprisingly, the main task policy tends to be less\nuseful compared to other policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 16:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Here we show how embedding\nan optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient\nmode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each\nindividual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability\nover the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear\noptical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial\nmulti-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these\ncircuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to\nseven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum\ngates.

Instead, agents compute model updates locally\nbased on their available data, and subsequently share the update model with a\nparameter server or their peers. This is followed by an aggregation step, which\ntraditionally takes the form of a (weighted) average. Distributed learning\nschemes based on averaging are known to be susceptible to outliers. A single\nmalicious agent is able to drive an averaging-based distributed learning\nalgorithm to an arbitrarily poor model. This has motivated the development of\nrobust aggregation schemes, which are based on variations of the median and\ntrimmed mean. While such procedures ensure robustness to outliers and malicious\nbehavior, they come at the cost of significantly reduced sample efficiency.\nThis means that current robust aggregation schemes require significantly higher\nagent participation rates to achieve a given level of performance than their\nmean-based counterparts in non-contaminated settings.

Using these wavefunctions, we calculate the trion-polariton interaction\nenergies for the exchange processes, resolving the outstanding question of\ntrion-trion scattering. We find that the nonlinearity is the result of the\ncompetition between different scattering channels. Such a cancellation effect\nis sensitive to wavefunction overlaps and depends on material parameters. Most\nimportantly, our result shows that the nonlinear interaction between\ntrion-polaritons is attractive, and is fivefold stronger than exciton-polariton\ninteraction. Our work thus describes the regime where trion-polaritons offer\nthe prospects for attractive fluids of light in monolayers of transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 17:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2022 09:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory\nrequirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g.,\nsparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread\nadoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality\ntradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable\nalgorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues,\nwe propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are\nparameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware\nutilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms).\nSurprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch\nmatrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties\nof Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense\nmodels. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable\naccuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training\napplications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and\nWikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and\nreducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In\nsparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called \"reverse\nsparsification,\" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation\nto speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The\nsame technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized\nimplementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse\nfine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds\nup BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 17:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-04"}

Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than\nsource generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our\nresults from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs,\nand is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline.\nMoreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to\nlonger training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones.\nFinally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet linear probing and competitive results on\ndownstream transfer.

Unambiguous\nidentification of jet quenching due to final-state interactions is key to\nconfirming QGP formation in these reactions. We compute the nuclear\nmodification factors $R_{AA}$ and $R_{p(d)A}$ of charged hadrons and heavy\nflavor mesons in large (Au-Au, Xe-Xe, Pb-Pb) and small ($d$-Au, $p$-Pb, O-O)\ncolliding systems, respectively. Our results include the Cronin effect and\ninitial-state parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter. In the final state,\nhard partons undergo collisional energy loss and branching that was recently\nderived using Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory with Glauber Gluon (SCET$_{\\rm\nG}$). In large colliding systems, medium-modified QCD evolution of the\nfragmentation functions dominates the nuclear correction. As the system size\ndecreases, we find that cold nuclear matter effects, collisional energy loss,\nand QGP-induced radiations can become equally important. A systematic scan over\nthe medium size and mass/flavor dependence of $R_{AA}$ provides the opportunity\nto separate these individual contributions and identify QGP signatures in small\nsystems.

Cosmic rays and magnetic fields are key ingredients in galaxy\nevolution, regulating both stellar feedback and star formation. Their\nproperties can be studied with low-frequency radio continuum observations, free\nfrom thermal contamination. Aims. We define a sample of 76 nearby (< 30 Mpc)\ngalaxies, with rich ancillary data in the radio continuum and infrared from the\nCHANG-ES and KINGFISH surveys, which will be observed with the LOFAR Two-metre\nSky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz. Methods. We present maps for 45 of them as part\nof the LoTSS data release 2 (LoTSS-DR2), where we measure integrated flux\ndensities and study integrated and spatially resolved radio spectral indices.\nWe investigate the radio-SFR relation, using star-formation rates (SFR) from\ntotal infrared and H $\\alpha$ + 24-$\\mu$m emission. Results. The radio-SFR\nrelation at 144 MHz is clearly super-linear with $L_{144} \\propto\nSFR^{1.4-1.5}$. The mean integrated radio spectral index between 144 and\n$\\approx$1400 MHz is $\\langle \\alpha\\rangle = -0.56 \\pm 0.14$, in agreement\nwith the injection spectral index for cosmic ray electrons (CRE). However, the\nradio spectral index maps show a variation of spectral indices with flatter\nspectra associated with star-forming regions and steeper spectra in galaxy\noutskirts and, in particular, in extra-planar regions. We found that galaxies\nwith high star-formation rates (SFR) have steeper radio spectra; we find\nsimilar correlations with galaxy size, mass, and rotation speed. Conclusions.\nGalaxies that are larger and more massive are better electron calorimeters,\nmeaning that the CRE lose a higher fraction of their energy within the\ngalaxies. This explains the super-linear radio-SFR relation, with more massive,\nstar-forming galaxies being radio bright. We propose a semi-calorimetric\nradio-SFR relation, which employs the galaxy mass as a proxy for the\ncalorimetric efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-10"}

Studies of a similar excess in the Milky Way center\nmotivate a correlation of the spatial morphology of the signal with the\ndistribution of stellar mass in M31. However, a robust determination of the\nbest theory for the observed excess emission is very challenging due to large\nuncertainties in the astrophysical gamma-ray foreground model. Here we perform\na spectro-morphological analysis of the M31 gamma-ray excess using\nstate-of-the-art templates for the distribution of stellar mass in M31 and\nnovel astrophysical foreground models for its sky region. We construct maps for\nthe old stellar populations of M31 based on observational data from the PAndAS\nsurvey and carefully remove the foreground stars.

We find that our stellar maps, taken as a\nproxy for the location of a putative population of millisecond pulsars in the\nbulge of M31, reach a statistical significance of $5.4\\sigma$, making them as\nstrongly favoured as the simple phenomenological models usually considered in\nthe literature, e.g., a disk-like template with uniform brightness. Our\ndetection of the stellar templates is robust to generous variations of the\nastrophysical foreground model. Once the stellar templates are included in the\nastrophysical model, we show that the dark matter annihilation interpretation\nof the signal is unwarranted. Using the results of a binary population\nsynthesis model we demonstrate that a population of about one million\nunresolved MSPs could naturally explain the observed gamma-ray luminosity per\nstellar mass, energy spectrum, and stellar bulge-to-disk flux ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

The procedure connects the\nout-of-equilibrium critical fluctuations described in concert with the\nhydrodynamic evolution of the droplet of QGP by extended hydrodynamics, known\nas Hydro+, with the subsequent kinetic description in terms of observable\nhadrons. We introduce a critical scalar isoscalar field sigma whose\nfluctuations cause correlations between observed hadrons due to the couplings\nof the sigma field to the hadrons via their masses. We match the QGP\nfluctuations obtained by solving the Hydro+ equations describing the evolution\nof critical fluctuations before freeze-out to the correlations of the sigma\nfield.

Hybrid methodologies\ncombining advanced data science with weather forecasting have been\nincrementally applied to the predictions.

Aiming at it, this paper proposes a novel\nframework with mathematical underpinnings for turbine power prediction. This\nframework is the first time to incorporate knowledge distillation into energy\nforecasting, enabling accurate and economical constructions of turbine models\nby learning knowledge from the well-established park model. Besides, park-scale\nweather forecasts non-explicitly are mapped to turbines by transfer learning of\npredicted power errors, achieving model correction for better performance. The\nproposed framework is deployed on five turbines featuring various terrains in\nan Arctic wind park, the results are evaluated against the competitors of\nablation investigation. The major findings reveal that the proposed framework,\ndeveloped on favorable knowledge distillation and transfer learning parameters\ntuning, yields performance boosts from 3.3 % to 23.9 % over its competitors.\nThis advantage also exists in terms of wind energy physics and computing\nefficiency, which are verified by the prediction quality rate and calculation\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 18:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The problem is often addressed by\nusing streaming algorithms with sublinear space data structures. These\nalgorithms allow processing of large data while using limited data storage.\nCommonly used streaming algorithms, such as count-min sketch, have many\nadvantages, but do not take into account properties of a data stream for\nperformance optimization. In the present paper we introduce a novel\ndouble-hashing algorithm that provides flexibility to optimize streaming\nalgorithms depending on the properties of a given stream. In the double-hashing\napproach, first a standard streaming algorithm is employed to obtain an\nestimate of the element frequencies. This estimate is derived using a fraction\nof the stream and allows identification of the heavy hitters. Next, it uses a\nmodified hash table where the heavy hitters are mapped into individual buckets\nand other stream elements are mapped into the remaining buckets. Finally, the\nelement frequencies are estimated based on the constructed hash table over the\nentire data stream with any streaming algorithm. We demonstrate on both\nsynthetic data and an internet query log dataset that our approach is capable\nof improving frequency estimation due to removing heavy hitters from the\nhashing process and, thus, reducing collisions in the hash table. Our approach\navoids employing additional machine learning models to identify heavy hitters\nand, thus, reduces algorithm complexity and streamlines implementation.\nMoreover, because it is not dependent on specific features of the stream\nelements for identifying heavy hitters, it is applicable to a large variety of\nstreams. In addition, we propose a procedure on how to dynamically adjust the\nproposed double-hashing algorithm when frequencies of the elements in a stream\nare changing over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 18:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In this line of thought, a scientific\nrealist is someone who believes in the objective existence of the entities\npostulated by our best scientific theories. In metaphysical terms, what does\nthat mean? In ontological terms, i.e., in terms about what exists, scientific\nrealism can be understood as involving the adoption of an ontology that is\nscientifically informed. But according to some philosophers, the realistic\nattitude must go beyond ontology. The way in which this requirement has been\nunderstood involves providing a metaphysics for the entities postulated by\nscience, that is, answering questions about the nature of what ontology admits\nto exist. We discuss how two fashionable approaches face the challenge of\nproviding a metaphysics for science: a form of naturalism and the\nViking/Toolbox approach. Finally, we present a third way, which adopts the best\nof both approaches: the meta-Popperian method, which focuses on discarding the\nwrong alternatives, or better saying, the metaphysical profiles incompatible\nwith certain theories. We present the meta-Popperian method, a metametaphysical\nmethod capable of objectively assessing which metaphysical profiles are\nincompatible with certain scientific theories. For this, we will use quantum\nmechanics as a case study, presenting some previously obtained results. As our\nfocus is on methodological questions about the relationship between metaphysics\nand science; with this method, we can see how science can be used to avoid\nerror in metaphysical issues. In our opinion, this would be a way to develop a\nproductive relationship between science and metaphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 18:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

However, the long time-resolved readouts\nrequire small flip angles to preserve ASL signal for later timepoints, limiting\nSNR. By using time-encoded ASL to generate temporal information, the readout\ncan be shortened. Here, the improvements in SNR from using larger flip angles,\nmade possible by the shorter readout, are quantitatively investigated.\n  Methods: The SNR of a conventional (sequential) protocol with 9 readouts and\na 4-by-3 time-encoded protocol with 3 readouts (giving 9 matched timepoints)\nwere directly compared using simulations and in vivo data. Both protocols were\ncompared using readouts with constant (CFA) and variable flip angles (VFA),\nwhere the VFA scheme was designed to produce a consistent ASL signal across\nreadouts. Optimization of the background suppression to minimize physiological\nnoise across readouts was also explored.\n  Results: The time-encoded protocol increased in vivo SNR by 103% and 96% when\nusing CFAs or VFAs, respectively.

The\nVFA scheme also removed signal discontinuities in the time-encoded data.\nPreliminary data suggest optimizing the background suppression could improve in\nvivo SNR by a further 16%.\n  Conclusion: Time-encoding can be used to generate additional temporal\ninformation in ASL angiography. This enables the use of larger flip angles\nwhich can double the SNR compared to a non-time-encoded protocol. The shortened\ntime-encoded readout can also lead to improved background suppression, reducing\nphysiological noise and further improving SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 19:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

To avoid the\nrisk of collision and protect the LEO environment, the space robotics ADR\nconcept has been continuously developed for over a decade to chase, capture,\nand deorbit space debris. This paper presents the designed small satellite with\ndual robotic manipulators. The small satellite is designed based on CubeSat\nstandards, which uses commercially available products in the market. In this\npaper, an approach is detailed for designing the controlled chase and deorbit\nmaneuver for a small satellite equipped with an RCS thruster. The maneuvers are\ncomprised of two phases, a. bringing the chaser satellite to the debris orbit\nand accelerating it to close proximity of 1m to the debris object by using the\nlow thrust RCS thruster, and b. Once captured, controlled deorbiting it to 250\nkm of altitude. A Hohmann transfer concept is used to move our chaser satellite\nfrom the lower orbit to the debris orbit by two impulsive burns. A number of\nthe scenarios are simulated, where one or more orbital elements are adjusted.\nFor more than one orbital elements adjustment, the DAG law and the Q law are\nutilized. These laws synthesize the three direction thrusts to the single\nthrust force for the controlled maneuver. The $\\Delta$V requirement at each\nmaneuver is determined by using the performance parameters of the RCS thruster\nintended for a small satellite. The results show that, for long term simulation\nof a chaser satellite maneuver to debris object, an optimum DAG law is most\nsuitable than the Q law, as it can handle the singularity behavior of the\norbital elements caused due by adjustment of one or more elements more\nefficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 19:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The\nnumber and severity of these fires has been rising for many years. Wildfires\npose direct threats to life and property as well as threats through ancillary\neffects like reduced air quality. The aim of this thesis is to develop\ntechniques to help combat the impacts of wildfires by improving wildfire\nmodeling capabilities by using satellite fire observations. Already much work\nhas been done in this direction by other researchers. Our work seeks to expand\nthe body of knowledge using mathematically sound methods to utilize information\nabout wildfires that considers the uncertainties inherent in the satellite\ndata.\n  In this thesis we explore methods for using satellite data to help initialize\nand steer wildfire simulations. In particular, we develop a method for\nconstructing the history of a fire, a new technique for assimilating wildfire\ndata, and a method for modifying the behavior of a modeled fire by inferring\ninformation about the fuels in the fire domain. These goals rely on being able\nto estimate the time a fire first arrived at every location in a geographic\nregion of interest. Because detailed knowledge of real wildfires is typically\nunavailable, the basic procedure for developing and testing the methods in this\nthesis will be to first work with simulated data so that the estimates produced\ncan be compared with known solutions. The methods thus developed are then\napplied to real-world scenarios. Analysis of these scenarios shows that the\nwork with constructing the history of fires and data assimilation improves\nimproves fire modeling capabilities. The research is significant because it\ngives us a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using\nsatellite data to inform wildfire models and it points the way towards new\navenues for modeling fire behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 20:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Each arm is\nassociated with an unknown law on safety risks and rewards, and the learner's\ngoal is to maximise reward whilst not playing unsafe arms, as determined by a\ngiven threshold on the mean risk.\n  We formulate a pseudo-regret for this setting that enforces this safety\nconstraint in a per-round way by softly penalising any violation, regardless of\nthe gain in reward due to the same. This has practical relevance to scenarios\nsuch as clinical trials, where one must maintain safety for each round rather\nthan in an aggregated sense.\n  We describe doubly optimistic strategies for this scenario, which maintain\noptimistic indices for both safety risk and reward. We show that schema based\non both frequentist and Bayesian indices satisfy tight gap-dependent\nlogarithmic regret bounds, and further that these play unsafe arms only\nlogarithmically many times in total.

A geofence is\nusually activated by detecting a location measurement inside the geofence\nregion. However, location measurements such as GPS often appear sporadically on\nsmartphones, partly due to weak signal, or privacy preservation, because users\nmay restrict location sensing, or energy conservation, because sensing\nlocations can consume a significant amount of energy. These unpredictable, and\nsometimes long, gaps between measurements mean that entry into a geofence can\ngo completely undetected. In this paper we argue that short term location\nprediction can help alleviate this problem by computing the probability of\nentering a geofence in the future. Complicating this prediction approach is the\nfact that another location measurement could appear at any time, making the\nprediction redundant and wasteful. Therefore, we develop a framework that\naccounts for uncertain location predictions and the possibility of new\nmeasurements to trigger geofence activations. Our framework optimizes over the\nbenefits and costs of correct and incorrect geofence activations, leading to an\nalgorithm that reacts intelligently to the uncertainties of future movements\nand measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 22:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

We\nused the Kepler dataset collected by NASA from the Kepler Space Observatory to\nconduct supervised learning, which predicts the existence of exoplanet\ncandidates as a three-categorical classification task, using decision tree,\nrandom forest, na\\\"ive Bayes, and neural network; we used another NASA dataset\nconsisted of the confirmed exoplanets data to conduct unsupervised learning,\nwhich divides the confirmed exoplanets into different clusters, using k-means\nclustering. As a result, our models achieved accuracies of 99.06%, 92.11%,\n88.50%, and 99.79%, respectively, in the supervised learning task and\nsuccessfully obtained reasonable clusters in the unsupervised learning task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 23:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

Therefore, it is\nimportant to develop efficient indoor spatial query algorithms for supporting\nvarious location-based applications.

Consequently, we cannot\napply existing spatial query evaluation techniques devised for outdoor\nenvironments for this new challenge. Because Bayesian filtering techniques can\nbe employed to estimate the state of a system that changes over time using a\nsequence of noisy measurements made on the system, in this research, we propose\nthe Bayesian filtering-based location inference methods as the basis for\nevaluating indoor spatial queries with noisy RFID raw data.

Unfortunately, accuracy of mathematical\nmodels is very difficult to achieve. During the past few decades computational\nintelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks have been very\nsuccessful when an accurate mathematical model is not available. Therefore, in\nthis paper, an artificial neural network controller is proposed for heading and\nposition control system. For simulation purposes, a mathematical model with\nfour effective thrusters have been chosen to test the performance of the\nproposed controller. The final closed loop system has been analyzed and tested\nthrough simulation studies. The results are very encouraging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 04:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

The coupling of bands dominated by pure Sb layers hosting topological\nfermions to Mn and Eu magnetic states provides a potential path to tune the\ntopological properties. We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic\nstructure on three AFM phases based on single-crystal neutron diffraction,\nmagnetization, and heat capacity data as well as polycrystalline $^{151}$Eu\nM\\\"ossbauer data. The Mn magnetic sublattice orders into a C-type AFM structure\nbelow $323(1)$~K with the ordered Mn magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\text{Mn}}$ lying\nperpendicular to the layers.

The results show that not all ridesplitting trips reduce\nemissions from ridesourcing in the real world. The CO2 emission reduction rate\nof ridesplitting varies from trip to trip, averaging at 43.15g/km.

Based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations\n(SHAP) method, the overlap rate and detour rate of shared rides are identified\nto be the most important factors that determine the CO2 emission reduction rate\nof ridesplitting. Increasing the overlap rate, the number of shared rides,\naverage speed, and ride distance ratio while decreasing the detour rate, actual\ntrip distance, and ride distance gap can increase the CO2 emission reduction\nrate of ridesplitting.

They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size\nand complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource\nconsumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the\npremise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even\nretrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in\npractice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model\nconsumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network\npruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are\nnot only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in\nopen-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and\nretraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional\naggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as\na progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic\noptimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process.\nOur method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of\nexperiments on diverse neural network models.

As Markov\nchains are stochastic processes, it is natural to use probability based\narguments for proofs. At the same time, the dynamics of a Markov chain is\ncompletely captured by its initial distribution, which is a vector, and its\ntransition probability matrix. Therefore, arguments based on matrix analysis\nand linear algebra can also be used. The proofs discussed below use one or the\nother of these two types of arguments, except in one case where the argument is\ngraph theoretic. Appropriate credits to the various proofs are given in the\nmain text.\n  Our first proof is entirely elementary, and yet the proof is also quite\nsimple. The proof also suggests a mixing time bound, which we prove, but this\nbound in many cases will not be the best bound. One approach in proving the\nfundamental theorem breaks the proof in two parts: (i) show the existence of a\nunique positive stationary distribution for irreducible Markov chains, and (ii)\nassuming that an ergodic chain does have a stationary distribution, show that\nthe chain will converge in the limit to that distribution irrespective of the\ninitial distribution. For (i), we survey two proofs, one uses probability\narguments, and the other uses graph theoretic arguments.

A common\napproach for this scenario is to generate more training data through\ntranslation or generation-based data augmentation method. Unfortunately, we\nfind that simply combining source-language data and the corresponding\ntranslation cannot fully exploit the translated data and the improvements\nobtained are somewhat limited. In this paper, we describe our novel\ndual-contrastive framework ConCNER for cross-lingual NER under the scenario of\nlimited source-language labeled data. Specifically, based on the\nsource-language samples and their translations, we design two contrastive\nobjectives for cross-language NER at different grammatical levels, namely\nTranslation Contrastive Learning (TCL) to close sentence representations\nbetween translated sentence pairs and Label Contrastive Learning (LCL) to close\ntoken representations within the same labels. Furthermore, we utilize knowledge\ndistillation method where the NER model trained above is used as the teacher to\ntrain a student model on unlabeled target-language data to better fit the\ntarget language. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide variety of target\nlanguages, and the results demonstrate that ConCNER tends to outperform\nmultiple baseline methods.

In real applications, search engines are designed to display\nonly the most relevant k documents from the retrieved candidate set. The rest\ncandidates are discarded. As a consequence, position bias and sample selection\nbias usually occur simultaneously. Existing unbiased learning to rank\napproaches either focus on one type of bias (e.g., position bias) or mitigate\nthe position bias and sample selection bias with separate components,\noverlooking their associations. In this study, we first analyze the mechanisms\nand associations of position bias and sample selection bias from the viewpoint\nof a causal graph. Based on the analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood\nDecomposition (CLD), a unified approach to simultaneously mitigating these two\nbiases in top-k learning to rank. By decomposing the log-likelihood of the\nbiased data as an unbiased term that only related to relevance, plus other\nterms related to biases, CLD successfully detaches the relevance from position\nbias and sample selection bias. An unbiased ranking model can be obtained from\nthe unbiased term, via maximizing the whole likelihood. An extension to the\npairwise neural ranking is also developed. Advantages of CLD include\ntheoretical soundness and a unified framework for pointwise and pairwise\nunbiased top-k learning to rank.

A novel affine invariant descriptor called vertex trichotomy descriptor\nis proposed on the basis of that geometrical relations between any of vertices\nand lines are preserved after affine transformations, which is constructed by\nmapping each vertex into trichotomy sets. The outlier removals in Vertex\nTrichotomy Matching (VTM) are implemented by iteratively comparing the\ndisparity of corresponding vertex trichotomy descriptors. Some inliers\nmistakenly validated by a large amount of outliers are removed in VTM\niterations, and several residual outliers close to correct locations cannot be\nexcluded with the same graph structures. Therefore, a recovery and filtering\nstrategy is designed to recover some inliers based on identical vertex\ntrichotomy descriptors and restricted transformation errors. Assisted with the\nadditional recovered inliers, residual outliers can also be filtered out during\nthe process of reaching identical graph for the expanded vertex sets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance on precision and\nstability of this algorithm under various conditions, such as remote sensing\nimages with large transformations, duplicated patterns, or inconsistent\nspectral content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 09:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

A key question regarding the magnetic field\namplification by turbulence, is, on what scale, $k_{\\rm p}$, do magnetic fields\nbecome most concentrated? There has been some disagreement about whether\n$k_{\\rm p}$ is controlled by the viscous scale, $k_\\nu$ (where turbulent\nkinetic energy dissipates), or the resistive scale, $k_\\eta$ (where magnetic\nfields dissipate). Here we use direct numerical simulations of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence to measure characteristic scales in the\nkinematic phase of the turbulent dynamo. We run $104$-simulations with\nhydrodynamic Reynolds numbers of $10 \\leq {\\rm Re} \\leq 3600$, and magnetic\nReynolds numbers of $270 \\leq {\\rm Rm} \\leq 4000$, to explore the dependence of\n$k_{\\rm p}$ on $k_\\nu$ and $k_\\eta$. Using physically motivated models for the\nkinetic and magnetic energy spectra, we measure $k_\\nu$, $k_\\eta$ and $k_{\\rm\np}$, making sure that the obtained scales are numerically converged. We\ndetermine the overall dissipation scale relations $k_\\nu =\n(0.025^{+0.005}_{-0.006})\\, k_{\\rm turb}\\, {\\rm Re}^{3/4}$ and $k_\\eta =\n(0.88^{+0.21}_{-0.23})\\, k_\\nu\\, {\\rm Pm}^{1/2}$, where $k_{\\rm turb}$ is the\nturbulence driving wavenumber and ${\\rm Pm}={\\rm Rm}/{\\rm Re}$ is the magnetic\nPrandtl number. We demonstrate that the principle dependence of $k_{\\rm p}$ is\non $k_\\eta$.

This new approach is designed to address the problems\nassociated with the registration of images with affine deformations and\ninconsistent content, such as remote sensing images with different spectral\ncontent or noise interference, or map images with inconsistent annotations. To\nbegin with, line-support regions, namely a straight region whose points share\nroughly the same image gradient angle, are extracted to address the issues of\ninconsistent content existing in images. To alleviate the incompleteness of\nline segments, an iterative strategy with multi-resolution is employed to\npreserve global structures that are masked at full resolution by image details\nor noise. Then, Geometrical Outlier Removal (GOR) is developed to provide\nreliable feature point matching, which is based on affineinvariant geometrical\nclassifications for corresponding matches initialized by SIFT.

However,\nedge devices often suffer from abnormalities and failures in industrial\nproduction. Therefore, detecting these abnormal situations timely and\naccurately is crucial for cloud manufacturing. As such, a straightforward\nsolution is that the edge device uploads the data to the cloud for anomaly\ndetection. However, Industry 4.0 puts forward higher requirements for data\nprivacy and security so that it is unrealistic to upload data from edge devices\ndirectly to the cloud. Considering the above-mentioned severe challenges, this\npaper customizes a weakly-supervised edge computing anomaly detection\nframework, i.e., Federated Learning-based Transformer framework\n(\\textit{FedAnomaly}), to deal with the anomaly detection problem in cloud\nmanufacturing. Specifically, we introduce federated learning (FL) framework\nthat allows edge devices to train an anomaly detection model in collaboration\nwith the cloud without compromising privacy. To boost the privacy performance\nof the framework, we add differential privacy noise to the uploaded features.\nTo further improve the ability of edge devices to extract abnormal features, we\nuse the Transformer to extract the feature representation of abnormal data. In\nthis context, we design a novel collaborative learning protocol to promote\nefficient collaboration between FL and Transformer. Furthermore, extensive case\nstudies on four benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework.

A conceivable way to get around this obstacle might be to utilize a\nspontaneous ionization of the ultracold Rydberg gas, where the initial kinetic\nenergies could be much less. However, the spontaneous avalanche ionization will\nresult in a very inhomogeneous distribution (clusterization) of the ions, which\ncan change the efficiency of the electron relaxation in the vicinity of such\nclusters substantially. In the present work, this hypothesis is tested by an\nextensive set of numerical simulations. As a result, it is found that despite a\nless initial kinetic energy, the subsequent relaxation of the electron\nvelocities in the clusterized plasmas proceeds much more violently than in the\ncase of the statistically-uniform ionic distribution. The electron temperature,\nfirstly, experiences a sharp initial jump (presumably, caused by the\n\"virialization\" of energies of the charged particles) and, secondly, exhibits a\ngradual subsequent increase (presumably, associated with a multi-particle\nrecombination of the electrons at the ionic clusters). As a possible tool to\nreduce the anomalous temperature increase, we considered also a two-step plasma\nformation, involving the blockaded Rydberg states. This leads to a suppression\nof the clusterization due to a quasi-regular distribution of ions. In such a\ncase, according to the numerical simulations, the subsequent evolution of the\nelectron temperature proceeds more gently, approximately with the same rate as\nin the statistically-uniform ionic distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 11:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 21:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 14:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Since\nnickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel energy\nspectrum and its relative abundance with respect to iron provide important\ninformation to estimate the abundances at the cosmic ray source and to model\nthe Galactic propagation of heavy nuclei. However, only a few direct\nmeasurements of cosmic-ray nickel at energy larger than $ \\sim$ 3 GeV/n are\navailable at present in the literature and they are affected by strong\nlimitations in both energy reach and statistics. In this paper we present a\nmeasurement of the differential energy spectrum of nickel in the energy range\nfrom 8.8 to 240 GeV/n, carried out with unprecedented precision by the\nCalorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) in operation on the International Space\nStation since 2015. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear\nspecies via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range\nextending far beyond iron (up to atomic number $ Z $ = 40). The particle's\nenergy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction\nlengths, 27 radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation\nlengths) providing tracking and energy sampling. This paper follows our\nprevious measurement of the iron spectrum [O. Adriani et al., Phys. Rev.

To tackle privacy concerns, research communities\nhave proposed different methods to preserve privacy, with Differential privacy\n(DP) standing out as a formal definition that allows quantifying the\nprivacy-utility trade-off. Besides, with the local DP (LDP) model, users can\nsanitize their data locally before transmitting it to the server. The objective\nof this thesis is thus two-fold: O$_1$) To improve the utility and privacy in\nmultiple frequency estimates under LDP guarantees, which is fundamental to\nstatistical learning. And O$_2$) To assess the privacy-utility trade-off of\nmachine learning (ML) models trained over differentially private data. For\nO$_1$, we first tackled the problem from two \"multiple\" perspectives, i.e.,\nmultiple attributes and multiple collections throughout time, while focusing on\nutility. Secondly, we focused our attention on the multiple attributes aspect\nonly, in which we proposed a solution focusing on privacy while preserving\nutility. In both cases, we demonstrate through analytical and experimental\nvalidations the advantages of our proposed solutions over state-of-the-art LDP\nprotocols. For O$_2$, we empirically evaluated ML-based solutions designed to\nsolve real-world problems while ensuring DP guarantees. Indeed, we mainly used\nthe input data perturbation setting from the privacy-preserving ML literature.\nThis is the situation in which the whole dataset is sanitized independently\nand, thus, we implemented LDP algorithms from the perspective of the\ncentralized data owner. In all cases, we concluded that differentially private\nML models achieve nearly the same utility metrics as non-private ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 12:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

For $0<p<1$, the $p$-co-sum of $C$-coconvex sets is introduced, and\nthe corresponding $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski inequality for $C$-coconvex sets is\nestablished.

Differential cost analysis is\nparticularly interesting because of the many compelling applications for it,\nsuch as detecting resource-use regressions at code-review time or proving the\nabsence of certain side-channel vulnerabilities. One prior approach to\ndifferential cost analysis is to apply relational reasoning that conceptually\nconstructs a product program on which one can over-approximate the difference\nin costs between the two program versions. However, a significant challenge in\nany relational approach is effectively aligning the program versions to get\nprecise results. In this paper, our key insight is that we can avoid the need\nfor and the limitations of program alignment if, instead, we bound the\ndifference of two cost-bound summaries rather than directly bounding the\nconcrete cost difference. In particular, our method computes a threshold value\nfor the maximal difference in cost between two program versions simultaneously\nusing two kinds of cost-bound summaries -- a potential function that evaluates\nto an upper bound for the cost incurred in the first program and an\nanti-potential function that evaluates to a lower bound for the cost incurred\nin the second. Our method has a number of desirable properties: it can be fully\nautomated, it allows optimizing the threshold value on relative cost, it is\nsuitable for programs that are not syntactically similar, and it supports\nnon-determinism. We have evaluated an implementation of our approach on a\nnumber of program pairs collected from the literature, and we find that our\nmethod computes tight threshold values on relative cost in most examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 14:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 06:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

We discuss and highlight the\nprojection power of the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale\napplications. We show for a convex problem, our methods can surpass the\nconvergence rate of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \\sqrt{\\mu/L}$, where\n$\\mu, L$ are the strongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the\nLipschitz constant of $F'$, which is the theoretical limit for the convergence\nrate of first-order methods. On the well-known non-convex Rosenbrock function,\nour planning methods achieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while\ngradient descent takes about 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$\naccuracy. We discuss the connection of step-size planing to planning in\nreinforcement learning, in particular, Dyna architectures.\n  (This is a shorter abstract than in the paper because of length requirement)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 19:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 01:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 02:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 20:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

Experimental\nstudies validate the superiority of BNS over the peers in terms of better\nsampling quality and better recommendation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 09:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 16:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 01:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

Inspired by the\ndomain of inequality measurement in economics, this paper explores the use of\ngeneralized Gini welfare functions (GGFs) as a means to specify the normative\ncriterion that recommender systems should optimize for. GGFs weight individuals\ndepending on their ranks in the population, giving more weight to worse-off\nindividuals to promote equality. Depending on these weights, GGFs minimize the\nGini index of item exposure to promote equality between items, or focus on the\nperformance on specific quantiles of least satisfied users. GGFs for ranking\nare challenging to optimize because they are non-differentiable. We resolve\nthis challenge by leveraging tools from non-smooth optimization and projection\noperators used in differentiable sorting. We present experiments using real\ndatasets with up to 15k users and items, which show that our approach obtains\nbetter trade-offs than the baselines on a variety of recommendation tasks and\nfairness criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 09:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 09:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2022 09:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 08:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Numerous\nstatistical and machine learning methods have been proposed in the last five\ndecades with the demand for high-quality and reliable forecasts. However, in\nreal-life prediction problems, situations exist in which a model based on one\nof the above paradigms is preferable. Therefore, hybrid solutions are needed to\nbridge the gap between classical forecasting methods and modern neural network\nmodels. In this context, we introduce a Probabilistic AutoRegressive Neural\nNetwork (PARNN) model that can handle a wide variety of complex time series\ndata (e.g., nonlinearity, non-seasonal, long-range dependence, and\nnon-stationarity). The proposed PARNN model is built by creating a fusion of an\nintegrated moving average and autoregressive neural network to preserve the\nexplainability, scalability, and ``white-box-like'' prediction behavior of the\nindividuals. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic stationarity and geometric\nergodicity are obtained by considering the asymptotic behavior of the\nassociated Markov chain. Unlike advanced deep learning tools, the uncertainty\nquantification of the PARNN model based on prediction intervals is obtained.\nDuring computational experiments, PARNN outperforms standard statistical,\nmachine learning, and deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, NBeats, DeepAR,\netc.) on a diverse collection of real-world datasets from macroeconomics,\ntourism, energy, epidemiology, and others for short-term, medium-term, and\nlong-term forecasting. Multiple comparisons with the best method are carried\nout to showcase the superiority of the proposal in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art forecasters over different forecast horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2022 17:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 19:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Such\noperational support for ineffective ads has been less explored than that for\neffective ads. After pre-analyzing 1,000,000 real-world ad creatives, we found\nthat there are two types of discontinuation: short-term (i.e., cut-out) and\nlong-term (i.e., wear-out). In this paper, we propose a practical prediction\nframework for the discontinuation of ad creatives with a hazard function-based\nloss function inspired by survival analysis. Our framework predicts the\ndiscontinuations with a multi-modal deep neural network that takes as input the\nad creative (e.g., text, categorical, image, numerical features). To improve\nthe prediction performance for the two different types of discontinuations and\nfor the ad creatives that contribute to sales, we introduce two new techniques:\n(1) a two-term estimation technique with multi-task learning and (2) a\nclick-through rate-weighting technique for the loss function. We evaluated our\nframework using the large-scale ad creative dataset, including 10 billion scale\nimpressions. In terms of the concordance index (short: 0.896, long: 0.939, and\noverall: 0.792), our framework achieved significantly better performance than\nthe conventional method (0.531). Additionally, we confirmed that our framework\n(i) demonstrated the same degree of discontinuation effect as manual operations\nfor short-term cases, and (ii) accurately predicted the ad discontinuation\norder, which is important for long-running ad creatives for long-term cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2022 04:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}
