Finally, two software solutions have been developed,\nenabling an easy use of the trained models and standardized generation of\nclinical reports: Raidionics and Raidionics-Slicer. Segmentation performances\nwere quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an\naverage true positive Dice ranging between 80% and 90%, patient-wise recall\nbetween 88% and 98%, and patient-wise precision around 95%. With our Raidionics\nsoftware, running on a desktop computer with CPU support, tumor segmentation\ncan be performed in 16 to 54 seconds depending on the dimensions of the MRI\nvolume. For the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the\ntumor segmentation and features computation, 5 to 15 minutes are necessary. All\ntrained models have been made open-access together with the source code for\nboth software solutions and validation metrics computation. In the future, an\nautomatic classification of the brain tumor type would be necessary to replace\nmanual user input. Finally, the inclusion of post-operative segmentation in\nboth software solutions will be key for generating complete post-operative\nstandardized clinical reports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Two problems, therefore,\nnaturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the\nextraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path\nsum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a\nquantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator.\n  We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is\nin P when restricted to Clifford path sums.

However, the model uses a\nconstant angular velocity. To investigate the effect of a dynamic angular\nvelocity, a quantal microscopic time-reversal and D2 invariant cranking model\nfor triaxial rotation (MSCRM3) including residual correction terms is derived\nfrom a unitary transformation of the nuclear Schrodinger equation and using\nHartree-Fock approach. Except for the angular velocity and residual terms,\nMSCRM3 and the conventional cranking model for triaxial rotation (CCRM3)\nSchrodinger equations are identical in form, and are solved iteratively in a\nsimilar manner. The article identifies the differences in the rotational\nfeatures predicted by CCRM3 and MSCRM3 for 20Ne, 24Mg, and 28Si using a\nself-consistent deformed harmonic-oscillator potential. The rotational features\nstudied are: rotational relaxation of the intrinsic system, stability of the\nrotational states, various rotation modes, nuclear shapes, their transitions,\nand band termination. MSCRM3 predicts the observed reduced energy-level spacing\nin 20Ne between J=6 and 8 and attributes its occurrence to quenching of a\nwobbly rotation. The remaining discrepancy between the observed and\nMSCRM3-predicted excitation energies for 20Ne is removed by including the\nspin-orbit interaction and the residuals of the square of the angular momentum\nand interaction. CCRM3 does not predict the three dimensional phenomena\npredicted by MSCRM3 (such as the reduced energy-level spacing in 20Ne and the\nrotational-band termination at J=12 in prolate 28Si and triaxial 24Mg, etc.\narising from the angular velocity). We, therefore, conclude that CCRM3 is\neffectively a uniaxial rotation model. Therefore, using CCRM3 or its uniaxial\nversion, one would miss capturing three-dimensional rotation phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 02:49:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 12:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 12:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 15:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 20:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

While Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)\nserve as workhorse for network data analyses, their applicability to very large\nnetworks is problematic via classical inference such as maximum likelihood or\nfully Bayesian estimation due to scaling and instability issues. The latter\ntrace from the fact, that classical network statistics consider nodes as\nexchangeable, i.e. actors in the network are assumed to be homogeneous.

QDM magnetic imaging is enhanced using\nquantum control techniques and improved diamond material to increase magnetic\nfield sensitivity by a factor of 4 and measurement speed by a factor of 16 over\nprevious demonstrations. These upgrades facilitate the first demonstration of\nQDM magnetic field measurement for hardware trojan detection. Unsupervised\nconvolutional neural networks and clustering are used to infer trojan presence\nfrom unlabeled data sets of 600x600 pixel magnetic field images without human\nbias. This analysis is shown to be more accurate than principal component\nanalysis for distinguishing between field programmable gate arrays configured\nwith trojan free and trojan inserted logic. This framework is tested on a set\nof scalable trojans that we developed and measured with the QDM. Scalable and\nTrustHub trojans are detectable down to a minimum trojan trigger size of 0.5%\nof the total logic. The trojan detection framework can be used for golden-chip\nfree detection, since knowledge of the chips' identities is only used to\nevaluate detection accuracy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

There exists a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm to compute an EF1+PO allocation, and a non-constructive proof of\nexistence of allocations that are both EF1 and fractionally Pareto-optimal\n(fPO), which is a stronger notion than PO. We present a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm to compute an EF1+fPO allocation, thereby improving the earlier\nresults. Our techniques also enable us to show that an EQ1+fPO allocation\nalways exists when the values are positive, and that it can be computed in\npseudo-polynomial time.\n  We also consider the class of $k$-ary instances where $k$ is a constant,\ni.e., each agent has at most $k$ different values for the goods. We show that\nfor such instances an EF1+fPO allocation can be computed in strongly polynomial\ntime. When all values are positive, we show that an EQ1+fPO allocation for such\ninstances can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Next, we consider\ninstances where the number of agents is constant, and show that an EF1+PO (also\nEQ1+PO) allocation can be computed in polynomial time. These results\nsignificantly extend the polynomial-time computability beyond the known cases\nof binary or identical valuations.\n  Further, we show that the problem of computing an EF1+PO allocation\npolynomial-time reduces to a problem in the complexity class PLS. We also\ndesign a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a Nash welfare maximizing\nallocation when there are constantly many agents with constant many different\nvalues for the goods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

In the previous attempt of (Sealfon 2016}, by adding Laplace noise to\neach edge weight or to each output distance, to achieve DP with some fixed\nbudget, with high probability the maximal absolute error among all published\npairwise distances is roughly $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. It was\nshown that this error could be reduced for some special graphs, which, however,\nis hard for general graphs. Therefore, whether the approximation error can be\nreduced to sublinear in $n$ is posted as an interesting open problem.\n  We break the linear barrier on the distance approximation error of previous\nresult, by proposing an algorithm that releases a constructed synthetic graph\nprivately. Computing all pairwise distances on the constructed graph only\nintroduces $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ error in answering all pairwise shortest path\ndistances for fixed privacy parameter. Our method is based on a novel graph\ndiameter (link length) augmentation via constructing \"shortcuts\" for the paths.\nBy adding a set of shortcut edges to the original graph, we show that any node\npair has a shortest path with link length $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$. Then by adding\nnoises with some positive mean to the edge weights, we show that the new graph\nis differentially private and can be published to answer all pairwise shortest\npath distances with $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ approximation error using standard APSP\ncomputation.\n  Additionally, we consider the graph with small feedback vertex set number. A\nfeedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves\na graph without cycles, and the feedback vertex set number of a graph, $k$, is\nthe size of a smallest feedback vertex set.

Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development\nof a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision\nAvoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both\nmanned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants\nprimarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For\nexample, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu\nand ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft\nperformance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr,\nis being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and\nAdvanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation\nfrom the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been\nproposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS\nXr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the\nsafety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an\nMDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare\nits performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo\nsimulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while\nspeed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe\nnor as efficient as their horizontal and vertical counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 17:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

We used a high\nresolution of $1000/H$ to resolve as many SI unstable modes as possible. The\nsimulation produced a long-lived particle over-density far exceeding the SI\ncriteria (i.e., a critical solid abundance to headwind parameter ratio $Z/\\Pi$)\nwhere strong clumping would occur if these conditions were present over an\nextended region of the disk; yet we observed none.

In this task, our main objective is to build\nthe system to deal with conversational questions based on the audio recordings,\nand to explore the plausibility of providing more cues from different\nmodalities with systems in information gathering. To this end, instead of\ndirectly adopting automatically generated speech transcripts with highly noisy\ndata, we propose a novel unified data distillation approach, DDNet, which\neffectively ingests cross-modal information to achieve fine-grained\nrepresentations of the speech and language modalities.

They are the only class of novae in which the white dwarf can grow\nin mass, making some of these systems strong Type Ia supernova progenitor\ncandidates. Almost all known recurrent novae are long-period (P_orb > 12 hrs)\nbinary systems in which the requisite mass supply rate can be provided by an\nevolved (sub-)giant donor star. However, at least two recurrent novae are\nshort-period (P_orb < 3 hrs) binaries in which mass transfer would normally be\ndriven by gravitational radiation at rates 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than\nrequired. Here, we show that the prototype of this class -- T Pyxidis -- has a\ndistant proper motion companion and therefore likely evolved from a\nhierarchical triple star system. Triple evolution can naturally produce exotic\ncompact binaries as a result of three-body dynamics, either by Kozai-Lidov\neccentricity cycles in dynamically stable systems or via mass-loss-induced\ndynamical instabilities.

How their huge black holes formed in\nsuch short times is debated, particularly as they lie above the local black\nhole mass-galaxy dynamical mass correlation, thus following the black\nhole-dominance growth path. It is unknown what slowed down the black hole\ngrowth, leading towards the symbiotic growth observed in the local Universe,\nand when this process started, although black hole feedback is a likely driver.\nThis deadlock is due to the lack of large, homogeneous samples of high-redshift\nquasars with high-quality, broad-band spectroscopic information. Here we report\nresults from a VLT/X-shooter survey of 30 quasars at redshift 5.8$\\le$z$\\le$6.6\n(XQR-30).

XQR-30 BAL quasars\nexhibit extreme outflow velocities, up to 17% of the light speed, rarely\nobserved at lower redshift. These outflows inject large amounts of energy into\nthe galaxy interstellar medium, which can contrast nuclear gas accretion,\nslowing down the black-hole growth. The star-formation rate in high-z quasar\nhosts is generally $>$100 M$_\\odot$/yr, so these galaxies are growing at a fast\nrate. The BAL phase may then mark the beginning of significant feedback, acting\nfirst on black hole growth and possibly later on galaxy growth.

The principal observation of\nthis work is that the multiple local minima and energy barriers in a landscape\ncan often occur as a result of discrete symmetries in the potential energy\nfunction. A new Monte Carlo method is proposed, group action Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (GA-MCMC), which augments more conventional trial moves (e.g. random\njumps, hybrid Monte Carlo, etc.) with the application of a group action from a\nwell-chosen generating set of the discrete symmetry group; the result is a\nframework for symmetry-adapted MCMC. It is shown that conventional trial moves\nare generally optimal for \"local mixing\" rates, i.e. sampling a single energy\nwell; whereas the group action portion of the GA-MCMC trial move allows the\nMarkov chain to propagate between energy wells and can vastly improve the rate\nof \"global mixing\". The proposed method is compared with standard jumps and\numbrella sampling (a popular alternative for energy landscapes with barriers)\nfor potential energies with translational, reflection, and rotational\nsymmetries. GA-MCMC is shown to consistently outperform the considered\nalternatives, even when the symmetry of the potential energy function is\nbroken. The work culminates by extending GA-MCMC to a clustering-type algorithm\nfor interacting dielectric polymer chains. Not only does GA-MCMC again\noutperform the considered alternatives, but it is the only method which\nconsistently converges for all of the cases considered. Some new and\ninteresting phenomena regarding the electro-elasticity of dielectric polymer\nchains, unveiled via GA-MCMC, is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 18:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Efficient tidal interactions between hot Jupiters and the\nconvective envelopes present in lower-mass main sequence stars have been a\npopular explanation for these observations.

The\nCross Correlation Function (CCF) method is one of the traditional approaches\nfor RV extraction. More recently, template matching was introduced as an\nadvantageous alternative for M-dwarf stars. In this paper, we describe a new\nimplementation of template matching within a semi-Bayesian framework, providing\na more statistically principled characterization of the RV measurements. In\nthis context, a common RV shift is used to describe the difference between each\nspectral order of a given stellar spectrum and a template built from the\navailable observations. Posterior probability distributions are obtained for\nthe relative RV associated with each spectrum, after marginalizing with respect\nto the continuum. This methodology was named S-BART: Semi-Bayesian Approach for\nRVs with Template-matching, and it can be applied to HARPS and ESPRESSO. The\napplication of our method to HARPS archival observations of Barnard's star\nallowed us to validate our implementation against HARPS-TERRA and SERVAL. Then,\nwe applied it to 33 ESPRESSO targets, evaluating its performance and comparing\nit with the CCF method. We found a decrease in the median RV scatter of \\sim\n10\\% and \\sim 4\\% for M- and K-type stars, respectively. S-BART yields more\nprecise RV estimates than the CCF method, particularly in the case of M-type\nstars where a median uncertainty of \\sim 15 cm/s is achieved over 309\nobservations. Further, we estimated the nightly zero point (NZP) of ESPRESSO,\nfinding a weighted NZP scatter below \\sim 0.7 m/s. As this includes stellar\nvariability, photon noise, and potential planetary signals, it should be taken\nas an upper limit of the RV precision attainable with ESPRESSO data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 20:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

However, the periodic arrangement of the\nunit cells leads to coherent constructive and destructive interference in the\nscattered field in some directions which is undesirable for achieving acoustic\ndiffusivity. The spatial uniformity of acoustic energy scattered from\nconventional diffusers constructed in this way is a fundamental limitation of\nthe traditional approach which is not easily overcome when one wishes to cover\nlarge reflecting surfaces.

A standard\nway to proceed is with benefit risk analysis, often under the Bayesian paradigm\nto account for uncertainty and combine data with expert judgement, which is\noperationalised via multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) scores. The\nprocedure is based on a suitable model to accommodate key features of the data,\nwhich are typically of mixed type and potentially depended, with factor models\nproviding a standard choice. The contribution of this paper is threefold:\nfirst, we extend the family of existing structured factor models. Second, we\nprovide a framework for choosing between them, which combines fit and\nout-of-sample predictive performance. Third, we present a sequential estimation\nframework that can offer multiple benefits: (i) it allows us to efficiently\nre-estimate MCDA scores of different drugs each time new data become available,\nthus getting an idea on potential fluctuations in differences between them,\n(ii) it can provide information on potential early stopping in cases of evident\nconclusions, thus reducing unnecessary further exposure to undesirable\ntreatments; (iii) it can potentially allow to assign treatment groups\ndynamically based on research objectives.

This has\nprohibited adoption of such models for cascading failure simulation. To solve\nthis, we propose a fast cascading failure simulation approach based on implicit\nBackward Euler method (BEM) with stiff decay property. Unfortunately, BEM\nsuffers from hyperstability issue in case of oscillatory instability and\nconverges to the unstable equilibrium. We propose a predictor-corrector\napproach to fully address the hyperstability issue in BEM. The predictor\nidentifies oscillatory instability based on eigendecomposition of the system\nmatrix at the post-disturbance unstable equilibrium obtained as a byproduct of\nBEM. The corrector uses right eigenvectors to identify the group of machines\nparticipating in the unstable mode. This helps in applying appropriate\nprotection schemes as in ground truth.

Nevertheless, the adiabatic\nrepresentation is plagued with severe limitations when conical intersections\nare involved: the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOCs) are\nnon-integrable, and the geometric phase effect on the nuclear wavepackets\ncannot be accounted for unless a model is available.

However, not all scientific news article cites proper\nsources, such as original scientific papers. A portion of scientific news\narticles contain misinterpreted, exaggerated, or distorted information that\ndeviates from facts asserted in the original papers. Manually identifying\nproper citations is laborious and costly. Therefore, it is necessary to\nautomatically search for pertinent scientific papers that could be used as\nevidence for a given piece of scientific news. We propose a system called SciEv\nthat searches for scientific evidence papers given a scientific news article.\nThe system employs a 2-stage query paradigm with the first stage retrieving\ncandidate papers and the second stage reranking them. The key feature of SciEv\nis it uses domain knowledge entities (DKEs) to find candidates in the first\nstage, which proved to be more effective than regular keyphrases. In the\nreranking stage, we explore different document representations for news\narticles and candidate papers. To evaluate our system, we compiled a pilot\ndataset consisting of 100 manually curated (news,paper) pairs from ScienceAlert\nand similar websites. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset of this\nkind. Our experiments indicate that the transformer model performs the best for\nDKE extraction. The system achieves a P@1=50%, P@5=71%, and P@10=74% when it\nuses a TFIDF-based text representation. The transformer-based re-ranker\nachieves a comparable performance but costs twice as much time. We will collect\nmore data and test the system for user experience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 01:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Methods: Motion compensation is challenging\nto incorporate into high spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction due to the\nmemory footprint of the motion fields and the potential to lose dynamics by\nrelying on an initial high temporal resolution, low spatial resolution\nreconstruction. Motivated by the work of Ong Et al. and Huttinga Et al., we\nestimate low spatial resolution motion fields through a loss enforced in\nk-space and represent these motion fields in a memory efficient manner using\nmulti-scale low rank components. We interpolate these motion fields to the\ndesired spatial resolution, and then incorporate these fields into Extreme MRI.\nResults: MoCo-MSLR was able to improve image quality for reconstructions around\n500ms temporal resolution and capture bulk motion not seen in Extreme MRI.\nFurther, MoCo-MSLR was able to resolve realistic cardiac dynamics at near 100ms\ntemporal resolution while Extreme MRI struggled to resolve these dynamics.\nConclusion: MoCo-MSLR improved image quality over Extreme MRI and was able to\nresolve both respiratory and cardiac motion in 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 02:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Naturally, one might expect video retrieval to support\nnatural-language queries with negation, e.g., finding shots of kids sitting on\nthe floor and not playing with a dog. However, the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning based video retrieval models lack such ability, as they are typically\ntrained on video description datasets such as MSR-VTT and VATEX that lack\nnegated descriptions. Their retrieved results basically ignore the negator in\nthe sample query, incorrectly returning videos showing kids playing with dog.\nThis paper presents the first study on learning to understand negation in video\nretrieval and make contributions as follows. By re-purposing two existing\ndatasets (MSR-VTT and VATEX), we propose a new evaluation protocol for video\nretrieval with negation. We propose a learning based method for training a\nnegation-aware video retrieval model. The key idea is to first construct a soft\nnegative caption for a specific training video by partially negating its\noriginal caption, and then compute a bidirectionally constrained loss on the\ntriplet. This auxiliary loss is weightedly added to a standard retrieval loss.\nExperiments on the re-purposed benchmarks show that re-training the CLIP\n(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model by the proposed method clearly\nimproves its ability to handle queries with negation.

Numerous works have focused on determining nonlinear physical processes\nthrough model selection methods. However, identifying corresponding nonlinear\nsystems for different physical phenomena using numerical methods can be\ncomputationally prohibitive. With the advent of machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms, more efficient surrogate models based on neural networks (NNs) have\nbeen developed in various disciplines. In this work, a theory-guided U-net\n(TgU-net) framework is proposed for surrogate modeling of three-dimensional\n(3D) groundwater contaminant problems in order to efficiently elucidate their\ninvolved processes and unknown parameters. In TgU-net, the underlying governing\nequations are embedded into the loss function of U-net as soft constraints. For\nthe considered groundwater contaminant problem, sorption is considered to be a\npotential process of an uncertain type, and three equilibrium sorption isotherm\ntypes (i.e., linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir) are considered. Different from\ntraditional approaches in which one model corresponds to one equation, these\nthree sorption types are modeled through only one TgU-net surrogate. The three\nmentioned sorption terms are integrated into one equation by assigning\nindicators. Accurate predictions illustrate the satisfactory generalizability\nand extrapolability of the constructed TgU-net. Furthermore, based on the\nconstructed TgU-net surrogate, a data assimilation method is employed to\nidentify the physical process and parameters simultaneously. This work shows\nthe possibility of governing equation discovery of physical problems that\ncontain multiple and even uncertain processes by using deep learning and data\nassimilation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 02:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

The transported\ncurrent is a topological invariant that is intimately related to the integer\nquantum Hall effect. Most of the previous works focus on topological pumping in\nlinear and square lattices. In this work, we theoretically propose a mechanism\nto perform topological pumping in arrays of spin chains with complex\ngeometries. To achieve this, we consider an array where the spin chains are\ncoupled through their edges, which allows to split the populations to generate\nsuperpositions of spin excitations in different spin chains. We show that due\nto the topological protection, the quantum superpositions can be transported\nthrough the array against the effect of disorder. This approach will open a new\navenue to transport excitations and correlated states with potential\napplications in quantum technologies and information processing. Our ideas can\nbe realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulators such as cold atoms and\nsuperconducting qubit arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 03:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

We investigate the drawbacks of previous studies and\nfind that a coarse-grained discriminator is insufficient for supervising a font\ngenerator. To this end, we propose a novel Component-Aware Module (CAM), which\nsupervises the generator to decouple content and style at a more fine-grained\nlevel, i.e., the component level. Different from previous studies struggling to\nincrease the complexity of generators, we aim to perform more effective\nsupervision for a relatively simple generator to achieve its full potential,\nwhich is a brand new perspective for font generation. The whole framework\nachieves remarkable results by coupling component-level supervision with\nadversarial learning, hence we call it Component-Guided GAN, shortly CG-GAN.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\none-shot font generation methods.

Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN\nclassifiers may output misclassifications as they experience tasks in their\noperational environments, that were not identified during development. Removing\na system from operation and retraining it to include these new tasks becomes\neconomically infeasible as the number of such ASs increases. Additionally, such\nmisclassifications may cause financial loss and safety threats to the AS or to\nother operators in the environment. In this paper, we propose to reduce such\nthreats by investigating how DNN classifiers can adapt their knowledge to learn\nnew information in the AS's operational environment, using only a limited\nnumber of observations encountered sequentially during operation. This allows\nthe AS to adapt to newly encountered information, increasing the AS's\nclassification accuracy and hence its overall reliability. However, retraining\nDNNs on different observations than used in prior training is known to cause\ncatastrophic forgetting or significant model drift. We investigate how this\nproblem can be controlled by using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) whilst\nlearning from limited new observations. We carry out experiments using original\nand noisy versions of the MNIST dataset to represent known and new information\nto DNN classifiers.

To render the uncertainty of DE reliable, we propose a\nrefinement of DE where the functional inconsistency is explicitly\ncharacterized, and further tuned w.r.t. the training data and certain priori\nbeliefs. Specifically, we describe the functional inconsistency with the\nempirical covariance of the functions dictated by ensemble members, which,\nalong with the mean, define a Gaussian process (GP).

Consequently, deep learning-based program\nrepair techniques leverage context for bug fixes. However, existing techniques\ntreat context in an arbitrary manner, by extracting code in close proximity of\nthe buggy statement within the enclosing file, class, or method, without any\nanalysis to find actual relations with the bug. To reduce noise, they use a\npredefined maximum limit on the number of tokens to be used as context. We\npresent a program slicing-based approach, in which instead of arbitrarily\nincluding code as context, we analyze statements that have a control or data\ndependency on the buggy statement. We propose a novel concept called dual\nslicing, which leverages the context of both buggy and fixed versions of the\ncode to capture relevant repair ingredients. We present our technique and tool\ncalled Katana, the first to apply slicing-based context for a program repair\ntask. The results show Katana effectively preserves sufficient information for\na model to choose contextual information while reducing noise. We compare\nagainst four recent state-of-the-art context-aware program repair techniques.\nOur results show Katana fixes between 1.5 to 3.7 times more bugs than existing\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 07:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 20:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 22:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

The spectral element method is used to discretize\nthe spatial fluid domain, whereas the classical explicit 4-stage 4th order\nRunge-Kutta scheme is employed for the temporal integration.

For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which\nconsist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such\nas power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a\ntypical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a\ncomputer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is\ncentrally managed at the operator's servers, making it vulnerable to insider\nthreats.\n  Our goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor\nnetworks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider\nthreats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks\nagainst data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders\nin the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to\nanalyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote\nfirmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs.\nHowever, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability\nlimit the applicability of these existing mechanisms. We propose the\nFeather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure (FLBI) framework to address these\nlimitations. Our framework leverages a two-layer architecture and cryptographic\nthreshold signature chains to support large networks of low-capacity devices\nsuch as meters and data aggregators.

Precise constraints on the spatial\ndistribution and properties of carbonaceous dust particles are essential to\nunderstanding the physics of the disk. The HD 169142 disk is seen almost\nface-on and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the dust radial\nevolution. We investigate the spatial distribution and properties of the\ncarriers of several dust aromatic emission features in the disk across a broad\nspatial range (10-200 AU). We analysed imaging and spectroscopic observations\nin the 8-12 microns range from VLT/VISIR, as well as adaptive optics\nspectroscopic observations in the 3-4 microns range from VLT/NACO. The data\nprobes the spatial evolution of the 3.3, 8.6, and 11.3 microns aromatic bands.\nTo constrain the radial distribution of carbonaceous nano-grains, the\nobservations were compared to models using The Heterogeneous dust Evolution\nModel for Interstellar Solids (THEMIS), integrated into the POLARIS radiative\ntransfer code by calculating the thermal and stochastic heating of\nsub-micrometer dust grains. Our data show predominant nano-particle emission at\nall radii (resolution of about 0.1\", 12 AU at 3 microns and 0.3\", 35 AU at 10\nmicrons) in the HD 169142 disk. This unambiguously shows that carbonaceous\nnano-grains dominate radiatively the infrared spectrum in most of the disk, as\nsuggested by previous studies. In order to account for both VISIR and NACO\nemission maps, we show the need for aromatic particles distributed within the\ndisk from the outermost regions to a radius of 20 AU, corresponding to the\nouter limit of the inner cavity derived from previous observations. In the\ninner cavity, these aromatic particles might be present but their abundance\nwould then be significantly decreased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 08:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Four different communication\nscenarios including 90 transmitter-receiver pairs are measured in two channel\nmeasurement campaigns of a meeting room and an office room, respectively. The\ntwo measurement campaigns contains four scenarios, namely, a meeting room,\ncubicle area, hallway and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) case. The propagation of\nmulti-path components (MPCs) in the four scenarios is characterized by the\npower-delay-angular profiles.

We find a high plasma\ncurrent (of the order of few $\\mu$A/m2) flowing at the magnetospheric\nboundaries (bow shock and magnetopause) dominated by electrons. This current is\ndriven by the small-scale electron physics resolved in our model. Furthermore,\nwe observe strong electron acceleration up to tens of keV as a consequence of\nmagnetic reconnection when the interplanetary magnetic field is directed\nsouthward. Such energetic electrons are partially trapped in the dipolar\nmagnetic field of the planet mainly at nightside. Finally, by studying the\ndistribution of electrons in our simulations along Mariner10 and BepiColombo\nfirst-Mercury-flyby trajectories, we propose that both spacecraft observed this\nenergetic quasi-trapped electron population around closest approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 10:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

When objects or vehicles are\nmoving, which is the case of industrial or vehicular environments, multiple\nsuccessive representations of the environment (\"snapshots\") and multiple ray\ntracing runs are often necessary, which require a great human effort and a\ngreat deal of computation resources. Recently, the Dynamic Ray Tracing (DRT)\napproach has been proposed to predict the multipath evolution within a given\ntime lapse on the base of the current multipath geometry, assuming constant\nspeeds and/or accelerations for moving objects, using analytical extrapolation\nformulas. This is done without re-running a full ray tracing for every\n\"snapshot\" of the environment, therefore with a great computation time saving.\nWhen DRT is embedded in a mobile radio system and used in real-time,\nahead-of-time (or anticipative) field prediction is possible that opens the way\nto interesting applications. In the present work, a full-3D DRT algorithm is\npresented that allows to account for multiple reflections, edge diffraction and\ndiffuse scattering for the general case where moving objects can translate and\nrotate.

The size of the ion source was\n30 mm * 26 mm * 70 mm, and its weight was 70 g. We confirmed that when\nconsuming 3.0 W power, the ion source emits more than 2 mA electrons, which is\n10 times greater than the previous models electron emission level. Ionization\nefficiency of the EI ion source is proportional to the amount of electron\nemission, which implies our new model increased the ionization efficiency 10\ntimes. We conducted performance tests on the prototype with the 3.0 W heating\ncondition, confirming a high ionization efficiency (10^4 nA/Pa). In addition,\nwe conducted endurance tests of the ion source and demonstrated the persistence\nof the ionization efficiency for 30 min * 100 cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 11:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 00:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The actual observable data at the\ntransmitter can also have non-identical distribution with the empirical data in\nthe shared background knowledge library. To address these practical issues,\nthis paper proposes a new neural network-based semantic communication system\nfor image transmission, where the task is unaware at the transmitter and the\ndata environment is dynamic. The system consists of two main parts, namely the\nsemantic coding (SC) network and the data adaptation (DA) network. The SC\nnetwork learns how to extract and transmit the semantic information using a\nreceiver-leading training process. By using the domain adaptation technique\nfrom transfer learning, the DA network learns how to convert the data observed\ninto a similar form of the empirical data that the SC network can process\nwithout retraining.

Thermal face imagery is still a\nrelatively new research area to be evaluated and studied in different\ndomains.The current thermal face datasets are limited in regards to the\nsubjects' distance from the camera, the ambient temperature variation, and\nfacial landmarks' localization. We address these gaps by presenting a new\nfacial thermography dataset. This article makes two main contributions to the\nbody of knowledge. First, it presents a comprehensive review and comparison of\ncurrent public datasets in facial thermography. Second, it introduces and\nstudies a novel public dataset on facial thermography, which we call it\nCharlotte-ThermalFace. Charlotte-ThermalFace contains more than10000 infrared\nthermal images in varying thermal conditions, several distances from the\ncamera, and different head positions. The data is fully annotated with the\nfacial landmarks, ambient temperature, relative humidity, the air speed of the\nroom, distance to the camera, and subject thermal sensation at the time of\ncapturing each image. Our dataset is the first publicly available thermal\ndataset annotated with the thermal sensation of each subject in different\nthermal conditions and one of the few datasets in raw 16-bit format. Finally,\nwe present a preliminary analysis of the dataset to show the applicability and\nimportance of the thermal conditions in facial thermography.

Feeder\nbus service fills the area that is far from the railway system; therefore,\ndesigning a feeder network in a gap area causes the expansion of the main\ntransit network. Purpose: To present a modified potential demand model for\ndesigning a multi-circulation feeder network. Materials and Methods: In this\nstudy, the potential demand is defined based on the traffic demand of each\nsection related to each link, the average walking distance of passengers to\nspecified links, the distance from the links to stations, and finally potential\ndemand of accessing each main station for each link. A labelling method is used\nto create continuous circular and separated routes. After generating an initial\nsolution using a constructive heuristic algorithm, a genetic algorithm was\noperated to solve the problem. In the second algorithm, each route is\nconsidered a gene, and each network is considered a chromosome. In fact, in\nthis step, different routes from diverse solutions are combined as a unique\nfeeder network.

The driving scene is complicated, and\nthere exists heterogeneity within elements, where they own diverse types of\ninformation i.e., agent dynamics, map routing, road lines, etc. Meanwhile,\nthere also exist relativity across elements - meaning they have spatial\nrelations with each other; such relations should be canonically represented\nregarding the relative measurements since the absolute value of the coordinate\nis meaningless. Taking these two observations into consideration, we propose a\nnovel backbone, namely Heterogeneous Driving Graph Transformer (HDGT), which\nmodels the driving scene as a heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes\nand edges. For graph construction, each node represents either an agent or a\nroad element and each edge represents their semantics relations such as\nPedestrian-To-Crosswalk, Lane-To-Left-Lane. As for spatial relation encoding,\ninstead of setting a fixed global reference, the coordinate information of the\nnode as well as its in-edges is transformed to the local node-centric\ncoordinate system. For the aggregation module in the graph neural network\n(GNN), we adopt the transformer structure in a hierarchical way to fit the\nheterogeneous nature of inputs.

Secondly, the\npipeline of simulating stream data is proposed, which can accurately and\nefficiently simulate the characteristics of the stream data to improve\nefficiency for specific tasks. Finally, we design and implement a novel\nframework that can simulate various stream data for related stream processing\ntasks. To verify the validity of the proposed framework, we apply this\nframework to stream processing task running in the stream processing system.\nThe experimental results reveal that the related stream processing task is\naccelerated by at least 24 times using our proposed simulation framework with\nthe premise of ensuring volatility and trends of stream data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 09:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 08:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

The surrogate model based\non neural networks shows significant potential in balancing efficiency and\naccuracy. However, its serial information flow and prediction based on\nsingle-level features adversely affect the network performance. Therefore, a\nweighted stacked pyramid neural network architecture is proposed herein. This\nnetwork establishes a pyramid architecture by introducing multi-level shortcuts\nto directly integrate features in the output module. In addition, a weighted\nstacked strategy is proposed to replace the conventional feature fusion method.\nThe weights of the features are determined based on their levels. These basic\nprinciples are verified, and key network settings are discussed. Subsequently,\nthe redesigned architectures are compared with other commonly used algorithms.\nResults show that the testing mean-square error (MSE) loss of the networks on\nvaried datasets can be reduced by an average of 34.7%. The redesigned\narchitectures outperform 87.5% of cases, and the proposed Pyramid-GA network\nhas the best overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 16:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}
