This construction permits to\ndesign shorter signatures but induces a non negligible performance overhead as\nit uses cut-and-choose. In this paper, we introduce the PoK leveraging\nstructure paradigm along with its associated challenge space amplification\ntechnique. Our new approach to design PoK brings some improvements over the PoK\nwith Helper one.

The multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform\nactually helps in achieving this objective by caching popular contents at the\nedge of cellular network. This not only reduces the delivery latency, but also\nthe load and the cost of the backhaul links. However, MEC platforms are\nafflicted by constrained resources in terms of storage and processing\ncapabilities; and centralized caching of contents may nullify the advantage of\nreduced latency by lowering the offloading probability. Distributed caching at\nthe edge not only improves the offloading probability, but also dynamically\nadjusts the load distribution among the MEC servers. In this article, we\npropose an architecture for deployment of MEC platforms by exploiting the\ncharacteristics of a scalable video encoding technique. The layered video\ncoding techniques, such as the scalable video coding (SVC), is used by the\ncontent providers to adjust to the network dynamics, by dynamically dropping\npackets in order to reduce latency. We show how an SVC video easily lends\nitself to distributed caching at the edge. Then we investigate the\nlatency-storage trade-off by storing the video layers at different parts of the\naccess networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 16:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

In contrast, branch mappings employ branch\nproperties instead of node similarity information, and are independent of\npredetermined branch decompositions. Especially for topological features, which\nare typically based on branch properties, this allows a more intuitive distance\nmeasure which is also less susceptible to instabilities from small-scale\nperturbations.

We summarize\ngeneralizations to other types of decay and a variety of applications to BSM.\nThe energy-peak idea can also furnish a measurement of the top quark via the\nenergy of the bottom quark from its decay, which, based on the\n\"parent-boost-invariance,\" is less sensitive to details of the production\nmechanism of the top quark (cf.~most other methods assume purely SM production\nof the top quarks, hence are subject to uncertainties therein, including a\npossible BSM contribution).

The effect of end-to-end\nlearning is not systematically evaluated. Besides, there lacks an in-depth\nstudy on the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in end-to-end TAD. In this paper, we\npresent an empirical study of end-to-end temporal action detection.

Equally important is the temporal evolution of a star's luminosity\nbecause of its intimate connection with the stellar energy budget, large-scale\nconvective motion, and heat storage in the stellar interior. Here, we model the\nsolar luminosity by extending a semi-empirical total solar irradiance (TSI)\nmodel that uses solar-surface magnetism to reconstruct solar irradiance over\nthe entire 4{\\pi} solid angle around the Sun. This model was constrained by\ncomparing its output to the irradiance in the Earth's direction with the\nmeasured TSI. Comparing the solar luminosity to the TSI on timescales from days\nto for cycles 23 and 24, we find poor agreement on short timescales (< solar\nrotation). On longer timescales, however, we find good agreement between the\nluminosity model and the TSI, which suggests that the extrapolation of\nluminosities to multi-cycle timescales based on TSI reconstructions may be\npossible. We show that the solar luminosity is not constant but varies in phase\nwith the solar cycle. This variation has an amplitude of 0.14% from minimum to\nmaximum for solar cycle 23. Considering the energetics in the solar convection\nzone, it is therefore obvious that a steady-state input from the radiative zone\nat the solar minimum level would lead to a gradual reduction in the energy\ncontent in the convection zone over multi-century timescales. We show that the\nluminosity at the base of the convection zone should be approximately 0.032%\nhigher than that at the solar surface during solar minimum to maintain net\nenergy equilibrium through the solar cycle. These different energy-input\nscenarios place constraints on the long-term evolution of the total solar\nirradiance and its impact on the solar forcing of climate variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 17:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-20"}

The age of information (AoI) of any\nsource is a function of the time difference between the departure time of\nsuccessive updates of that source. Each fully/partially transmitted update\nincurs a fixed (energy) cost, and the goal of the scheduler is to minimize the\nlinear combination of the sum of the age of information across all sources and\nthe total energy cost. We propose a simple non-preemptive randomized scheduling\nalgorithm that randomly marks arriving updates from a source to be eligible for\ntransmission with a fixed probability and discards them otherwise.

In theory, the majority of brain tumours could well be\nidentified exclusively by the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Each MRI\nmodality delivers distinct information on the soft tissue of the human brain\nand integrating all of them would provide comprehensive data for the accurate\nsegmentation of the glioma, which is crucial for the patient's prognosis,\ndiagnosis, and determining the best follow-up treatment. Unfortunately, MRI is\nprone to artifacts for a variety of reasons, which might result in missing one\nor more MRI modalities. Various strategies have been proposed over the years to\nsynthesize the missing modality or compensate for the influence it has on\nautomated segmentation models. However, these methods usually fail to model the\nunderlying missing information. In this paper, we propose a style matching\nU-Net (SMU-Net) for brain tumour segmentation on MRI images.

To do so, we encode both full-modality and missing-modality data into\na latent space, then we decompose the representation space into a style and\ncontent representation. Our style matching module adaptively recalibrates the\nrepresentation space by learning a matching function to transfer the\ninformative and textural features from a full-modality path into a\nmissing-modality path. Moreover, by modelling the mutual information, our\ncontent module surpasses the less informative features and re-calibrates the\nrepresentation space based on discriminative semantic features.

Since\nthe 1960's, the affirmative answer to this question has been well-understood\nfor $2 \\to 2$ scattering of the lightest particle in theories with a mass gap\nat low momentum transfer, where the S-matrix is analytic everywhere except at\nnormal-threshold branch cuts. We ask whether an analogous picture extends to\nrealistic theories, such as the Standard Model, that include massless fields,\nUV/IR divergences, and unstable particles. Especially in the presence of light\nstates running in the loops, the traditional $i\\varepsilon$ prescription for\napproaching physical regions might break down, because causality requirements\nfor the individual Feynman diagrams can be mutually incompatible. We\ndemonstrate that such analyticity problems are not in contradiction with\nunitarity. Instead, they should be thought of as finite-width effects that\ndisappear in the idealized $2\\to 2$ scattering amplitudes with no unstable\nparticles, but might persist at higher multiplicity. To fix these issues, we\npropose an $i\\varepsilon$-like prescription for deforming branch cuts in the\nspace of Mandelstam invariants without modifying the analytic properties. This\nprocedure results in a complex strip around the real part of the kinematic\nspace, where the S-matrix remains causal. In addition to giving a pedagogical\nintroduction to the analytic properties of the perturbative S-matrix from a\nmodern point of view, we illustrate all the points on explicit examples, both\nsymbolically and numerically.

The sequence of high-alpha\nin-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected\nnon-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first\ndeclines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3<[Fe/H]<-0.7, and\nthen declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ\npopulation rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these\nstars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]<-1 and then become\nincreasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities.

However, to realise the Standard Model at low energies, the\nunified symmetry group has to be partially broken by a suitable scalar\npotential in just the right way. The scalar potential contains several\ncouplings, whose values dictate the residual symmetry at a global minimum. Some\n(and possibly many) of the corresponding symmetry-breaking patterns are\nincompatible with the Standard Model and therefore non-admissible. Here, we\ninitiate a systematic study of radiative symmetry breaking to thereby constrain\nviable initial conditions for the scalar couplings, for instance, at the Planck\nscale. We combine these new constraints on an admissible scalar potential with\nwell-known constraints in the gauge-Yukawa sector into a general blueprint that\ncarves out the viable effective-field-theory parameter space of any underlying\ntheory of quantum gravity.

A network of wireless sensors is needed to monitor the\nspectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area.\nEach sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on\nits location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network (DNN)\naccordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors\nmay exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion\ncenter (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed\nfederated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to\ncollectively train a DNN for signal identification. In distributed federated\nlearning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects\nthe DNN models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own\nmodel for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data,\nthis process is repeated over time such that a common DNN is built across the\nnetwork while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at\ndifferent locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are\nevaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid,\nand random networks) and packet loss events. Then, the reduction of\ncommunication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random\nparticipation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of\nextending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless\nnetwork through federated learning and indicate its robustness to wireless\nnetwork effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication\noverhead and energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 18:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

The\nf-mode is known to correlate in normal neutron stars with their tidal\ndeformability, moment of inertia and quadrupole moment. Using a piecewise\npolytropic parameterization scheme to model the uncertain hadronic high-density\nEOS and a constant sound-speed scheme to model pure quark matter, we refine\nthis correlation and show that these universal relations also apply to both\nself-bound stars and hybrid stars containing phase transitions. We identify a\nnovel 1-node branch of the f-mode that occurs in low-mass hybrid stars in a\nnarrow mass range just beyond the critical mass necessary for a phase\ntransition to appear. This 1-node branch shows the largest, but still small,\ndeviations from the universal correlation we have found. The g-mode frequency\nonly exists in matter with a non-barotropic equation of state involving\ntemperature, chemical potential or composition, or a phase transition in\nbarotropic matter. The g-mode therefore could serve as a probe for studying\nphase transitions in hybrid stars. In contrast with the f-mode, discontinuity\ng-mode frequencies depend strongly on properties of the transition (the density\nand the magnitude of the discontinuity) at the transition. Imposing causality\nand maximum mass constraints, the g-mode frequency in hybrid stars is found to\nhave an upper bound of about 1.25 kHz. However, if the sound speed c_s in the\ninner core at densities above the phase transition density is restricted to\nc_s^2 < c^2/3, the g-mode frequencies can only reach about 0.8 kHz, which are\nsignificantly lower than f-mode frequencies, 1.3-2.8 kHz.

Myopically\nmaximizing customer satisfaction by ranking products only according to\nrelevance will lead to unfair distribution of exposure for products, followed\nby unfair opportunities and economic gains for product producers. This\nunfairness will force producers to leave the system, and discourage new\nproducers from coming in. Eventually, fewer purchase options would be left for\ncustomers and the overall transaction rates on e-commerce platforms would\ndecrease. Thus, how to maintain a balance between ranking relevance and\nfairness is important to both producers and customers. In this paper, we focus\non the task of exposure fairness in offline recommendation settings. We\ndemonstrate that existing methods for amortized fairness optimization are\nsuboptimal for offline recommendation because they fail to utilize the prior\nknowledge of customers. We further propose a novel fair recommendation\nalgorithm to reach a better balance between exposure fairness and\nrecommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art fair\nranking algorithm in terms of fairness-performance trade off from both\nindividual level and group level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Approximate solvers, or surrogates, greatly reduce the\ncomputational cost but can introduce significant biases, for example in the\nnon-linear regime of cosmic structure growth.

The aim of this work is to propose a deepfake\ndetector that can cope with the wide variety of manipulation methods and\nscenarios encountered in the real world. Our key insight is that each person\nhas specific characteristics that a synthetic generator likely cannot\nreproduce. Accordingly, we extract audio-visual features which characterize the\nidentity of a person, and use them to create a person-of-interest (POI)\ndeepfake detector. We leverage a contrastive learning paradigm to learn the\nmoving-face and audio segment embeddings that are most discriminative for each\nidentity. As a result, when the video and/or audio of a person is manipulated,\nits representation in the embedding space becomes inconsistent with the real\nidentity, allowing reliable detection. Training is carried out exclusively on\nreal talking-face video; thus, the detector does not depend on any specific\nmanipulation method and yields the highest generalization ability. In addition,\nour method can detect both single-modality (audio-only, video-only) and\nmulti-modality (audio-video) attacks, and is robust to low-quality or corrupted\nvideos.

The observed formations of\nbirds-in-flight are studied with a thermal model. Avian formation-flying is\ntested as a self-organization process. The maximum entropy production rate\n(MEPR) postulate is examined to determine its applicability to the observed V\nformation during the long-distance migration of large birds. A brief discussion\nof the principles of the rate of entropy generation maximization or\nminimization is first presented. The V formation is compared to other closely\nrelated, but distinctly different formations that can also be adopted by a\nflock. The thermodynamic analysis from the results of the model indicates that\nthe V formation (named the SV formation in the article) is found to be the\npattern that optimizes energy use for the flight duration. This is accomplished\nwith savings in the formation's thermal energy output (heat) by the trailing\nbirds. The MEPR postulate is found to hold for the V formation. The formation\nalso provides for the highest comfort temperatures, perhaps thereby allowing\nfor high altitude (low drag) flight levels to be accessed by the birds. The\nresults of the model point to thermal awareness as a possible key driver for\norganization into a V formation. The thermal model appears to validate all the\nmajor experimental observations of avian formation flying. Regardless, without\ndetailed thermal measurements to validate, and without a physical basis for the\nconstant used in equation (C4d), it is not yet definitive that this thermal\nmodel is valid for avian flight formation. The analysis appears to indicate\nthat the organization into patterns of live objects may follow the MEPR\nprinciple for self-organization in a manner previously noted for chemical and\nmetallurgical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 21:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images\nand linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since\nsynthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which\nlearns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the\ncorresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the\nUV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be\neasily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned\nin an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module,\ntaking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The\nlearned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of\napplications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single\nview 3D reconstruction.

Our approach utilizes\ncertificates--either Lyapunov or barrier functions--to design intermittent\ntrigger laws that guarantee stability or safety; the controller is turned on\nfor the period for which is beneficial with regard to the certificate, and\nturned off until a performance threshold is reached. The main result of this\npaper is that the intermittent controller scheme guarantees (set) stability\nwhen Lyapunov functions are utilized, and safety (forward set invariance) in\nthe setting of barrier functions. As a result, our trigger designs can leverage\nthe intermittent nature of the actuator, and at the same time, achieve the task\nof stabilization or safety. We further demonstrate the application and benefits\nof intermittent control in the context of the spacecraft orbit stabilization\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 21:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Two IGR tasks have been studied extensively:\ntext-guided garment retrieval (TGR) and visually compatible garment retrieval\n(VCR). The user feedback for the former indicates what semantic attributes to\nchange with the garment category preserved, while the category is the only\nthing to be changed explicitly for the latter, with an implicit requirement on\nstyle preservation. Despite the similarity between these two tasks and the\npractical need for an efficient system tackling both, they have never been\nunified and modeled jointly.

An accurate treatment of the\nsolar chromosphere is complicated by the effects arising from Non Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer. A small number of strong,\nhighly scattering lines dominate the cooling and heating in the chromosphere.\nAdditionally, the recombination times of ionised hydrogen are longer than the\ndynamical timescales, requiring a non-equilibrium (NE) treatment of hydrogen\nionisation. The MURaM code is extended to include the physical process required\nfor accurate simulation of the solar chromosphere, as implemented in the\nBifrost code. This includes a time-dependent treatment of hydrogen ionisation,\na scattering multi-group radiation transfer scheme and approximations for NLTE\nradiative cooling. The inclusion of NE and NLTE physics has a large impact on\nthe structure of the chromosphere; the NE treatment of hydrogen ionisation\nleads to a higher ionisation fraction and enhanced populations in the first\nexcited state throughout cold inter-shock regions of the chromosphere.\nAdditionally this prevents hydrogen ioniation from buffering energy\nfluctuations, leading to hotter shocks and cooler inter-shock regions. The\nhydrogen populations in the ground and first excited state are enhanced by\n$10^2-10^3$ in the upper chromosphere and up to $10^9$ near the transition\nregion.

Yet high-fidelity digital twin models\ncan be computationally expensive, making quick-turnaround assessment\nchallenging. Towards this goal, this article proposes a novel bi-fidelity\nmethod for estimating the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) for nonlinear\nsystems subject to dependent and high-dimensional inputs. For models that can\nbe evaluated fast, a method that integrates the dimensionally decomposed\ngeneralized polynomial chaos expansion (DD-GPCE) approximation with a standard\nsampling-based CVaR estimation is proposed. For expensive-to-evaluate models, a\nnew bi-fidelity method is proposed that couples the DD-GPCE with a\nFourier-polynomial expansion of the mapping between the stochastic low-fidelity\nand high-fidelity output data to ensure computational efficiency. The method\nemploys measure-consistent orthonormal polynomials in the random variable of\nthe low-fidelity output to approximate the high-fidelity output. Numerical\nresults for a structural mechanics truss with 36-dimensional (dependent random\nvariable) inputs indicate that the DD-GPCE method provides very accurate CVaR\nestimates that require much lower computational effort than standard GPCE\napproximations. A second example considers the realistic problem of estimating\nthe risk of damage to a fiber-reinforced composite laminate. The high-fidelity\nmodel is a finite element simulation that is prohibitively expensive for risk\nanalysis, such as CVaR computation. Here, the novel bi-fidelity method can\naccurately estimate CVaR as it includes low-fidelity models in the estimation\nprocedure and uses only a few high-fidelity model evaluations to significantly\nincrease accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 00:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 15:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 07:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 17:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In this work, we propose a\nperception-aware collision avoidance trajectory planner for multicopters, that\nmay be used with any feature-based VIO algorithm. Our approach is able to fly\nthe vehicle to a goal position at fast speed, avoiding obstacles in an unknown\nstationary environment while achieving good VIO state estimation accuracy. The\nproposed planner samples a group of minimum jerk trajectories and finds\ncollision-free trajectories among them, which are then evaluated based on their\nspeed to the goal and perception quality. Both the motion blur of features and\ntheir locations are considered for the perception quality. Our novel\nconsideration of the motion blur of features enables automatic adaptation of\nthe trajectory's aggressiveness under environments with different light levels.\nThe best trajectory from the evaluation is tracked by the vehicle and is\nupdated in a receding horizon manner when new images are received from the\ncamera. Only generic assumptions about the VIO are made, so that the planner\nmay be used with various existing systems. The proposed method can run in\nreal-time on a small embedded computer on board. We validated the effectiveness\nof our proposed approach through experiments in both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments.

We\ndecompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as\nthe outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a\ndeep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the\nmean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit\nregularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal\nstructures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear\nmethods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component\nanalysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance\ndeteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian\nnoise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide\nrange of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and\ncomputationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of\nreal-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI\ntomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB\nsignal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals\ncorrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster\nthan a single DN equipped with 3D convolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 01:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

The correspondence between these codes and submodules of the free\n$\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$-module $\\left(\\mathbb{F}_q[x]\\right)^\\ell$ is established.\nThus, any of these codes corresponds to a free linear code over the principal\nideal domain (PID) $\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$. A basis of this code exists and is used\nto build a generator matrix with polynomial entries, called the generator\npolynomial matrix (GPM). The Hermite normal form of matrices over PIDs is\nexploited to achieve the reduced GPMs of MT codes. Some properties of the\nreduced GPM are introduced, for example, the identical equation.

To address\nthis, in this paper, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework called\nFlexible Sampling for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task.\nSpecifically, we initially sample a subset of training data as anchor points\nbased on the individual class prototypes. Then, these anchor points are used to\npre-train an inference model to evaluate the per-class learning difficulty.\nFinally, we use a curriculum sampling module to dynamically query new samples\nfrom the rest training samples with the learning difficulty-aware sampling\nprobability. We evaluated our model against several state-of-the-art methods on\nthe ISIC dataset. The results with two long-tailed settings have demonstrated\nthe superiority of our proposed training strategy, which achieves a new\nbenchmark for long-tailed skin lesion classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 02:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Two key lines of evidence have argued that these stars have\nnot significantly depleted their initial ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$: i) the lack of\ndispersion in Li abundances measured at low metallicity; and ii) the detection\nof the more fragile ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ isotope in at least two halo stars. The\npurported ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ detections were in good agreement with predictions\nfrom cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis which is responsible for the origin of\n${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$. This concordance left little room for depletion of\n${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ depletion, and implied that the more robust ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$\nlargely evaded destruction. Recent (re)-observations of halo stars challenge\nthe evidence against ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$ depletion: i) lithium abundances now show\nsignificant dispersion, and ii) sensitive ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ searches now reveal\nonly firm upper limits to the ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}/{}^{7}{\\rm Li}$ ratio. The tight\nnew ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ upper limits generally fall far below the predictions of\ncosmic-ray nucleosynthesis, implying that substantial ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$\ndepletion has occurred--by factors up to 50. We show that in stars with\n${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ limits and thus lower bounds on ${}^{6}{\\rm Li}$ depletion, an\nequal amount of ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$ depletion is more than sufficient to resolve\nthe primordial ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$ Problem. This picture is consistent with\nstellar models in which ${}^{7}{\\rm Li}$ is less depleted than ${}^{6}{\\rm\nLi}$, and strengthen the case that the Lithium Problem has an astrophysical\nsolution.

It causes the locally trained models of clients to move\nin different directions. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls the\nglobal updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it\nenlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global\nmodel with poor performance.

For sources as large as quasars we show\nthat gravitational lensing and extinction are the dominant effects, with gas\nrefraction playing only a minor role. We find that clouds with mass\n~10^{-4.5+/-0.5} M_\\odot can reproduce the observed distribution of quasar\nvariation amplitudes, but only if such clouds make up a large fraction of the\nclosure density. In that case there may also be substantial extinction of\ndistant optical sources, which can in principle be constrained by data on\n\"standard candles\" such as type Ia supernovae. Unfortunately that extinction is\nessentially grey, even when the material opacity is strongly wavelength\ndependent, making it difficult to distinguish from the influence of the\nbackground geometry. We propose a novel statistical test of the origin of\nquasar variability, based on the angular structure of the variation timescale\nfor a large number of quasars distributed all over the sky. If quasar\nvariability is primarily due to nanolensing that angular structure is expected\nto include a quadrupole term of amplitude $\\sim5\\%$, which ought to be\nmeasurable with future data from the Gaia mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 03:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

The C standard describes the\nmemory model in terms of cross-thread relationships between events, and has\nbeen influenced by several research works that are similarly based. In this\npaper we provide a thread-local definition of the fundamental principles of the\nC memory model, which, for concise concurrent code, serves as a basis for\nrelatively straightforward reasoning about the effects of the C ordering\nmechanisms.

In this work, we propose a\nhierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework in which a symbolic\ntransition model is learned to efficiently produce high-level plans that can\nguide the agent efficiently solve different tasks. Specifically, the symbolic\ntransition model is learned by inductive logic programming (ILP) to capture\nlogic rules of state transitions. By planning over the product of the symbolic\ntransition model and the automaton derived from the LTL formula, the agent can\nresolve causal dependencies and break a causally complex problem down into a\nsequence of simpler low-level sub-tasks. We evaluate the proposed framework on\nthree environments in both discrete and continuous domains, showing advantages\nover previous representative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 04:01:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 15:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 20:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-14"}

Existing\nlearning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing\ndata are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing\nliterature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have\ndifferent distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and\ntesting distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the\nsolution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when\ntraining and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness,\ni.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is\nchallenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement\nquantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP\ninstances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different\nlevels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these\nchallenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the\nhardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to\ngenerate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum\nlearner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments\nshow that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times\nharder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant\nimprovement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 05:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

While\nthe order parameter of this new phase II'' remains unknown, the discovery\nrenders Ce$_3$Pd$_{20}$Si$_6$ a unique material with two field-driven phase\ntransitions between distinct multipolar phases. They are both clearly\nmanifested in the magnetic-field dependence of the field-induced (111) Bragg\nintensities measured with neutron scattering for $\\mathbf{B} \\parallel [112]$.\nWe also find from inelastic neutron scattering that the number of nondegenerate\ncollective excitations induced by the magnetic field correlates with the number\nof phases in the magnetic phase diagram for the same field direction.\nFurthermore, the magnetic excitation spectrum suggests that the new phase II''\nmay have a different propagation vector, revealed by the minimum in the\ndispersion that may represent the Goldstone mode of this hidden-order phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 06:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Most strikingly, entirely new states not seen in the\nnoiseless system can be induced purely by including multiplicative noise - an\neffect known as pure noise-induced transitions.

Recent results in complex nonequilibrium systems have\nalso shown how new collective states emerge from such pure noise-induced\ntransitions, such as the foraging behavior of insect colonies, and schooling in\nfish. Here we report such effects of noise in a quantum-mechanical system. We\nfind that multiplicative quantum noise can induce a classically forbidden\ntransition. We use a minimal model of a nonlinearly damped oscillator in a\nfluctuating environment that is analytically tractable, and whose microscopic\nphysics can be understood. When environmental noise is included, the system is\nseen to transition to a limit-cycle state. The noise-induced quantum limit\ncycle exhibits genuine nonclassical traits such as Wigner negativity and\nnumber-parity sensitive circulation in phase space. Such quantum limit cycles\nare also conservative. These properties are in stark contrast to those of a\nwidely used limit cycle in the literature, which is dissipative and loses all\nWigner negativity. Our results establish the existence of a pure noise-induced\ntransition that is nonclassical and unique to open quantum systems. They\nillustrate a fundamental difference between quantum and classical noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 07:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 03:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 02:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 05:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 08:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

In this paper, a modified sensor concept is proposed which is able to\nacquire both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution. This is achieved by\ndynamically reading out only a subset of pixels in a non-regular order to\nobtain a high temporal resolution. A full high spatial resolution is then\nobtained by performing a subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction of the\npartially acquired frames.

However, these embeddings are usually assigned a unified\ndimension, which suffers from the following issues: (1) high memory usage and\ncomputation cost. (2) sub-optimal performance due to inferior dimension\nassignments. In order to alleviate the above issues, some works focus on\nautomated embedding dimension search by formulating it as hyper-parameter\noptimization or embedding pruning problems. However, they either require\nwell-designed search space for hyperparameters or need time-consuming\noptimization procedures. In this paper, we propose a Single-Shot Embedding\nDimension Search method, called SSEDS, which can efficiently assign dimensions\nfor each feature field via a single-shot embedding pruning operation while\nmaintaining the recommendation accuracy of the model. Specifically, it\nintroduces a criterion for identifying the importance of each embedding\ndimension for each feature field. As a result, SSEDS could automatically obtain\nmixed-dimensional embeddings by explicitly reducing redundant embedding\ndimensions based on the corresponding dimension importance ranking and the\npredefined parameter budget. Furthermore, the proposed SSEDS is model-agnostic,\nmeaning that it could be integrated into different base recommendation models.\nThe extensive offline experiments are conducted on two widely used public\ndatasets for CTR prediction tasks, and the results demonstrate that SSEDS can\nstill achieve strong recommendation performance even if it has reduced 90\\%\nparameters.

However, their contribution to the total F budget is not fully\nknown due to the lack of observations. In this paper, we report the detection\nof AlF line emission, one of the two main carriers of F in the gas-phase in the\noutflow of evolved stars, towards five nearby oxygen-rich AGB stars, $o$ Ceti,\nR Leo, IK Tau, R Dor, and W Hya. From spatially resolved observations, we\nestimated the AlF emitting region with a radius $\\sim11R_{\\star}$ for $o$ Ceti\nand $\\sim9R_{\\star}$ for R Leo. From population diagram analysis, we report the\nAlF column densities of $\\sim 5.8\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\\sim\n3\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $o$ Ceti and R Leo, respectively, within these\nregions. For $o$ Ceti, we used the C$^{18}$O ($v=0$, $J=3-2$) observations to\nestimate the H$_2$ column density of the emitting region. We found a fractional\nabundance of $f_{\\rm AlF/H_2}\\sim(2.5\\pm1.7)\\times10^{-8}$. This gives a lower\nlimit on the F budget in $o$ Ceti and is compatible with the solar F budget\n$f_{\\rm F/H_2}=(5\\pm2)\\times10^{-8}$. For R Leo, a fractional abundance $f_{\\rm\nAlF/H_2}=(1.2\\pm0.5)\\times10^{-8}$ is estimated. For other sources, we cannot\nprecisely determine the emitting region based on the available data. Assuming\nan emitting region with a radius of $\\sim 11R_{\\star}$ and the rotational\ntemperatures derived for $o$ Ceti and R Leo, we crudely approximated the AlF\ncolumn density to be $\\sim(1.2-1.5)\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in W Hya,\n$\\sim(2.5-3.0)\\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ in R Dor, and\n$\\sim(0.6-1.0)\\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ in IK Tau.

Automatic tracking methods,\nhowever, also poses serious challenges: (1) individuals are small and similar\nin appearance; (2) frequent interactions with each other cause severe and\nlong-term occlusion. With the advances of artificial intelligence and computing\nvision technologies, we are hopeful to provide a tool to automate monitor\nmultiple insects to address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a\ndetection and tracking framework for multi-ant tracking in the videos by: (1)\nadopting a two-stage object detection framework using ResNet-50 as backbone and\ncoding the position of regions of interest to locate ants accurately; (2) using\nthe ResNet model to develop the appearance descriptors of ants; (3)\nconstructing long-term appearance sequences and combining them with motion\ninformation to achieve online tracking.

Using Cloudy-based locally optimally-emitting cloud\nphotoionisation model relations between metallicity and emission-line flux\nratios, we find the observable properties of the broad emission lines to be\nconsistent with emission from gas clouds with metallicity that are at least 2-4\ntimes solar. Our high-redshift measurements also confirm that the blueshift of\nthe CIV emission line is correlated with its equivalent width, which influences\nline ratios normalised against CIV. When accounting for the CIV blueshift, we\nfind that the rest-frame UV emission-line flux ratios do not correlate\nappreciably with the black hole mass or bolometric luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 10:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

To address these two limitations, we propose robust and\nexplainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time\nseries into a clean time series and an outlier time series using autoencoders.\nImproved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better\nexplained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities.

Multi-sensor\ndepth fusion is able to substantially improve the robustness and accuracy of 3D\nreconstruction methods, but existing techniques are not robust enough to handle\nsensors which operate with diverse value ranges as well as noise and outlier\nstatistics. To this end, we introduce SenFuNet, a depth fusion approach that\nlearns sensor-specific noise and outlier statistics and combines the data\nstreams of depth frames from different sensors in an online fashion. Our method\nfuses multi-sensor depth streams regardless of time synchronization and\ncalibration and generalizes well with little training data. We conduct\nexperiments with various sensor combinations on the real-world CoRBS and\nScene3D datasets, as well as the Replica dataset. Experiments demonstrate that\nour fusion strategy outperforms traditional and recent online depth fusion\napproaches. In addition, the combination of multiple sensors yields more robust\noutlier handling and more precise surface reconstruction than the use of a\nsingle sensor.

One novelty of the proposed framework is that it decouples the\nlocal filter from synchronization process.

This divide has motivated the introduction of\nresource theories of non-Gaussianity. As for any resource theory, it is of\npractical relevance to identify free conversion protocols between resources,\nnamely Gaussian conversion protocols between non-Gaussian states. Via\nsystematic numerical investigations, we address the approximate conversion\nbetween experimentally relevant single-mode non-Gaussian states via arbitrary\ndeterministic one-to-one mode Gaussian maps. First, we show that cat and\nbinomial states are approximately equivalent for finite energy, while this\nequivalence was previously known only in the infinite-energy limit. Then we\nconsider the generation of cat states from photon-added and photon-subtracted\nsqueezed states, improving over known schemes by introducing additional\nsqueezing operations.

Generally in DST, the dialogue state or\nbelief state for a given turn contains all the intents shown by the user till\nthat turn. Due to this cumulative nature of the belief state, it is difficult\nto get a correct prediction once a misprediction has occurred. Thus, although\nbeing a useful metric, it can be harsh at times and underestimate the true\npotential of a DST model. Moreover, an improvement in JGA can sometimes\ndecrease the performance of turn-level or non-cumulative belief state\nprediction due to inconsistency in annotations. So, using JGA as the only\nmetric for model selection may not be ideal for all scenarios. In this work, we\ndiscuss various evaluation metrics used for DST along with their shortcomings.\nTo address the existing issues, we propose a new evaluation metric named\nFlexible Goal Accuracy (FGA). FGA is a generalized version of JGA. But unlike\nJGA, it tries to give penalized rewards to mispredictions that are locally\ncorrect i.e. the root cause of the error is an earlier turn. By doing so, FGA\nconsiders the performance of both cumulative and turn-level prediction flexibly\nand provides a better insight than the existing metrics. We also show that FGA\nis a better discriminator of DST model performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 11:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

We adjust the initial and boundary conditions to take\nadvantage of the properties of random boundary conditions (RBC). The RBC does\nnot suppress unwanted waves coming from the artificial boundary enabling the\nfull wavefield recovery. Besides, it explores low correlations with\nnon-coherent signals due to the random velocities in the boundary.

This example relies on the\nclassical observation that enriched categories are monoid objects in a category\nof enriched graphs. We observe that the category of enriched graphs is\nbiclosed, meaning that it comes with both left and right internal hom objects.\nGiven a category $R$ (which plays the role of the ground field $k$ in classical\nalgebra), and an augmented $R$-algebra $C$, we define the Koszul dual of $C$,\ndenoted $K(C)$, as the $R$-algebra of derived endomorphisms of $R$ in the\ncategory of right $C$-modules.\n  We establish the expected adjunctions between the categories of modules over\n$C$ and modules over $K(C)$.

Self-supervised\nlearning from speech signals aims to learn the latent structure inherent in the\nsignal, while self-supervised learning from text attempts to capture lexical\ninformation. Learning aligned representations from unpaired speech and text\nsequences is a challenging task. Previous work either implicitly enforced the\nrepresentations learnt from these two modalities to be aligned in the latent\nspace through multitasking and parameter sharing or explicitly through\nconversion of modalities via speech synthesis. While the former suffers from\ninterference between the two modalities, the latter introduces additional\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose Maestro, a novel algorithm to learn\nunified representations from both these modalities simultaneously that can\ntransfer to diverse downstream tasks such as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)\nand Speech Translation (ST). Maestro learns unified representations through\nsequence alignment, duration prediction and matching embeddings in the learned\nspace through an aligned masked-language model loss.

Recent\nstudies have proved that PAT-based CIL can naturally avoid fighting against\nforgetting by replaying or distilling like most of the existing methods.\nHowever, we find that PAT-based CIL still faces serious semantic drift, the\nhigh-level forgetting problem caused by classifier learning bias at different\nlearning phases, which significantly reduces the performance of PAT-based CIL.\nTo address this problem, we propose Incremental Prototype Tuning (IPT), a\nsimple but effective method that tunes category prototypes for classification\nand learning example prototypes to compensate for semantic drift.

The\naim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations and\nmethods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than\nstudied until to date. An abstract variational framework is provided\nreformulating the original problem by the well-known form involving a\nscattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence\nbetween the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a\nseries of wave propagation problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the\nscalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwell's equations, a dual formulation of the\nHelmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element\ndiscretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three\nconvergence results are shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second\none (based on absorbtion) generalize Despr\\'es' early findings and apply as\nwell to the FETI-2LM formulation. The third result, oriented on the work by\nCollino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases\nwith cross points, while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key\ningredient is a global interface exchange operator, proposed originally by X.\nClaeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked out in full\ngenerality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete\nlevel as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The\nresulting scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier\nmethod introduced by S. Loisel, and connections are drawn to another technique\nproposed by Gander and Santugini.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 13:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

We focus on the low-mass\npost-AGB star Sakurai's Object which has been forming substantial quantities of\ncarbonaceous dust since an eruptive event in the 1990s. Large melilite grains\ncannot be responsible for the 6.9-micron absorption feature because the\nsimilarly-shaped feature in the laboratory spectrum was produced by very low\n(0.1 per cent by mass) carbonate contamination which was not detected at other\nwavelengths. Due to the high band-strength of the 6.9-micron feature in\ncarbonates, we conclude that carbonates carry the astronomical 6.9~micron\nfeature. Replacement of melilite with carbonates in models of Sakurai's object\nimproves fits to the 6 - 7-micron Spitzer spectra without significantly\naltering other conclusions of Bowey's previous models except that there is no\nlink between the feature and the abundance of melilite in meteorites.

Existing\npost-processing algorithms do not use all prior domain knowledge that is\navailable about the problem. We propose a new method that builds on our\nunderstanding of the systematic noise and the causal structure of the\ndata-generating process. Our algorithm is based on a modified version of\nhalf-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines\nideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to\naddress the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data\nobtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic\nnoise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of\ncausally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear\nmodels in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a\nsecond step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate\nobserving conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional\npredictors. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO\ninstrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than\nPCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field.\nAdditionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate\nestimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert\nartificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present\nfirst evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can\nimprove the results.

Here\nwe summarize the formalism behind G\\\"unther's theory and apply it to two\nwell-known examples from physics where different observers operate in distinct\nand only locally valid logical systems. Using polycontextural logic we show how\nthe emerging awareness of these limitations of logical systems entails the\ndesign of mathematical transformations, which then become an integral part of\nthe theory. In our view, this approach offers a novel perspective on the\nstructure of physical theories and, at the same time, emphasizes the relevance\nof the theory of polycontexturality in modern sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 13:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

In\nparticular, they conjecture that for all integers $k, p, t\\ge 2$, there exists\nsome $\\delta>0$ such that for all $n\\ge 1$, $1\\leq a_1\\le\\cdots\\le a_{p-1}\\le\nt$ and $a_p \\le \\delta n$, we have $r(H, B_{k,n})=\n(p-1)(n-1)+d_k(n,K_{a_1,a_2})+1,$ where $d_k(n,K_{a_1,a_2})$ is the maximum $d$\nfor which there is an $(n+d-1)$-vertex $K_{a_1,a_2}$-free graph in which at\nmost $k-1$ vertices have degree less than $d$.They verify the conjecture when\n$a_1=a_2=1$.\n  Building upon the work of Fox et al. (2021), we make a substantial step by\nshowing that the conjecture \"roughly\" holds if $a_1=1$ and $a_2|(n-1-k)$, i.e.\n$a_2$ divides $n-1-k$. Moreover, avoiding use of the regularity lemma, we prove\nthat for every $k, a\\geq 1$ and $p\\ge2$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for\nall large $n$ and $b\\le \\delta\\ln n$, $r(K_p(1,a,b,\\dots,b), B_{k,n})=\n(p-1)(n-1)+k(p-1)(a-1)+1$ if $a|(n-1-k)$, where the case when $a=1$ has been\nproved by Nikiforov and Rousseau (2009) using the regularity lemma. The bounds\non $1/\\delta$ we obtain are not of tower-type since our proofs do not rely on\nthe regularity lemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 14:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

In\nthis context, this paper proposes a novel NV-LLC organization leveraging data\ncompression. Data compression reduces the size of the blocks and, together with\nwear-leveling mechanisms, can defer the degradation of such a NV-LLC. Moreover,\nas capacity is reduced by write wear, data compression enables degraded cache\nframes to allocate blocks whose compressed size is adequate.\n  From a methodological point of view, although different approaches are used\nin the literature to analyze the degradation of a NV-LLC, none of them allows\nto study in detail its temporal evolution.

Yet due to\nthe inherent challenges of motion estimation (e.g. occlusions and\ndiscontinuities), most state-of-the-art interpolation approaches require\nsubsequent refinement of the warped result to generate satisfying outputs,\nwhich drastically decreases the efficiency for multi-frame interpolation. In\nthis work, we propose a fully differentiable Many-to-Many (M2M) splatting\nframework to interpolate frames efficiently. Specifically, given a frame pair,\nwe estimate multiple bidirectional flows to directly forward warp the pixels to\nthe desired time step, and then fuse any overlapping pixels. In doing so, each\nsource pixel renders multiple target pixels and each target pixel can be\nsynthesized from a larger area of visual context. This establishes a\nmany-to-many splatting scheme with robustness to artifacts like holes.\nMoreover, for each input frame pair, M2M only performs motion estimation once\nand has a minuscule computational overhead when interpolating an arbitrary\nnumber of in-between frames, hence achieving fast multi-frame interpolation. We\nconducted extensive experiments to analyze M2M, and found that it significantly\nimproves efficiency while maintaining high effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 15:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Low-resolution peripheral field\nprovides coarse scene exploration to direct the eye to focus to a highly\nresolved fovea region for sharp imaging. Among 3D computer vision techniques,\nLight Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is currently considered at the industrial\nlevel for robotic vision. LiDAR is an imaging technique that monitors pulses of\nlight at optical frequencies to sense the space and to recover\nthree-dimensional ranging information. Notwithstanding the efforts on LiDAR\nintegration and optimization, commercially available devices have slow frame\nrate and low image resolution, notably limited by the performance of mechanical\nor slow solid-state deflection systems. Metasurfaces (MS) are versatile optical\ncomponents that can distribute the optical power in desired regions of space.\nHere, we report on an advanced LiDAR technology that uses ultrafast low FoV\ndeflectors cascaded with large area metasurfaces to achieve large FoV and\nsimultaneous peripheral and central imaging zones. This technology achieves MHz\nframe rate for 2D imaging, and up to KHz for 3D imaging, with extremely large\nFoV (up to 150{\\deg}deg. on both vertical and horizontal scanning axes).

In recent years, many sequential models including those\nmodels based on recurrent neural networks have been broadly employed to predict\ninformation cascade. However, the user dependencies in a cascade sequence\ncaptured by sequential models are generally unidirectional and inconsistent\nwith diffusion trees. For example, the true trigger of a successor may be a\nnon-immediate predecessor rather than the immediate predecessor in the\nsequence. To capture user dependencies more sufficiently which are crucial to\nprecise cascade modeling, we propose a non-sequential information cascade model\nnamed as TAN-DRUD (Topology-aware Attention Networks with Dual Role User\nDependency).

The farmers are still largely dependent on their\npeers knowledge in solving the problems they face in their field. These\ntechnologies have not been effectively used to give the required information to\nfarmers on timely manner. This project aims to implement a closed domain\nChatBot for the field of Agriculture Farmers Assistant. Farmers can have\nconversation with the Chatbot and get the expert advice in their field. Farmers\nAssistant is based on RASA Open Source Framework. The Chatbot identifies the\nintent and entity from user utterances and retrieve the remedy from the\ndatabase and share it with the user. We tested the Bot with existing data and\nit showed promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 11:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

In various forms and formats and for varied\npurposes. In fact, the content marketing industry is set to be worth $412.88\nbillion by the end of 2021. However, according to the Content Marketing\nInstitute, creating engaging content is the #1 challenge that marketers face\ntoday. We under-stand that producing great content requires great writers who\nunderstand the business and can weave their message into reader (and search\nengine) friendly content. In this project, the team has attempted to bridge the\ngap between writers and projects by using AI and ML tools. We used NLP\ntechniques to analyze thou-sands of publicly available business articles\n(corpora) to extract various defining factors for each writing sample. Through\nthis project we aim to automate the highly time-consuming, and often biased\ntask of manually shortlisting the most suitable writer for a given content\nwriting requirement. We believe that a tool like this will have far reaching\npositive implications for both parties - businesses looking for suitable talent\nfor niche writing jobs as well as experienced writers and Subject Matter\nExperts (SMEs) wanting to lend their services to content marketing projects.\nThe business gets the content they need, the content writer/ SME gets a chance\nto leverage his or her talent, while the reader gets authentic content that\nadds real value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 12:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-22"}

Laser-based techniques are promising for autonomous compound\ndetection because the optical response of materials encodes enough electronic\nand vibrational information for remote chemical identification. This has been\nexploited using the fingerprint region of infrared absorption spectra, which\ninvolves a dense set of absorption peaks that are unique to individual\nmolecules, thus facilitating chemical identification. However, optical\nidentification using visible light has not been realized. Using decades of\nexperimental refractive index data in the scientific literature of pure organic\ncompounds and polymers over a broad range of frequencies from the ultraviolet\nto the far-infrared, we develop a machine learning classifier that can\naccurately identify organic species based on a single-wavelength dispersive\nmeasurement in the visible spectral region, away from absorption resonances.\nThe optical classifier proposed here could be applied to autonomous material\nidentification protocols or applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 20:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 04:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Most existing models of football player motion have not been\nvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is\nthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of\nplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable\npositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football\nplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of\nactually reachable positions.\n  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that\nmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all\npossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of\nreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a\nmanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four\ndifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion\nwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed\nlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show\nthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a\nlimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate\ndistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two\nsegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the\ntested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of\nreal-world player motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 08:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

It has been proposed that fast learning relies on\nneural representations that favor efficient Hebbian modification of synapses.\nThese efficient representations may be encoded in the genome, resulting in a\nrepertoire of fast learning that differs across species. Alternatively, the\nrequired neural representations may be acquired from experience through a slow\nprocess of unsupervised learning from the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2022 19:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}
