Unfortunately, existing forgery detection methods suffer\nsignificant performance drops when applied to novel forgery approaches. In this\nwork, we address the few-shot forgery detection problem by designing a\ncomprehensive benchmark based on coverage analysis among various forgery\napproaches, and proposing Guided Adversarial Interpolation (GAI). Our key\ninsight is that there exist transferable distribution characteristics among\ndifferent forgery approaches with the majority and minority classes.\nSpecifically, we enhance the discriminative ability against novel forgery\napproaches via adversarially interpolating the artifacts of the minority\nsamples to the majority samples under the guidance of a teacher network. Unlike\nthe standard re-balancing method which usually results in over-fitting to\nminority classes, our method simultaneously takes account of the diversity of\nmajority information as well as the significance of minority information.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our GAI achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on the established few-shot forgery detection benchmark.

Loyalty can be defined by the time period a user has been\nactive in a recommender system, or by the number of historical interactions a\nuser has. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of recommendation\nresults along global timeline. We conduct experiments with five widely used\nmodels, i.e., BPR, NeuMF, LightGCN, SASRec and TiSASRec, on four benchmark\ndatasets, i.e., MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music, and Amazon-electronic.

To perform\nour prediction, we mined and used a number of features about a release, such as\nthe complexity of the changed code, change types, and development activities.\nWe then used four ML classifiers.

Meso- and large-scale\ncurrents along sloping topography are subjected to a delicate balance of Ekman\narrest and spin down. These two seemingly disparate oceanographic phenomena\nshare a common theory, which is based on a one-dimensional model of rotating,\nstratified flow over a sloping, insulated boundary. This commonly used model,\nhowever, lacks rapid adjustment of interior flows, limiting its ability to\ncapture the full physics of spin up and spin down of along-slope flow.\nMotivated by two-dimensional dynamics, the present work extends the\none-dimensional model by constraining the vertically integrated cross-slope\ntransport and allowing for a barotropic cross-slope pressure gradient. This\nproduces a closed secondary circulation by forcing Ekman transport in the\nbottom boundary layer to return in the interior. The extended model can thus\ncapture Ekman spin up and spin down physics: the interior return flow is turned\nby the Coriolis acceleration, leading to rapid \\linelabel{ll:slowdiff}rather\nthan slow diffusive adjustment of the along-slope flow. This\ntransport-constrained one-dimensional model accurately describes\ntwo-dimensional mixing-generated spin up over an idealized ridge and provides a\nunified framework for understanding the relative importance of Ekman arrest and\nspin down of flow along a slope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 16:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Recent studies have identified thin bottom boundary layers\n(BLs) as locations of intense upwelling, yet it remains unclear how they\ninteract with and shape the large-scale circulation of the abyssal ocean. The\ncurrent understanding of this BL--interior coupling is shaped by 1D theory,\nsuggesting that variations in locally produced BL transport generate exchange\nwith the interior and thus a global circulation. Until now, however, this\npicture has been based on a 1D theory that fails to capture the local evolution\nin even highly idealized 2D geometries. The present work applies BL theory to\nrevised 1D dynamics, which more naturally generalizes to two and three\ndimensions. The BL is assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium between the upwelling\nof dense water and the convergence of downward buoyancy fluxes. The BL\ntransport, for which explicit formulae are presented, exerts an influence on\nthe interior by modifying the bottom boundary condition. In 1D, this BL\ntransport is independent of the interior evolution, but in 2D the BL and\ninterior are fully coupled. Once interior variables and the bottom slope are\nallowed to vary in the horizontal, the resulting convergences and divergences\nin the BL transport exchange mass with the interior. This framework allows for\nthe analysis of previously inaccessible problems such as the BL--interior\ncoupling in the presence of an exponential interior stratification, laying the\nfoundation for developing a full theory for the abyssal circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 16:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 23:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

A deeper understanding of these\nhuman-to-human interactions will require, in part, the precise measurement of\nskin-to-skin physical contact. Among prior efforts, each measurement approach\nexhibits certain constraints, e.g., motion trackers do not capture the precise\nshape of skin surfaces, while pressure sensors impede direct skin contact. In\ncontrast, this work develops an interference-free 3D visual tracking system\nusing a depth camera to measure the contact attributes between the bare hand of\na toucher and the forearm of a receiver. The toucher's hand is tracked as a\nposed and positioned mesh by fitting a hand model to detected 3D joints,\nwhereas the forearm is extracted as a detailed 3D surface. Based on a contact\nmodel of point clouds, the spatiotemporal contact changes are decomposed as six\nhigh-resolution time-series attributes, i.e., contact area, indentation depth,\nabsolute velocity, and three orthogonal velocity components, together with\ncontact duration. To examine the system's capabilities and limitations, two\nexperiments were performed. First, to evaluate its ability to discern human\ntouches, one person delivered cued social messages, e.g., happiness, anger,\nsympathy, to another using their preferred gestures. The results indicated that\nmessages, gestures, and the individual touchers, were readily discerned from\ntheir contact attributes. Second, the measurement accuracy was validated\nagainst independent devices, including an electromagnetic tracker, pressure\nmat, and laser sensor. While validated here in the context of social\ncommunication, this system is extendable to human touch interactions such as\nmaternal care of infants and massage therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 17:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

However, this is based on a\nblock encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, whose implementation is known to\nrequire a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue\ntransformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QET-U), which uses a\ncontrolled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit and\nno multi-qubit control operations, and is thus suitable for early\nfault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that\noutperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for\nestimating the ground state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians,\nwe propose a new method that exploits certain anti-commutation relations and\nfurther removes the need of implementing the controlled Hamiltonian evolution.\nCoupled with Trotter based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the\nresulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum\ndevices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM Qiskit for\nthe transverse field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multi-qubit\nToffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary\namplitude estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases\nthe total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal\ncomplexity for ground state preparation and energy estimating using a constant\nnumber of ancilla qubits (no more than 3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 17:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 12:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

Second, we introduce the concept of valuable\nlocalization region that can aid to selectively distill the classification and\nlocalization knowledge for a certain region.

However, manual bug fixing scheduling can be time-consuming,\ncumbersome, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose the Schedule and\nDependency-aware Bug Triage (S-DABT), a bug triaging method that utilizes\ninteger programming and machine learning techniques to assign bugs to suitable\ndevelopers. Unlike prior works that largely focus on a single component of the\nbug reports, our approach takes into account the textual data, bug fixing\ncosts, and bug dependencies. We further incorporate the schedule of developers\nin our formulation to have a more comprehensive model for this multifaceted\nproblem. As a result, this complete formulation considers developers' schedules\nand the blocking effects of the bugs while covering the most significant\naspects of the previously proposed methods. Our numerical study on four\nopen-source software systems, namely, EclipseJDT, LibreOffice, GCC, and\nMozilla, shows that taking into account the schedules of the developers\ndecreases the average bug fixing times. We find that S-DABT leads to a high\nlevel of developer utilization through a fair distribution of the tasks among\nthe developers and efficient use of the free spots in their schedules. Via the\nsimulation of the issue tracking system, we also show how incorporating the\nschedule in the model formulation reduces the bug fixing time, improves the\nassignment accuracy, and utilizes the capability of each developer without much\ncomprising in the model run times. We find that S-DABT decreases the complexity\nof the bug dependency graph by prioritizing blocking bugs and effectively\nreduces the infeasible assignment ratio due to bug dependencies. Consequently,\nwe recommend considering developers' schedules while automating bug triage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 17:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

However, manual SMR schemes are\nnotoriously difficult to apply correctly, and automatic schemes, such as\nreference counting, have been argued for over a decade to be too slow for\npractical purposes. A recent wave of work has disproved this long-held notion\nand shown that reference counting can be as scalable as hazard pointers, one of\nthe most common manual techniques. Despite these tremendous improvements, there\nremains a gap of up to 2x or more in performance between these schemes and\nfaster manual techniques such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR).\n  In this work, we first advance these ideas and show that in many cases,\nautomatic reference counting can in fact be as fast as the fastest manual SMR\ntechniques. We generalize our previous Concurrent Deferred Reference Counting\n(CDRC) algorithm to obtain a method for converting any standard manual SMR\ntechnique into an automatic reference counting technique with a similar\nperformance profile. Our second contribution is extending this framework to\nsupport weak pointers, which are reference-counted pointers that automatically\nbreak pointer cycles by not contributing to the reference count, thus\naddressing a common weakness in reference-counted garbage collection.\n  Our experiments with a C++-library implementation show that our automatic\ntechniques perform in line with their manual counterparts, and that our weak\npointer implementation outperforms the best known atomic weak pointer library\nby up to an order of magnitude on high thread counts. All together, we show\nthat the ease of use of automatic memory management can be achieved without\nsignificant cost to practical performance or general applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 17:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

If successful,\nresonance capture can trigger dramatic growth in the BHB eccentricity, with\nimportant consequences for the BHB merger timescale, as well as for the\ngravitational wave (GW) signature of such an eccentric merger. This resonance\ncapture may occur when the orbital period around the SMBH (the \"outer binary\")\nand the apsidal precession of the BHB (the \"inner binary\") are in a 1:1\ncommensurability. This effect is analogous to the phenomenon of lunar evection\nresonance in the early Sun-Earth-Moon system, with the distinction that in the\npresent case, the BHB apsidal precession is due to general relativity, rather\nthan rotationally-induced distortion. In contrast to the case of lunar\nevection, however, the inner binary undergoes orbital decay driven by GW\nemission, rather than orbital expansion driven by tidal dissipation. This\ndistinction fundamentally alters the three-body dynamics, forbidding resonance\ncapture, and limiting eccentricity growth. However, if the BHB migrates through\nof a gaseous AGN disk, the change in the outer binary can counterbalance the\nsuppressing effect of BHB decay, permitting evection resonance capture and the\nproduction of eccentric BHB mergers. We compute the likelihood of resonance\ncapture assuming an agnostic distribution of parameters for the three bodies\ninvolved and for the properties of the AGN disk. We find that intermediate-mass\nratio BHBs (involving an intermediate-mass black hole and a stellar-mass black\nhole) are the most likely to be captured into evection resonance and thus\nundergo an eccentric merger. We also compute the GW signature of these mergers,\nshowing that they can enter the LISA band while eccentric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

We\ndevelop a framework for generating random collision operators which respect\ncrystal symmetries and conservation laws and which have a tunable ratio between\nthe momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes.

High accuracy typically requires high polynomial degrees,\ndemanding many training points especially in high-dimensional problems through\nthe curse of dimensionality. So-called sparse PCE concepts work with a much\nsmaller selection of basis polynomials compared to conventional PCE approaches\nand can overcome the curse of dimensionality very efficiently, but have to pay\nspecific attention to their strategies of choosing training points.\nFurthermore, the approximation error resembles an uncertainty that most\nexisting PCE-based methods do not estimate. In this study, we develop and\nevaluate a fully Bayesian approach to establish the PCE representation via\njoint shrinkage priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The suggested Bayesian PCE\nmodel directly aims to solve the two challenges named above: achieving a sparse\nPCE representation and estimating uncertainty of the PCE itself. The embedded\nBayesian regularizing via the joint shrinkage prior allows using higher\npolynomial degrees for given training points due to its ability to handle\nunderdetermined situations, where the number of considered PCE coefficients\ncould be much larger than the number of available training points. We also\nexplore multiple variable selection methods to construct sparse PCE expansions\nbased on the established Bayesian representations, while globally selecting the\nmost meaningful orthonormal polynomials given the available training data.

Instead, the spectrum of\nfluctuations at stationary points determines their topological stability under\nanalytic continuation of the theory. Topological changes, which occur at\nso-called Stokes points, proliferate among saddles with marginal (flat)\ndirections and are suppressed otherwise. This gives a direct interpretation of\nthe gap or 'threshold' energy -- which in the real case separates saddles from\nminima -- as the level where the spectrum of the hessian matrix of stationary\npoints develops a gap. This leads to different consequences for the analytic\ncontinuation of real landscapes with different structures: the global minima of\n'one step replica-symmetry broken' landscapes lie beyond a threshold, their\nhessians are gapped, and are locally protected from Stokes points, whereas\nthose of 'many step replica-symmetry broken' have gapless hessians and Stokes\npoints immediately proliferate.

The result is that data\naccess libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot\nutilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive\nsolution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering\ntasks to the storage layer.

Unfortunately, DL algorithms are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples that inject imperceptible modifications to\nthe input and cause the DL algorithm to misclassify the input. Existing\nadversarial attacks in the NIDS domain often manipulate the traffic features\ndirectly, which hold no practical significance because traffic features cannot\nbe replayed in a real network. It remains a research challenge to generate\npractical and evasive adversarial attacks.\n  This paper presents the Liuer Mihou attack that generates practical and\nreplayable adversarial network packets that can bypass anomaly-based NIDS\ndeployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

Compositions are 2-simplices (commutative\ntriangles) in which the position of the composite is the 1-simplex opposite\nvertex i=1. These conditions generalize to all n>1 and i in {0 , ... , n+1}. We\ncall such a simplicial set an (n,i)-composer. This paper explores two aspects\nof composers: models and the algebra of such generalized composition.\n  Models: we develop a family of set-based models for composers analogous to\nsets-and-functions models for ordinary categories. The key to obtaining\nset-based models of (n,i)-composers is to observe that in the nerve of a\ncategory of sets-and-functions, a 1-simplex is a binary relation with certain\nproperties on its two faces, that is, its codomain and domain. In a model of an\n(n,i)-composer, each k-simplex is a (k+1)-ary relation on its faces having\ncertain properties, with special attention to k=n (things which compose) and\nk=n+1 (a composition of things). The development of these models is guided by\nrequiring: (i) the usual sets-and-functions model, i.e. when n=1 and i=1,\nbelongs to the family; (ii) the things which compose have properties which\nresemble and generalize properties possessed by ordinary functions.\n  Algebra: we explore some notions which are inspired by the algebra of\nordinary composition. These include \"comma-composers\" generalizing comma\ncategories, a composer structure for function complexes, representables, and a\ngeneralization of universal map. In its current form, this part of the paper is\nprovisional in content and organization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 00:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

The locations of the inelastic scattering\ncenters are calculated by measuring the arrival time and the position of the\nassociated particle, the alpha particle in the fusion reaction, and the arrival\ntime of the prompt gamma created in the scattering event. While the neutron and\nits associated particle move in opposite directions in the center-of-mass (COM)\nsystem, in the laboratory system the angle is slightly less than 180 degrees,\nand the COM movement must be taken into account in the reconstruction of the\nscattering location. Furthermore, due to energy loss of ions in the target, the\nfusion reactions are produced by ions of different energies, and thus the COM\nvelocity varies, resulting in an uncertainty in the reconstructed positions. In\nthis paper, we analyze the COM corrections to this reconstruction by simulating\nthe energy loss of beam ions in the target material and identifying sources of\nuncertainty in these corrections. We show that an average COM velocity can be\nused in the reconstruction and discuss errors as a function of ion beam energy,\ncomposition, and alpha detection location. When accounting for the COM effect,\nthe mean of the reconstructed locations can be considered a systematic error\nleading to shift/tilt in the reconstruction. However, the distribution of\nreconstructed locations also have a spread that will introduce an error in the\nreconstruction that cannot be corrected. In this paper, we will use the known\nstopping powers of ions in materials and reaction cross-sections to examine\nthis effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 01:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

The super\nlearner (SL) is an algorithm that alleviates concerns over selecting the one\n\"right\" strategy while providing the freedom to consider many of them, such as\nthose recommended by collaborators, used in related research, or specified by\nsubject-matter experts. It is an entirely pre-specified and data-adaptive\nstrategy for predictive modeling. To ensure the SL is well-specified for\nlearning the prediction function, the analyst does need to make a few important\nchoices. In this Education Corner article, we provide step-by-step guidelines\nfor making these choices, walking the reader through each of them and providing\nintuition along the way. In doing so, we aim to empower the analyst to tailor\nthe SL specification to their prediction task, thereby ensuring their SL\nperforms as well as possible. A flowchart provides a concise, easy-to-follow\nsummary of key suggestions and heuristics, based on our accumulated experience,\nand guided by theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 02:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 23:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 04:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 20:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

The Terzan 5 pulsars are faint, so that individual observations of\nmost of the pulsars have too little signal-to-noise (S/N) to measure reliable\nflux density or polarization information. We combined over 5.2\\,days of\narchival data, at each of 1.5\\,GHz and 2.0\\,GHz, taken with the Green Bank\nTelescope over the past 11\\,years. We created high S/N profiles for 32 of the\npulsars and determined precise rotation measures (RMs) for 28 of them. We used\nthe RMs, and the known pulsar positions and dispersion measures (DMs), to map\nthe projected parallel component of the Galactic magnetic field toward the\ncluster. The $\\langle B_{||}\\rangle$ shows a rough gradient of\n$\\sim$6\\,nG/arcsec ($\\sim$160\\,nG/parsec), or fractionally, a change of\n$\\sim$20$\\%$ in the right ascension direction across the cluster, implying\nGalactic magnetic field variability at sub-parsec scales.

This spectral index is flatter than most known pulsars,\nlikely a selection effect due to the high frequencies used in pulsar searches\nto mitigate dispersion and scattering. The inferred pulsar luminosity function\nis roughly power-law, with slope $(d\\log N)/(d\\log L) = -1$ at the\nhigh-luminosity end.

In the aforementioned application areas, property\npreservation often manifests itself as a requirement for either data\nboundedness or positivity preservation. For example, in NWP, one may have to\ninterpolate between the grid on which the dynamics is calculated to a grid on\nwhich the physics is calculated (and back). Interpolating density or other key\nphysical quantities without accounting for property preservation may lead to\nnegative values that are nonphysical and result in inaccurate representations\nand/or interpretations of the physical data. Property-preserving interpolation\nis straightforward when used in the context of low-order numerical simulation\nmethods. High-order property-preserving interpolation is, however, nontrivial,\nespecially in the case where the interpolation points are not equispaced. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct high-order\ninterpolation methods that ensure either data boundedness or constrained\npositivity preservation. A novel feature of the algorithm is that the\npositivity-preserving interpolant is constrained; that is, the amount by which\nit exceeds the data values may be strictly controlled. The algorithm we have\ndeveloped comes with theoretical estimates that provide sufficient conditions\nfor data boundedness and constrained positivity preservation.

To make it practical, in this paper, we explore a more efficient\nkNN-MT and propose to use clustering to improve the retrieval efficiency.\nConcretely, we first propose a cluster-based Compact Network for feature\nreduction in a contrastive learning manner to compress context features into\n90+% lower dimensional vectors. We then suggest a cluster-based pruning\nsolution to filter out 10%-40% redundant nodes in large datastores while\nretaining translation quality. Our proposed methods achieve better or\ncomparable performance while reducing up to 57% inference latency against the\nadvanced non-parametric MT model on several machine translation benchmarks.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed methods maintain the most\nuseful information of the original datastore and the Compact Network shows good\ngeneralization on unseen domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 05:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 10:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

This\nsituation can be avoided if the entanglement is detected through the\nconstruction of witness operator method. In this work, we take an analytical\napproach to construct a witness operator. To achieve this task, we first\nconstruct a linear map using partial transposition and realignment operation.\nThen we find some conditions on the parameters of the map for which the map\nrepresent a positive map. Further, we have constructed a Choi matrix\ncorresponding to the map and have shown that it is not completely positive. We\nthen construct an entanglement witness operator, which is based on the linear\ncombination of the function of Choi matrix and the identity matrix and it can\ndetect both NPTES and PPTES. Finally, we prove its efficiency by detecting\nseveral bipartite bound entangled states which were previously undetected by\nsome well-known separability criteria. We also compared the detection power of\nour witness operator with three well-known powerful entanglement detection\ncriteria, namely, dV criterion, CCNR criterion and the separability criteria\nbased on correlation tensor (CT) proposed by Sarbicki et. al. and find that our\nwitness operator detect more entangled states than these criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 06:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 09:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Given a set of hybrid\nsensors that can collect combined time of arrival (TOA), received signal\nstrength (RSS) and angle of arrival (AOA) measurements, the localization\naccuracy can be enhanced further by optimally designing the placements of the\nhybrid sensors. In this paper, we present an optimal sensor placement\nmethodology, which is based on the principle of majorization-minimization (MM),\nfor hybrid localization technique.

However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization\nagainst diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models.\nMotivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global\nfeatures, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these\nproblems by helping models better exploit these features.

We propose\nthree different optimal intermittent filters, whose optimality criteria depend\non the information available at the time of decision making. For the first, the\nstochastic program filter, the measurement times are given by a policy that\ndetermines whether a measurement should be taken based on the measurements\nalready acquired. The second, called the offline filter, determines all\nmeasurement times at once by solving a combinatorial optimization program\nbefore any measurement acquisition. For the third one, which we call online\nfilter, each time a new measurement is received, the next measurement time is\nrecomputed to take all the information that is then available into account. We\nprove that in terms of expected mean square error, the stochastic program\nfilter outperforms the online filter, which itself outperforms the offline\nfilter. However, these filters are generally intractable. For this reason, the\nfilter estimate is approximated by a particle filter. Moreover, the mean square\nerror is approximated using a Monte-Carlo approach, and different optimization\nalgorithms are compared to approximately solve the combinatorial programs (a\nrandom trial algorithm, greedy forward and backward algorithms, a simulated\nannealing algorithm, and a genetic algorithm). Finally, the performance of the\nproposed methods is illustrated on two examples: a tumor motion model and a\ncommon benchmark for particle filtering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 09:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Previous methods\nmostly follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e., language-irrelevant detection and\ncross-modal matching, which is limited by the isolated architecture. In such a\nparadigm, the detector needs to sample keypoints from raw point clouds due to\nthe inherent properties of 3D point clouds (irregular and large-scale), to\ngenerate the corresponding object proposal for each keypoint. However, sparse\nproposals may leave out the target in detection, while dense proposals may\nconfuse the matching model. Moreover, the language-irrelevant detection stage\ncan only sample a small proportion of keypoints on the target, deteriorating\nthe target prediction. In this paper, we propose a 3D Single-Stage Referred\nPoint Progressive Selection (3D-SPS) method, which progressively selects\nkeypoints with the guidance of language and directly locates the target.\nSpecifically, we propose a Description-aware Keypoint Sampling (DKS) module to\ncoarsely focus on the points of language-relevant objects, which are\nsignificant clues for grounding. Besides, we devise a Target-oriented\nProgressive Mining (TPM) module to finely concentrate on the points of the\ntarget, which is enabled by progressive intra-modal relation modeling and\ninter-modal target mining. 3D-SPS bridges the gap between detection and\nmatching in the 3D visual grounding task, localizing the target at a single\nstage.

We show how these bounds make it\npossible to study the adversarial error using analysis from non-adversarial\nsetups.

Moreover, we provide a\ncharacterization of the property (SL) in the class of reflexive smooth Banach\nspaces in terms of subspaces of quotient spaces. As a consequence, we prove\nthat the space $\\ell_p$ have the property (SL) for every $1 < p < \\infty$.\nFinally, using a variant of the Gowers-Maurey space, we construct an\ninfinite-dimensional uniformly smooth Banach space $X$ such that every smooth\nBanach space isomorphic to $X$ has the property (SL).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 10:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

By confining liquids down\nto a few atomic layers, anomalies in molecular transport and structure have\nbeen revealed. Currently, only indirect and ensemble averaged techniques have\nbeen able to operate in such extreme confinements, as even the smallest\nmolecular fluorophores are too bulky to penetrate state-of-the-art single-digit\nnanofluidic systems. This strong limitation calls for the development of novel\noptical approaches allowing for the direct molecular imaging of liquids\nconfined at the nanoscale.

Vibrational spectra of\nthe emitters suggest that their activation occurs through the chemisorption of\ncarbon-bearing liquid molecules onto native hBN defects. The correlated\nactivation of neighboring defects reveals single-molecule dynamics at the\ninterface, while defect emission spectra offer a direct readout of the local\ndielectric properties of the liquid medium.

At the same time, the\nlow-voltage grid is largely unmonitored and local power failures are sometimes\nhard to detect.

In\naddition to establishing a communication infrastructure, PLC also offers the\npossibility of evaluating the cables themselves, as well as the connection\nquality between individual cable distributors based on their Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR). The roll-out of a large-scale PLC infrastructure therefore not\nonly ensures communication, but also introduces a tool for monitoring the\nentire network.

The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework\nproposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected\nrisk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is\nmost commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective\nto emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows\nfor estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they\nare subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes\nin the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the\noptimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization\nconstraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -- mini-batch level\nnormalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -- allow us to\ntrain models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In\na series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we\nfind that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are\nconsistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO\napproaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little\nhyper-parameter tuning.

We systematically compare the grippers' performance,\ntogether with the effects of: (1) type of classifier (k-NN, SVM, LSTM)\noperating on raw time series or on features, (2) action parameters (grasping\nconfiguration and speed of squeezing), (3) contribution of sensory modalities.\nClassification results are complemented by visualization of the data using PCA.\nWe found: (i) all the grippers but the qb SoftHand could reliably distinguish\nthe ordinary objects set; (ii) Barrett Hand reached around 95% accuracy on the\nfoams; OnRobot RG6 around 75% and Robotiq 2F-85 around 70%; (iii) across all\ngrippers, SVM over features and LSTM on raw time series performed best; (iv)\nfaster compression speeds degrade classification performance; (v) transfer\nlearning between compression speeds worked well for the Barrett Hand only;\ntransfer between grasping configurations is limited; (vi) ablation experiments\nprovided intriguing insights -- sometimes a single sensory channel suffices for\ndiscrimination. Overall, the Barrett Hand as a complex and expensive device\nwith rich sensory feedback provided best results, but uncalibrated parallel jaw\ngrippers without tactile sensors can have sufficient performance for\nsingle-grasp object discrimination based on position and effort data only.\nTransfer learning between the different robot hands remains a challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 12:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

It is therefore\ncritical to develop techniques that can mitigate unintended biases in facial\nclassifiers.

For years, the detection task has been performed manually by\nphoto-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of\ncontextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the\nincreasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires\nautomation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection\nmethods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from\nanthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections.\nAs an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on\nan extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick\nannotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 4\nyears over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR\nimages and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios.\nFurther, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data\ncollection.

This introduces a\nsignificant overhead in computational cost for many practical applications, as\nfeatures are extracted and computed via sampling and evaluating the problem\ninstance at hand, similarly to what the optimization algorithm would perform\nanyway within its search trajectory. As suggested in Jankovic et al. (EvoAPPs\n2021), trajectory-based algorithm selection circumvents the problem of costly\nfeature extraction by computing landscape features from points that a solver\nsampled and evaluated during the optimization process. Features computed in\nthis manner are used to train algorithm performance regression models, upon\nwhich a per-run algorithm selector is then built.\n  In this work, we apply the trajectory-based approach onto a portfolio of five\nalgorithms. We study the quality and accuracy of performance regression and\nalgorithm selection models in the scenario of predicting different algorithm\nperformances after a fixed budget of function evaluations. We rely on landscape\nfeatures of the problem instance computed using one portion of the\naforementioned budget of the same function evaluations. Moreover, we consider\nthe possibility of switching between the solvers once, which requires them to\nbe warm-started, i.e. when we switch, the second solver continues the\noptimization process already being initialized appropriately by making use of\nthe information collected by the first solver. In this new context, we show\npromising performance of the trajectory-based per-run algorithm selection with\nwarm-starting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 14:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2022 11:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Data programming is a practical\nWS approach that allows programmatic labeling data samples using labeling\nfunctions (LFs) instead of hand-labeling each data point.

This is due to the common data\nprogramming pipeline that neglects to utilize data features during the\ngenerative process. This paper proposes a new approach called reinforced\nlabeling (RL). Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of LFs, RL augments the\nLFs' outputs to cases not covered by LFs based on similarities among samples.\nThus, RL can lead to higher labeling coverage for training an end classifier.\nThe experiments on several domains (classification of YouTube comments, wine\nquality, and weather prediction) result in considerable gains.

In this\nwork, we consider the formation of cosmological singularities in an\nasymptotically safe cosmology where the cut off scale is proportional to the\nHubble parameter. We consider a well motivated inhomogeneous form of the\nequation of state(EOS) as well. We firstly delve into some basics of this\ncosmology and show that such a scenario permits a transition between phantom\nand quintessence forms of universal evolution. We then show that one can have\nType I - Type IV singularities in such a cosmology for various version of the\nEOS and that the singularities can occur both in finite and infinite time. The\nconditions in which these singularities occur is significantly different than\nhow they occur in the standard cosmology, with the formulations being even more\ninvolved. Interestingly this difference comes about without the need of any\nfree parameters in the cosmological models, which is usually what one observes\nwhen one goes for the same pursuit via various modified gravity/ QG inspired\ncosmological approaches.

However, there is often a dichotomy between\nfairness and efficacy: fair algorithms may proffer low social welfare solutions\nwhereas welfare optimizing algorithms may be very unfair. This issue is\nexemplified in the machine scheduling problem where, for $n$ jobs, the social\nwelfare of any fair solution may be a factor $\\Omega(n)$ worse than the optimal\nwelfare. In this paper, we prove that this dichotomy between fairness and\nefficacy can be overcome if we allow for a negligible amount of bias: there\nexist algorithms that are both \"almost perfectly fair\" and have a constant\nfactor efficacy ratio, that is, are guaranteed to output solutions that have\nsocial welfare within a constant factor of optimal welfare.

The\nthermal and mechanical evolution of such a high-contrast facility leads to\nwavefront drifts that degrade the DH contrast during the observing time, thus\nlimiting the ability to retrieve planetary signals. Lyot-style coronagraphs are\nstarlight suppression systems that remove the central part of the image for an\nunresolved observed star, the point spread function, with an opaque focal plane\nmask (FPM). When implemented with a flat mirror containing an etched pinhole,\nthe mask rejects part of the starlight through the pinhole which can be used to\nretrieve information about low-order aberrations. We propose an active control\nscheme using a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) to analyze the light rejected by\nthe FPM, control low-order aberrations, and stabilize the DH contrast. The\nconcept formalism is first presented before characterizing the sensor behavior\nin simulations and in laboratory.

Exploiting the potential\nvalue of the histopathology images can promote precision medicine in oncology.\nTissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image\nanalysis. Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation\nperformance but require sufficient pixel-level annotations, which is\ntime-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources of LUAD and to\nalleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call\nfor the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) techniques\nfor histopathology images of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to\nsegment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only\npatch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level annotations (the\ntraining set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test\nsets), from 87 WSIs (67 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated\nby a pathologist-in-the-loop pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by\nthe label review board.

This is a more data efficient method compared to\ntraining a machine-translation system or a multi-lingual model from scratch\nusing only parallel data. In this study, we experiment with zero-shot transfer\nof English models to four typologically different languages (Spanish, Russian,\nVietnamese, and Hindi) and three NLP tasks (QA, NLI, and NER).

However, from the paired-differences histograms introduced in our work\nwe can see that the adjustment only modestly affects the relative distances\nbetween related and unrelated words. In contrast, fine-tuning of mBERT on\nEnglish data (for a specific task such as NER) draws embeddings of both related\nand unrelated words closer to each other. The cross-lingual adjustment of mBERT\nimproves NLI in four languages and NER in two languages, while QA performance\nnever improves and sometimes degrades. When we fine-tune a cross-lingual\nadjusted mBERT for a specific task (e.g., NLI), the cross-lingual adjustment of\nmBERT may still improve the separation between related and related words, but\nthis works consistently only for the XNLI task.

Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information\nis required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and\nprevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall\ncanopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single\ndata source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI\ndeliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical\nsatellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot\ndirectly measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have\ndeveloped a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from\nSentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these\nestimates. The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly\nencountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to\nresolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map,\nonly 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data\nplay an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these\ntall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent,\nuncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to\ndetect change and inform decision making.

To solve\nthis issue, in this paper, we propose a Fog-Edge hybrid computing architecture\nfor Metaverse applications that leverage an edge-enabled distributed computing\nparadigm, which makes use of edge devices computing power to fulfil the\nrequired computational cost for heavy tasks such as collision detection in\nvirtual universe and computation of 3D physics in virtual simulation. The\ncomputational cost related to an entity in the Metaverse such as collision\ndetection or physics emulation are performed at the end-device of the\nassociated physical entity. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed\narchitecture, we simulate a distributed social metaverse application.\nSimulation results shows that the proposed architecture can reduce the latency\nby 50% when compared with the legacy cloud-based Metaverse applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 11:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}
