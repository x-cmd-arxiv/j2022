In particular, the vortex liquid regime is found to rapidly\nshrink upon entering, by cooling, the temperature range in which the FFLO state\nwith a periodic modulation parallel to the magnetic field is stable in the mean\nfield theory.

Often CEMs are formulated to model grid operations over\nrepresentative periods that are sampled from the original input data using\nclustering algorithms. However, such representative period selection (RPS)\nmethods are limited by the declining efficacy of the clustering algorithm with\nincreasing dimensionality of the input data and do not consider the relative\nimportance of input data variations on CEM outcomes. Here, we propose a RPS\nmethod that addresses these limitations by incorporating dimensionality\nreduction, accomplished via neural network based autoencoders, prior to\nclustering. Such dimensionality reduction not only improves the performance of\nthe clustering algorithm, but also facilitates using additional features, such\nas estimated outputs produced from parallel solutions of simplified versions of\nthe CEM for each disjoint period in the input data (e.g. 1 week). The impact of\nincorporating dimensionality reduction as part of RPS methods is quantified\nthrough the error in outcomes of the corresponding reduced-space CEM vs. the\nfull space CEM.

This paper addresses this question based on\na naive learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals\nevolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average\nopinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous\ntheoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing\nand undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom\nof finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the\ntruth as group size increases, provided individuals' variances are finite. We\nshow that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is\ndetermined by the social power allocation of the influence system: if the\ninfluence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more\naccurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence\nsystem assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines\nthe wisdom. At a population level, individuals' susceptibilities to\ninterpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve\nthe wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have\nlarger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if\nrelatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the\nwisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the\nwisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence.\nOur investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role\nsocial influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 16:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 14:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Using density-functional theory, we examine vacancy stability and\ndiffusion barriers in body-centered cubic (Mo0.95W0.05)0.85Ta0.10(TiZr)0.05.\nThe results in this MPEA show strong dependence on environment, originating\nfrom local lattice distortion associated with charge-transfer between\nneighboring atoms that vary with different chemical environments. We find a\ncorrelation between degree of lattice distortion and migration barrier: (Ti,\nZr) with less distortion have lower barriers, while (Mo, W) with larger\ndistortion have higher barriers, depending up local environments. Under\nirradiation, our findings suggest that (Ti, Zr) are significantly more likely\nto diffuse than (Mo, W) while Ta shows intermediate effect. As such, material\ndegradation caused by vacancy diffusion can be controlled by tuning composition\nof alloying elements to enhance creep strength at extreme operating\ntemperatures and harsh conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 16:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

However, in a regime where supercurrents and lossy currents\ncoincide, a full understanding of the relationship between these two transport\nphenomena is still missing. Moreover, especially for superconducting circuits,\nthe question of how noninteger quasicharges can be reconciled with charge\nquantization is still not fully resolved, and plays an important role for the\ncircuit dynamics.

Experimental and\nsynthetic material microstructures are often represented by 3D image data. The\ncomputational complexity of simulations operating on such three-dimensional\nhigh-resolution voxel data comprising billions of unknowns induces the need for\nalgorithmically and numerically efficient solvers. The inability of voxelized\n3D geometries to capture smooth material interfaces accurately, along with the\nnecessity for complexity reduction, motivates a special local coarse-graining\ntechnique called composite voxels [Kabel,M. et al.

Composite\nvoxels enhance local field quality at a modest computational cost. Our\ncontribution comprises the generalization towards composite boxels (ComBo) that\nare nonequiaxed, a feature that can pay off for materials with a preferred\ndirection.

However, while\nhumans can say \"I don't know\" when they are uncertain (i.e., abstain from\nanswering a question), such ability has been largely neglected in multimodal\nresearch, despite the importance of this problem to the usage of VQA in real\nsettings. In this work, we promote a problem formulation for reliable VQA,\nwhere we prefer abstention over providing an incorrect answer. We first enable\nabstention capabilities for several VQA models, and analyze both their\ncoverage, the portion of questions answered, and risk, the error on that\nportion. For that, we explore several abstention approaches. We find that\nalthough the best performing models achieve over 70% accuracy on the VQA v2\ndataset, introducing the option to abstain by directly using a model's softmax\nscores limits them to answering less than 7.5% of the questions to achieve a\nlow risk of error (i.e., 1%). This motivates us to utilize a multimodal\nselection function to directly estimate the correctness of the predicted\nanswers, which we show can increase the coverage by, for example, 2.3x from\n6.8% to 15.6% at 1% risk. While it is important to analyze both coverage and\nrisk, these metrics have a trade-off which makes comparing VQA models\nchallenging. To address this, we also propose an Effective Reliability metric\nfor VQA that places a larger cost on incorrect answers compared to abstentions.\nThis new problem formulation, metric, and analysis for VQA provide the\ngroundwork for building effective and reliable VQA models that have the\nself-awareness to abstain if and only if they don't know the answer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 16:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 22:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 17:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-21"}

In particular, we\nconsider both the Maxwell-$CP(2)$ and the Chern-Simons-$CP(2)$ enlarged\nscenarios, separately. We choose a $CP(2)$-field configuration with a null\ntopological charge not only in the simplest (free) case, but also when coupled\nto an Abelian gauge field. The implementation of the\nBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism shows that the effective models\nfor such a configuration possess a self-dual structure which looks like those\ninherent to the gauged sigma models. Therefore, when the $CP(2)$ field is\ncoupled to the Maxwell term, the corresponding total energy possesses both a\nwell-defined Bogomol'nyi bound and a quantized magnetic flux. Further, when the\n$CP(2)$ scenario is gauged with the Chern-Simons action, the total electric\ncharge is verified to be proportional to the quantized magnetic flux. In\naddition, the analysis verifies that the magnetic impurity contributes to the\nBPS potentials and appears in both the models' BPS equations. Next, we\nintroduce a Gaussian type impurity and solve the self-dual equations via a\nfinite-difference scheme. The resulting solutions present a nonmonotonic\nbehavior that flips both the magnetic and electric fields. Finally, we discuss\nthe topologically trivial solutions in the limit for which the impurity becomes\na Dirac $\\delta $-function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 16:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 15:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-27"}

Recent approaches focus on utilizing color images as guidance\nimages to recover depth at invalid pixels. However, color images alone are not\nenough to provide the necessary semantic understanding of the scene.\nConsequently, the depth completion task suffers from sudden illumination\nchanges in RGB images (e.g., shadows). In this paper, we propose a novel\nthree-branch backbone comprising color-guided, semantic-guided, and\ndepth-guided branches. Specifically, the color-guided branch takes a sparse\ndepth map and RGB image as an input and generates color depth which includes\ncolor cues (e.g., object boundaries) of the scene. The predicted dense depth\nmap of color-guided branch along-with semantic image and sparse depth map is\npassed as input to semantic-guided branch for estimating semantic depth. The\ndepth-guided branch takes sparse, color, and semantic depths to generate the\ndense depth map. The color depth, semantic depth, and guided depth are\nadaptively fused to produce the output of our proposed three-branch backbone.\nIn addition, we also propose to apply semantic-aware multi-modal\nattention-based fusion block (SAMMAFB) to fuse features between all three\nbranches.

Existing\napproaches mainly assume that the roof and footprint of a building are well\noverlapped, which may not hold in off-nadir aerial images as there is often a\nbig offset between them. In this paper, we propose an offset vector learning\nscheme, which turns the building footprint extraction problem in off-nadir\nimages into an instance-level joint prediction problem of the building roof and\nits corresponding \"roof to footprint\" offset vector. Thus the footprint can be\nestimated by translating the predicted roof mask according to the predicted\noffset vector. We further propose a simple but effective feature-level offset\naugmentation module, which can significantly refine the offset vector\nprediction by introducing little extra cost. Moreover, a new dataset, Buildings\nin Off-Nadir Aerial Images (BONAI), is created and released in this paper.

Multi-modal image registration is\nessential for the accurate alignment of these multi-modal images. However, it\nremains a very challenging task due to complicated and unknown spatial\ncorrespondence between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntranslation-based unsupervised deformable image registration approach to\nconvert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically,\nour approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to\nfacilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive\nloss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes.\nFurthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in\nprevious multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to\nintegrate the output of translation into the target modality.

This newfound\noccupation matrix is then used as an initialization to explore the broken\nsymmetry phases. We find the oxygen cage distortion of the 3k antiferromagnetic\nstate to be in excellent agreement with experiments, and both the spin-orbit\ncoupling and the Hubbard $U$ are critical ingredients. We demonstrate that only\nselect phonon modes have a strong dependence on the Hubbard $U$, whereas\nmagnetic ordering has only a small influence overall.

We prove\nthat, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state\nspace by composing the operations, then every operation can be learned. When\none cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately\nknown and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient\nalgorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter\ncharacterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel\non Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer\nexperiments than previously known protocols.

The problems are\ngoverned by partial differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwell's\nequations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due to the\nill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues, recent\nstudies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings from\nmeasurements to the property directly. In this paper, we show that such a\nmapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not wide) network with only\nfive layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of an intriguing\nproperty: a near-linear relationship between the input and output, after\napplying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when\ndealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by\na wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are\nlinearly correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels.\nFurthermore, this property can be easily turned into a light-weight\nencoder-decoder network for inversion. The encoder contains the integration of\nseismic data and the linear transformation without need for fine-tuning. The\ndecoder only consists of a single transformer block to reverse the integral of\nvelocity. Experiments show that this interesting property holds for two\ngeophysics inversion problems over four different datasets.

Two of the biggest are the origin of\nthe baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the existence and nature of dark\nmatter. In the present thesis, the author addresses these topics in various\nways. The first part of the thesis is concerned with cosmological first-order\nphase transitions that may have occurred shortly after the Big Bang. Such\ntransitions proceed via the nucleation and expansion of true vacuum bubbles and\ngive rise to a rich phenomenology. The author suggests a mechanism to\nsimultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry and dark matter, based on the\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics at the boundary of a dark phase transition with\nlarge order parameter. The same class of phase transitions can, in the\nparameter regime of small dark matter Yukawa couplings, lead to the production\nof primordial black holes via the compression of the plasma in shrinking false\nvacuum regions, as the author demonstrates with a sophisticated numerical\nsimulation. In a third project regarding cosmological phase transitions, the\nauthor investigates the possibility of sub-MeV hidden sectors that are\ndecoupled from the remaining plasma and cold enough to be reconciled with\ncosmological constraints, but at the same time give rise to a detectable\ngravitational-wave spectrum produced during bubble collisions.

Several recent works aim at addressing these issues, e.g., methods\nthat implement online variable selection or conduct the search on a\nlower-dimensional sub-manifold of the original search space. Advancing our\nprevious work of PCA-BO that learns a linear sub-manifold, this paper proposes\na novel kernel PCA-assisted BO (KPCA-BO) algorithm, which embeds a non-linear\nsub-manifold in the search space and performs BO on this sub-manifold.\nIntuitively, constructing the GPR model on a lower-dimensional sub-manifold\nhelps improve the modeling accuracy without requiring much more data from the\nobjective function. Also, our approach defines the acquisition function on the\nlower-dimensional sub-manifold, making the acquisition optimization more\nmanageable.\n  We compare the performance of KPCA-BO to a vanilla BO and to PCA-BO on the\nmulti-modal problems of the COCO/BBOB benchmark suite.

PL optimization with the REINFORCE\nalgorithm can be used for optimizing black-box objective functions over\npermutations. In particular, it can be used for optimizing fairness measures.\nHowever, though effective for queries with a moderate number of repeating\nsessions, PL optimization has room for improvement for queries with a small\nnumber of repeating sessions.\n  In this paper, we present a novel way of representing permutation\ndistributions, based on the notion of permutation graphs. Similar to PL, our\ndistribution representation, called PPG, can be used for black-box optimization\nof fairness. Different from PL, where pointwise logits are used as the\ndistribution parameters, in PPG pairwise inversion probabilities together with\na reference permutation construct the distribution. As such, the reference\npermutation can be set to the best sampled permutation regarding the objective\nfunction, making PPG suitable for both deterministic and stochastic rankings.\nOur experiments show that PPG, while comparable to PL for larger session\nrepetitions (i.e., stochastic ranking), improves over PL for optimizing\nfairness metrics for queries with one session (i.e., deterministic ranking).\nAdditionally, when accurate utility estimations are available, e.g., in tabular\nmodels, the performance of PPG in fairness optimization is significantly\nboosted compared to lower quality utility estimations from a learning to rank\nmodel, leading to a large performance gap with PL. Finally, the pairwise\nprobabilities make it possible to impose pairwise constraints such as \"item\n$d_1$ should always be ranked higher than item $d_2$.\" Such constraints can be\nused to simultaneously optimize the fairness metric and control another\nobjective such as ranking performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 20:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

First, canonical self attention has a quadratic complexity\nw.r.t. the input time series length, thus falling short in efficiency. Second,\ndifferent variables' time series often have distinct temporal dynamics, which\nexisting studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space,\ne.g., projection matrices, for all variables' time series, thus falling short\nin accuracy.

When a group of competing advertisers is managed by\na common agency, many forms of collusion, such as bid rigging, can be\nimplemented by coordinating bidding strategies, dramatically increasing\nadvertisers' value. We study the problem of finding bids and monetary transfers\nmaximizing the utility of a group of colluders, under GSP and VCG mechanisms.\nFirst, we introduce an abstract bid optimization problem -- called weighted\nutility problem (WUP) -- , which is useful in proving our results. We show that\nthe utilities of bidding strategies are related to the length of paths in a\ndirected acyclic weighted graph, whose structure and weights depend on the\nmechanism under study. This allows us to solve WUP in polynomial time by\nfinding a shortest path of the graph. Next, we switch to our original problem,\nfocusing on two settings that differ for the incentives they allow for.\nIncentive constraints ensure that colluders do not leave the agency, and they\ncan be enforced by implementing monetary transfers between the agency and the\nadvertisers. In particular, we study the arbitrary transfers setting, where any\nkind of monetary transfer to and from the advertisers is allowed, and the more\nrealistic limited liability setting, in which no advertiser can be paid by the\nagency. In the former, we cast the problem as a WUP instance and solve it by\nour graph-based algorithm, while, in the latter, we formulate it as a linear\nprogram with exponentially-many variables efficiently solvable by applying the\nellipsoid algorithm to its dual. This requires to solve a suitable separation\nproblem in polynomial time, which can be done by reducing it to a WUP instance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 20:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Using both analytical\narguments and \\textit{Planck}-like mock observations, we show that doing so\ncauses the MMF noise to be overestimated, inducing a loss of signal-to-noise.\nFurthermore, the MMF cluster observable (the amplitude $\\hat{y}_0$ or the\nsignal-to-noise $q$) does not behave as expected, which can potentially bias\ncosmological inference. In particular, the observable becomes biased with\nrespect to its theoretical prediction and displays a variance that also differs\nfrom its predicted value. We propose an iterative MMF (iMMF) approach designed\nto mitigate these effects. In this approach, after a first standard MMF step,\nthe noise power spectra are reestimated by masking the detections from the\ndata, delivering an updated iterative cluster catalogue. Applying our iMMF to\nour \\textit{Planck}-like mock observations, we find that the aforementioned\neffects are completely suppressed. This leads to a signal-to-noise gain\nrelative to the standard MMF, with more significant detections and a higher\nnumber of them, and to a cluster observable with the expected theoretical\nproperties, thus eliminating any potential biases in the cosmological\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 21:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Depending on the aggregation\nmethod used, the local updates are either the gradients or the weights of local\nlearning models. Recent reconstruction attacks apply a gradient inversion\noptimization on the gradient update of a single minibatch to reconstruct the\nprivate data used by clients during training. As the state-of-the-art\nreconstruction attacks solely focus on single update, realistic adversarial\nscenarios are overlooked, such as observation across multiple updates and\nupdates trained from multiple mini-batches. A few studies consider a more\nchallenging adversarial scenario where only model updates based on multiple\nmini-batches are observable, and resort to computationally expensive simulation\nto untangle the underlying samples for each local step. In this paper, we\npropose AGIC, a novel Approximate Gradient Inversion Attack that efficiently\nand effectively reconstructs images from both model or gradient updates, and\nacross multiple epochs. In a nutshell, AGIC (i) approximates gradient updates\nof used training samples from model updates to avoid costly simulation\nprocedures, (ii) leverages gradient/model updates collected from multiple\nepochs, and (iii) assigns increasing weights to layers with respect to the\nneural network structure for reconstruction quality. We extensively evaluate\nAGIC on three datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Our results show that\nAGIC increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 50% compared to\ntwo representative state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks.

The method works by\nconnecting several well-known equivalences. The group of all single-qubit gates\nis $U(2)$, the unitary transformations of $C^2$. Using an appropriate phase\nmultiplier, every element of $U(2)$ can be mapped to a corresponding element of\n$SU(2)$ with unit determinant, whose quantum mechanical behavior is identical.\nThe group $SU(2)$ is isomorphic to the group of unit quaternions. Powers and\nroots of unit quaternions can be constructed by extending de Moivre's theorem\nfor roots of complex numbers to the quaternions by selecting a preferred square\nroot of -1. Using this chain of equivalences, for any single-qubit gate $A$ and\nreal exponent $k$, a gate $B$ can be predictably constructed so that $B^k = A$.\nDifferent fractions generated in this way can be combined by connecting the\nindividually rotated qubits to a common 'sum' qubit using 2-qubit CNOT gates.\nExamples of such algebras are explored including those generated by roots of\nthe quaternion $k$ (which corresponds to and $X$-rotation of the Bloch sphere),\nthe quaternion $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(i + k)$ (which corresponds to the Hadamard\ngate), and a mixture of these.

Our analysis indicates that the more evolved sources, namely the class\nII and III young stars, are located further away from clouds than class I and\nflat-spectrum sources that have ample circumstellar matter and are closely\nassociated with natal clouds. Particularly the class II and III population is\nfound to exhibit a structured spatial distribution indicative of passage of\nshock fronts from the nearby Sco-Cen OB association thereby compressing clouds\nto trigger star formation, with the latest starbirth episode occurring now in\nthe densest cloud filaments. The young stars at all evolutionary stages share\nsimilar kinematics. This suggests that the stellar patterns trace the relics of\nparental cloud filaments that now have been dispersed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 22:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

While their precise production mechanisms are\nstill unknown, the two main theories are via interchange reconnection events\nand in-situ generation. In this work density and abundance variations of alpha\nparticles are studied inside and outside individual switchbacks. We find no\nconsistent compositional differences in the alpha particle abundance ratio,\n$n_{\\alpha p}$, inside vs outside, nor do we observe any signature when\nseparating the switchbacks according to $V_{\\alpha p}/V_{pw}$, the ratio of\nalpha-proton differential speed to the wave phase speed (speed the switchback\nis travelling). We argue these measurements cannot be used to rule in favour of\none production mechanism over the other, due to the distance between PSP and\nthe postulated interchange reconnection events. In addition we examine the 3D\nvelocity fluctuations of protons and alpha particles within individual\nswitchbacks. While switchbacks are always associated with increases in proton\nvelocity, alpha velocities may be enhanced, unchanged, or decrease. This is due\nto the interplay between $V_{pw}$ and $V_{\\alpha p}$, with the Alfv\\'enic\nmotion of the alpha particles vanishing as the difference $|V_{pw} - V_{\\alpha\np}|$ decreases. We show how the Alfv\\'enic motion of both the alphas and the\nprotons through switchbacks can be understood as approximately rigid arm\nrotation about the location of the wave frame, and illustrate that the wave\nframe can therefore be estimated using particle measurements alone, via sphere\nfitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 22:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Strikingly,\nresearch also suggests that these gender gaps are visible even under blinded\nreview, wherein the evaluator is not aware of the gender of the author. In this\narticle, we consider whether gender differences in writing styles -- how men\nand women communicate their work -- may contribute to these observed gender\ngaps. We ground our investigation in a previously established framework for\ncharacterizing the linguistic style of written text, which distinguishes\nbetween two sets of features -- informational (i.e., features that emphasize\nfacts) and involved (i.e., features that emphasize relationships). Using a\nlarge, matched sample of academic papers and patents, we find significant\ndifferences in writing style by gender; women use more involved features in\ntheir writing, a pattern that holds universally across fields. The magnitude of\nthe effect varies across fields, with larger gender differences observed in the\nsocial sciences and arts humanities and smaller gaps in the physical sciences\nand technology. Subsequently, we show that gender differences in writing style\nmay have parallels in reading preferences; papers and patents with more\ninformational features tend to be cited more by men, while those with more\ninvolved features tend to be cited more by women, even after controlling for\nthe gender of the author, inventor, and patent attorney.

In\nthis work, neural network-enhanced reproducing kernel particle method (NN-RKPM)\nis proposed, where the location, orientation, and shape of the solution\ntransition near a localization is automatically captured by the NN\napproximation via a block-level neural network optimization. The weights and\nbiases in the blocked parametrization network control the location and\norientation of the localization. The designed basic four-kernel NN block is\ncapable of capturing a triple junction or a quadruple junction topological\npattern, while more complicated localization topological patters are captured\nby the superposition of multiple four-kernel NN blocks. The standard RK\napproximation is then utilized to approximate the smooth part of the solution,\nwhich permits a much coarser discretization than the high-resolution\ndiscretization needed to capture sharp solution transitions with the\nconventional methods.

Filter bubbles will grow along the feedback loop and\ninadvertently narrow user interests. Existing work usually mitigates filter\nbubbles by incorporating objectives apart from accuracy such as diversity and\nfairness. However, they typically sacrifice accuracy, hurting model fidelity\nand user experience. Worse still, users have to passively accept the\nrecommendation strategy and influence the system in an inefficient manner with\nhigh latency, e.g., keeping providing feedback (e.g., like and dislike) until\nthe system recognizes the user intention.\n  This work proposes a new recommender prototype called UserControllable\nRecommender System (UCRS), which enables users to actively control the\nmitigation of filter bubbles. Functionally, 1) UCRS can alert users if they are\ndeeply stuck in filter bubbles. 2) UCRS supports four kinds of control commands\nfor users to mitigate the bubbles at different granularities. 3) UCRS can\nrespond to the controls and adjust the recommendations on the fly. The key to\nadjusting lies in blocking the effect of out-of-date user representations on\nrecommendations, which contains historical information inconsistent with the\ncontrol commands. As such, we develop a causality-enhanced User-Controllable\nInference (UCI) framework, which can quickly revise the recommendations based\non user controls in the inference stage and utilize counterfactual inference to\nmitigate the effect of out-of-date user representations. Experiments on three\ndatasets validate that the UCI framework can effectively recommend more desired\nitems based on user controls, showing promising performance w.r.t. both\naccuracy and diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 01:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

The\ngoal of this work is to develop and apply a memory efficient method called\nblock-wise learning that combines gradient checkpointing with patch-wise\ntraining to allow for fast and high-quality 3D non-Cartesian reconstructions\nusing MBDL. Approach: Block-wise learning applied to a single unroll decomposes\nthe input volume into smaller patches, gradient checkpoints each patch, passes\neach patch iteratively through a neural network regularizer, and then rebuilds\nthe full volume from these output patches for data-consistency. This method is\napplied across unrolls during training. Block-wise learning significantly\nreduces memory requirements by tying GPU memory to user selected patch size\ninstead of the full volume.

Earlier spectroscopic and\nimaging observations revealed blue-shifted plasma and propagating disturbances\n(PDs) in plumes that are widely interpreted in terms of flows and/or\npropagating slow-mode waves, but these interpretations (flows vs waves) remain\nunder debate. Recently we discovered an important clue about plume internal\nstructure: dynamic filamentary features called plumelets, which account for\nmost of the plume emission. Here we present high-resolution observations from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) and the\nInterface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) that revealed numerous,\nquasiperiodic, tiny jets (so-called jetlets) associated with transient\nbrightening, flows, and plasma heating at the chromospheric footpoints of the\nplumelets. By analogy to larger coronal jets, these jetlets are most likely\nproduced within the plume base by magnetic reconnection between closed and open\nflux at stressed 3D null points. The jetlet-associated brightenings are in\nphase with plumelet-associated PDs, and vary with a period of about 3 to 5\nminutes, which is remarkably consistent with the photospheric/chromospheric\np-mode oscillation. This reconnection at the open-closed boundary in the\nchromosphere/transition region is likely modulated or driven by local\nmanifestations of the global p-mode waves. The jetlets extend upward to become\nplumelets, contribute mass to the solar wind, and may be sources of the\nswitchbacks recently detected by the Parker Solar Probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 04:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 01:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Four configurations are\ninvestigated; namely, (i) permeable bed with randomly packed sediment grains,\n(ii) an impermeable-wall with full layer of roughness elements matching the top\nlayer of the sediment bed, (iii) an impermeable-wall with half layer of\nroughness elements , and (iv) a smooth wall. A double-averaging methodology is\nused to compute the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, form-induced stresses,\nand turbulent kinetic energy budget. It is observed that the mean velocity,\nReynolds stresses, and form-induced pressure-velocity correlations representing\nupwelling and downwelling fluxes are similar in magnitude for the permeable-bed\nand impermeable-full layer wall cases. However, for the impermeable-half layer\ncase, the wall blocking effect results in higher streamwise and lower\nwall-normal stresses compared to the permeable-bed case. Bed roughness\nincreases Reynolds shear stress whereas permeability has minimal influence. Bed\npermeability, in contrast to Reynolds stresses, significantly influences\nform-induced shear stress.

Existing methodologies that use sparse depth\nfrom visual SLAM mainly employ point features. However, point features have\nlimitations in preserving structural regularities owing to texture-less\nenvironments and sparsity problems. To deal with these issues, we perform depth\ncompletion with visual SLAM using line features, which can better contain\nstructural regularities than point features. The proposed methodology creates a\nconvex hull region by performing constrained Delaunay triangulation with depth\ninterpolation using line features. However, the generated depth includes\nlow-frequency information and is discontinuous at the convex hull boundary.\nTherefore, we propose a mesh depth refinement (MDR) module to address this\nproblem.

Second, the system must also be able to react to\nchanges in the acoustic environment with near real-time latency. In this work,\nwe harness the combined prowess of cloud computing and the Internet of Things\n(IoT) to allow in-situ listening and playback using microcontrollers while\ndelegating computationally expensive inference tasks to the cloud. In\nparticular, a serverless cloud architecture was used for inference, ensuring\nnear real-time latency and scalability without the need to provision computing\nresources. A working prototype of the system is currently being deployed in a\npublic area experiencing high traffic noise, as well as undergoing public\nevaluation for future improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 05:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

Many global\nmanipulations are designed for traditional CNN-based architectures to overcome\nthe locality of convolutions. Attention mechanisms or transformers originally\ndesigned for capturing long-range dependencies might be a better choice, but\nusually complicates architectures and could lead to a decrease in inference\nspeed. In this work, we propose a pure transformer architecture called SideRT\nthat can attain excellent predictions in real-time. In order to capture better\nglobal context, Cross-Scale Attention (CSA) and Multi-Scale Refinement (MSR)\nmodules are designed to work collaboratively to fuse features of different\nscales efficiently. CSA modules focus on fusing features of high semantic\nsimilarities, while MSR modules aim to fuse features at corresponding\npositions. These two modules contain a few learnable parameters without\nconvolutions, based on which a lightweight yet effective model is built. This\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art performances in real-time (51.3 FPS) and\nbecomes much faster with a reasonable performance drop on a smaller backbone\nSwin-T (83.1 FPS). Furthermore, its performance surpasses the previous\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin, improving AbsRel metric 6.9% on KITTI and\n9.7% on NYU.

A major\nlimitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally\nrequires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned\ndiffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast\nsampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high\nsample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure\nin DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the\nmethod of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned\ndiffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS).\nIt is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the\nlearned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed\nmethod can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as\nfew as 10 steps. In our experiments, it takes about 3 minutes on one A6000 GPU\nto generate $50k$ images from CIFAR10.

The\nfracture toughness $K_{{\\rm I}c}$, which represents the resistance to fracture,\ncan be estimated using the three-dimensional (3D) information of a fracture\nsurface, i.e., its roughness. However, this is time-consuming and expensive to\nobtain the 3D information of a fracture surface; thus, it is desirable to\nestimate $K_{{\\rm I}c}$ from a two-dimensional (2D) image, which can be easily\nobtained. In recent years, methods of estimating a 3D structure from its 2D\nimage using deep learning have been rapidly developed. In this study, we\npropose a framework for fractography that directly estimates $K_{{\\rm I}c}$\nfrom a 2D fracture surface image using deep neural networks (DNNs). Typically,\nimage recognition using a DNN requires a tremendous amount of image data, which\nis difficult to acquire for fractography owing to the high experimental cost.\nTo compensate for the limited data, in this study, we used the transfer\nlearning (TL) method, and constructed high-performance prediction models even\nwith a small dataset by transferring machine learning models trained using\nother large datasets.

This is mainly\nbecause the gravity can speed up the formation of some important molecules\n(e.g., H$_2$, CO, OH) by increasing the number density during collapse. The\ndifferent morphologies of prolate, oblate, and spherical clouds lead to\ndifferences in chemical evolution, which are mainly due to their different\nevolution of number density.

As a result of this interaction, the SW spectrum becomes\nnonreciprocal to depend on the sign of the SW wave vector q.

The\nsaturated surface becomes inert to dissociative reactions and enables the\ndiffusion of molecular oxygen to the \\interface interface as assumed within the\nDeal-Grove model. Further oxidation of the Si substrate is then provided by\nO$_2$ dissociations at the interface due to the same charge transfer process\nresponsible for the chemisorption at the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 09:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 14:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The weak lines of the $\\nu_1$, $\\nu_1+\\nu_3-\\nu_1$\nand $\\nu_2+\\nu_3-\\nu_2$ bands in the 2.774--2.910 $\\mu$m range were used to\ncalculate by how much the strong $\\nu_3$ band centred at 2.67 $\\mu$m is\nattenuated due to optical depth effects, expressed by the attenuation factor\n$f_{\\rm atten}$. Most OPR determinations are strongly affected by opacity\neffects, as demonstrated by the observed anti-correlation between the OPR and\nthe column density, and the correlation between the OPR and attenuation factor\n$f_{\\rm atten}$. Based on both radiative transfer calculations and OPR values\nobtained in low-opacity conditions, we derive an OPR of 2.94 $\\pm$ 0.06 for\ncomet 67P. The water OPR measured in the coma of 67P is consistent with\nlaboratory experiments showing that water vapour that has thermally desorbed\nfrom water ice has a statistical value of 3, regardless of the past formation\nprocess of water ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 09:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

However,\nexisting methods always only use the real image as the positive sample to guide\nthe training, and at most introduce the corresponding composite image as a\nsingle negative sample for an auxiliary constraint, which leads to limited\ndistortion knowledge, and further causes a too large solution space, making the\ngenerated harmonized image distorted. Besides, none of them jointly constrain\nfrom the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,\nwhich exacerbates this problem. Moreover, recent region-aware adaptive instance\nnormalization achieves great success but only considers the global background\nfeature distribution, making the aligned foreground feature distribution\nbiased. To address these issues, we propose a self-consistent style contrastive\nlearning scheme (SCS-Co). By dynamically generating multiple negative samples,\nour SCS-Co can learn more distortion knowledge and well regularize the\ngenerated harmonized image in the style representation space from two aspects\nof the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,\nleading to a more photorealistic visual result.

These uncommon\nfeatures are related to the influence of 56Ni decay on the light curve during\nthe plateau phase, when the SN emission is usually dominated by cooling of the\nenvelope. The inferred 56Ni mass of SN 2019va is 0.088+/-0.018 solar mass,\nwhich is significantly larger than most SNe II. To estimate the influence of\n56Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we calculate the ratio (dubbed as\neta_Ni) between the integrated time-weighted energy from 56Ni decay and that\nfrom envelope cooling within the plateau phase, obtaining a value of 0.8 for SN\n2019va, which is the second largest value among SNe II that have been measured.\nAfter removing the influence of 56Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we\nfound that the progenitor/explosion parameters derived for SN 2019va are more\nreasonable.

There are several examples in medical\nliterature where the assumption of a known constant relative treatment effect\n(e.g. an odds-ratio) is used to estimate CATE models from large observational\ndatasets. One approach to estimating these CATE models is by using the relative\ntreatment effect as an offset, while estimating the covariate-specific baseline\nrisk. Whether this is a valid approach in the presence of unobserved\nconfounding is unknown. We demonstrate for a simple example that offset models\ndo not recover the true CATE in the presence of unobserved confounding. We then\nexplore the magnitude of this bias in numerical experiments. For virtually all\nplausible confounding magnitudes, estimating the CATE using offset models is\nmore accurate than assuming a single absolute treatment effect whenever there\nis sufficient variation in the baseline risk. Next, we observe that the\nodds-ratios reported in randomized controlled trials are not the odds-ratios\nthat are needed in offset models because trials often report the marginal\nodds-ratio.

Here we show how to\nentangle the mechanical vibration modes of two massive ferrimagnets that are\nplaced in the same microwave cavity. Each ferrimagnet supports a magnon mode\nand a low-frequency vibration mode coupled by the magnetostrictive force. The\ntwo magnon modes are, respectively, coupled to the microwave cavity by the\nmagnetic dipole interaction. We first generate a stationary nonlocal entangled\nstate between the vibration mode of the ferrimagnet-1 and the magnon mode of\nthe ferrimagnet-2. This is realized by continuously driving the ferrimagnet-1\nwith a strong red-detuned microwave field and the entanglement is achieved by\nexploiting the magnomechanical parametric down-conversion and the cavity-magnon\nstate-swap interaction.

The main limitations of Bayesian filters are the\nsignificant computational costs and the implementation problems for higher\ndimensional systems.

To tackle these\nthree challenges, we propose an FL algorithm inspired by evolutionary\ntechniques.

Communication cost is\nreduced since fewer clients are used in the final training of the FL model. To\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct a number of\nexperiments using FEMNIST dataset and compare the result against the random FL\nalgorithm.

Unlike\nbiometric recognition, such as face recognition, iris recognition, and person\nre-identification, ASR suffers from a much larger semantic gap but receives\nless attention. In this paper, we propose a challenging ASR benchmark. Firstly,\nwe collect a large-scale ASR dataset (LSASRD), which contains 20,937 images of\n190 anime works and each work at least has ten different roles. In addition to\nthe large-scale, LSASRD contains a list of challenging factors, such as complex\nilluminations, various poses, theatrical colors and exaggerated compositions.\nSecondly, we design a cross-role protocol to evaluate ASR performance, in which\nquery and gallery images must come from different roles to validate an ASR\nmodel is to learn abstract painting style rather than learn discriminative\nfeatures of roles. Finally, we apply two powerful person re-identification\nmethods, namely, AGW and TransReID, to construct the baseline performance on\nLSASRD. Surprisingly, the recent transformer model (i.e., TransReID) only\nacquires a 42.24% mAP on LSASRD.

Previous UGC video\nquality assessment (VQA) studies either use the image recognition model or the\nimage quality assessment (IQA) models to extract frame-level features of UGC\nvideos for quality regression, which are regarded as the sub-optimal solutions\nbecause of the domain shifts between these tasks and the UGC VQA task. In this\npaper, we propose a very simple but effective UGC VQA model, which tries to\naddress this problem by training an end-to-end spatial feature extraction\nnetwork to directly learn the quality-aware spatial feature representation from\nraw pixels of the video frames. We also extract the motion features to measure\nthe temporal-related distortions that the spatial features cannot model. The\nproposed model utilizes very sparse frames to extract spatial features and\ndense frames (i.e. the video chunk) with a very low spatial resolution to\nextract motion features, which thereby has low computational complexity.

This result not only helps to\nunderstand the physics of the somewhat mysterious delta shocks, but also\nprovides a way to reduce the fluid-solid interaction problem, which consists of\nseveral initial-boundary value problems coupled with moving boundaries, to a\nsimpler Cauchy problem.

In this\nstudy, we aim to develop a new BL-type dynamo model, in which the dynamo\noperates mainly within the bulk of the convection zone. Our 2D model includes\nthe effect of solar-like differential rotation, one-cell meridional flow,\nnear-surface radial pumping, strong turbulent diffusion, BL-type poloidal\nsource, and nonlinear back-reaction of the magnetic field on its source with a\nvertical outer boundary condition. The model leads to a simple dipolar\nconfiguration of the poloidal field that has the dominant latitudinal\ncomponent, which is wound up by the latitudinal shear within the bulk of the\nconvection zone to generate the toroidal flux. As a result, the tachocline\nplays a negligible role in the model. The model reproduces the basic properties\nof the solar cycle, including (a) approximately 11 yr cycle period and 18 yr\nextended cycle period; (b) equatorward propagation of the antisymmetric\ntoroidal field starting from high latitudes; and (c) polar field evolution that\nis consistent with observations.

However, the\nmagnitude of this interaction is poorly constrained, and the intermittent\nnature of the interaction is a challenge for observers. AU Mic is an early M\ndwarf, and the most actively flaring planet host detected to date. Its\ninnermost companion, AU Mic b, is a promising target for magnetic SPI\nobservations. We used optical light curves of AU Mic obtained by the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite to search for signs of flaring SPI with AU Mic b\nusing a customized Anderson-Darling test. In the about $50$ days of\nobservations, the flare distributions with orbital, rotational, and synodic\nperiods were generally consistent with intrinsic stellar flaring. We found the\nstrongest deviation ($p=0.07,\\;n=71$) from intrinsic flaring with the orbital\nperiod of AU Mic b, in the high energy half of our sample ($ED>1$ s). If it\nreflects the true SPI signal from AU Mic b, extending the observing time by a\nfactor of $2-3$ will yield a $>3\\sigma$ detection. Continued monitoring of AU\nMic may therefore reveal flaring SPI with orbital phase, while rotational\nmodulation will smear out due to the star's strong differential rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 13:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-25"}

In this paper, to alleviate this\nmisalignment, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, called SiamLA. Within this\nparadigm, a series of simple, yet effective localization-aware components are\nintroduced, to generate localization-aware target confidence scores.\nSpecifically, with the proposed localization-aware dynamic label (LADL) loss\nand localization-aware label smoothing (LALS) strategy, collaborative\noptimization between the classification and regression is achieved, enabling\nclassification scores to be aware of location state, not just appearance\nsimilarity. Besides, we propose a separate localization branch, centered on a\nlocalization-aware feature aggregation (LAFA) module, to produce location\nquality scores to further modify the classification scores. Consequently, the\nresulting target confidence scores, are more discriminative for the location\nstate, allowing accurate prediction boxes tend to be predicted as high scores.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on six challenging benchmarks, including\nGOT-10k, TrackingNet, LaSOT, TNL2K, OTB100 and VOT2018.

Hence, there exists a natural tradeoff\nbetween the AoI and the update cost at the service provider who needs to make\nupdate decisions. To capture this tradeoff, we formulate an optimization\nproblem with the objective of minimizing the total cost, which is the sum of\nthe staleness cost (which is a function of the AoI) and the update cost.

The\nConflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a framework that provides a\nprincipled approach to maintaining eventual consistency among data replicas.\nCRDTs have been notoriously difficult to design and implement correctly. Subtle\ndeep bugs lie in the complex and tedious handling of all possible cases of\nconflicting data updates. We argue that the CRDT design should be formally\nspecified and model-checked to uncover deep bugs. The implementation further\nneeds to be systematically tested. On the one hand, the testing needs to\ninherit the exhaustive nature of the model checking and ensures the coverage of\ntesting. On the other hand, the testing is expected to find coding errors which\ncannot be detected by design level verification.\n  Towards the challenges above, we propose the Model Checking-driven\nExplorative Testing (MET) framework. At the design level, MET uses TLA+ to\nspecify and model check CRDT designs. At the implementation level, MET conducts\nmodel checking-driven explorative testing, in the sense that the test cases are\nautomatically generated from the model checking traces. The system execution is\ncontrolled to proceed deterministically, following the model checking trace.\nThe explorative testing systematically controls and permutes all\nnondeterministic message reorderings.\n  We apply MET in our practical development of CRDTs. The bugs in both designs\nand implementations of CRDTs are found. As for bugs which can be found by\ntraditional testing techniques, MET greatly reduces the cost of fixing the\nbugs. Moreover, MET can find subtle deep bugs which cannot be found by existing\ntechniques at a reasonable cost. We further discuss how MET provides us with\nsufficient confidence in the correctness of our CRDT designs and\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 14:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

To determine to what extent the problem of forward fitting visibilities\nmeasured by the Spectrometer/Telescope Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar\nOrbiter is more challenging with respect to the same problem in the case of\nprevious hard X-ray solar imaging missions; to identify an effective\noptimization scheme for parametric imaging for STIX.

We found\nout that the parametric imaging approach based on PSO is as reliable as the one\nbased on the simplex method in the case of RHESSI visibilities. However, PSO is\nsignificantly more robust when applied to STIX simulated and experimental\nvisibilities. Conclusions. Standard deterministic optimization is not effective\nenough for forward-fitting the few visibilities sampled by STIX in the angular\nfrequency plane. Therefore a more sofisticated optimization scheme must be\nintroduced for parametric imaging in the case of the Solar Orbiter X-ray\ntelescope.

This study shows that\nrange-only measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only\nmeasurements for this specific situation. Different bias handling strategies\nare also investigated. It has been found that even a less accurate ranging\nmethod, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination\nsolution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected\nCubeSat mission. The most observable states are found to be position states of\nthe lunar orbiter via the observability analysis. In addition, the best\ntracking windows are also investigated for the selected mission scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 15:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-01"}

We here try to resolve this issue by performing 'theoretical\nexperiments' of time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES)\nfor a strong-field laser-pumped solid, which should give access to the actual\nobservable bands of the irradiated material. To our surprise, we find that the\nadiabatic band-picture survives quite well, up to high field intensities\n(~10^12 W/cm^2), and in a wide frequency range (driving wavelengths of 4000 to\n800nm, with Keldysh parameters ranging up to ~7).

In this\narticle, a theoretical framework is presented that extends existing theories by\nplacing the surrounding solution environment on an equal footing with the\ncrystal itself; this is advantageous, e.g., when considering processes such as\ncrystal growth from solution. By considering the polar crystal as a stack of\nparallel plate capacitors immersed in a solution environment, the equilibrium\nadsorbed surface charge density is derived by minimizing the free energy of the\nsystem. In analogy to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar\ncrystal surface at zero temperature, for a crystal in solution it is shown that\nthe \"polar catastrophe\" manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb\nthe system from equilibrium. Going further than existing theories, the present\nformulation predicts that fluctuations in the adsorbed surface charge density\nbecome increasingly suppressed with increasing crystal thickness. We also show\nhow, in the slab geometry often employed in both theoretical and computational\nstudies of interfaces, an electric displacement field emerges as an\nelectrostatic boundary condition, the origins of which are rooted in the slab\ngeometry itself, rather than the use of periodic boundary conditions.

Being able to measure loudness perception correctly in the\nclinic is essential for fitting hearing aids. For this, experiments in the\nclinic should be able to reflect and capture loudness perception as in\neveryday-life situations. Little research has been done comparing loudness\nperception in the field and in the laboratory. Design: Participants rated the\nloudness in the field and in the laboratory of 36 driving actions done by four\ndifferent vehicles. The field measurements were done in a restricted street and\nrecorded with a 360deg camera and a tetrahedral microphone. The recorded\nstimuli, which are openly accessible, were presented in three different\nconditions in the laboratory: 360deg video recordings with a head-mounted\ndisplay, video recordings with a desktop monitor, and audio-only. Sample:\nThirteen normal-hearing participants and 18 hearing-impaired participants\nparticipated in the study. Results: The driving actions were rated\nsignificantly louder in the laboratory than in the field for the audio-only\ncondition. These loudness rating differences were bigger for louder sounds in\ntwo laboratory conditions, i.e., the higher the sound level of a driving action\nwas the more likely it was to be rated louder in the laboratory. There were no\nsignificant differences in the loudness ratings between the three laboratory\nconditions and between groups. Conclusions: The results of this experiment\nfurther remark the importance of increasing the realism and immersion when\nmeasuring loudness in the clinic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 22:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}
