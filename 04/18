Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) variant aims at improving power\nconsumption on battery-constrained devices. BLE-enabled devices broadcast\ninformation (e.g., as beacons) to nearby devices via advertisements.\nUnfortunately, such functionality can become a double-edged sword at the hands\nof attackers. In this paper, we primarily show how an attacker can exploit BLE\nadvertisements to exfiltrate information from BLE-enable devices. In\nparticular, our attack establishes a communication medium between two devices\nwithout requiring any prior authentication or pairing. We develop a\nproof-of-concept attack framework on the Android ecosystem and assess its\nperformance via a thorough set of experiments. Our results indicate that such\nan exfiltration attack is indeed possible though with a limited data rate.\nNevertheless, we also demonstrate potential use cases and enhancements to our\nattack that can further its severeness.

On the one hand, directly\nlearning from the massive, unstructured and unordered 3D point cloud is\ncomputationally and algorithmically more difficult than learning from\ncompactly-organized and context-rich 2D RGB images. On the other hand, both\nLiDAR point cloud and RGB images are captured in standard automated-driving\ndatasets. This motivates us to conduct a \"task transfer\" paradigm so that 3D\nsemantic segmentation benefits from aggregating 2D semantic cues, albeit pose\nnoises are contained in 2D image observations. Among all difficulties, pose\nnoise and erroneous prediction from 2D semantic segmentation approaches are the\nmain challenges for the task transfer. To alleviate the influence of those\nfactor, we perceive each 3D point using multi-view images and for each single\nimage a patch observation is associated. Moreover, the semantic labels of a\nblock of neighboring 3D points are predicted simultaneously, enabling us to\nexploit the point structure prior to further improve the performance. A\nhierarchical full attention network~(HiFANet) is designed to sequentially\naggregates patch, bag-of-frames and inter-point semantic cues, with\nhierarchical attention mechanism tailored for different level of semantic cues.\nAlso, each preceding attention block largely reduces the feature size before\nfeeding to the next attention block, making our framework slim.

However, the relationship between\nstructure and function -- their coupling -- is relatively unexplored,\nparticularly in the context of an intervention. Epilepsy surgery alters the\nbrain structure and networks to control the functional abnormality of seizures.\nGiven that surgery is a structural modification aiming to alter the function,\nwe hypothesized that stronger structure-function coupling preoperatively is\nassociated with a greater chance of post-operative seizure control. We\nconstructed structural and functional brain networks in 39 subjects with\nmedication-resistant focal epilepsy using data from intracranial EEG\n(pre-surgery), structural MRI (pre-and post-surgery), and diffusion MRI\n(pre-surgery). We investigated pre-operative structure-function coupling at two\nspatial scales a) at the global iEEG network level and b) at the resolution of\nindividual iEEG electrode contacts using virtual surgeries. At global network\nlevel, seizure-free individuals had stronger structure-function coupling\npre-operatively than those that were not seizure-free regardless of the choice\nof interictal segment or frequency band. At the resolution of individual iEEG\ncontacts, the virtual surgery approach provided complementary information to\nlocalize epileptogenic tissues. In predicting seizure outcomes,\nstructure-function coupling measures were more important than clinical\nattributes, and together they predicted seizure outcomes with an accuracy of\n85% and sensitivity of 87%. The underlying assumption that the structural\nchanges induced by surgery translate to the functional level to control\nseizures is valid when the structure-functional coupling is strong. Mapping the\nregions that contribute to structure-functional coupling using virtual\nsurgeries may help aid surgical planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 20:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Previously, the\nonly known algorithm for this problem was due to Hu et al. [HWC17].

Heterogeneous data further deteriorates the situation by causing\nslow convergence. Although the impact of data heterogeneity on supervised FL\nhas been widely studied, the related investigation for Federated Reinforcement\nLearning (FRL) is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first define the type\nand level of data heterogeneity for policy gradient based FRL systems. By\ninspecting the connection between the global and local objective functions, we\nprove that local training can benefit the global objective, if the local update\nis properly penalized by the total variation (TV) distance between the local\nand global policies. A necessary condition for the global policy to be\nlearn-able from the local policy is also derived, which is directly related to\nthe heterogeneity level. Based on the theoretical result, a Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence based penalty is proposed, which, different from the\nconventional method that penalizes the model divergence in the parameter space,\ndirectly constrains the model outputs in the distribution space. Convergence\nproof of the proposed algorithm is also provided. By jointly penalizing the\ndivergence of the local policy from the global policy with a global penalty and\nconstraining each iteration of the local training with a local penalty, the\nproposed method achieves a better trade-off between training speed (step size)\nand convergence.

The question is\nraised: do such cuts pollute the inherent semantic segments, like incorrect\npunctuation in sentences?

Moreover, we explore the effect of\nanharmonicity-induced frequency shift on the prediction of the thermal\nconductivity. It is found that the thermal conductivity calculated by the\nrecently developed anharmonic theory (quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo approximation,\nQHGK) is higher than that by the harmonic theory developed by Allen and\nFeldman. The use of anharmonic vibrational frequencies also leads to a higher\nthermal conductivity compared with that calculated using harmonic vibrational\nfrequencies. The anharmonicity induced frequency shifts is a mechanism for the\npositive temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 at higher\ntemperatures. Further investigation on mode diffusivity suggests that although\nanharmonicity has larger influence on locons than diffusons, the increase of\nthe thermal conductivity due to the anharmonicity is mainly contributed by the\nanharmonicity induced increase of the diffusivity of diffusons. Finally, it is\nfound that the cross-correlations between diffusons and diffusons contribute\nmost to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2, and the locons contribute to the\nthermal conductivity mainly through collaboration with diffusons.

The computer vision community has\nextensively explored the area of Super-Resolution.

One such area is statistical downscaling, where\nsuper-resolution is increasingly being used to obtain high-resolution climate\ninformation from low-resolution data.

To reduce the cost of generating\nhigh-resolution climate information, Super-Resolution algorithms should be able\nto train with a limited number of low-resolution, high-resolution pairs. This\npaper tries to solve the aforementioned problem by introducing a\nsemi-supervised way to perform super-resolution that can generate sharp,\nhigh-resolution images with as few as 500 paired examples.

Gradual domain adaptation (GDA), on the other\nhand, assumes a path of $(T-1)$ unlabeled intermediate domains bridging the\nsource and target, and aims to provide better generalization in the target\ndomain by leveraging the intermediate ones. Under certain assumptions, Kumar et\nal. (2020) proposed a simple algorithm, Gradual Self-Training, along with a\ngeneralization bound in the order of $e^{O(T)}\n\\left(\\varepsilon_0+O\\left(\\sqrt{log(T)/n}\\right)\\right)$ for the target domain\nerror, where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the source domain error and $n$ is the data\nsize of each domain.

Compared with\nthe existing bound with an exponential dependency on $T$ as a multiplicative\nfactor, our bound only depends on $T$ linearly and additively. Perhaps more\ninterestingly, our result implies the existence of an optimal choice of $T$\nthat minimizes the generalization error, and it also naturally suggests an\noptimal way to construct the path of intermediate domains so as to minimize the\naccumulative path length $T\\Delta$ between the source and target.

The fastest spin qubits to date are\ndefined in long quantum dots with two tight confinement directions, when the\ndriving field is aligned to the smooth direction. However, in these systems the\nlifetime of the qubit is strongly limited by charge noise, a major issue in\nhole qubits. We propose here a different, scalable qubit design, compatible\nwith planar CMOS technology, where the hole is confined in a curved germanium\nquantum well surrounded by silicon. This design takes full advantage of the\nstrong spin-orbit interaction of holes, and at the same time suppresses charge\nnoise in a wide range of configurations, enabling highly coherent, ultrafast\nqubit gates. While here we focus on a Si/Ge/Si curved quantum well, our design\nis also applicable to different semiconductors. Strikingly, these devices allow\nfor ultrafast operations even in short quantum dots by a transversal electric\nfield. This additional driving mechanism relaxes the demanding design\nconstraints, and opens up a new way to reliably interface spin qubits in a\nsingle quantum dot to microwave photons. By considering state-of-the-art\nhigh-impedance resonators and realistic qubit designs, we estimate interaction\nstrengths of a few hundreds of MHz, largely exceeding the decay rate of spins\nand photons. Reaching such a strong coupling regime in hole spin qubits will be\na significant step towards high-fidelity entangling operations between distant\nqubits, as well as fast single-shot readout, and will pave the way towards the\nimplementation of a large-scale semiconducting quantum processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 08:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Our methodology exploits analytic properties of the moment\ngenerating function of the order parameter in systems of finite size, and it\ncan be implemented in combination with tensor-network calculations.\nSpecifically, the onset of a symmetry-broken phase is signaled by the zeros of\nthe moment generating function approaching the origin in the complex plane of a\ncounting field that couples to the order parameter. Moreover, the zeros can be\nobtained by measuring or calculating the high cumulants of the order parameter.\nWe determine the phase diagram of the two-dimensional quantum Ising model and\nthereby demonstrate the potential of our method to predict the critical\nbehavior of two-dimensional quantum systems at finite temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 08:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2022 10:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-03"}

Though\nefficient, such a structure loses interaction between the query-passage pair,\nresulting in inferior accuracy. To enhance the performance of dense retrieval\nmodels without loss of efficiency, we propose a GNN-encoder model in which\nquery (passage) information is fused into passage (query) representations via\ngraph neural networks that are constructed by queries and their top retrieved\npassages. By this means, we maintain a dual-encoder structure, and retain some\ninteraction information between query-passage pairs in their representations,\nwhich enables us to achieve both efficiency and efficacy in passage retrieval.\nEvaluation results indicate that our method significantly outperforms the\nexisting models on MSMARCO, Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets, and\nachieves the new state-of-the-art on these datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 10:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 08:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

Second, they often learn the similarity structure by either global\nstructure learning or local structure learning, lacking the capability of graph\nlearning with both global and local structural awareness. In light of this,\nthis paper presents a joint multi-view unsupervised feature selection and graph\nlearning (JMVFG) approach. Particularly, we formulate the multi-view feature\nselection with orthogonal decomposition, where each target matrix is decomposed\ninto a view-specific basis matrix and a view-consistent cluster indicator.\nCross-space locality preservation is incorporated to bridge the cluster\nstructure learning in the projected space and the similarity learning (i.e.,\ngraph learning) in the original space. Further, a unified objective function is\npresented to enable the simultaneous learning of the cluster structure, the\nglobal and local similarity structures, and the multi-view consistency and\ninconsistency, upon which an alternating optimization algorithm is developed\nwith theoretically proved convergence.

The discovery in the interstellar medium (ISM) of ethanolamine, the\nsimplest phospholipid head group, raises the question whether simple\namphiphilic molecules are also synthesized in space. We investigate whether\nprecursors of fatty alcohols are present in the ISM.

Secondly, the residual from the k-factor\nGARMA model has been used as a proxy for the conditional variance; these\nresiduals were predicted using two different approaches. In the first approach,\na local linear wavelet neural network model (LLWNN) has developed to predict\nthe conditional variance using two different learning algorithms, so we\nestimate the hybrid k- factor GARMA-LLWNN based backpropagation (BP) algorithm\nand based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the second approach,\nthe Gegenbauer generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity\nprocess (G-GARCH) has been adopted, and the parameters of the k-factor GARMAG-\nGARCH model have been estimated using the wavelet methodology based on the\ndiscrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) approach.

However, there is a lack of theoretical guarantees for their\nconvergence and acceleration since the optimization landscape of the neural\nnetwork is non-convex. Nowadays, some works make progress towards understanding\nthe convergence of momentum methods in an over-parameterized regime, where the\nnumber of the parameters exceeds that of the training instances. Nonetheless,\ncurrent results mainly focus on the two-layer neural network, which are far\nfrom explaining the remarkable success of the momentum methods in training deep\nneural networks. Motivated by this, we investigate the convergence of NAG with\nconstant learning rate and momentum parameter in training two architectures of\ndeep linear networks: deep fully-connected linear neural networks and deep\nlinear ResNets. Based on the over-parameterization regime, we first analyze the\nresidual dynamics induced by the training trajectory of NAG for a deep\nfully-connected linear neural network under the random Gaussian initialization.\nOur results show that NAG can converge to the global minimum at a $(1 -\n\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}))^t$ rate, where $t$ is the iteration number and\n$\\kappa > 1$ is a constant depending on the condition number of the feature\nmatrix.

For example, in heavy rain, face images captured by CCTV\nfrom a distance have significant deterioration in both visibility and\nresolution. Unlike traditional image degradation models (IDM), such as rain\nremoval and superresolution, this study addresses a new IDM referred to as a\nscale-aware heavy rain model and proposes a method for restoring\nhigh-resolution face images (HR-FIs) from low-resolution heavy rain face images\n(LRHR-FI). To this end, a 2-stage network is presented. The first stage\ngenerates low-resolution face images (LR-FIs), from which heavy rain has been\nremoved from the LRHR-FIs to improve visibility. To realize this, an\ninterpretable IDM-based network is constructed to predict physical parameters,\nsuch as rain streaks, transmission maps, and atmospheric light. In addition,\nthe image reconstruction loss is evaluated to enhance the estimates of the\nphysical parameters. For the second stage, which aims to reconstruct the HR-FIs\nfrom the LR-FIs outputted in the first stage, facial component guided\nadversarial learning (FCGAL) is applied to boost facial structure expressions.\nTo focus on informative facial features and reinforce the authenticity of\nfacial components, such as the eyes and nose, a face-parsing-guided generator\nand facial local discriminators are designed for FCGAL. The experimental\nresults verify that the proposed approach based on physical-based network\ndesign and FCGAL can remove heavy rain and increase the resolution and\nvisibility simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed heavy-rain face image\nrestoration outperforms state-of-the-art models of heavy rain removal,\nimage-to-image translation, and superresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 13:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

The primary theory\nunderlying AR is human visual confusion, which allows users to perceive the\nreal-world scenes and augmented contents (virtual-world scenes) simultaneously\nby superimposing them together. To achieve good Quality of Experience (QoE), it\nis important to understand the interaction between two scenarios, and\nharmoniously display AR contents. However, studies on how this superimposition\nwill influence the human visual attention are lacking. Therefore, in this\npaper, we mainly analyze the interaction effect between background (BG) scenes\nand AR contents, and study the saliency prediction problem in AR. Specifically,\nwe first construct a Saliency in AR Dataset (SARD), which contains 450 BG\nimages, 450 AR images, as well as 1350 superimposed images generated by\nsuperimposing BG and AR images in pair with three mixing levels. A large-scale\neye-tracking experiment among 60 subjects is conducted to collect eye movement\ndata. To better predict the saliency in AR, we propose a vector quantized\nsaliency prediction method and generalize it for AR saliency prediction. For\ncomparison, three benchmark methods are proposed and evaluated together with\nour proposed method on our SARD.

The\nclassification and diagnosis of breast cancer and its histopathological images\nhave always been a hot spot of clinical concern. In Computer-Aided Diagnosis\n(CAD), traditional classification models mostly use a single network to extract\nfeatures, which has significant limitations.

In a recent work, Lu\nand Oliveira [LO21] established an unconditional time-bounded version of this\nresult, by showing that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability\n$\\delta$ then rKt$(x) = O(\\log(1/\\delta)) + O(\\log n)$, where rKt denotes the\nrandomized analogue of Levin's Kt complexity. Unfortunately, this result is\noften insufficient when transferring applications of the classical coding\ntheorem to the time-bounded setting, as it achieves a $O(\\log(1/\\delta))$ bound\ninstead of the information-theoretic optimal $\\log(1/\\delta)$.\n  We show a coding theorem for rKt with a factor of $2$.

Although many augmentation and pre-training strategies have been\nproposed to alleviate these issues, there lacks a systematic survey to\nsummarize the properties, challenges, and solutions of DE-GANs. In this paper,\nwe revisit and define DE-GANs from the perspective of distribution\noptimization. We conclude and analyze the challenges of DE-GANs. Meanwhile, we\npropose a taxonomy, which classifies the existing methods into three\ncategories: Data Selection, GANs Optimization, and Knowledge Sharing. Last but\nnot the least, we attempt to highlight the current problems and the future\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 14:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 14:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

An increasing\nlevel of competition might prompt companies to frequently restructure their\nmarketing and product pricing strategies. Therefore, identifying the change\npatterns in product prices and sales volumes would provide a competitive\nadvantage for the companies in the marketplace. In this paper, we investigate\nalternative clustering methodologies to group the products based on the price\npatterns and sales volumes. We propose a novel distance metric that takes into\naccount how product prices and sales move together rather than calculating the\ndistance using numerical values. We compare our approach with traditional\nclustering algorithms, which typically rely on generic distance metrics such as\nEuclidean distance, and image clustering approaches that aim to group data by\ncapturing its visual patterns. We evaluate the performances of different\nclustering algorithms using our custom evaluation metric as well as Calinski\nHarabasz and Davies Bouldin indices, which are commonly used internal validity\nmetrics.

A linear regression model provides a good estimate (R2 =\n0.85) of the number of occasional boardings at a stop as a function of the\ntotal number of boardings, time of day, and land use composition around the\nlocation of trip origin. We conclude that the conventional PT may lose\nsubstantial urban ridership to the future flexible modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 15:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 05:25:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2022 08:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-12"}

The derived bounds reveal that a temporal\ncovariance of the data plays a key role; its strength affects the bias of the\nrisk, and its nondegeneracy affects the variance of the risk. Moreover, for the\nheterogeneous correlation case, we show that the convergence rate of risks with\nshort-memory processes is identical to that of cases with independent data, and\nthe risk can converge to zero even with long-memory processes.

Specifically, numerous domain\nadaptation (DA) algorithms have been exploited in the past five years to\nenhance the generalization of emotion recognition models across subjects. The\nDA methods assume that calibration data (although unlabeled) exists in the\ntarget domain (new user). However, this assumption conflicts with the\napplication scenario that the model should be deployed without the\ntime-consuming calibration experiments. We argue that domain generalization\n(DG) is more reasonable than DA in these applications. DG learns how to\ngeneralize to unseen target domains by leveraging knowledge from multiple\nsource domains, which provides a new possibility to train general models.

The methods based on supervised learning need a large amount of\nhigh-quality training data and their performance highly depends on the quality\nof the labels. However, in practical remote sensing applications, it is often\nexpensive and time-consuming to obtain large-scale data sets with high-quality\nlabels, which leads to a lack of sufficient supervised information.

However, deep hashing models are\nvulnerable to adversarial examples, making it essential to develop adversarial\ndefense methods for image retrieval. Existing solutions achieved limited\ndefense performance because of using weak adversarial samples for training and\nlacking discriminative optimization objectives to learn robust features. In\nthis paper, we present a min-max based Center-guided Adversarial Training,\nnamely CgAT, to improve the robustness of deep hashing networks through worst\nadversarial examples. Specifically, we first formulate the center code as a\nsemantically-discriminative representative of the input image content, which\npreserves the semantic similarity with positive samples and dissimilarity with\nnegative examples. We prove that a mathematical formula can calculate the\ncenter code immediately. After obtaining the center codes in each optimization\niteration of the deep hashing network, they are adopted to guide the\nadversarial training process. On the one hand, CgAT generates the worst\nadversarial examples as augmented data by maximizing the Hamming distance\nbetween the hash codes of the adversarial examples and the center codes. On the\nother hand, CgAT learns to mitigate the effects of adversarial samples by\nminimizing the Hamming distance to the center codes. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial\ntraining algorithm in defending against adversarial attacks for deep\nhashing-based retrieval.

The effects on\nthe dislocation density of annealing the metal under vacuum, of annealing in\nthe beta hydride phase, and of the phase transformation itself were\ninvestigated by measuring diffraction peak breadths during annealing and\nhydrogen cycling. During annealing under vacuum the dislocations were removed\nat a lower temperature than was previously reported, but annealing in the beta\nphase gave nearly the same result.
